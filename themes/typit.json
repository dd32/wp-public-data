        "description": "Typit is Gutenberg ready and we also made sure that it works with the Classic Editor should you decide to stay with it. Typit was created for bloggers who love to write and you definitely won't find a lack of customizable theme options. One of the major features of Typit is that the top header area has so many variations available, you can make your blog look completely different from others. Add a title and intro for your blog, have your post titles displayed on top of the featured image banners (or none at all), add a page excerpt to your headers, and much more. To help you get started, download Typit and follow our detailed setup tutorials to see how flexible this theme really is. Be sure to check out the About Typit under the Appearance admin menu for more theme information, support, and tutorials."
