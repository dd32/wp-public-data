        "description": "The Online Marketer WordPress theme is definitely more business oriented. The design brief for this one was simple, smart, and professional. Like all our themes it comes with a full width template included for static content pages. It supports custom menus and widgets so it remains very flexible and could easily be used for a static content site, a blog, or a site incorporating both which is pretty much all sites these days. You can of course swap out the main header image for anything you like to suit your own niche."
