Lucas likes to travel, music and photography and he's always on the move, so his theme was designed to put content in front and by taking the mobile-first approach, meaning that it is fully responsive. Gaukingo is accessibility and translation ready, works perfectly with Gutenberg and features the full range of post formats, two menu locations, two widget areas in the sidebar and three in the footer."
