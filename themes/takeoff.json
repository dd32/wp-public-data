The Blog page displays your most recent post with a big featured image and thumbnails appear beside older posts. Single posts have a section at the bottom to show Next and Previous posts to make visitors stay longer on your site. Several options found under Theme Options can customize how your posts page looks. Takeoff also has two Google Fonts, Lato and Roboto. Takeoff is for you if you are looking for a simple, professional and a beautiful theme."
