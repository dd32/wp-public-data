Learn more about the difference in the Theme Handbook (developer.wordpress.org/themes). Block Builder is very minimal, giving you a completely blank canvas to build your own templates on as needed. You can add dynamic content to your theme with Theme Blocks (wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks-list/#theme-blocks)."
