Extremely customizable: you can separately set different layouts to homepage, archives, single pages, bbPress and BuddyPress. The theme includes responsive customisable slider (no plugins needed!) and five color themes (including completely custom colors). Content can be displayed in up to four-column layout. The theme also includes bbPress and BuddyPress styles. It is built with highest coding standards in mind and is regularly updated. Support is available on the creator's website. This was a premium theme before but now all features are available for free."
