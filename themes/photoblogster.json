We have made clean code so the load time is fast, quick page speed is a big part of our SEO friendly theme. Whether you like food, fashion, photography, travel or need a business portfolio then our minimal article theme is a good choice. If you are a corporate business or agency, you can use it to design your creative &amp; elegant landing page. Bloggers can use ads like adsense and affiliate marketing for your blog page about books, actors or other entertainment as well as write a journal / biography about your personal life with our typography optimised, reading friendly, flat and light design. We don&#8217;t yet fully support websites having a one page / single page with post builder plugins, but we will add that soon together with making special white and dark layouts for school, education, coach and conference sites. PhotoBlogster has many features such as widgets, header image and responsive design so it works on mobile phones too. But it is mainly designed for photography portfolios and photography blogs."
