        "description": "Theme has three layouts you can use to make three types of page layouts. Single posts pages and regular blog page content are displayed with content on the right and a sidebar and a navigation bar each to the left. Individual Pages that you create are displayed with content in the middle and sidebar/menu on each side of content. There is a third layout that you can have by using the template named \"Portfolio Page\" to show custom posts on the far right, tiled vertically kind of like a gallery. These custom posts have their own editor and the plugin for it is installable from within the theme. Options to add social media links with icons; change link colors, background and header image. Theme uses a responsive framework but is not fully optimized for all screens. As of v. 1.3 there is option to change footer text. Demo at https://leadspilot.com/leslie/"
