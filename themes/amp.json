        "description": "TSW theme, Amp, is a novelty theme replicating a classic electric guitar amplifier. Theme options include, Upload logo which sits in top of each article; Upload footer background image; Upload background image; Select colors for site links, background of content, text color and whole site background color. Also a header image can be uploaded. Top menu is volume, tone controls and is very basic but no worries as this theme has a mobile-type navigation for menu two and a menu in the footer for menu three. So you will be able to make the top menu work without losing overall site navigation. Sidebar for widgets is in footer. Demo at: https://leadspilot.com/amp/"
