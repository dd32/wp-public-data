Now offer a child theme called Transference to create design and visual enhancements for a more refined feel. We've maintained the exceptional core features and functions of Twenty Sixteen, while making several font adjustments. We also made adjustments to sidebar and main content areas, added a new banner sidebar position, added a new colour style option, customized the social icon menu, and several other refinements that will stand out to be a much cleaner style."
