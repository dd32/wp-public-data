        "description": "Wedding Planner is a fully responsive WordPress theme integrated with WooCommerce. This theme is great for wedding blogs or shops, event planning, ceremony planning, dinner planning, photography, and DJ websites. This is a powerful theme for creating any type of wedding and marriage website. WordPress Wedding Planner theme has many benefits such as a customizable and unique homepage, beautiful and customizable WooCommerce pages, different top bar, header and footer layouts, various footer themes, multiple animation types for different elements, built-in button styles, custom search overlay, unique blog styles and much more. Most of these features are available in the free version, but there are some additional premium features as well. For example, animation types, custom search overlay, some WooCommerce options including search bar, premium fonts, additional custom homepage sections, and others are only available in the premium version. The theme's customizable homepage is the main advantage of the Wedding Planner theme. To activate the custom homepage you need to navigate to the \"Homepage Settings\" page from the customizer and select the option \"Your latest posts\" for the \"Your homepage displays\" setting. After that, you need to enable the custom homepage by going to the \"Custom Homepage\" page from the customizer and enabling the option \"Enable custom homepage\". That's all. After this, you will get a beautiful and fully customizable home page with various useful sections. The WordPress Wedding Planner theme allows you to separately manage the layouts and other settings of a single post, single page, and blog/search pages. This means that you can set different designs for these pages. By the way, you can manage the design of WooCommerce pages separately from these regular pages. In short, all the settings and elements of the theme are customizable, and you can create your site the way you need."
