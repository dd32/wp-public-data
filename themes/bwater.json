        "description": "As water, this theme is 100% fluid-width. Bwater will look great in virtually any screen resolution or font size. Bwater is designed and developed following a fluid grid system and a fluid baseline rhythm. Furthermore, it is responsive for small resolutions. It uses pure HTML5 and CSS3, microformats included. It is as well translation ready and ready to work with a right-to-left language. You can configure it to use with a single column or with an additional right sidebar where you can put any widget. It's also possible to have a custom menu. Bwater works fine in any modern browser."
