Also, added some important patterns like blog archive page and contact page patterns so that you can use those as per your need for any page. The main target of this theme is to create a simple site. It's a dark-mode theme. All the content is focused on the dark mode style. You will get an interesting Blog archive pattern. In the first section you will get the option to set your featured blog, so make any blog post a sticky item. That Item will be reflected there. Note: After installing the theme you may not find the menu items so create menu items from the navigation menu block in the templates and template parts."
