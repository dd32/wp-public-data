        "description": "Baker Shop WordPress Theme has been designed to help bakers market and sell their bakery products online as well as offline. Our team has delved deep into the niche before designing the theme to ensure all the elements that the potential customer and the bakery owner expect are present in the design. We’ve interacted with many bakers, bakery shop owners as well as consumers of bakery products over and over to understand what is it they think that attracts a buyer to a bakery store and what triggers him/her to place an order. Likewise we’ve spoken to bakery shop owners to get their perception on their customers’ preferences and choices. These insights and mind mappings have helped our designing team to create a layout that would have optimum possibilities to ring the bell in the mind of consumers. Baker Shop WordPress Theme is an ideal platform for a bakery shop owner who is new to the online world and has been resisting the idea of going online because they associated it with getting entwined in the complexities of technology. However, on the contrary Baker Shop WordPress Theme is very easy to maintain. The shop owner or manager can easily place images of their products, create descriptions, and share other details very fast without any difficulty. The user-interface has been created keeping bakery shop owners in mind who may not be well versed with coding and technology.
