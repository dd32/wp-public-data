        "description": "Openness is built from the popular WordPress theme called Twenty Fifteen, so you may want to give Openness a try and see just how far it goes. We made several changes and enhancements to give you the flexibility that you need. Openness is really the best choice for personal blogs, especially if you write articles with a lot of images. We even included some attention to detail with shadow styles for images to add depth to your pages. Openness is perfect for your blog with a more refined style, unlimited colours, at least a couple blog layouts that includes a grid concept, RTL support, show or hide various page elements, and of course support is always available for you. Be sure to read more about the Openness theme under the Appearance admin menu."
