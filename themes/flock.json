Flock can help you create a personal blog equipped with easily customisable menus, featured images, sticky posts, footer widgets, a threaded comments section,  and a few other needful functionalities like an always-at-hand search form. The degree of customizability is still limited in this first iteration, nonetheless through the Theme Customize Screen you can already let your personality colour Flock. With or without a logo, Flock will allow you to give to your personal blog, identity, and a clean look."
