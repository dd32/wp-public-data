        "description": "Reviewers Landing page is a responsive multi purpose one page / Landing page WordPress business theme. Simple 1 pages and presentation pages have become very popular since its great for presenting products/apps in a creative and elegant way. Starting a landing page or single page is easy with our modern theme due to the features and flat easy-going design, large header, and clean design. The design is often used as a layout for an agency, marketing bureau, or other corporate businesses. Reviewers Landing page is simple to set up but has a lot of features for affiliate marketing, i.e. lots of advertisement space for affiliate programs such as Google AdSense. Authors &amp; bloggers can easily create a simple and minimalistic blog and customize it to a niche with the header, so you can write about anything from food, travel, fashion, lifestyle, reviews, products, or other entertainment niches... The theme works fine as a photography portfolio, even though this isn't its primary purpose, we have tried to satisfy that area too. The last thing to say is that the theme is of course fully SEO optimized ( search engine optimized ) and responsive so it works on all types of phones, tablets, and desktop computers. Beaver Page Builder is integrated so you can build your own website from scratch, you can hide sidebars, header, and much more so you can make the design exactly how you like it. The code is clean and optimized so you can get a good page speed and loading time."
