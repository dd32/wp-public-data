Upload your own logo, choose one of the bundled background images or upload your own rich imagery to brand your site. The dedicated home page template can also slide a range of brand images in the background, powered by a native WordPress gallery. The advocate theme also comes bundled with an optional plugin to add a custom post type for staff profiles. Combined with the bespoke profile templates this makes it easy to profile the most important part of your business, the people."
