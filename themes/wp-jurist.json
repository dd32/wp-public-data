        "description": "Jurist is a responsive theme designed for law firms, though it would be well suited to any professional services business that wants to profile their expert staff. Bold and simple in our usual style, it comes bundled with the optional People Profiles plugin which adds the 'People' custom post type. If you use this you can also use the included profiles page template to present a beautiful looking staff profiles page. There are home page template options with sliders that can display the latest posts, or a static WordPress gallery if you prefer, and using widgets you can add more custom content to the home page. Check out the demo for examples of all the options."
