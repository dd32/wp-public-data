        "description": "This theme isn't the most sophisicated. It's actually a hacked up and minimized version of Threat To Creativity. However, it's beautiful in it's own way. This theme is not for serious content bloggers or the most orienting. The home page employs a flash piece courtesy of WP Cumulus....but I've broken it apart a bit. Instead of using WP Cumulus for tags in the sidebar, it feeds out the most recent titles on the home page. Whether you set 1 or 100 posts to be on your home page, all the titles will file into this flash cloud interface. Give this theme a spin!"
