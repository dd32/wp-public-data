It's not a convoluted or confusing framework that's hard to learn or even harder to modify. It's a simple and elegant starter theme built on HTML5 &amp; CSS3. Its base is a responsive, 12 column grid. It incorporates custom theme options that are easy to modify, a set of common templates, support for WordPress Post Formats and the gorgeous, retina friendly Font Awesome icon font. Wisnia is WooCommerce compatible, Multilingual Ready (WPML) and translated into Spanish, German and French. Wisnia is also compatible with popular page builders such as Gutenberg, Elementor, Divi Builder, Beaver Builder, the SiteOrigin Page Builder and Visual Composer."
