        "description": "It goes without saying that the goal of a real estate website is to drive more leads. But what's the best way to do this? Is it better to dazzle visitors with digital velvet and mahoghany? Or should you ditch the expensive decor and let your inventory speak for itself? With Columbus, you don't have to choose. Columbus' borderless look will give your website an understated elegance, while its green and blue accents will make your listing details jump off the page. Perfect for both individual agents and single-office agencies, Columbus is ideal for displaying multiple property listings, with a two-column layout and top-level page navigation. It's also fully customizable, so you can make it your own, which means youâ€™ll get even more compliments on your feng shui. In order to enable full real estate capabilities of the theme, use with Placester's Real Estate Builder plugin."
