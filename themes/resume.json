To make a Portfolio you will create a blog post for each entry of your Portfolio. And for the Resume you create another page. Pretty easy and if you want to use the theme for a blog that would be great as well. Customize the theme with options for changing all link colors, the color of the sidebar and the color of the sidebar text as well as remove the top header date, author and category links to keep header aspects clean. Comment form can be hidden as well. Theme has printer friendly styles and option to turn off sidebar when printing. Fluid grids and most media supported. Visit http://themes.tradesouthwest.com/resume to check out the demo."
