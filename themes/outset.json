The Front Page has a beautiful carousel image slider linking to your site's pages and has several call to action sections. The Blog Page template loads your recent blog posts with a thumbnail beside them. Outset also uses the Options Framework plugin which lets you customize your site's look from your Dashboard, never having to do any coding. You can upload images to the carousel, set a favicon, upload a logo, choose a global font style, set heading &amp; paragraph sizes and much more."
