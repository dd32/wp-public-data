        "description": "Pizzaland is a child theme of the Twenty Fifteen default WordPress theme.  This ensures that it's got a solid basis on which it's built.  It's specifically designed for restaurants and cafes: it supports the Food and Drink Menu Plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/), the Restaurant Reservations Plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant-reservations/), the Testimonials Widget plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/testimonials-widget/), and the Team Members Plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/team-members/).  The user interface elements provided by these plugins have been thoughtfully styled and a custom Restaurant Home page purposefully crafted.  However, Pizzaland can be used as an elegant blogging theme without installing any of the recommended plugins."
