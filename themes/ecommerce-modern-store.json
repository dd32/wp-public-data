        "description": "Ecommerce Modern Store is a responsive WordPress theme fully integrated with WooCommerce. The theme has a lot of options that allow you to fully customize the layout and design of your blog and store pages. It comes with various built-in sections that are beautifully designed and can be enabled/disabled from the theme Customize/Settings page. The theme has a breadcrumb feature, which means you can easily enable breadcrumbs for single posts and pages. You can find the breadcrumb settings page under the Single Post/Page section and enable or disable it. The breadcrumb colors will be the same as the post/page banner colors, so if you change the banner link/text colors, it will also be applied to the breadcrumb colors. WordPress Ecommerce Modern Store theme also comes with the WooCommerce breadcrumb feature. This feature is included in the premium version of the theme. The custom homepage has two built-in banner themes (plus four additional banner themes for the premium version), and you can choose the one you want to use in the Custom Homepage section. The free version of the theme also includes Call to Action and Latest Posts sections. The premium version of the WordPress Ecommerce Modern Store theme includes even more sections (WooCommerce Products List, WooCommerce Sales, Achievements, Advantages, and Services). All of these sections have a lot of options, so you can change the default values and add the information you need. The design of these sections is also fully customizable. As we mentioned, the WordPress Ecommerce Modern Store theme is fully integrated with WooCommerce, so many WooCommerce settings can be configured directly from the theme settings page. You can add a search bar for the shop page, show/hide the WooCommerce sidebar, change the entire store design. The theme comes with different footer layouts. Six different layouts are available. In different layouts you can use different numbers of widgets: three, four, or five widgets. The premium version also comes with four additional themes for the footer."
