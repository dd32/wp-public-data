Also, you can create your own color schemes combining background (or even fullscreen background images!) and accent colors. Oh, and did I mention that Aries adapts to your needs? By default content is displayed in a single column, but if you add some widgets to the sidebar.. it morphs into two columns (content + sidebar)! Perfect for personal bloggers. P.S. Built with love @ wplovin.com"
