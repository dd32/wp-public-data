        "description": "TSW EduBlu theme originally a blue scheme theme is now re-versioned as Multi-color ready to match University and College colors. Black, blue, brown, auburn, crimson, green, red and sun. Theme has three menu placements. Top, header and a lists area below the header menu. Activate all three or any number. Just create a separate menu in the admin control panel for each, then select placement for the menu. Three menus are always better than one! Footer has four widget spaces. Content area has one right-sidebar and an article area on the left. Font family is Oxygen. Logo can be added in header. Background can be changed. Option to add footer text when removing credits. Plus a 3 speed slide-show running on pure CSS3, no javascript. Option to remove slide-show on the fly without having to reconfigure page styles. See theme options page for custom school schemas."
