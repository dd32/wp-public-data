Designed with a split view, you can showcase an amazing side column photo; which you can change the width to your liking. If you don't like the colour scheme, Fifty50 comes with 10 preset colour options to choose from. You even get two menu choices, a standard version and then an off-canvas overlay menu. We even have you covered if you prefer the Classic editor, but if you want to take advantage of blocks, you can! Fifty50 is ideal for personal bloggers, travelers, artists, writers, outdoor enthusiasts, personal journals, beauty, foodies, authors, and more!"
