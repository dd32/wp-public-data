I've been both a writer and an editor for over a decade now and have put together all the very best custom sanity controls that I've created over the years for managing a team of writers into one organized place. To greatly enhance the features of this theme, it is highly recommended that you install the companion plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishers/). Also, it would be a good idea to review the readme.txt (https://wp-themes.com/wp-content/themes/publishers/readme.txt). I'll be here if you need me (bhadaway@gmail.com)."
