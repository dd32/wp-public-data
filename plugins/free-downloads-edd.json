        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20version%20of%20easy%20digital%20downloads%20is%20supported%3F'>\nWhat version of Easy Digital Downloads is supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Free Downloads EDD</strong> always works best with the latest version of Easy Digital Downloads. If there is a backwards compatibility issue, please let us know.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20support%3F'>\nHow can I get support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Free Downloads EDD</strong> comes complete with a full guide and explanation of the plugin settings. These are available on the plugin settings page. If you need more help, please feel free to post in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/free-downloads-edd\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20files%20downloaded%3F'>\nHow are files downloaded?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is the plugin uses a safe and secure form on the front-end which requests the file. A second round of security checks is performed, and if everything is ok the file is downloaded using the EDD downloader; as well as using the download method you set for EDD <strong>(Force Downloads or Redirect)</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20the%20dynamically%20created%20zip%20files%20handled%3F'>\nHow are the dynamically created ZIP files handled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The product files must have been uploaded to your WordPress site, for example using the EDD <strong>Add File</strong> option, otherwise the ZIP file will be empty. They will not be included if they are external links.</p>\n<p>Once created with either all of the files for a product or a selection of the files, it is temporarily saved in a folder on your server. Every hour that folder is emptied. If you deactivate this plugin, that folder and its contents will be removed.</p>\n<p>If you use external file links it is recommended that you use the <strong>Links Only</strong> display method, if you have products with multiple files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20full%20links%20to%20files%20visible%20to%20a%20user%3F'>\nAre the full links to files visible to a user?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on your EDD settings.</p>\n<p>If you use the <strong>Force</strong> download method (found in the EDD settings, Misc, File Downloads) for your store downloading, the file paths and URLs will be hidden. If there are multiple files downloaded as a dynamically created ZIP file, regardless of setting, the URLs will be hidden.</p>\n<p>If you use the <strong>Redirect</strong> download method, the full URL may be visible for single files. For example, a PDF. This is the same as it would be without this plugin.</p>\n<p>If in doubt and you&#8217;re worried test it yourself on your own site, or please don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/free-downloads-edd\" rel=\"ugc\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20other%20plugins%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat other plugins are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Free Downloads EDD</strong> should be compatible with most plugins. If you have a problem please get in touch and we will include support if possible.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of plugins offered by WP Enhanced that work beautifully with Free Downloads EDD:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong Passwords EDD</li>\n<li>Frontend Reset Password</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
