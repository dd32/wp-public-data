        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20digital%20accessibility%20compliance%3F'>\nWhat is digital accessibility compliance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the United States and many other countries, there are laws that call for digital content to be accessible to people with disabilities. Making digital content accessible means that people with disabilities are able to access and navigate the content using Assistive Technologies.</p>\n<p>Compliance to the law differs from country to country but, generally speaking, the guidelines set forth in W3C, called the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), are used to measure compliance. As defined in WCAG, website content needs to be perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20audioeye%20solution%20secure%3F'>\nIs the AudioEye solution secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. AudioEye takes each of our clients&#8217; security very seriously and has a duty to protect every site visitor accessing the Usability Toolbar embedded within our clients&#8217; websites. AudioEye conducts quarterly PEN tests, pre-release static code testing, and ongoing security awareness training to provide the highest level of security.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%E2%80%99t%20ai%20do%20it%20all%3F'>\nWhy can’t AI do it all?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As smart as artificial intelligence has become, it simply cannot do everything that is needed to test and fix digital content so that it is accessible. And, in fact, the compliance standards explicitly recognize this and call for manual testing as a requirement.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='a%20toolbar%20is%20all%20i%20need%2C%20right%3F'>\nA toolbar is all I need, right?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wrong. A toolbar generally enhances usability for your visitors. They can change things like color contrast, the size of the cursor, font, font size, and more. Making your digital content accessible to an individual with an assistive technology, like a screen reader, requires back-end work.</p>\n<p>With AudioEye, we automatically find and fix the majority of common accessibility errors while providing reporting on which issues need to be addressed directly. Oh, and we also provide a toolbar!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.audioeye.com/post/toolbars-verlays-and-testing-demystifying-the-tech-behind-online-accessibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read Our Blog: Toolbars, Overlays &amp; Testing: Demystifying The Tech Behind Online Accessibility</a></p>\n</p>\n\n"
