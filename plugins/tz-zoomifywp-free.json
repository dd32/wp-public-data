Future versions will include methods to specifically name the element id and therefore allow you to add as many zooms on a page or post as is feasible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I upload a ZIF</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Zifs are special files created by the Zoomify Converter. As of this writing, the free converter didn&#8217;t have a production version capable of creating the ZIF but a version was in beta testing. ZIF upload capability will be available in future versions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add skins to the zoom</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time. The free version of the Zoomify product contains a very basic user interface. Future versions of the ZoomifyWP plugin will include the specification of basic skins as well as other skins you have created.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I apply styling to the Zoomify div</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The styling of the block is basic and ready for further styling such as width, height, border color, etc.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
