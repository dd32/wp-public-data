        "description": "<p>This plugin retrieves the permalink URL for a page or post based on the ID with the shortcode [permalink].</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the point of this plugin?</h4>\n<p>In creating my own sites with WordPress, I started noticing that I like to link to articles within other articles. Then I&#8217;m always changing my mind about stuff, messing around with page/post slugs, and screwing with my permalinks. It&#8217;s very annoying to then have to go back and change links wherever I placed them.</p>\n<p>This plugin is pretty simple. It just retrieves the URL of a page or post based on WordPress&#8217;s unique, numerical ID for it, which never changes. For me personally, using the [permalink] shortcode every time I link to another page or post within my site makes life easier because I don&#8217;t have to worry about the URL changing. Also, when I move my site from my local dev server to the live web server, I don&#8217;t have to worry about any of these links.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I thought what the heck, why not share? &#8212; I keep pasting this code snippet in all my personal website themes anyway.</p>\n<p>However, keep in mind this plugin will be more useful for people like me who are always working under the HTML tab when editing pages and posts. If you&#8217;re looking for a similar shortcode that constructs the entire HTML link for you, check out <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/09/19/get-permalink-wordpress-plugin\" title=\"Get Permalink Plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this plugin</a> by Justin Tadlock.</p>\n<h4>Usage Examples</h4>\n<p>Since all this plugin does is retrieve the URL to the post or page, you need to format a standard HTML link in whatever way you normally would. Then, instead manually writing in the post or page&#8217;s URL, you retrieve it with the [permalink] shortcode. Inside, you reference the WordPress&#8217;s numeric ID for the post or page.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"[permalink id=\"123\"]\"&gt;Your Text&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"[permalink id=\"123\"]\" title=\"Your Link Title\"&gt;Your Text&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=\"[permalink id=\"123\"]#some_section_of_page\"&gt;Your Text&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Extended Usage Examples</h4>\n<p>In v1.0.1, I added the optional feature to allow you to use a page&#8217;s slug to reference the permalink you&#8217;re trying to retrieve.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"[permalink slug=\"your-page\"]\"&gt;Your Text&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re referencing anything other than a page, you need to specify the post type with the optional &#8220;post_type&#8221; parameter.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"[permalink slug=\"your-post\" post_type=\"post\"]\"&gt;Your Text&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>If you can use the Post ID, it will consume less resources on your server to retrieve the permalinks that way.</strong></p>\n<p>So why use the slug at all? Why not just always use the ID? Well personally, I added this in for myself. When I setup demo websites for my WordPress themes, I&#8217;m always importing many of the same pages that innerlink with eachother. As you know, when importing pages and posts between different websites, ID&#8217;s will generally change. By using this shortcode and referencing page/post slugs, I can keep URL&#8217;s intact when I&#8217;m importing/exporting pages to different websites.</p>\n",
