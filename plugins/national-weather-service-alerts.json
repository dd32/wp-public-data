The alerts are then automatically updated using<br />\nAJAX, based on the severity of the alerts for the specified location. The location can be set by using zipcode,<br />\ncity and state, or state and county. There is also the option to choose the scope of what alerts to include,<br />\nsuch as alerts only for your county, alerts only for your state, or alerts for the entire United States.</p>\n<p>If applicable, a Google Map will be included with polygon overlays to show the affected regions of certain alert<br />\ntypes, such as tornado warnings or flash flood warnings.</p>\n<p><em>Currently the National Weather Service Alerts plugin only works for areas within United States.

Try specifying a county and state instead.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is letting your know that there was an error when attempting to retrieve additional location information<br />\nabout the specified location. Check for spelling errors in the city or county name. On rare occasion the locations<br />\ndatabase table may not include the specified city and is thus unable to retrieve additional information necessary<br />\nfor the plugin to function properly and the only workaround is to instead use the zipcode. If you continue to seeing<br />\nthis error, despite trying the above fixes, please try deactivating and deleting the plugin and re-installing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m seeing the following message: Data Error</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will show this message when it is unable to retrieve the Atom feed from the National Weather Service.<br />\nIt is rare for this to happen and when it does it&#8217;s generally because the Atom feed is temporarily unavailable.<br />\nSimply refreshing the page should fix the problem.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The error retrieving weather alert data. This was caused by the feed mime type changing from rss+xml to atom+xml.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The 1.3.3 updates included some code incompatible with PHP &lt;5.5 and this update fixes that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>1.3.3</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The alerts map now requires a Google Maps JavaScript API key, so a new setting was added to the NWS Alerts settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: The wp_remote_get function is now used to request National Weather Service CAP data. This will use WordPress core HTTP functions and classes and improves server compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The National Weather Service Public Alerts require the use of https, so the feed urls needed to be updated.</li>\n<li>Fixed: A bug that caused the NWS Alerts Bar to display even when there are no alerts. It will now automatically hide if there are no alerts and display when there are active alerts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Feature: Support for WordPress Multisite.</li>\n<li>Added Feature: &#8216;nws_alerts_template_path&#8217; filter, which can be used to specify alternative template paths.</li>\n<li>Added Feature: &#8216;nws-alerts-page-builder-index-fix&#8217; CSS class that is unused, but intended to be added via page builder (Visual Composer, Beaver Builder, etc) to ensure that NWS Alerts display on top of surrounding content.</li>\n<li>Added Feature: New display templates can be created and added by calling NWS_Alerts_Utils::register_display_template.</li>\n<li>Added Feature: Alert entries can now be limited to a specified amount.</li>\n<li>Improvement: The outputting of html has been moved to templates. Default plugin templates can be overridden by copying the template files into child theme and parent theme directories and then modified.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Each Alert entry now includes the Target Area.</li>\n<li>Removed: NWS_Alerts-&gt;get_output_headings object method.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Alert effective and expiration times. They&#8217;re no longer adjusted to the WordPress gmt_offset for the site.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Auto updating alerts via AJAX. This was broken in update 1.2.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Feature: The location title can now be overridden with a custom name.</li>\n<li>Added Feature: The alert entry details now include a link to the official NWS notice. Also, the effective and expiration date and times are included as part of each entries details.</li>\n<li>Added Feature: NWS Alerts XML is now cached, when possible, to speed up page loads.</li>\n<li>Improvement: NWS Alerts XML is now fetched using CURL if server support is available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Bug fix that prevented the alerts from auto-updating using AJAX.</li>\n<li>Improvement: The plugin activation process is simplified and should work on all web hosts.</li>\n<li>Improvement: The process to build database tables used for location look-up has been removed from the activation process and broken up into multiple automated parts to be compatible with all web hosts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: NWS Alerts settings page to add the NWS Alerts Bar.</li>\n<li>Added: Bar display option, which displays in a horizontal layout and only displays when there are active alerts.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Style and layout compatibility with themes. Also added additional classes to nws alerts markup to allow for more specific adjustments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Typos</li>\n<li>Change: Updated readme</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release of the National Weather Service Alerts plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n"
