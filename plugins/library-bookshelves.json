Will future versions support it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Yes! But only if you <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/library-bookshelves/\" rel=\"ugc\">contact me</a> with a link to your catalog! As soon as you do I&#8217;ll get working on an update.

Amazon, for example, only supports 10-digit ISBNs. Not all CDNs will have images for every ISBN. In some cases you may get better results using UPCs for DVD items.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
