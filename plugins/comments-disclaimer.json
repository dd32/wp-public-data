        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20any%20theme%3F'>\nWill it work with any theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it should work with every theme. Tested with multiple block themes and classic themes from the official repository. The styling on the comment disclaimer content is dependant on the theme you end up using.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%5C%27ve%20disabled%20gutenberg%20block%20widget.%20will%20it%20still%20work%3F'>\nI\\&#8217;ve disabled Gutenberg Block Widget. Will it still work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it will. As long as your comment section is active, that is by default or enabled in the individual posts. There is a meta box on the post editor setting where you can individually enable or disable the comment disclaimer section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20still%20show%20the%20disclaimer%20if%20the%20comment%20section%20is%20disabled%3F'>\nDoes it still show the disclaimer if the comment section is disabled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No the plugin checks if the comments section is enabled or not. If it is not enabled then it won\\&#8217;t show on the comment section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20individual%20control%20on%20my%20posts'>\nI need individual control on my posts\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can individually control and decide, on which posts the disclaimer content should appear. Make sure, you have enabled the comment section for all those posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20to%20add%20comments%20disclaimer%20on%20previously%20published%20posts.'>\nI need to add Comments Disclaimer on previously published posts.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible to add Comments Disclaimer to existing published posts. Please follow the steps below<br />\n1. Go to the Comments Disclaimer Plugin page. You can find it inside the comment section in the Dashboard menu.<br />\n2. Click on generate button to add disclaimers to existing published posts, without any hassle.</p>\n<p>Remember this button will work only once. All posts published from thereupon, or after the installation of the plugin will have to be enabled from the editor itself. Although, as a work around you can delete the plugin and install it again, and repeat the above step to add Comments Disclaimer to posts published.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='should%20i%20add%20comments%20disclaimer%20on%20previously%20published%20posts%3F'>\nShould I add comments disclaimer on previously published posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although not necessary, I would suggest to add it to those posts as well. Blogs posts mostly doesn&#8217;t have an expiry date. So as long as your site is active, it will exists. Though the comment section may contains links which may have been added like five years before, but doesn\\&#8217;t exists anymore or some bad actor own it today. So some of your readers might come across these links and follow them assuming as a valid website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20works%20with%20version%20previous%20to%205.8'>\nWill the plugin works with version previous to 5.8\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin should work for sites before 5.8, although I haven&#8217;t tested with any of those. If you plan to use it with older version please test it on a staging site, before using it on a live site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20the%20plugin%20is%20deactivated%3F'>\nWhat happens if the plugin is deactivated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once the plugin is removed, it will remove the comments disclaimers from all the posts. Reactivating will make it appear again.<br />\nRemember if the plugin is removed or deleted entirely, all the plugin data will also be deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20appear%20on%20pages%3F'>\nDoes it appear on pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20more%20feature%20%21'>\nI need more feature !\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The purpose of the plugin is very minimal and the current version supports it out of the box. So adding new features might not happen unless it\\&#8217;s very necessary to the core purpose. But you could raise a enhancement issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/alanjacobmathew/comments-disclaimer/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
