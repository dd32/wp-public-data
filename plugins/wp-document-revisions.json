It even gives you the option to revert back to a previous revision — so don&#8217;t fret if you make a mistake — or receive updates on changes to the document right in your favorite feed reader.</p>\n<p><strong>Access Control</strong> &#8211; Each document is given a persistent URL (e.g., yourcompany.com/documents/2011/08/TPS-Report.doc) which can be private (securely delivered only to members of your organization), password protected (available only to those you select such as clients or contractors), or public (published and hosted for the world to see). If you catch a typo and upload a new version, that URL will continue to point to the latest version, regardless of how many changes you make.</p>\n<p><strong>Enterprise Security</strong> &#8211; Worried about storing propriety or sensitive information? WP Document Revisions was built from the first line of code with government- and enterprise-grade security in mind. Each file is masked behind an anonymous 128-bit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MD5 hash</a> as soon as it touches the server, and requests for files are transparently routed through WordPress&#8217;s time-tested URL rewriting, authentication, and permission systems (which can even <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/active-directory-integration/\" rel=\"ugc\">integrate with existing enterprise active directory</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-ldap-login/\" rel=\"ugc\">LDAP servers</a>). Need more security? WP Document Revisions allows you to store documents in a folder above the <code>htdocs</code> or <code>public_html</code> <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">web root</a>, further ensuring that only those you authorize have access to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Customization</strong> &#8211; WP Document Revisions recognizes that no two teams are identical, and as a result, molds to your firm&#8217;s needs, not the other way around. Need to track additional information associated with a document? Departments, editors, issues, sections, even arbitrary key-value pairs — whatever you can throw at it, it can handle. Development and customization costs are further minimized by its extensive plugin API, and the <a href=\"http://themergency.com/generators/wordpress-custom-taxonomy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Custom Taxonomy Generator</a> makes it easy for even the uninitiated to add custom taxonomies to documents. Need an audit trail to track check-ins and check-outs? User-level permissions based on the document&#8217;s state or another custom taxonomy? Support for third-party encryption? Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Document Revisions Code Cookbook</a> for sample code. Looking for even more advanced control of your workflow? WP Document Revisions will detect the popular workflow plugin <a href=\"http://editflow.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow</a>, if installed, and will automatically pull <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2011/10/24/advanced-workflow-management-tools-for-wp-document-revisions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow’s advanced workflow management tools</a> into WP Document Revisions. Simply put, virtually every aspect of the plugin&#8217;s functionality from workflow states to user-level permissions can be fully customized to your team&#8217;s unique needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Proof</strong> &#8211; Switching costs a concern? WP Document Revisions is built with tomorrow&#8217;s uncertainty in mind. Equally at home in an in-house server room as it is in the cloud, moving individual files or entire document repositories in and out of WP Document Revisions is a breeze (history and all). And since the software is open-source, you can easily add tools to automate the process of moving to or integrating with future third-party systems.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for any file type (docs, spreadsheets, images, PDFs — anything!)</li>\n<li>Securely stores unlimited revisions of your business&#8217;s essential files</li>\n<li>Provides a full file history in the form of a revision log, accessible via RSS</li>\n<li>Helps you track and organize documents as they move through your organization&#8217;s existing workflow</li>\n<li>Each file gets a permanent, authenticated URL that always points to the latest version</li>\n<li>Each revision gets its own unique url (e.g.,TPS-Report-revision-3.doc) accessible only to those you deem</li>\n<li>Files are intuitively checked out and locked to prevent revisions from colliding</li>\n<li>Toggle documents between public, private, and password protected with a single mouse click</li>\n<li>Runs in-house or in the cloud</li>\n<li>Secure: filenames are hashed on upload and files are only accessible through WordPress&#8217;s proven authentication system</li>\n<li>Can move document upload folder to location outside of web root to further ensure government- and enterprise-grade security</li>\n<li>Documents and Revisions shortcodes, Recently Revised Documents widget</li>\n<li>Multisite and Windows (XAMPP) support</li>\n<li>French and Spanish language support (easily translated to your language)</li>\n<li>Integration with <a href=\"https://editflow.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow</a></li>\n<li>Recently Revised Documents Widget, shortcodes, and templating functions for front-end integration</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features Available via the [Code Cookbook](https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Audit Trail</strong> &#8211;

Therefore there is a process to change these images to use another name.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The document post record can also support Featured Images.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If loaded via the Edit document page, it would be considered as a Document file. So the parent post identifier will be removed to eliminate confusion between it being a Featured Image and a Document file being stored.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since version 3.4 of the plugin, it is possible to enter a user-oriented description that can be displayed to users with the shortcodes or blocks provided with the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An audit trail of changes to published versions of the Document file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user can enter a reason for changing the Document including uploading a Document file; changing the Document Description; or Title; or any Taxonomy element.</li>\n<li>This reason will be stored in the Excerpt field.</li>\n<li>The aggregate information may be displayed as a Revision Log.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use will be made of the standard WP Revisions functionality to contain the Audit Trail itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard WP processing creates a Revision if any one of these fields are changed: title, content or excerpt.</li>\n<li>Since all Attachments are linked to the parent Document record, by storing the Attachment Id in the content field, then a Revision record will be created automatically. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This plugin is delivered with just one Taxonomy &#8211; Workflow_State. This shows the status of the Document file in its processing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is not considered very useful for user data classification.</li>\n<li>However, being a generic tool, sites can use of a dedicated Taxonomy plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data Structure</h3>\n<p>The records held in the database will be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Document Record</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>post_content contains the id of the latest Document file attachment record.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a Document file is loaded on editing this Document record, the post_content will be modified to contain the ID of the Attachment record created.</li>\n<li>In plugin versions prior to 3.4, this would simply be the numeric ID.</li>\n<li>Subsequent versions hold this in the form of an HTML comment &#8220;&lt;!&#8211; WPDR nnn &#8211;&gt;&#8221; where nnn is the ID of an attachment post. It can also contain a text Document description.</li>\n<li>When editing the post, this field is decomposed into its two parts of ID and description with program management of the former and user management of the latter, recombined automatically when changes are made.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>post_excerpt will contain any comment entered when the document record is updated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As taxonomy records are held only against this Document record, there is no effective audit trail of changes to Taxonomy. Changes can be noted manually in the excerpt field</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Attachment Record(s)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There can be multiple Attachment records, one for each Document file loaded.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The name and title of the Attachment record is set to a MD5 hash of the original file name and the load time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Document file name is also set as this MD5 hash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>post_parent is set to the Document Record ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a PDF Document file is loaded, then standard WP processing will attempt to make a JPEG image of the first page as a thumbnail (using all sizes). These will be held in the same directory as the Document file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>However if the file name is MD5Hash.pdf, then these images will be called MD5Hash-pdf.jpg.</li>\n<li>If used on a page, this would expose the name of the file to the user.</li>\n<li>To avoid this, there is a process to transform this name to another (essentially random) MD5 and rename these image files.</li>\n<li>Once done, a postmeta record is created with these new file names (and a field denoting this process has been done).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a Featured Image is loaded whilst editing the Document record, this would also have the same post_parent set, so in this case, the post_parent is set to 0 leaving the functional postmeta link to denote the presence of the featured image.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Revision Record(s)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When saving a Document Record, standard WP processing will be invoked to detect a change in title, content or excerpt fields.

The origin lock-holder will receive a notification.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20keep%20track%20of%20each%20individual%27s%20changes%3F'>\nDoes it keep track of each individual&#8217;s changes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and no. It will track who uploaded each version of the file, and will provide an opportunity to describe those changes. For more granular history, the plugin is designed to work with a format&#8217;s unique history features, such as tracked changes in Microsoft Word.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20permissions%20work%3F'>\nHow do permissions work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are default permissions (based off the default post permissions), but they can be overridden either with third-party plugins such as the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/\" rel=\"ugc\">Members plugin</a>, or for developers, via the <code>document_caps</code> filter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20documents%20can%20my%20team%20collaborate%20on%3F'>\nWhat types of documents can my team collaborate on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In short, any. By default, WordPress accepts <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/accepted-filetypes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">most common file types</a>, but this can easily by modified to accept just about any file type. In WordPress multisite, the allowed file types are set on the Network Admin page. In non-multisite installs, you can simply install a 3d party plugin to do the same. The only other limitation may be maximum file size, which can be modified in your php.ini file or directly in wp-config.php</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20documents%20i%20upload%20secure%3F'>\nAre the documents I upload secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Document Revisions was built from the ground up with security in mind. Each request for a file is run through WordPress&#8217;s time-tested and proven authentication system (the same system that prevents private or un-published posts from being viewed) and documents filenames are hashed upon upload, thus preventing them from being accessed directly. For additional security, you can move the document upload folder above the web root, (via settings-&gt;media-&gt;document upload folder). Because WP Document Revisions relies on a custom capability, user permissions can be further refined to prevent certain user roles from accessing certain documents.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20additional%20documentation%3F'>\nIs there any additional documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the top right corner of the edit document screen (where you upload the document or make other changes) and on the document list (where you can search or sort documents), there is a small menu labeled &#8220;help&#8221;. Both should provide some contextual guidance. Additional information may be available on the <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2011/08/29/document-management-version-control-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Document Revisions page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20lose%20internet%20connectivity%20while%20i%20have%20a%20file%20checked%20out%3F'>\nWhat happens if I lose internet connectivity while I have a file checked out?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Document Revisions will &#8220;ping&#8221; the server every minute to let it know that you have the file open. If for some reason you lose connectivity, the server will give you roughly a two minute grace period before it lifts the file lock. If it&#8217;s brief (e.g., WiFi disconnected), you should be fine, but if it&#8217;s for an extended period of time (e.g., a flight), you may find that someone else has checked the file out. You do not need to re-download the file (if no one else has modified it), simply remain on the document page to maintain the file lock.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20any%20plans%20to%20implement%20a%20front%20end%3F'>\nDo you have any plans to implement a front end?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In short, &#8220;no&#8221;, because each site&#8217;s use would be radically different. Although, you can always link directly to the permalink of any public document, which will always point the latest revision and is available on the document edit screen (right click on the &#8220;download&#8221; link), or through the add-link wizard when editing a post or page (simply search for the document you want). The long answer, is &#8220;it&#8217;s really easy to adapt a front end to your needs.&#8221; There are more than 35 document-specific API hooks, and the plugin exposes two global functions, <code>get_documents()</code> and <code>get_document_revisions()</code>, all of which are designed to allow plugin and theme developers to extend the plugins native functionality (details below). Looking for a slightly more out-of-the-box solution? One site I know of uses a combination of two plugins <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/count-shortcode/\" rel=\"ugc\">count shortcode</a>, which can make a front end to browse documents, especially in coordination with a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/faceted-search-widget/\" rel=\"ugc\">faceted search widget</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='no%20really%2C%20how%20do%20i%20present%20documents%20on%20the%20front%20end%3F'>\nNo really, how do I present documents on the front end?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A chronological list of all documents a user has access to can be seen at yourdomain.com/documents/. Moreover, because documents are really posts, many built in WordPress features should work and public documents should act similar to posts on the front end (searching, archives, etc.). The plugin comes with a customizable recently revised documents widget, as well as two shortcodes to display documents and document revisions (details below).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20wp%20document%20revisions%20work%20in%20my%20language%3F'>\nCan WP Document Revisions work in my language?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! So far WP Document Revisions has been translated to French and Spanish, and is designed to by fully internationalized. If you enjoy the plugin and are interested in contributing a translation (it&#8217;s super easy), please take a look at the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Translating WordPress</a> page and the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"http://translations.benbalter.com/projects/wp-document-revisions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translations repository</a>. If you do translate the plugin, please be sure to <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact the plugin author</a> so that it can be included in future releases for other to use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20in%20work%20with%20wordpress%20multisite'>\nWill in work with WordPress MultiSite\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Each site can have its own document repository (with the ability to give users different permissions on each repository), or you can create one shared document repository across all sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20over%20https%20%28ssl%29'>\nWill it work over HTTPS (SSL)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Just follow the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/administration-over-ssl/\" rel=\"ugc\">standard WordPress SSL instructions</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20tag%20my%20documents%3F%20what%20about%20categories%20or%20some%20other%20grouping%3F'>\nCan I tag my documents? What about categories or some other grouping?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-taxonomy-refreshed/\" rel=\"ugc\">Simple Taxonomy Refreshed plugin</a> to add taxonomies, or can share your existing taxonomies (e.g., the ones you use for posts) with documents.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20put%20my%20documents%20in%20folders%3F'>\nCan I put my documents in folders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Document Revisions doesn&#8217;t use the traditional folder metaphor to organize files. Instead, the same document can be described multiple ways, or in folder terms, be in multiple folders at once. This gives you more control over your documents and how they are organized. You can add a folder taxonomy with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-taxonomy-refreshed/\" rel=\"ugc\">Simple Taxonomy Refreshed</a> plugin. Just add the taxonomy with a post type of &#8220;Documents&#8221;, and as the &#8220;Hierarchical&#8221; set to True.</p>\n<p>Since a document can have many categories assigned at the same time, this is logically equivalent to being in many folders simultaneously.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20want%20even%20more%20control%20over%20my%20workflow%3F'>\nWhat if I want even more control over my workflow?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/\" rel=\"ugc\">Edit Flow Plugin</a> which allows you to set up notifications based on roles, in-line comments, assign all sorts of metadata to posts, create a team calendar, budget, etc. WP Document Revisions will detect if <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2011/10/24/advanced-workflow-management-tools-for-wp-document-revisions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow</a> is installed and activated, and will adapt accordingly (removing the workflow-state dialogs, registering documents with Edit Flow, etc.). If you&#8217;re looking for even more control over your team&#8217;s work flow, using the two plugins in conjunction is the way to go.</p>\n<p>Equally the <a href=\"https://publishpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PublishPress Plugin</a>, a fork of Edit Flow, is detected and can be used with WP Document Revisions in exactly the same manner as Edit Flow.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20some%20small%20changes%20to%20the%20processing%2C%20but%20there%20are%20few%20configuration%20options.%20how%20do%20i%20do%20this%3F'>\nI want some small changes to the processing, but there are few configuration options. How do I do this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there are few Settings. However there are many filters that allows processing to be configured to your requirement. These are described <a href=\"https://wp-document-revisions.github.io/wp-document-revisions/filters/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>. This will need some coding to be done.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20make%20it%20so%20that%20users%20can%20only%20access%20documents%20assigned%20to%20them%20%28or%20documents%20that%20they%20create%29%3F'>\nCan I make it so that users can only access documents assigned to them (or documents that they create)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Each document has an &#8220;owner&#8221; which can be changed from a dialog on the edit-document screen at the time you create it, or later in the process (by default, the document owner is the person that creates it). If the document is marked as private, only users with the read_private_documents capability can access it. Out of the box, this is set to Authors and below, but you can customize things via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/\" rel=\"ugc\">Members plugin</a> (head over to roles after installing).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20documents%20shortcode%3F'>\nHow do I use the documents shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In a post or page, simply type <code>[documents]</code> to display a list of documents.<br />\nMore information is on <a href=\"https://wp-document-revisions.github.io/wp-document-revisions/shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this</a> page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20document%20revisions%20shortcode%3F'>\nHow do I use the document revisions shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In a post or page, simply type <code>[document_revisions id=\"100\"]</code> where ID is the ID of the document for which you would like to list revisions.<br />\nMore information is on <a href=\"https://wp-document-revisions.github.io/wp-document-revisions/shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this</a> page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20recently%20revised%20documents%20widget%3F'>\nHow do I use the recently revised documents widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to your theme&#8217;s widgets page (if your theme supports widgets), and drag the widget to a sidebar of you choice. Once in a sidebar, you will be presented with options to customize the widget&#8217;s functionality.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20%60get_documents%60%20function%20in%20my%20theme%20or%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the `get_documents` function in my theme or plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply call <code>get_documents()</code>. Get documents accepts an array of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#parameters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Standard WP_Query parameters</a> as an argument. Use it as you would get_posts. It returns an array of document objects. The <code>post_content</code> of each document object is the attachment ID of the revision. <code>get_permalink()</code> with that document&#8217;s ID will also get the proper document permalink (e.g., to link to the document).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20%60get_document_revisions%60%20function%20in%20my%20theme%20or%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the `get_document_revisions` function in my theme or plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply call <code>get_document_revisions( 100 )</code> where 100 represents the ID of the document you&#8217;d like to query. The function returns an array of revisions objects. Each revisions&#8217;s <code>post_content</code> represents the ID of that revisions attachment object. <code>get_permalink()</code> should work with that revision&#8217;s ID to get the revision permalink (e.g., to link to the revision directly).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20the%20upload%20directory%20on%20multisite%20installs%20if%20i%20don%27t%20want%20to%20network%20activate%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I set the upload directory on multisite installs if I don&#8217;t want to network activate the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. There&#8217;s a plugin in the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Document Revisions Code Cookbook</a> to help with that. Just install and network activate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20limit%20access%20to%20documents%20based%20on%20workflow%20state%2C%20department%2C%20or%20some%20other%20custom%20taxonomy%3F'>\nCan I limit access to documents based on workflow state, department, or some other custom taxonomy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Download (and optionally customize) the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook/blob/master/taxonomy-permissions.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">taxonomy permissions</a> plugin from the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Code Cookbook</a>. Out of the box, it will register a &#8220;departments&#8221; taxonomy (which can be easily changed at the top of the file, if you want to limit access by a different taxonomy), and will create additional permissions based on that taxonomy&#8217;s terms using WordPress&#8217;s built-in capabilities system. So for example, instead simply looking at <code>edit_document</code> to determine permissions, it will also look at <code>edit_document_in_marketing</code>, for example. You can create additional roles and assign capabilities using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members\" rel=\"ugc\">Members</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20do%20a%20bulk%20import%20of%20existing%20documents%20%2F%20files%20already%20on%20the%20server%3F'>\nIs it possible to do a bulk import of existing documents / files already on the server?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It will need to be slightly customized to meet your needs, but take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook/blob/master/bulk-import.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bulk Import Script</a> in the code cookbook.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

It even gives you the option to revert back to a previous revision — so don&#8217;t fret if you make a mistake — or receive updates on changes to the document right in your favorite feed reader.</p>\n<p><strong>Access Control</strong> &#8211; Each document is given a persistent URL (e.g., yourcompany.com/documents/2011/08/TPS-Report.doc) which can be private (securely delivered only to members of your organization), password protected (available only to those you select such as clients or contractors), or public (published and hosted for the world to see). If you catch a typo and upload a new version, that URL will continue to point to the latest version, regardless of how many changes you make.</p>\n<p><strong>Enterprise Security</strong> &#8211; Worried about storing propriety or sensitive information? WP Document Revisions was built from the first line of code with government- and enterprise-grade security in mind. Each file is masked behind an anonymous 128-bit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MD5 hash</a> as soon as it touches the server, and requests for files are transparently routed through WordPress&#8217;s time-tested URL rewriting, authentication, and permission systems (which can even <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/active-directory-integration/\" rel=\"ugc\">integrate with existing enterprise active directory</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-ldap-login/\" rel=\"ugc\">LDAP servers</a>). Need more security? WP Document Revisions allows you to store documents in a folder above the <code>htdocs</code> or <code>public_html</code> <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">web root</a>, further ensuring that only those you authorize have access to your work.</p>\n<p><strong>Customization</strong> &#8211; WP Document Revisions recognizes that no two teams are identical, and as a result, molds to your firm&#8217;s needs, not the other way around. Need to track additional information associated with a document? Departments, editors, issues, sections, even arbitrary key-value pairs — whatever you can throw at it, it can handle. Development and customization costs are further minimized by its extensive plugin API, and the <a href=\"http://themergency.com/generators/wordpress-custom-taxonomy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Custom Taxonomy Generator</a> makes it easy for even the uninitiated to add custom taxonomies to documents. Need an audit trail to track check-ins and check-outs? User-level permissions based on the document&#8217;s state or another custom taxonomy? Support for third-party encryption? Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Document Revisions Code Cookbook</a> for sample code. Looking for even more advanced control of your workflow? WP Document Revisions will detect the popular workflow plugin <a href=\"http://editflow.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow</a>, if installed, and will automatically pull <a href=\"http://ben.balter.com/2011/10/24/advanced-workflow-management-tools-for-wp-document-revisions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow’s advanced workflow management tools</a> into WP Document Revisions. Simply put, virtually every aspect of the plugin&#8217;s functionality from workflow states to user-level permissions can be fully customized to your team&#8217;s unique needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Future Proof</strong> &#8211; Switching costs a concern? WP Document Revisions is built with tomorrow&#8217;s uncertainty in mind. Equally at home in an in-house server room as it is in the cloud, moving individual files or entire document repositories in and out of WP Document Revisions is a breeze (history and all). And since the software is open-source, you can easily add tools to automate the process of moving to or integrating with future third-party systems.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for any file type (docs, spreadsheets, images, PDFs — anything!)</li>\n<li>Securely stores unlimited revisions of your business&#8217;s essential files</li>\n<li>Provides a full file history in the form of a revision log, accessible via RSS</li>\n<li>Helps you track and organize documents as they move through your organization&#8217;s existing workflow</li>\n<li>Each file gets a permanent, authenticated URL that always points to the latest version</li>\n<li>Each revision gets its own unique url (e.g.,TPS-Report-revision-3.doc) accessible only to those you deem</li>\n<li>Files are intuitively checked out and locked to prevent revisions from colliding</li>\n<li>Toggle documents between public, private, and password protected with a single mouse click</li>\n<li>Runs in-house or in the cloud</li>\n<li>Secure: filenames are hashed on upload and files are only accessible through WordPress&#8217;s proven authentication system</li>\n<li>Can move document upload folder to location outside of web root to further ensure government- and enterprise-grade security</li>\n<li>Documents and Revisions shortcodes, Recently Revised Documents widget</li>\n<li>Multisite and Windows (XAMPP) support</li>\n<li>French and Spanish language support (easily translated to your language)</li>\n<li>Integration with <a href=\"https://editflow.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edit Flow</a></li>\n<li>Recently Revised Documents Widget, shortcodes, and templating functions for front-end integration</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features Available via the [Code Cookbook](https://github.com/wp-document-revisions/wp-document-revisions-Code-Cookbook)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Audit Trail</strong> &#8211;

(Only post_ID and new value are available)</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions-admin.php</p>\n<h3>Action document_change_workflow_state</h3>\n<p>Called when the post is saved and Workflow_State taxonomy value is changed. (post_ID, new and old value are available)</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions-admin.php</p>\n<h3>Action document_edit</h3>\n<p>Called as part of the Workflow_State taxonomy when putting the metabox on the admin page</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions-admin.php</p>\n<h3>Action document_lock_notice</h3>\n<p>Called when putting the lock notice on the admin edit screen.</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions-admin.php</p>\n<h3>Action document_lock_override</h3>\n<p>Called after trying to over-ride the lock and possibly a notice has been sent.</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions.php</p>\n<h3>Action document_saved</h3>\n<p>Called when a document has been saved and all plugin processing done.</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions-admin.php</p>\n<h3>Action document_serve_done</h3>\n<p>Called just after serving the file to the user.</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions.php</p>\n<h3>Action serve_document</h3>\n<p>Called just before serving the file to the user.</p>\n<p>In: class-wp-document-revisions.php</p>\n<h3>WP-Documents-Revisions Data Design and Data Structure</h3>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To maintain a reference to a document and to hold a list of published versions of the documents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is not particularly concerned about how the document is created and the process to arrive at the state ready to upload.</li>\n<li>It will maintain a status of where it is in the publishing process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It makes use of a custom post type &#8220;document&#8221; and revisions to maintain the history of Document file uploads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Document file will be uploaded using the standard Media loader.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This will result in an Attachment post being created with the Document post as its parent.</li>\n<li>It will not be visible in the Media library as Queries to the Media library remove attachments with parents that are documents.</li>\n<li>Document files can be stored in a different host library.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Document file should not be accessible directly by the user, but ideally via the WP interface.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This will be supported by changing the uploaded file name to be an MD5-hash of the original file name and load time.</li>\n<li>This can be supplemented by changing .htaccess rules to stop direct access to files with MD5 format names</li>\n<li>Standard WP processing may create a JPEG image of PDF uploads.</li>\n<li>Since it will store these using the MD5 file name that will be downloaded to the user this would expose the MD5 file name. Therefore there is a process to change these images to use another name.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The document post record can also support Featured Images.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If loaded via the Edit document page, it would be considered as a Document file. So the parent post identifier will be removed to eliminate confusion between it being a Featured Image and a Document file being stored.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since version 3.4 of the plugin, it is possible to enter a user-oriented description that can be displayed to users with the shortcodes or blocks provided with the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An audit trail of changes to published versions of the Document file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user can enter a reason for changing the Document including uploading a Document file; changing the Document Description; or Title; or any Taxonomy element.</li>\n<li>This reason will be stored in the Excerpt field.</li>\n<li>The aggregate information may be displayed as a Revision Log.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use will be made of the standard WP Revisions functionality to contain the Audit Trail itself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard WP processing creates a Revision if any one of these fields are changed: title, content or excerpt.</li>\n<li>Since all Attachments are linked to the parent Document record, by storing the Attachment Id in the content field, then a Revision record will be created automatically. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This plugin is delivered with just one Taxonomy &#8211; Workflow_State. This shows the status of the Document file in its processing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is not considered very useful for user data classification.</li>\n<li>However, being a generic tool, sites can use of a dedicated Taxonomy plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Data Structure</h3>\n<p>The records held in the database will be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Document Record</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>post_content contains the id of the latest Document file attachment record.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a Document file is loaded on editing this Document record, the post_content will be modified to contain the ID of the Attachment record created.</li>\n<li>In plugin versions prior to 3.4, this would simply be the numeric ID.</li>\n<li>Subsequent versions hold this in the form of an HTML comment &#8220;&lt;!&#8211; WPDR nnn &#8211;&gt;&#8221; where nnn is the ID of an attachment post. It can also contain a text Document description.</li>\n<li>When editing the post, this field is decomposed into its two parts of ID and description with program management of the former and user management of the latter, recombined automatically when changes are made.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>post_excerpt will contain any comment entered when the document record is updated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As taxonomy records are held only against this Document record, there is no effective audit trail of changes to Taxonomy. Changes can be noted manually in the excerpt field</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Attachment Record(s)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There can be multiple Attachment records, one for each Document file loaded.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The name and title of the Attachment record is set to a MD5 hash of the original file name and the load time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Document file name is also set as this MD5 hash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>post_parent is set to the Document Record ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a PDF Document file is loaded, then standard WP processing will attempt to make a JPEG image of the first page as a thumbnail (using all sizes). These will be held in the same directory as the Document file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>However if the file name is MD5Hash.pdf, then these images will be called MD5Hash-pdf.jpg.</li>\n<li>If used on a page, this would expose the name of the file to the user.</li>\n<li>To avoid this, there is a process to transform this name to another (essentially random) MD5 and rename these image files.</li>\n<li>Once done, a postmeta record is created with these new file names (and a field denoting this process has been done).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a Featured Image is loaded whilst editing the Document record, this would also have the same post_parent set, so in this case, the post_parent is set to 0 leaving the functional postmeta link to denote the presence of the featured image.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Revision Record(s)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When saving a Document Record, standard WP processing will be invoked to detect a change in title, content or excerpt fields. If one is found then a Revision record is created.</p>\n<p>There can be multiple Revision records held, one for each saving event where a change in these fields are detected.</p>\n<p>Because the document content contains the latest Attachment ID, an upload of  &hellip;</p>\n",
