        "description": "<p>WordPress supports featured images out of the box, allowing images to represent posts in various ways defined by the theme. This plugin adds similar support for audio, allowing musicians, podcasters, and anyone who publishes audio with WordPress to feature audio files on posts and pages in a structured way. Each post and page gets a featured audio metabox where an audio file can be uploaded or selected from the media library.</p>\n<p>By default, featured audio is displayed at the top of posts and pages <code>(within the_content)</code>. Developers can change this by adding theme support for <code>featured-audio</code>, via several API functions listed below.</p>\n<p>Why use featured audio instead of embeding audio directly into posts? Featured audio organizes the content in a structured way, alowing infinite possibilities to customize the way users experience audio content on your site. The plugin ships with one example of this &#8211; the featured audio playlist widget. Add this widget to your sidebar and it&#8217;ll automatically display a playlist of all of the audio files featured on posts shown on the current view, on views with more than one post such as the main blog page or a category page. The plugin also supports a recent audio playlist widget, which behaves similarly to a latest posts widget.</p>\n<p>For a more comprehensive way to manage <em>music</em> with WordPress, particularly if you need to include sheet music alongisde audio, see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sheet-music-library/\" rel=\"ugc\">Sheet Music Library</a> plugin.</p>\n<h3>Developer API Functions</h3>\n<h4>Add Theme Support</h4>\n<pre><code>add_theme_support( 'featured-audio' )\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding theme support for featured audio tells the plugin not to add the featured audio to the content automatically.

You can use the <code>featured_audio_post_types</code> filter to modify this list. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'featured_audio_post_types', 'prefix_featured_audio_post_types' );\nfunction prefix_featured_audio_post_types( $post_types ) {\n    // Add support to the sheet_music post type.\n    $post_types[] = 'sheet_music';\n\n    // Overwrite the entire list to remove support on pages.\n    $post_types = array( 'post' );\n\n    return $post_types;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>the_featured_audio( $args )</h4>\n<p>Display the featured audio, if it exists.</p>\n<p>Parameters:</p>\n<pre><code>$args                   array   Display options.\n$args['id']             int     Post id (optional). Defaults to current post id. \n$args['album_art']      boolean Whether to display the album art for the featured audio cycle. Default: false.\n$args['album_art_size'] string  Size to use for the album art picture. Default: thumbnail.\n$args['title']          boolean Whether to display the title of the audio attachment. Default: false.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>get_the_featured_audio( $args )</h4>\n<p>Get the featured audio, if it exists, as a string.
