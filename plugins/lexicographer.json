Here&#8217;s an <a href=\"http://texttheater.net/woerterverzeichnis\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">example</a> of such an index.</p>\n<p>I wrote this plugin because I like to invent words and define them on my blog, thereby creating a dictionary distributed over several posts. Not only was there no list of all the words available, it was also that Google wouldn&#8217;t find the words because it couldn&#8217;t deal with the stress marks I put in there, dictionary-style. Lexicographer solves both of these problems.</p>\n<p>Lexicographer&#8217;s index is divided into sections, according to the initial characters of terms. Such sections are currently created for the Latin letters (A-Z, letters with diacritics are grouped with the non-diacriticized versions), Hindi characters, and Telugu characters. A single section &#8220;#&#8221; is created for all Arabic digits (0-9). All other initial characters go into a special section titled &#8220;*&#8221;. Contributions to add support for other writing systems are welcome!</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Lexicographer does not add any new elements to the WordPress admin interface.  Instead, you use it as follows:</p>\n<p>In the posts and pages where you define terms, <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/wordpress-editor/#configuring-a-block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">use &#8220;Edit as HTML&#8221;</a> and put the words and terms to index in spans of class <code>lemma</code>, like so: <code>&lt;span class=\"lemma\"&gt;ˌsu·per·ca·liˌfra·gi·lis·ticˌex·pi·a·liˈdo·cious&lt;/span&gt;</code> (the stress and hyphenation marks are of course optional).</p>\n<p>In the page (or post, or text widget) where you&#8217;d like the index to live, paste the following shortcode:</p>\n<p>[lexicographer_index]</p>\n<p>At this place, the index will be inserted. It will consist of the defined terms, linking to the definitions.</p>\n<p>Shortcode attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>anchorlinks [true/false, default: true]: If true, anchored links to the terms<br />\nwill be created. If false, links to the post(s) containing the term will be<br />\ncreated.</li>\n<li>headerlevel [int, default: 3]: Which heading level to use for the capical<br />\ncharacters in the index.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If you have questions or suggestions, contact me at poststelle ät texttheater döt net.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for and install Lexicographer directly through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in<br />\nWordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and unzip Lexicographer</li>\n<li>Upload the <code>lexicographer</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Telugu and Hindi (contribution by Sriram Nadiminti).</li>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.1.1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how the Lexicographer index is inserted in posts and pages. You must<br />\nnow use shortcodes instead of pasting the </li>\n</ul>\n<p>{{Lexicographer index}}</p>\n<p>string where you want the index to appear.<br />\n* Using the shortcode, you can now specify the heading level of the capital<br />\n  character and if you want anchoring links for the terms or just plain links<br />\n  to posts.<br />\n* Tested with WordPress 4.4.2.</p>\n<h4>0.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The individual index sections are now put into divs of class<br />\nlexicographer-index-section for the benefit of those who want to style and/or<br />\nscript the index.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The index is now put into a div of class lexicographer-index for the benefit<br />\nof those who want to style and/or script the index.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Transliteration of lemmas to ASCII both for creating anchor names and for<br />\nsorting now uses the same transliteration table. The characters ÄäÖöÜü<br />\n(graphemes corresponding to German umlauts) still receive special treatment<br />\nin that they are expanded à la ä <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> ae for anchor names (but not for sorting),<br />\nbut this is now done as a preprocessing step.</li>\n<li>The transliteration table now covers almost every latin-derived letter in the<br />\nUnicode blocks Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B and<br />\nLatin Extended Additional. Most transliterations are &#8220;glyph-oriented&#8221; in that<br />\nthey involve only removing diacritic marks, decomposing ligatures and<br />\nrotating letters back. A few transliterations are more &#8220;usage-oriented&#8221;, such<br />\nas ß <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> ss, þ <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> th or Ɣ <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> g. Some effort was made to keep the transliteration<br />\ntable sane, consistent and language-neutral. Missing letters are indicated in<br />\ncomments. Suggestions for additions and improvement are more than welcome!</li>\n<li>Bugfix: generated links were broken if not using /%postname permalinks.</li>\n<li>Bugfix: was indexing unpublished posts/pages on installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now observing DB_CHARSET for creating the database table. This fixes a<br />\nproblem where non-ASCII characters get replaced by question marks when<br />\ninserting into the table via a UTF-8 connection.</li>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 3.3.2.</li>\n<li>Updated documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Index can now be inserted in widgets.</li>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 3.3.</li>\n<li>Updated documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Lemmas are now removed from the index when the post/page containing them is<br />\ndeleted or otherwise unpublished.</li>\n<li>The index now uses absolute links.</li>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 2.9.1.</li>\n<li>Updated documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
