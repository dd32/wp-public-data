        "faq": "\n<h4>Who made this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thanks to Omar Reygaert.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What versions of wordpress does this plugin support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment I have no idea, it&#8217;s created since version 3.3.2, but I think this will still work on older versions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What versions of PHP does this support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin should work with PHP 4.4 through last versions of php is always the best.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I upgrade from a version before 0.1.3 and I see birthdays 2 times in the ical?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since 0.1.3 there is a change in the way the plugin saves the ical-file. If you encounter problems of duplicate events, run the &#8220;rebuild birthdays&#8221; on the overview page on &#8220;Birthday users&#8221;. This will cleanup the old usage and recreate it in the new way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have version 0.1.3 but it gives an error when I activate the plugin, what to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For some reason there went 2 breakspaces in the core plugin file. You can edit the file wp-birthday-users.php at the end by remove the breakspaces. Or you could upgrade to the last version.<br />\nI&#8217;m sorry for this.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
