        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Unpack the zip file and copy the craftyclicks_postcode_lookup folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins folder.</li>\n<li>On the admin panel, go to Plugins / Installed Plugins, and activate the Crafty Clicks Postcode Lookup Integration.</li>\n<li>From the admin panel, go to WooCommerce / Settings / Integration and click on the Crafty Clicks Postcode Lookup tab. Here you can insert your access token, which is needed to use this plugin on a live site. To get an access token, you will need to sign up for an account with us, and we will email you an access token. On this page you will also find configuration options, which are explained below in the Configuration section. When you have finished, click &#8216;Save changes&#8217;.</li>\n<li>You can test the plugin without an access token using our free test postcodes: AA11AA, AA11AB, AA11AD and AA11AE. If all is OK so far and you haven&#8217;t got an account with us yet, register at www.craftyclicks.co.uk. You will get an email with your access token. Remember that you need a paid up account to go live on a public facing website (the trial only gives you up to 30 clicks of live address searches).</li>\n<li>(optional) Any suggestions for improvements to the module? Let us know at support@craftyclicks.co.uk.</li>\n</ol>\n",
