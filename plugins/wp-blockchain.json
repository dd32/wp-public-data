        "faq": "\n<h4>What is blockchain?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Blockchain is a permanent, decentralized database system based. The first discovered use case was a virtual monetary system named Bitcoin, but the technology now allows infinite possibilities in terms of safe communication. The coming blockchain era is also known as the &#8220;Forth Industrial Revolution&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is blockchain timestamping?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Timestamping is the act of certifying that some data existed at some moment. Blockchain timestamping is the act of timestamping through attaching the unique cryptographic stamp (SHA256) of some data, to a small cryptocurrency transaction. Blockchain timestamping is permanent, mathematically provable, and does not require the stamped data to be revealed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is blockchain related to Bitcoin cryptocurrency?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cryptucurrencies act as an economic incentives for each blockchain network to remain very decentralized, and thus secure.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin connect to the blockchains?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Blockchain uses many APIs as stamping services (like <a href=\"https://stampery.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stampery.com</a>) and block explorers (like <a href=\"https://www.blockcypher.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlockCypher</a>). Furthermore, all the features are extendable to your needs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you help our company implement a blockchain project?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, we offer customized services to help you implement your company&#8217;s very own blockchain.
