The placement of every page and field was considered to reduce distraction and confusion, and let your products shine. This results in higher conversion rates and increased online revenue.<br />\nXola’s plugin pages are optimized for everything:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleek, simple, and readable.</li>\n<li>Completely SEO ready.</li>\n<li>Lightning fast.</li>\n<li>Made for mobile, verified by Google.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Your Brand, Your Business</h4>\n<p>Every page is built with your brand in mind. The minimalist storefront design puts the focus on your activities, and harmonizes beautifully with any theme.</p>\n<h4>Take Bookings In Real-Time</h4>\n<p>Xola&#8217;s real-time booking engine manages availability, inventory, and guides so you don&#8217;t have to.

        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.4.45 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>From your WordPress admin panel, go to Plugins &gt; “Add New”</li>\n<li>Search “Xola” and select “Install Now”. A new menu item will appear named “Xola”.</li>\n<li>When you select “Xola” from your WordPress admin panel, you will need to sign in with your primary account email in order to fully use the plugin.</li>\n<li>Once you sign in, the plugin will walk you through the simple onboarding steps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>In case you want to manually install the plugin all you have to do is to unpack the plugin package and upload it to your webserver via FTP. You can find more detailed instructions on how to do this <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Whenever there&#8217;s a new version of the plugin available, you&#8217;ll see a notification in your WordPress admin panel and you can automatically update it by following the link in notification.</p>\n<p>As with all other plugin updates, it is a good idea to backup your site first, just in case something unexpected goes wrong.</p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with plugin pages, try flushing the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and clicking the &#8220;Save&#8221; button. This should reset the settings and make plugin pages available again.</p>\n",

If you’re not a Xola user yet, sign up for a free demo <a href=\"https://www.xola.com/demo?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=faq&amp;utm_campaign=wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20xola%20plugin%20work%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nWill the Xola plugin work with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin is designed to work with any theme, however, it may require some styling to make it fit perfectly to your screens.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
