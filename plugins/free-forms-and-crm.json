The settings of the form allow to redirect to a<br />\nspecial page or use a &#8220;thank you&#8221; text that you define, insert contacts in the CRM or not, send different kinds of notification, assign different processes<br />\nto happen after the form is sent.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/--UP3NuWXIY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Free Forms &amp; CRM <a href=\"http://crm-plugin.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin page</a></p>\n<p>Detailed description <a href=\"http://crm-plugin.org/82/how-to-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">how to use</a> including videos for every step</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add fields with one click</li>\n<li>Form builder</li>\n<li>Responsive design included</li>\n<li>Notifications by email</li>\n<li>Storing data into CRM</li>\n<li>Import and export data from CRM</li>\n<li>Assigning groups to users that register using a specific form in order to be found after</li>\n<li>Form Validation</li>\n<li>Customized Confirmation Messages</li>\n<li>Redirect to a URL or create a &#8220;Thank you&#8221; page</li>\n<li>Standard Fields</li>\n<li>Custom defined Fields</li>\n<li>Shortcode works on any Post or Page</li>\n<li>Embed Multiple Forms on a Post/Page</li>\n<li>One click form duplication</li>\n<li>Use your own CSS (if you want)</li>\n<li>Multiple field layout options: arrange the fields in columns, set width of label and fields</li>\n<li>Advanced interface for responsive layouts &#8211; if necessary layouts for different devices can be created</li>\n<li>Anti spam system included</li>\n<li>Accepts all languages</li>\n<li>Accepts all styles, fonts, colors, background images and positions </li>\n<li>Processes assigned to forms</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Field Types</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard address fields connected to CRM</li>\n<li>Additional custom defined fields connected to CRM</li>\n<li>Basic fields: text input, radio, checkbox, text area, select box</li>\n<li>HTML field</li>\n<li>Date picker</li>\n<li>File upload</li>\n<li>Captcha</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Entries</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Forms can add leads into the CRM as registered users, not registered users, or not adding at all (just a contact)</li>\n<li>Registered users have access to client administration which is also included in the free package</li>\n<li>Form content is added in the database and can be submitted by email</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>CRM</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Search by keyword</li>\n<li>Advanced search by any possible field</li>\n<li>Sending emails to clients using email templates</li>\n<li>Search clients by the form that was used for registration</li>\n<li>Collecting data from different forms</li>\n<li>Upload documents to clients</li>\n<li>Groups of clients</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>SPAM Protection</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>CSRF automatically included on every form</li>\n<li>Can use captcha (included)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>The plugin is created with the purpose of offering a very high security to your data.

There is no part in the CRM that cannot be accessed over API.<br />\nThis makes the plugin and the CRM be very developer friendly.

You have also the possibility to adapt the design for different devices directly with the form builder.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I receive an email when somebody fills the form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, you need just to check a check-box on the settings page. Else you have all the answers as messages in the CRM</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I select leads based on what form they filled in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Just assign a group to all who filled the form.

You can assign groups by answers, and use them for search.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the CRM entirely free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the CRM is free up to 1000 clients.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
