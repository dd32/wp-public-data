        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need my own AdSense account to make this work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this work on my Multi User (MU) installation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This has not been tested in a MU environment. We have reports of it crashing MU websites, so I would only test on a non live website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I make my ads align left or right?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. If you would like your ads to align left, use the shortcode [GARD align=&#8221;left&#8221;]. The same is true for center and right.<br />\nSamples:<br />\n[GARD] will not center or wrap text.<br />\n[GARD align=&#8221;left&#8221;] will make your ad align left and text wrap around it.<br />\n[GARD align=&#8221;center&#8221;] will make your ad centered and text wrap NOT around it.<br />\n[GARD align=&#8221;right&#8221;] will make your ad align right and text wrap around it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to create ads for every size?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You will only need to create an ad for each size that you want displayed. Feel free to leave the field(s) blank to skip that size.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do you prevent GARD from displaying more than 3 ads on one page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We check for three types of ads; link units, ad units, and the 300&#215;600 ad size. If either the link units, or ad units already have 3 per page, we don&#8217;t output ads. Same goes for the 300&#215;600, if there is already one on the page, we don&#8217;t output a 2nd.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the different versions of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GARD (What you&#8217;re looking at now)<br />\n<a href=\"http://thepluginfactory.co/warehouse/gard-pro\" title=\"GARD Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GARD Pro</a> (Offers many additional features to extend GARD)<br />\n* GARD Pro costs $24.95, and is appropriate if you expect to make more than $24.95 in ad revenue from your site. ðŸ˜›</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I contact the plugin developer for help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support is available on <a href=\"http://thepluginfactory.co/community/forum/plugin-specific/gard-google-adsense-for-responsive-design/\" title=\"GARD Official WordPress Plugin Support Forum\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GARD Official WordPress Plugin Support Forum</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
