Alternatively, the plugin is also widget-aware and will appear in your widget list.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new page with some information about your sponsorship campaign. Add this tag to your page: <!--SponsorMe-page--></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure the plugin from the SponsorMe menu in your Administration Section. Specify the currency you want to sell in, your Paypal address, your target amount and the Page ID of the page you created in step 4. You can now click a link to ask the plugin to search for this ID for you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wait for pledges to come in!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a user pledges an amount, they will be taken straigh to PayPal to donate money. Once you receive the PayPal email to confirm the amount has been received, log into the plugin page and click &#8220;Verify&#8221; next to the payment you have received. This updates the graph and moves the payment to the confirmed list.</p>\n",
