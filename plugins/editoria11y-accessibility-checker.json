        "installation": "<p>Editoria11y&#8217;s default settings will work great for most sites.</p>\n<p>Your first task after installation should be clicking through a representative sampling of the main pages of your site. This will start to populate your dashboard report, and give you a chance to look for issues to fix or dismiss.</p>\n<p>If you notice anything amiss, experiment with these settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a &#8220;Theme for tooltips&#8221; that looks nice with your site&#8217;s colors.</li>\n<li>If the checker is flagging issues that are not relevant to content editors, either use &#8220;Check content in these containers&#8221; to constrain checks to the parts of the page with editable content, or &#8220;Exclude these elements from checks&#8221; to skip over certain elements, regions or widgets.</li>\n<li>Editoria11y also provides a minimalist &#8220;as-you-type&#8221; issue highlighter that works inside the Block Editor/Gutenberg. If you find this feature annoying rather than helpful, change &#8220;Highlight issues while editing content&#8221; to &#8220;Only definite errors&#8221; or &#8220;None.&#8221;</li>\n<li>If you do not want PDF or other document types flagged for manual checks, provide a shorter selector list or set &#8220;Document types that need manual review&#8221; to <code>false</code></li>\n<li>If your theme has done something very unusual with its layout, such as setting the height of the content container to 0px, you may see confusing alerts when opening Editoria11y tips saying that the highlighted element may be off-screen or invisible. If that happens, disable &#8220;Check if elements are visible when using panel navigation buttons.&#8221; This is disabled by defaults on any WordPress themes we have noticed this on, so if you find a theme</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are a theme developer, note that the library dispatches JavaScript events at several key moments (scan finishes, panel opens, tooltip opens or shuts), allowing you to attach custom functionality. JavaScript on sites running Editoria11y can use these events to do things like <a href=\"https://editoria11y.princeton.edu/configuration/#hidden-content\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">automatically opening accordion widgets</a> if they contain hidden alerts, disabling &#8220;sticky&#8221; site menus if the panel is open, inserting <a href=\"https://editoria11y.princeton.edu/configuration/#customtests\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">custom results</a>, or syncing results to third-party dashboards.</p>\n<p>And then&#8230;tell us how it went! This plugin and its base library are both under active development. Ideally send bug reports and feature requests through the <a href=\"https://github.com/itmaybejj/editoria11y-wp/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub issue queue</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20is%20this%20different%20from%20other%20checkers%3F'>\nHow is this different from other checkers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Editoria11y is meant to supplement, not replace, these tools.</p>\n<p>Editoria11y is&#8230;spellcheck: a seamless, automatic and intuitive integration for content authoring. It:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does not require training before use.</li>\n<li>Eschews obfuscation and techno-legal jargon. It explains what the issue is in plain language, with a simple explanation of how to fix it. &#8220;This image needs alternative text&#8221; with a short explanation of what alternative text is makes sense without prior technical knowledge; &#8220;Failure of WCAG 1.1.1 Level A: Non-text Content&#8221; does not.</li>\n<li>Deliberately excludes tests for theme and plugin issues, like invalid HTML tags and ARIA attributes. Testing is critically important for themers and developers, but it is work for themers and developers, not content editors. For ongoing quality assurance, Editoria11y provides people with a tool that fits their role, so they only receive alerts for things they can fix.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20this%20different%20from%20sa11y%3F'>\nHow is this different from Sa11y?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Editoria11y&#8217;s test suite is quite similar to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sa11y/\" rel=\"ugc\">Sa11y</a>. Editoria11y began as a Sa11y fork, and the maintainers collaborate on new tests and optimizations.</p>\n<p>The look, feel and features outside of the core test suite are a bit different. At a high level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sa11y focuses on flexibility and extensibility:\n<ul>\n<li>The end-user can override appearance and test coverage settings from the results panel</li>\n<li>A legibility scoring library is included</li>\n<li>A contrast checking library is included</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Editoria11y focuses on providing a shared experience for all editors:\n<ul>\n<li>An API is added, meaning findings are synchronized with your site&#8217;s database, populating a site-wide reporting dashboard</li>\n<li>Manual-checks marked as &#8220;OK&#8221; are dismissed for <strong>all</strong> users, not just the current user</li>\n<li>Issues can be highlighted within the Block Editor/Gutenberg as you edit, not just on the published page</li>\n<li>All configuration is managed in the plugin settings</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20an%20overlay%3F'>\nIs this an overlay?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Overlays are tools that modify your site&#8217;s public pages according to automated attempts to modify its code and design, claiming these machine-generated changes to your site will better meet the accessibility needs of your users.</p>\n<p>Overlays may override your font sizes or colors, or modify its heading tags and buttons. You should familiarize yourself with the <a href=\"https://overlayfactsheet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">assistive technology compatibility problems overlays may introduce</a> before assuming these changes will be helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Editoria11y is not an overlay.</strong> It does not modify the site viewed by not-logged-in-users in any way. It is an editor-facing &#8220;spellchecker&#8221; that helps your site editors create accessible content.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
