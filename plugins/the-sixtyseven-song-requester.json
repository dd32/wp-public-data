        "description": "<p>The sixtyseven song requester plugin was originally created as a tool to manage the song requests on the programmer&#8217;s wedding. The goal was to give the attending guests a nice way to make a song request to the DJ without even leaving the table. It offers the ability to mark songs as played by the DJ and some basic settings. Everything can be fully achieved in the frontend, so you do not need to give your DJ access to the WordPress admin area, but the plugin has of course the typical admin view of the song requests as well. And there is a nice way to get some demo data from Apple&#8217;s itunes store topselling tracks from all over the world.</p>\n<p>The frontend output is realized by a shortcode to provide maximum flexibility. Simply put the shortcode [ss_song_requester] anywhere on a page to show the song requests list. To match the output styling with your theme, simply copy the file ss_song_requester-public.css from the public/css directory of this plugin to the directory wp-content/themes/yourtheme/css. When the plugin finds this file, it will load it superior to the plugin&#8217;s public css file.</p>\n<p>Translations:<br />\n* English (sixtyseven)<br />\n* German (sixtyseven)<br />\n* German formal (sixtyseven)</p>\n<p>Please contact me if you want to add a translation</p>\n",
