Install and activate the plugin</strong><br />\nIn your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins =&gt; Add New. Search for &#8220;LTL Freight Quotes WooCommerce Plugin For FedEx Customers&#8221;, and click Install Now.<br />\nAfter the installation process completes, click the Activate Plugin link to activate the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Get a license from Eniture Technology</strong><br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://eniture.com/woocommerce-fedex-ltl-freight/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Eniture Technology</a> and pick a<br />\nsubscription package. When you complete the registration process you will receive an email containing your license key and<br />\nyour login to eniture.com. Save your login information in a safe place. You will need it to access your customer dashboard<br />\nwhere you can manage your licenses and subscriptions. A credit card is not required for the free trial. If you opt for the free<br />\ntrial you will need to login to your <a href=\"http://eniture.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Eniture Technology</a> dashboard before the trial period expires to purchase<br />\na subscription to the license. Without a paid subscription, the plugin will stop working once the trial period expires.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Establish the connection</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings and select the tab for the carrier. . Use the <em>Connection</em> link to create a connection to your carrier account.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Select the plugin settings</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings and select the tab for the carrier. Use the <em>Quote Settings</em> link to enter the required information and choose<br />\nthe optional settings.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Define warehouses and drop ship locations</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings and select the tab for the carrier. Use the <em>Warehouses</em> link to enter your warehouses and drop ship locations.  You should define at least one warehouse, even if all of your products ship from drop ship locations. Products are quoted as shipping from the warehouse closest to the shopper unless they are assigned to a specific drop ship location. If you fail to define a warehouse and a product isn’t assigned to a drop ship location, the plugin will not return a quote for the product. Defining at least one warehouse ensures the plugin will always return a quote.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Enable the plugin</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings =&gt; Shipping. Click on the Shipping Zones link. Add a US domestic shipping zone if one doesn’t already exist. Click the “+” sign to add a shipping method to the US domestic shipping zone and choose carrier name from the list.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Configure your products</strong><br />\nAssign each of your products and product variations a weight, Shipping Class and freight classification. Products shipping LTL freight should have the Shipping Class set to “LTL Freight”. The Freight Classification should be chosen based upon how the product would be classified in the NMFC Freight Classification Directory. If you are unfamiliar with freight classes, contact the carrier and ask for assistance with properly identifying the freight classes for your  products.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20my%20shopping%20cart%20contains%20products%20that%20ship%20ltl%20and%20products%20that%20would%20normally%20ship%20parcel%3F'>\nWhat happens when my shopping cart contains products that ship LTL and products that would normally ship parcel?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the shopping cart contains one or more products tagged to ship LTL freight, all of the products in the shopping cart<br />\nare assumed to ship LTL freight. To ensure the most accurate quote possible, make sure that every product has a weight, dimensions and a freight classification recorded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20forget%20to%20identify%20a%20freight%20classification%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I forget to identify a freight classification for a product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the absence of a freight class, the plugin will determine the freight classification using the density calculation method. To do so the products weight and dimensions must be recorded. This is accurate in most cases, however identifying the proper freight class will be the most reliable method for ensuring accurate rate estimates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20was%20the%20invoice%20i%20received%20from%20the%20carrier%20more%20than%20what%20it%20was%20quoted%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy was the invoice I received from the carrier more than what it was quoted by the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions, freight class) is different, or additional services (such as residential<br />\ndelivery, lift gate, delivery by appointment and others) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping<br />\nsettings on the products included in the shipment. Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packaging<br />\nmaterials, such as a pallet, is included by the carrier in the billable weight for the shipment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20out%20what%20freight%20classification%20to%20use%20for%20my%20products%3F'>\nHow do I find out what freight classification to use for my products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact your local the carrier&#8217;s office for assistance. You might also consider getting a subscription to ClassIT offered<br />\nby the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA). Visit them online at classit.nmfta.org.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20an%20account%20number%3F'>\nHow do I get an account number?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit the carrier&#8217;s website or contact the carrier&#8217;s customer support..</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20my%20username%20and%20password%20to%20the%20carrier%27s%20website%3F'>\nWhere do I find my username and password to the carrier&#8217;s website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your username and password will have been issued when you established your account. If you have your username and not your password, you can try to recover the password on the login page to the carrier&#8217;s website. Otherwise contact the carrier&#8217;s customer support department.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20a%20license%20key%20for%20my%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I get a license key for my plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must register your installation of the plugin, regardless of whether you are taking advantage of the trial period or<br />\npurchased a license outright. At the conclusion of the registration process an email will be sent to you that will include the<br />\nlicense key. You can also login to eniture.com using the username and password you created during the registration process<br />\nand retrieve the license key from the My Licenses tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20my%20plugin%20license%20from%20the%20trail%20version%20to%20one%20of%20the%20paid%20subscriptions%3F'>\nHow do I change my plugin license from the trail version to one of the paid subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to eniture.com and navigate to the My Licenses tab. There you will be able to manage the licensing of all of your<br />\nEniture Technology plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%20the%20plugin%20on%20another%20website%3F'>\nHow do I install the plugin on another website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has a single site license. To use it on another website you will need to purchase an additional license.<br />\nIf you want to change the website with which the plugin is registered, login to eniture.com and navigate to the My Licenses tab.<br />\nThere you will be able to change the domain name that is associated with the license key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20purchase%20a%20second%20license%20for%20my%20staging%20or%20development%20site%3F'>\nDo I have to purchase a second license for my staging or development site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Each license allows you to identify one domain for your production environment and one domain for your staging or<br />\ndevelopment environment. The rate estimates returned in the staging environment will have the word “Sandbox” appended to them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20plugin%20working%20on%20my%20other%20website%3F'>\nWhy isn’t the plugin working on my other website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you can successfully test your credentials from the Connection page (WooCommerce &gt; Settings  and select the tab for the carrier than connections)<br />\nthen you have one or more of the following licensing issues:</p>\n<p>1) You are using the license key on more than one domain. The licenses are for single sites. You will need to purchase an additional license.<br />\n2) Your trial period has expired.<br />\n3) Your current license has expired and we have been unable to process your form of payment to renew it. Login to eniture.com and go to the My Licenses tab to resolve any of these issues.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
