Visit the plugin installer and look for &#8216;Memory Bump&#8217; by the WordPress team, or download the plugin here and follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>memory-bump/memory-bump.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go install WordPress 3.0!</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is this plugin necessary?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The size of the download package for WordPress 3.0 is a bit larger than previous versions, due to the merge with WordPress MU and the awesome Twenty Ten theme. WordPress needs a bit more memory to download the larger file, which this plugin handles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your host may prevent PHP from increasing its own memory limit. Please contact your host. WordPress recommends at least 32 MB, but it may need a bit more during an automatic upgrade. This plugin bumps the theoretical limit to 256 MB, though we&#8217;d never need that much.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
