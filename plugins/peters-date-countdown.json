Also, make sure that the files are placed in the folder &#8220;wp-content/plugins/peters-date-countdown&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then, paste this code wherever you wish to display the countdowns:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\ncountdown_callit();\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to call a specific countdown, enter the number of the countdown item that you want to display in parentheses, such as this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\ncountdown_callit(3);\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can manage it like a normal widget in WordPress.</p>\n",
