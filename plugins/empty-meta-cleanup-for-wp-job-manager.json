        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20cleanup%20existing%20empty%20meta%3F'>\nHow do I cleanup existing empty meta?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To cleanup existing empty meta entries in the database, you must be have either the WP Job Manager Field Editor 1.12.2+ or Search and Filtering for WP Job Manager 1.1.9+ plugin installed and activated.  The code that handles that is included in those plugins, and is not something included with this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20really%20need%20this%3F'>\nDo I really need this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends. Does your theme or another plugin add custom fields outside the default WP Job Manager (or associated) fields? Have you changed any of the fields to optional? Are you<br />\nusing the WP Job Manager Field Editor or Search and Filtering for WP Job Manager addons? If you answered yes to any of these, then yes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently the method used to handle this is by looping through all the fields after the core plugin saves the listing, checking if those values were actually submitted when the<br />\nlisting was saved, and if they are not, it deletes the meta from the database. In an upcoming release the core plugins will be short-circuited when they attempt to save the meta,<br />\nbut for now we just delete the empty meta value after it&#8217;s added to the database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20exclude%20specific%20fields%3F'>\nCan I exclude specific fields?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, please check GitHub project for associated filters that can be used (a UI will be added in a later release for this)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20else%20can%20i%20speed%20up%20my%20site%20and%20database%3F'>\nHow else can I speed up my site and database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I strongly recommend also using the &#8220;Index WP MySQL for Speed&#8221; plugin to add indexes to your database:<br />\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/index-wp-mysql-for-speed/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
