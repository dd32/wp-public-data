It can get sort of unruly when you have a lot of sites. And because emails are annoying.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I would like to edit what the update email contains. Can I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably, but not with this plugin. This is <em>only</em> intended to suppress the emails sent, not modify them in any way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a question / bug report / feature request</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Best place for them is on <a href=\"https://github.com/norcross/control-wp-core-emails\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
