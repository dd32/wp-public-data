The WooCommerce Loyalty Program Plugin&#8217;s amazing feature allows you to differentiate customers based on their purchase history.</p>\n<p>With a WooCommerce Points and Rewards Plugin, you can gamify and recognize your loyal customers with special rewards using Levels / VIP Tiers. This system allows you to create levels/tiers based on the total points collected.</p>\n<p>Example: Let’s say you reward customers with 1 point for each $1 spent in the store. Consider introducing three levels – Silver, Gold, and Platinum – and reward customers with more points for their spending and loyalty towards the store:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When customers reach Silver, they can earn 2 points for each $1 spent.</li>\n<li>When customers reach Gold, they can earn 4 points for each $1 spent.</li>\n<li>When customers reach Platinum, they can earn 6 points for each $1 spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>INSTANT COUPON REWARDS:</h3>\n<p>The WooCommerce Rewards Plugin allows you to offer instant rewards in the form of coupons. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up for an account and get a $10 coupon code.</li>\n<li>Reward customers when they refer a friend with an instant coupon. For instance, if you Refer a friend, the friend gets a $10 coupon, and you get a $10 coupon upon successful referral completion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>ADD-ONS:</h3>\n<p>Expand your loyalty program and unlock new possibilities with <a href=\"https://wployalty.net/wployalty-add-ons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">add-ons for the WooCommerce Loyalty Plugin</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reward Panel Popup Widget:</strong> This chat-link widget helps your customers easily discover your loyalty program and participate without browsing through multiple pages.</li>\n<li><strong>Points Expiry:</strong> This helps you set up an expiry for the points, e.g., points expire 30 days from the date of earning. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages customers to redeem points and engage in repeat purchases.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Currency:</strong> With the multi-currency feature, your customers can now enjoy the convenience of earning and redeeming points in their preferred currency, making their shopping experience even more seamless and personalized.</li>\n<li><strong>Multilingual Compatibility:</strong> The Multilingual Compatibility Add-on streamlines translating dynamic strings, such as campaign titles and descriptions, within the WooCommerce Rewards Points Plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Discount Rules Integration:</strong> This add-on combines the power of the WooCommerce Rewards Plugin and the Discount Rules plugin to offer instant discounts for your VIP customers based on their levels/tiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Judge Me Product Reviews:</strong> You can use this add-on to incentivize customers by offering Points/Rewards for submitting reviews through the Judge.me plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>VIDEO TUTORIALS</h3>\n<p>Explore our <a href=\"https://wployalty.net/video-tutorials/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video Tutorials Library</a> for step-by-step guides, walk-through videos, and tutorials on creating a WooCommerce Loyalty Program for your store.
