        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow do I display New Ticket Form on my WordPress page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to display New Ticket Form, you need to add [GBL_SMTCKS] on a specific page and after saving the page it should appear on it after refresh.<br />\nYou can set [GBL_SMTCKS type=clear] if you would like to use our css formatting of the new ticket form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDisplaying Tickets on front end?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the version 1.6.5 now this is possible! Simply use [GBL_SMTCKS_LIST] to display the Ticket List on the front end. do [GBL_SMTCKS_LIST type=clear] to use our css formatting to it.<br />\nBare in mind you can only list tickets on the front end but users cannot go into a ticket and/or modify them; this can only be done through the administrator panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI can&#8217;t create a new ticket?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, either through the Simple Tickets panel in the WP-admin Simple Tickets &gt; New Ticket or through the website page you pasted the [GBL_SMTCKS] to.<br />\nDon&#8217;t forget when you&#8217;re finished writing up the ticket to click the button &#8216;Create Ticket&#8217;!<br />\nIf you are trying to create a ticket through a page then don&#8217;t forget to meet the criteria.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI got a notification &#8216;Your ticket has been created.&#8217; but I can&#8217;t see my ticket\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can if you are the website administrator. It is in Simple Tickets &gt; Ticket List.<br />\nIf you are not an administrator then you can&#8217;t see your ticket but if the website asks you for your email then the administrator might contact you through it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI&#8217;m in a ticket, what can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in a ticket, you can go back to the ticket list by clicking &#8216;Back to Ticket List&#8217; or go to the previous ticket by clicking &#8216;Previous Ticket&#8217; button (if displayed at the top) or you can go to the next ticket if button &#8216;Next Ticket&#8217; is displayed at the top.<br />\nAfter the buttons you will get a Settings Panel on the left which allows you (administrator) to edit all the user settings give like their email, name etc. You can update these by clicking Update Settings.<br />\nIf you want to comment on the ticket you can click in the &#8216;Your new comment here&#8217; area an type in your comment. After you have finished typing it in then you can click &#8216;Create Comment&#8217; button in order to create the comment.<br />\nIf you want to edit a ticket then you can click on the Edit button next to #1 | Date by user. or if you want to delete the ticket you can click delete button which is next to Edit or if you want to move this ticket into a different category you can click move which is next to delete.<br />\nDon&#8217;t forget that Edit | Delete and Move. On top of this, the move feature is only available if you are registered with us.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nOkay, I know how to edit a ticket but, how do I edit a comment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Same applies to comments as to ticket but the delete button doesnt delete the ticket now, it deletes the specified comment.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI get an error saying &#8216;This ticket does not exist.&#8217; when I try to view a ticket\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are getting this error it either means that the ticket doesn&#8217;t exist or one of the ticket files is corrupted. To find out more contact us through http://simple-tickets.com/contact/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I change the time the user has to wait after creating a ticket in order to create the next one?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to go into Simple Tickets &gt; Settings and at the top you will get &#8216;Time the user has to wait after creating a ticket in order to create the next one:&#8217; and the value will be set to 5 minutes by default, you can change this and click Save and it will save.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I change the minimum amount of characfters for a new ticket details?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Same as to one above, 25 is set by default.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Label stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Label stands for the display name of the field, so if you change Your name to e.g. &#8216;How old are you?&#8217; this will get displayed in new ticket form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Placeholder stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>same as Label but this is the text displayed in the input field next to the Label if the field is empty. It disappears if the user types something in it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Type stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Similar to label and placeholder but this determines what input type this field has. E.g. say you want the user to just input numbers, you would select number and the user would be limited to just using numbers.<br />\nPlaceholder does not work for the Type: &#8216;select&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Enabled stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Enabled specifies if this field is enabled or disabled. If it is set to Yes then this field will be displayed in new ticket form (if not hidden) and in ticket settings when viewing a ticket.<br />\nIf it is set to No then it will not be displayed anywhere. Bare in mind that it can be switched back on later.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Required stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If Required is set to Yes then when a user (outside of admin panel) tries to create a  ticket, they will get a little red star next to the required field. Furthermore this field will be validated so if it is empty, the user will get an error and will have to input something into this field if they want to create a ticket.<br />\nIf Required is set to No the user can input data into it but they do not have to so if it is left out blank and click Create Ticket it will be created.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is the &#8216;Hidden&#8217; in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If Hidden is set to Yes then the user (outside of admin panel) will not see this field altho it might be required, they will not see it and cannot input data into it. When the user creates a ticket then the admin set this field to whatever he or she wants through the admin panel when editing  their ticket.<br />\nHowever, if you are creating a ticket through the admin panel then you will see these hidden fields as you are the admin so you see everything.<br />\nIf Hidden is set to No then the user (outside of admin panel) will see this field and if it is required they need to fill it in but if it is disabled they won&#8217;t see it. Neither will you unless you switch it back on.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Display in Ticket List stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If Display in Ticket List is set to Yes then when you view the Ticket List this field will be in one of the headers and you can sort all your tickets with this field if you click on it in the header (blue). If this field is Disabled then this won&#8217;t have any affect.<br />\nIf Display in Ticket List is set to No then this field won&#8217;t be displayed in the Ticket List.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does Select Options (Only applies to Type: select) stand for in Advanced Features Simple Tickets &gt; Settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This stands for the select options the user can choose from. Of course if the Type of this field is set to &#8216;select&#8217;.<br />\nYour select options have to be separated by commas (,) on order to split the select options.<br />\nThis field does not work with any other Type so if you are trying to get select options working Type has to be set to select.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI have changed one of my fields but it doesn&#8217;t save\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It will save if you click on the Save button on the right. Don&#8217;t forget that this Save button saves only your field that is on the line with the button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I edit the tickets content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to go into the ticket you want to edit, click Edit Ticket (it is by the Ticket Details on the right) and edit what you want click Update and done.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I edit a comment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Same as to Edit Ticket but it says Edit Comment.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I delete a ticket?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click Delete Ticket next to Edit Ticket | Move Ticket</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I delete a comment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click Delete Comment next to Edit Comment | Move Comment</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy does my Move Comment shows Simple Tickets logo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because this feature is not available yet.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I disable automatic sending emails if someone creates a ticket?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into settings change &#8216;Send E-mail to website administrator if someone creates a ticket?&#8217; to No and click Save</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I disable automatic sending emails if someone creates a comment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into settings change &#8216;Send E-mail to website administrator if someone creates a comment in a ticket?&#8217; to No and click Save</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I disable automatic sending emails if someone changes ticket settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into settings change &#8216;Send E-mail to website administrator if someone updates a ticket settings?&#8217; to No and click Save</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I change Auto Save Backups off and how do they work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into Admin &gt; General Settings and set Auto Save Backups to off.<br />\nThis feature creates backup files of your database whenever there is a change (e.g. Updating or commenting on a ticket).<br />\nThe backup files are called  e.g. .BK00001 and the maximum number of backups per file is limited to 10,000 so do not<br />\nforget to delete the backups or archive them in order to maintain the Database size.<br />\nin future updates we will automate this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I disable the output from scripts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into Admin &gt; General Settings and set Display output from scripts to off.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I switch Dashboard off?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into Admin &gt; General Settings and set Switch Globel Dashboard On or Off to off.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I change Advanced Features on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go into Admin &gt; General Settings and set Advanced Features On/Off to on.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhen I change my General Settings the settings don&#8217;t save\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure after any change you do to click Save Settings button as otherwise your settings won&#8217;t save.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I delete a ticket through the Ticket List directly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you wan&#8217;t to delete a ticket directly through the Ticket list, you will see a column on the right saying &#8216;Options&#8217; and it will contain<br />\nin line with the ticket an &#8216;X&#8217; with red background. IF you click the &#8216;X&#8217; the ticket will be deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I change the colour of the tickets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you need advanced settings switched on in settings<br />\nthen you need to go into Simple Tickets &gt; Settings<br />\nif a field named &#8216;Status&#8217; doesn&#8217;t exist, rename one field to it and save<br />\nif the Type is not &#8216;select&#8217;, change it to select and add some options<br />\nsave and then you should see Ticket List Colour &#8221;: your colour goes here<br />\nthen save it and in Ticket List if a ticket has this field set to your desired option<br />\nthen the colour will be set to the colour you have set in the Settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhere do I edit the CSS  styling for the shortcodes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The CSS file responsible for the styling of [GBL_SMTCKS type=clear] is in Plugin Directory &gt; Extension &gt; simple-tickets &gt; simple-tickets.css &amp; shortcode.css</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I create a sticky ticket?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you need to create your ticket then you need to go to that ticket through the ticket list and change &#8216;Sticky Ticket?&#8217; from &#8216;No&#8217; to &#8216;Yes&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I change the default Settings of the Control Options on Ticket List?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You go into the Settings tab on the left menu and in &#8216;Ticket List Control Settings&#8217; you choose the default settings you want to be used.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
