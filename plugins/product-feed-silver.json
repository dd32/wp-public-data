        "faq": "\n<h4>Q: With which shopping plugin is Murphsy.com Product Feed Silver usable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: We have developed the plugin for use with Woocommerce. We have tested it only on Woocommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Will this work with other shopping plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Probably not.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: My feed isn&#8217;t updating according to the interval, what&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Product Feed Silver uses WP_cron to schedule the update of your product feed. WP_cron only triggers if someone visits your website. So if you aren&#8217;t receiving enough visitors the product feed might not update when expected.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
