Also, if you choose to &#8220;Discard multiple entries, but allow the entrant a single entry&#8221; the plugin has to do an additional database query to get your results, which takes more time. Be patient and your results will be returned as soon as possible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20isn%27t%20random%21%20i%20ran%20the%20plugin%20twice%20in%20a%20row%20and%20got%20the%20same%20winner.'>\nThis isn&#8217;t random! I ran the plugin twice in a row and got the same winner.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It may seem counterintuitive, but if you re-run the plugin on the same post and occasionally get the same winner, this proves that the plugin actually is random. For example, if you roll a dice several times you will eventually get the same number twice in a row. The same thing happens with the plugin. However, if you run the plugin several times in a row and keep getting the same winner, that could indicate a problem.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%20i%20only%20run%20this%20plugin%20on%20the%20100%20most%20recent%20posts%3F'>\nWhy can I only run this plugin on the 100 most recent posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is done to reduce strain on the server and avoid problems that occurred when people had more than a thousand posts. Most giveaways should be done by the time you&#8217;ve posted 100 more posts, so this shouldn&#8217;t cause problems for most people.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20is%20awesome%21%20can%20i%20send%20you%20money%3F'>\nThis is awesome!
