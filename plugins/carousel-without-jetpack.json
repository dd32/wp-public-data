Because the goal is to transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience, I think that comments are necessary. This is why I will NOT be adding an option to turn the comments off.</p>\n<p>However, if you want to turn off comments on Media attachments, you can follow this tutorial:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-disable-comments-on-wordpress-media-attachments/\" title=\"How to Disable Comments on WordPress Media Attachments\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Disable Comments on WordPress Media Attachments</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
