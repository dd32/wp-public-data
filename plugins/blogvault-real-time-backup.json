We use encrypted cloud backups and off-site BlogVault servers to store your site backups and run security operations. This ensures seamless integration of security to your website without affecting your site servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20have%20all%20backups%20sync%20to%20my%20google%20drive%20and%20not%20dropbox%3F'>\nCan I have all backups sync to my Google Drive and not Dropbox?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We do not automatically sync your backups to Dropbox. However, we do provide an interface that can help enable you to move your backup to Dropbox. You can also download your Backups to your computer and then upload them on Google Drive.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20blogvault%20be%20used%20for%20woocommerce%20store%20websites%3F'>\nCan BlogVault be used for WooCommerce store websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, BlogVault integrates well with WooCommerce websites with the special inbuilt Real-Time backups functionality. Please see <strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RKNfrR\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce backups page</a></strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20blogvault%20backup%20from%20a%20woocommerce%20site%3F'>\nWhat does BlogVault backup from a WooCommerce site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>BlogVault backups files and tables, database metadata like database name, location, all content, settings, and configuration.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20restore%20woocommerce%20store%20backup%20using%20blogvault%3F'>\nCan I restore WooCommerce store backup using BlogVault?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Restoring a backup using BlogVault is easy.

You can do this by making use of our integrated Migration feature where you can choose the backup version that you want to migrate to a new server or new site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20staging%20site%20located%3F'>\nWhere is the staging site located?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your staging site will be on BlogVault servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20is%20my%20staging%20valid%3F'>\nHow long is my staging valid?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With the BlogVault backup service, you can extend your staging site validity up to 56 days.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20do%20after%20staging%20a%20site%3F'>\nWhat do I do after Staging a site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you are satisfied with your staging site, BlogVault Backup Service allows you can push the changes you like, onto your actual live site, directly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20receive%20emails%20from%20the%20staging%20environment%3F'>\nWill I receive emails from the staging environment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, we do not have a mailing system at the Staging server. Many sites have automated emails set up on their sites. On staging environments, they do not want these to be triggered. The staging environment does not have protection for spam emails. Blocking all emails ensures that the staging server IP is not blacklisted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20merge%20the%20woocommerce%20website%20staging%20site%20to%20the%20live%20site%3F'>\nCan I merge the WooCommerce website staging site to the live site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you move them from the staging site to the live site, all your new orders will be lost on the live site.

Please don’t forget to backup your website before you start merging.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20blogvault%20backup%20work%20with%20all%20web%20hosts%3F'>\nDoes BlogVault backup work with all web hosts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We’ve built BlogVault to work with any web host in the world. You just need to provide FTP credentials for the destination server. We migrate your WordPress site, whether you are:</p>\n<p>Migrating to or from GoDaddy, BlueHost, SiteGround, HostGator, WPEngine, Flywheel, etc. OR Migrating to any other web host (in this case you’ll have to select either the cPanel or FTP options).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20there%20be%20downtime%20during%20migration%3F'>\nWill there be downtime during migration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, BlogVault Backup Service will cause no downtime to the destination server while migration.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20blogvault%20start%20backing%20up%20the%20new%20site%20after%20migration%3F'>\nWill BlogVault start backing up the new site after migration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, BlogVault will backup a site following DNS resolution. If you migrated the site to a different URL, make sure the new URL is added as a site with BlogVault to enable backup. If the migration were to the same URL at a different host, BlogVault would automatically start doing a backup from the new location as soon as the DNS is updated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20update%20wordpress%20core%2C%20plugins%2C%20and%20themes%20directly%3F'>\nCan I update WordPress core, plugins, and themes directly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Take a look at this <strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ROA9du\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Manage Site help doc</a></strong>. Before updating on the live site, we’d suggest you update on a staging site.

As for web hosts, if your site is not on wordpress.com, then you have a reason to worry. Servers, while generally robust, do fail from time to time for various reasons. Moreover, web hosting providers usually do not provide complete backups. When such backups are restored, sites crash, and data is lost. Several such horror stories inspired us to build this service!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20really%20need%20blogvault%3F'>\nDo I really need BlogVault?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>BlogVault provides comprehensive and complete backup services.
