        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20a%20backup%20%26%20staging%20website%3F'>\nWhy should I use a Backup &amp; Staging Website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin updates and theme customizations should be tested on a staging / backup platform before applying them on the production website.<br />\nUsually, it&#8217;s recommended having the staging / backup platform on an identical server like the production server. You can only catch all possible errors during testing with the same hardware and software environment for your test &amp; backup website.</p>\n<p>So, before you update a plugin or install a new one, it is highly recommended to check out the modifications on a clone / backup of your production website.<br />\nThat ensures that any modifications work on your production website without throwing unexpected errors or preventing your site from loading, better known as the &#8220;WordPress blank page error.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Testing a plugin update before installing it in a production environment isn&#8217;t done very often by most users because existing staging solutions are too complex and need a lot of time to create a<br />\nan up-to-date copy of your website.</p>\n<p>You could be afraid of installing plugins updates because you follow &#8220;never touch a running system.&#8221; You know that untested updates increase the risk of breaking your site.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s is one of the main reasons WordPress installations are often outdated, not updated at all, and insecure because of this non-update behavior.</p>\n<p><strong> It&#8217;s time to change this, so there is no easier way than using &#8220;WP STAGING&#8221; for backup, cloning, and migration of your WordPress website.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20install%20and%20set%20up%20a%20staging%20site%20%2F%20site%20backup%3F'>\nHow to install and set up a staging site / site backup?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install WP STAGING backup via the admin dashboard. Go to &#8216;Plugins&#8217;, click &#8216;Add New&#8217; and search the plugins for &#8216;WP STAGING&#8217;. Install the plugin with &#8216;Install Now&#8217;.<br />\nAfter installation, go to WP STAGING &gt; Staging Sites and create your first staging / backup site</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20staging%20a%20backup%20plugin%3F'>\nIs WP STAGING a backup plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely! WP STAGING started as a staging tool but evolved to a full fledged wordpress backup plugin. Even the free version can be used for backup purposes and comes with automatic backup background processing.<br />\nThe pro version delivers you few more backup features like uploading a backup to cloud backup file storage providers like google drive, (s)FTP, dropbox, Wasabi, DigitalOcean or Amazon S3 but even the free version allows you to restore the backup files in case something happens to your production site. There are many other backup plugins out there but WP STAGING&#8217;s goal is to bring the reliability and performance of business and enterprise level quality assurance to a WordPress backup plugin to a new level.</p>\n<p>We are offering a basic but still powerful backup feature free of charge for all users. If you want more, WP STAGING PRO will provide a full-fledged premium backup solution with enterprise code quality affordable for everyone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf9C9Pgu7Bs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video: How we run automated tests on WP STAGING</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20wp%20staging%20backup%20and%20other%20backup%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between WP STAGING backup and other backup plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note: WP STAGING | PRO provides more advanced backup functionality compared to other backup plugins. The speed and Performance of WP STAGING&#8217;s backup feature often exceed even the most prominent and most well-established backup plugins.</p>\n<p>We are now adding more advanced backup features to deliver what other existing backup plugins are still missing.</p>\n<p>You may have heard about other popular backup plugins like All in one Migration, BackWPUp, BackupWordPress, Simple Backup, WordPress Backup to Dropbox, or similar WordPress backup plugins and now wonder about the difference between WP STAGING and those backup tools.</p>\n<p>Other backup plugins usually create a backup of your WordPress filesystem and a database backup that you can use to restore your website if it becomes corrupted or you want to go back in time to a previous state.</p>\n<p>The backup files are compressed and can not be executed directly. WP STAGING, on the other hand, creates a full backup of the whole file system and the database in a working state that you can open like your original production website.</p>\n<p>Even though WP STAGING&#8217;s basic has been started as pure staging plugin it now comes with powerful backup features. So it shifted from being mainly a staging plugin to a staging and backup plugin that can be used to restore a backup and bring back you website to a previous state<br />\nIf you go with the WP STAGING | PRO version, you will get the same backup functionality of other backup plugins but at a much higher tested level and performance.</p>\n<p>Note, that some free backup plugins are not able to support custom tables. (For instance, the free version of Updraft plus backup plugin). In that case, your backup plugin is not able to create a backup of your staging site when it is executed on the production site.<br />\nThe reason is that the tables created by WP STAGING are custom tables beginning with another table prefix.<br />\nTo bypass this limitation and to be able to create a backup of your staging site, you can use any backup plugin or the WP STAGING backup plugin on the staging site and create the backup from that site. That works well even with every other WordPress backup plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20a%20backup%20plugin%20at%20all%3F'>\nWhy do I need a Backup plugin at all?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Consistent website backups are the foundation of a robust disaster recovery strategy. For mission-critical websites,<br />\nfrequent backups safeguard against data loss from hardware failures, software malfunctions, or even ransomware attacks.<br />\nBy creating backups of website files, databases, and configurations at regular intervals, You can ensure a swift<br />\nrestoration process, minimizing downtime and potential revenue loss.<br />\nBackups should encompass all essential data, including website code, content management system files,<br />\nuser data stored in databases, and website configurations. Utilizing a combination of full backups and incremental<br />\nbackups optimizes storage efficiency while capturing the latest website updates.<br />\nFurthermore, employing automated backup solutions streamlines the process, eliminating human error<br />\nand ensuring consistent data protection.<br />\nBy prioritizing website backups, You demonstrate a commitment to data security and business continuity.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20backup%20my%20local%20website%20and%20copy%20it%20to%20production%20and%20another%20host'>\nI want to backup my local website and copy it to production and another host\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to migrate your local website to an already existing production site, you can use our pro version <a href=\"https://wp-staging.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP STAGING | PRO</a>.<br />\nWP STAGING is intended to create a staging site with the latest data from your production site or create a backup of it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20benefits%20compared%20to%20a%20migration%20and%20backup%20plugin%20like%20duplicator%3F'>\nWhat are the benefits compared to a migration and backup plugin like Duplicator?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We like the Duplicator plugin. Even though Duplicator is not as fast as WP STAGING for creating a backup,  it&#8217;s still is a great tool for migrating from a development site to production one or from production site to development one. Overall it&#8217;s a good tool to create a backup of your WordPress website.<br />\nThe downside is that before you can even create an export or backup file with Duplicator, a lot of adjustments, manual interventions, and requirements are needed before you can start the backup process.<br />\nThe backup plugin Duplicator also needs some skills to be able to create a backup and development/staging site. In contrast, WP STAGING does not need more than a click from you to create a backup or staging site.</p>\n<p>If you have created a local or web-hosted development site and you need to migrate that site the first time to your production domain, you do nothing wrong by using<br />\nthe Duplicator plugin! If you need all your latest production data like posts, updated plugins, theme data, and styles in a testing environment or want to create a quick backup before testing out something, then we recommend using WP STAGING instead!</p>\n<p>If speed, performance, and code quality are a matter for you as well, give WP STAGING a try.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%20not%20log%20in%20to%20the%20staging%20%2F%20backup%20site'>\nI can not log in to the staging / backup site\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using a security plugin like Wordfence, iThemes Security, All In One WP Security &amp; Firewall, or a plugin that hides the WordPress default login URL, make sure that you have installed the latest version of WP STAGING to access your cloned backup site.<br />\nSuppose you can still not log in to your staging / backup site. In that case, you can go to WP STAGING &gt; settings and disable there the WP STAGING extra authentication. Your admin dashboard will still be protected and not accessible to public users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20activate%20permalinks%20on%20the%20staging%20%2F%20backup%20site%3F'>\nCan I activate permalinks on the staging / backup site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Permalinks are disabled on the staging / backup site after first time cloning / backup creation<br />\n<a href=\"https://wp-staging.com/docs/activate-permalinks-staging-site/\" title=\"activate permalinks on staging site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read here</a> how to activate permalinks on the staging site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20a%20backup%20file%20to%20migrate%20wordpress%20backup%20to%20another%20host%20or%20domain'>\nHow to use a Backup file to Migrate WordPress Backup to another Host or Domain\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The pro version of WP STAGING can backup your whole WordPress website.<br />\nWith the pro backup function, you can backup and copy your entire WordPress website to another domain, new host, or new server very easily, and often faster and more reliable than with any other existing backup plugins.<br />\nHave a look at [https://wp-staging.com/docs/how-to-migrate-your-wordpress-site-to-a-new-host/](this article), that introduces the backup feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20translation%20of%20wp%20staging%20in%20my%20language%3F'>\nIs There a Translation of WP STAGING in my Language?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have translated WP STAGING into five languages nearly completely:</p>\n<p>English: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP STAGING Backup &amp; Duplicator WordPress Plugin.
