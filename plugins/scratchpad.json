The instruction said : &#039; Stable tag should indicate the Subversion &quot;tag&quot; of the latest stable version, or &quot;trunk,&quot; if you use <code>/trunk/</code> for\nstable. &#039; Should this be 1.0?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More instructions we don&#039;t understand: Note that the <code>readme.txt</code> of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so if the <code>/trunk/readme.txt</code> file says that the stable tag is <code>4.3</code>, then it is <code>/tags/4.3/readme.txt</code> that&#039;ll be used\nfor displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk <code>readme.txt</code> is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk <code>readme.txt</code> to reflect changes in your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version\nthat lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk&#039;s <code>readme.txt</code> points to the correct stable tag.</p>\n\n<p>If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify &quot;trunk&quot; if that&#039;s where\nyou put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.\n[c]Should we add a &quot;&quot;Where can I report a bug&quot; section and what&#039;s the best way to do that ?</p>"
