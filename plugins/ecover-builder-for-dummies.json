        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin adds a new menu entry to the wordpress admin panel to create, edit or delete ecovers.</p>\n<p>To create a new ecover go to the ecover post type admin page. There you select a mockup and another image to cover part of the mockup. The user can use one of the provided mockups in the plugin or upload a new one from the media gallery. Adjust the positions of the images and drag the corners of the cover to the right positions to provide the right feeling of perspective. Once you are done save the ecover. Now you can use the ID of the ecover in the shortcode to show in any other page. For example, if the post type Ecover ID is 4, then use this shortcode to show the ecover:<br />\n    [ecover id=&#8221;4]</p>\n</p>\n\n"
