        "description": "<p><strong>MxChat</strong> is a versatile <strong>AI chatbot plugin</strong> that brings the power of <strong>OpenAI&#8217;s GPT models</strong> directly into your <strong>WordPress site</strong>. This plugin enables you to create an <strong>intelligent chatbot</strong> that can interact with users, answer questions, and provide assistance in real-time, all while being fully customizable to match your website&#8217;s design and functionality.</p>\n<h3>Personalize the AI Chatbot with Custom Knowledge:</h3>\n<p>One of the standout features of <strong>MxChat</strong> is the ability to fine-tune the AI’s responses by adding <strong>personalized content</strong> directly through the WordPress admin dashboard. This is achieved through <strong>vector embeddings</strong>, a powerful technique that allows the AI to reference specific information you provide.</p>\n<p>Whether you want the chatbot to answer questions based on your company’s unique services, products, or content, you can easily submit this information manually or via your website&#8217;s sitemap. By submitting custom knowledge, you guide the AI to understand and prioritize the most relevant data, ensuring that the responses are not only accurate but also highly contextual to your business or website.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manual Content Submission</strong>: Within the WordPress admin, you can manually add specific articles, FAQs, or any text that you want the AI to use as a reference. The plugin processes this content using vector embeddings, enhancing the chatbot&#8217;s ability to deliver precise, context-aware answers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sitemap Submission</strong>: By submitting your website&#8217;s sitemap, MxChat automatically extracts and adds content from the URLs listed in the sitemap into the chatbot&#8217;s knowledge base. This seamless integration ensures that the AI is well-informed about the entire content of your site, improving the overall user experience.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New in Version 1.0.8:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved WooCommerce Order Handling</strong>: The chatbot now supports more robust order management, allowing it to retrieve and discuss order history more accurately across multiple orders. This update ensures that even if a user has more than one order, the AI can handle inquiries more efficiently and provide detailed information.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Embedding Error Detection</strong>: A new error detection mechanism has been implemented, providing more precise error messaging when embedding content fails, ensuring easier troubleshooting and submission retries.</li>\n<li><strong>Chat Transcript Enhancements</strong>: Improved chat transcripts now display order-related queries and responses in a more structured format, making it easier to review customer interactions and order details.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Optimizations and Bug Fixes</strong>: General improvements to performance and bug fixes to ensure smoother operation across different platforms and configurations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integrate OpenAI API</strong>: Use your own OpenAI API key to leverage the power of AI-driven responses on your WordPress site.</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Chatbot Settings</strong>: Tailor the chatbot&#8217;s behavior, including the AI model, introductory message, and more, to fit your specific needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge Base Integration</strong>: Submit custom knowledge content using vector embeddings, allowing the chatbot to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.</li>\n<li><strong>Sitemap Submission</strong>: Automatically extract and add content from your website’s sitemap to the chatbot’s knowledge base, enhancing its ability to deliver precise answers.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce Integration</strong>: Directly integrate WooCommerce products into your chatbot for a seamless shopping experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Chat Transcripts</strong>: Review and analyze chat transcripts directly from your WordPress dashboard. This feature allows you to monitor conversations, identify frequently asked questions, and further align and tune your AI chatbot based on real user interactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Integration</strong>: Add the chatbot to any page using a shortcode or automatically append it to the body element of your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Pro Version with Advanced Features</strong>: Upgrade to the Pro version to unlock advanced features like Theme Customization, Rate Limit Settings, and WooCommerce Integration, allowing you to fully control the chatbot&#8217;s appearance and functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Choose MxChat?</h3>\n<p>MxChat is not just another chatbot plugin; it&#8217;s a comprehensive tool that transforms how your website interacts with users. Whether you&#8217;re using <strong>WordPress</strong> as a <strong>page builder</strong> or a <strong>website builder</strong>, this plugin seamlessly integrates into your workflow, offering a powerful AI assistant that can improve user engagement and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>This plugin is designed with both simplicity and flexibility in mind, making it ideal for website owners, developers, and agencies looking to enhance their WordPress sites with cutting-edge AI technology.</p>\n<h3>Use of Third-Party Services:</h3>\n<p>This plugin requires an active connection to the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> to generate AI-driven responses. By using this plugin, you consent to sending data to OpenAI&#8217;s servers, which may include user queries and other relevant information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Service Provider</strong>: <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI</a></li>\n<li><strong>Terms of Use</strong>: <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI API Terms</a></li>\n<li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please ensure compliance with OpenAI’s terms and any applicable data privacy laws.</p>\n<h3>License &amp; Warranty</h3>\n<p>This plugin is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This plugin is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
