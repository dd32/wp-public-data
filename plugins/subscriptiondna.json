        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20subscription%20dna%26reg%3B%20pci%20compliant%3F'>\nIs Subscription DNA&reg; PCI Compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We maintain passing PCI Compliance, and scans and extended server hardening.  Each Subscription DNA client owns their own account data. Your subscriber&#8217;s sensitive information is encrypted and secure and we do not store any credit card data whatsoever.  We use secure tokenization through connections to your payment gateway.  Our administrative portal is protected through SSL by encrypted password and optional CAPTCHA security code. Authenticated clients can export and download various member and reporting data at any time. Subscription DNA&reg; will NEVER intentionally share or misuse client data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20subscription%20dna%26reg%3B%20allow%20subscribers%20to%20update%20their%20profile%3F'>\nCan Subscription DNA&reg; allow subscribers to update their profile?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We include a ready-to-go subscriber portal where users can manage their profile, view transaction history, update their payment information, manage their subscriptions, etc. Alternatively, you can completely brand/customize a member portal in your template to transparently work with your site using advanced web services integration.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20key%20factors%20in%20how%20much%20we%27ll%20spend%20on%20subscription%20dna%26reg%3B%3F'>\nWhat are the key factors in how much we&#8217;ll spend on Subscription DNA&reg;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We cater to many business models and therefore offer a couple of intelligently formulated pricing methods. We offer a hybrid model of flat fee and per transaction fees, as well as a per user model. We are flexible and may be open to work with you to find a mutually agreeable cost. We are looking for long-term relationships and grow as you grow.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20simple%20or%20complex%20is%20the%20integration%20of%20your%20service%3F%20how%20long%20does%20it%20normally%20take%3F'>\nHow simple or complex is the integration of your service? How long does it normally take?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Integration can be as simple or complex as you need it to be &#8211; meaning, as you further customize your subscriber&#8217;s experience, more programming integration time and skills may be required. A simple integration which requires basic experience can take as little as 3-5 days. More complex integration will take longer, perhaps weeks as you wish to build a complete custom interface using our flexible API. We admit we&#8217;ve have had very successful clients with large subscriber bases that have taken 3-5 months to fully integrate and test before deploying &#8211; a testament to the power of our platform.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20a%20subscription%20dna%26reg%3B%20client%20request%20customizations%20or%20integration%20help%3F'>\nCan a Subscription DNA&reg; client request customizations or integration help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
