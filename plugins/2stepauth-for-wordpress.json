        "installation": "<p>How to get it working:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>2StepAuth</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to Settings-&gt;2StepAuth.</li>\n<li>Complete the 3 Steps (Enter Email, validate Phone and Generate Backup Codes) and 2StepAuth is ready to protect your blog.</li>\n<li>The next time you login to your Admin panel, you will find 2nd level of Authentication enabled.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>How does 2StepAuth increase security of my blog?</h4>\n<p>2StepAuth adds second level of Authentication (a.k.a 2nd layer of security) which helps in preventing unauthorized access to your blog Admin panel. The hacker, inorder to gain access to your blog admin panel, has to complete 2nd level of Authentication by using one of the 3 methods: SMS Verification, Email Verification or Backup codes. Thus, even if your password is compromised, the WordPress blog is safe.</p>\n<h4>What are the basic requirements for working of 2StepAuth?</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>WordPress (so obvious!!!) </li>\n<li>TextMagic or SMSGlobal account (in case of non-Indian bloggers). This requirement is optional.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>What if I dont have TextMagic or SMSGlobal Account?</h4>\n<p>If you dont have TextMagic or SMSGlobal account, SMS Verification feature won&#8217;t be enabled. The plugin will work with Backup Codes and Email Verification feature.</p>\n<h4>I have completed Step 2. Why 2StepAuth is not working?</h4>\n<p>2StepAuth depends mainly on completion of Step 3. So, you have to complete Step 3 for working of 2StepAuth.</p>\n<h4>I am unable to complete Step 2. What should I do?</h4>\n<p>You can skip it and proceed to Step 3. Make sure you generate and save Backup Codes from Step 3.</p>\n<h4>What type of users are supported?</h4>\n<p>2StepAuth supports users with &#8216;Administrator&#8217; privilege. Other users won&#8217;t feel the presence of 2StepAuth and they will be redirected to Dashboard on correct login.</p>\n<h4>Does 2StepAuth supports multiple users(Administrators)?</h4>\n<p>Yes, 2StepAuth recognizes different Administrators and supports blogs with multiple Admins.</p>\n"
