The data received from Eniro can be supplemented with your own<br />\ninformation fields and categorization to customize your own company directory.</p>\n<p>This greatly reduces the effort needed for registering companies, geocoding their locations and keeping the information up to date.</p>\n<p>Basic templates to browse and present your company directory is included, with the<br />\ncompany locations displayed on a map (Eniromap or Googlemap depending on the preferred choice).</p>\n<p>Eniro api key and profile is needed to make all this magic work!</p>\n<p>Pls register for your own eniro api key here:<br />\nhttp://api.eniro.com/</p>\n",

You need to provide a link to the enrico archive pages:<br />\n                e.g. if you creare a partner typ called &#8220;Clients&#8221; &#8211; the slug will be &#8220;clients&#8221;,<br />\n                when you have registered some company entries (in the Enrico Directory) and assigned them to<br />\n                the partner type clients- you can then visit the page &#8220;YOUR URL/partners/clients&#8221; to see your clients archive.<br />\n                It s recommended that you create a link on your blog page (e.g. in the Menu bar) which will take you to the Clients archive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The plugin uses the following Templates (located in the plugins template folder):<br />\n         archive-enrico.php (to display the full archive under YOUR URL/enrico/)<br />\n         single-enrico.php (to display a singel enrico company post)<br />\n         taxonomy-partner_type.php (to display taxonomy archive URL/YOUR CATEGORYSLUG/YOUR CATEGORYTERM)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will most probably want to customize the 3 templates above to fit the design of your blog.<br />\nTo do this it&#8217;s recommended that you copy the templates to you themeroot (keep their names!)- and custimize the copies- so you can refresh the plugin without ovewriting your customizations!<br />\nThe plugin will try to find the said templates in your themeroot first- before using the ones in the plugin theme folder.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
