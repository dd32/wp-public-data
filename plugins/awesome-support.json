        "": "<p>The version 4.x.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 3.x.x.  It is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage/test environment before applying it to your production site.\nAt the very least you should back-up your site before applying this update!</p>\n\n<p>After upgrading please make sure you install the latest version of add-ons as well - especially the Email Support add-on (Version 5.0.x) and Gravity Forms.</p>\n\n<p>Automatic upgrades to 4.0.0 are only supported from version 3.3.4. If you are running an earlier version in the 3.x line please make sure you upgrade to 3.3.4 FIRST, verify that all your settings are intact and then install version 4.\nUpgrades from the version 2.x and 1.x lines are NOT supported at all.</p>\n\n<p>After upgrading you might notice that menu options under TICKETS are missing or the tabs inside your TICKETS-&gt;SETTINGS screen are missing.  If so, please try any or all of the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1. Go to TICKETS-&amp;gt;TOOLS-&amp;gt;CLEANUP and find the upgrade button and click that to re-run the upgrade.  This will add required WordPress security capabilities back to the system.\n2. Go to your TICKETS-&amp;gt;SETTINGS screen and click the SAVE button.  This adds the default settings that are new for version 4.0 to your installation.\n3. Deactivate the add-on and re-activate it.  This triggers some housekeeping tasks.\n</code></pre>"
