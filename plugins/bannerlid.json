        "faq": "\n<h4>What is flash support like?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basic flash support is provided. The plugin can show flash banners and hyperlinks can be used on them, however this requires some CSS and has not been tested on older browsers. Also, flash can cause speed/stability issues.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin have banner fade/transitions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, I have kept the plugin as basic as possible so that the user can add his own transitions / slides or whatever by using one of the libraries already out there. The banners are wrapped in divs with classes so you should be able to apply jquery to them easily.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin support text/html banners</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this one and it&#8217;s something I might add in so users can add in html for Google Ads etc. If there are requests for this I&#8217;ll add it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What stats does it collect?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The system collects banner and zone clicks and impressions as well as the time, WP user, country, ip and date of the action.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
