Just in case the plugin gets loaded on a live site, I only want admins to see it.</p>\n<p>Q: Will you be adding new profile information or additional metrics? It seems like this is pretty basic.<br />\nA: Yes. This is just the beginning!</p>\n<p>Q: Do you offer support for the plugin?<br />\nA: Sadly, we don\\&#8217;t offer any support, but will check the plugin page from time to time and respond to messages.</p>\n<p>Q: Is this only for development?<br />\nA: While it was created primarily for development, you can use the plugin on any site. Only the logged in Admin user will see the toolbar on the frontend.</p>\n",
