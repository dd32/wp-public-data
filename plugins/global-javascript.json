        "faq": "\n<h4>What does the plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is just a simple Javascript writing/editing tool that allows the user to create some custom Javascript to their WordPress powered website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much experience do I need to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Javascript is not too difficult to pick up. There are many freely available resources online that you can find to help you get started. The site that I used to get started on Javascript is http://w3schools.com/js/default.asp</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it do anything to the database?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin allows the use of revisions and will add entries to the database in the posts table. The database is accessed using WordPress and PHP core functions and there are no direct SQL queries.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin access the filesystem?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin will save and delete files to the filesystem. The files will be located in the uploads folder under the sub-folder &#8220;global-js&#8221; on a default WordPress installation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin work in a multisite configuration?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin works in a multisite environment as it creates files and folders in the site&#8217;s own portion of the uploads directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get rid of the javascript files from the server?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, the only way to do this is to save a blank javascript file. This will delete all the relevant files from your uploads folder. There is currently no way to delete it from your database posts table through the plugin. You will have to access the database and delete it manually. You can find the posts in the data base by searching for post_title = &#8216;Global JavaScript Editor&#8217; in the posts table.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
