Once you’ve saved the page, the JSON-LD schema will be present in the HEAD of your page/post — and voila, you’re on your way to a making a great impact across rankings.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a tutorial, check out our comprehensive video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRhXbu24lsQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on YouTube here.</a>.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add JSON-LD schema easily to HEAD of any page or post</li>\n<li>Build on-page accordion FAQs </li>\n<li>Mass export to edit multiple page FAQs from a spreadsheet and reimport back in</li>\n<li>Simple copy and paste possible as editor present within a page/post</li>\n<li>Have a chance to gain more visibility on Google’s search result pages</li>\n<li>Secure and sanitised</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Using the plugin</h3>\n<p>Just to insert JSON-LD in a given page, go to that page/post and you’ll find new fields at the bottom the editor in the WP backend.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to also display your Questions and Answers via a FAQ, use the shortcode. Title defines the heading above the FAQs. If you’d like to use an accordion, add accordion=1 as in the example. Remove that part not to use an accordion and just show all FAQs open (ie. [wp-faq-schema title=”Car FAQs” accordion=1] )</p>\n<p>If you’d like to mass edit, use the Export section to export all of the pages and posts with their ids – and then edit the file and import it back. Note: For multiple FAQs for same post add more row at CSV file with same ID and title.</p>\n<p>Add the shortcode inside of the page or post content to display the FAQ. The shortcode tag is wp-faq-schema. It will take title and accordion attributes.</p>\n<h3>Example below:</h3>\n<p>[wp-faq-schema] – This code will only show FAQs of that page or post.<br />\n[wp-faq-schema title=”Car FAQs”] – This code will show FAQs with “Car FAQs” title.<br />\n[wp-faq-schema accordion=1] – This code will show FAQs as accordion.<br />\n[wp-faq-schema title=”Car FAQs” accordion=1] – This code will show FAQs as accordion with “Car FAQs” title.</p>\n",
