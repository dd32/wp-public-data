        "description": "<p>PredictWhen is a plugin that allows WordPress blog owners to tap into the wisdom of crowds and<br />\npoll predictions from their readers as to when an event of their choosing will occur. The plugin<br />\ncalculates the average of these predictions and presents a date, or date range, when the event is<br />\nlikely to occur. It also generates a graph to chart the spread of predictions in a graphical format.</p>\n<p>Example predictions created by blog owners might be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predict when will man walk on the moon again?</li>\n<li>When will polio be eradicated?</li>\n<li>Predict when Apple will announce the iPhone 5?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How it works</h4>\n<p>PredictWhen has been built to harness the &#8216;wisdom of crowds&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Find more information on the theory and view a <a href=\"http://www.predictwhen.com/how-predictwhen-works/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">short video</a> explaining the concept.</p>\n<h4>Closing a question</h4>\n<p>Once an event has occurred, the question is closed and the actual date the event happened is entered.  The chart then<br />\nshows the actual event date alongside the estimated date based on the submitted predictions.</p>\n<p>This provides interesting data on the accuracy of the blog reader’s prediction.</p>\n<h4>Scoring</h4>\n<p>If user registration is required for a question, then closing a question will assign a score to each users prediction based<br />\non the accuracy of their guess. To display a ranking table of users scores see the Usage section.</p>\n<p>Blog owners can use the scoring functionality to incentivize their readers to make considered predictions<br />\nor to include a competition mechanic for pride or prizes.</p>\n<h4>PredictWhen Directory</h4>\n<p>The plugin has a sister website <a href=\"http://www.predictwhen.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PredictWhen.com</a> which acts as a directory of published<br />\nquestions. An option within the plugin allows you to feature your question within the directory.</p>\n<p>By listing your question on PredictWhen.com we aim to collate all the predictions powered by this plugin and give them more exposure.<br />\nWe list your question and link to the page on your blog where it is published, users must visit your blog to make their prediction.</p>\n<h4>User submitted questions</h4>\n<p>The plugin provides the ability for logged-in users to submit their own question to the administrator for consideration.</p>\n<p>Questions submitted by users are subject to approval by the blog administrator.</p>\n<p>You can invite your readers to suggest their own questions or choose not to promote this feature.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Within the WordPress admin page select &#8216;Add New Question&#8217; from the &#8216;Predict When&#8217; menu.</p>\n<p>Enter the Question you wish to present to your users. Keep your question short &amp; simple. If you need to further qualify the question do so in the main body of the post.</p>\n<p>Use the date range limits to prevent predictions before or after the specified dates.  Leave either field blank to indicate no limit.</p>\n<p>Check the &#8216;Never&#8217; option to allow users to indicate that the event will never happen.</p>\n<p>If you require users to be logged in to make a prediction check the &#8216;Login or register&#8217; box.</p>\n<h4>Shortcodes</h4>\n<p>Use the following shortcodes in a post or page.</p>\n<p><strong>Chart of predictions</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[predictwhen id=n] - Display the question referenced by the question ID `n` along with a chart of\n</code></pre>\n<p>predictions and invite users to make their own prediction.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to display a chart, but just invite predictions add the option <code>hide_chart=1</code>, e.g. <code>[predictwhen id=x hide_chart=1]</code></p>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[predictwhen id=n scoring=1] - Once a question has been closed you can display a ranking table of scores based on\n</code></pre>\n<p>the accuracy of predictions for each user. Note the option &#8216;Login or register&#8217; must be checked to calculate scores.</p>\n<p>Additional options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>show_prediction</li>\n<li>show_when</li>\n<li>limit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example to display a ranking table showing each users score, the predicted date, when the prediction was made, limited<br />\nto the top 10 scorers use the following <code>[predictwhen id=n scoring=1 show_prediction=1 show_when=1 limit=10]</code></p>\n<p><strong>User questions</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[predictwhen user_question=1] - Include this shortcode in a post to provide the ability for a user to submit a question.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Users must be logged-in to submit a question for consideration.  The administrator will receive a notification email<br />\nof a new question and has the ability to approve or reject the submission.</p>\n<h4>Known Issues</h4>\n<p>Dates beyond the year 2038 are unlikely to work due to a restriction in the Unix time format.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>To install the plugin complete the following steps</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the automatic plugin installer or unzip the zip-file and upload the content to your WordPress Plugin directory. Usually <code>/wp-content/plugins</code></li>\n<li>Activate the plugin via the Admin plugin page.</li>\n<li>Create a prediction question from the admin menu</li>\n<li>Create or edit a post/page and add the shortcode <code>[predictwhen id=1]</code></li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I display the Question and Chart ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To display the question and chart in a post use the shortcode <code>[predictwhen id=n]</code> where <code>n</code> is the ID of the question.</p>\n<p>The ID above is shown next to the list of Questions in the plugin&#8217;s admin screens.</p>\n<p>For additional shortcode options see the Usage section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my charts are not displayed ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most probable reason is a Javascript error in another plugin or theme prevent the Google Chart API functioning correcly.</p>\n<p>Check your browser&#8217;s error log for any messages that might indicate the cause. In addition deactivating other plugins or using<br />\nthe default WordPress theme can help isolate the issue. If you need to report the issue please include a link to the page<br />\nwith the chart.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the chart colors ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit the plugin&#8217;s settings page to change the colors of each of the chart bar types.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The chart is not showing the crowd prediction dates</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to calculate the expected date of an event the plugin requires at least 10 predictions.  More than 30 predictions will<br />\nincrease the accuracy of the expected event date significantly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I publish my question to the PredictWhen directory ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By publishing your question to PredictWhen.com your blog receives more exposure and a link to the post or page hosting the question.</p>\n<p>Users can only predict the date of an event on your site, PredictWhen.com acts as a directory of all published questions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What data is sent to PredictWhen.com ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only anonymized summary data is sent to the PredictWhen directory.  No usernames, email addresses or personally identifable data is sent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Additional FAQ&#8217;s</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"http://www.predictwhen.com/plugin-faqs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.predictwhen.com/plugin-faqs/</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
