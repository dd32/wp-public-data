The content share buttons will appear on any device and if your website is responsive then the social share floating bar will appear at the bottom of mobile screens.<br />\nWe don&#8217;t want to give you a plugin that works great on desktop but then you need to pay to get it to work on mobile.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
