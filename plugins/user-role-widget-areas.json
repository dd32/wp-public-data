        "faq": "\n<h4>FAQ</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Q: I dragged widgets into the User Role Widget Areas but they are not showing up on the front end. Why?</p>\n<p>A: You must make sure that you have placed the “URWA &#8211; Users By Role” widget into any existing NON-USER widget area where you want to display specific widgets based on user roles.</p>\n<p>Q: I did the step above but the User Role widgets are still not showing up.</p>\n<p>A: Make sure you have at least one widget in the widget area for the role you are logged in as. For example: If you are logged in as an administrator drag a text widget into the Users &#8211; Administrators widget area and give it a title and some placeholder content. Go back to your browser and refresh.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
