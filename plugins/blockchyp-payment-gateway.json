Visit the attached <a href=\"https://github.com/blockchyp/blockchyp-php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlockChyp PHP SDK Repository</a> to learn more about the SDK and the terms of use. The SDK uses <a href=\"https://api.blockchyp.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlockChyp Gateway Host URL</a> and <a href=\"https://test.blockchyp.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlockChyp Test Gateway Host URL</a> to properly connect to the BlockChyp Gateway for either live or test transactions.</p>\n<p>The BlockChyp WooCommerce Plugin also implements the BlockChyp Web Tokenizer to connect e-commerce payments pages to BlockChyp in a secure way that minimizes PCI Scope.  Visit the attached <a href=\"https://github.com/blockchyp/blockchyp-tokenizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BlockChyp Web Tokenizer Repository</a> to learn more about the Web Tokenizer and the terms of use.</p>\n<h3>Setup and Configuration</h3>\n<p>Once you have the plugin installed, Open up the WooCommerce Setting page and click the Payments tab.</p>\n<p>Enable BlockChyp &#8211; Credit Card and click &#8220;setup&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Copy the API credentials and tokenizing keys from your BlockChyp merchant account and click &#8220;Test Mode&#8221; if you&#8217;re using a test merchant account.</p>\n",

Click Install and Activate to initialize the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>Download the plugin source from <a href=\"https://github.com/blockchyp/blockchyp-payment-gateway\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you have the source code, run <code>composer install</code> from the plugin&#8217;s root directory in order download the plugin&#8217;s dependencies.</p>\n<p>Open up your list of installed plugins and click &#8220;Activate&#8221;.</p>\n",

In the BlockChyp Payment Gateway Settings Page, simply check the &#8220;Preauth/Capture Mode&#8221; checkbox.  Selecting this mode will issue a pre-authorization at checkout, changing the order status to &#8220;On hold&#8221;. The payment will automatically be captured on shipment assuming that the order status is changed to either &#8220;Processing&#8221; or &#8220;Completed&#8221; as part of the shipping process.  You can manually capture the payment by changing the order status to either &#8220;Processing&#8221; or &#8220;Completed&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If the &#8220;Preauth/Capture Mode&#8221; checkbox is not selected, which is default, payments will be both preauthed and captured at the same time at checkout.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
