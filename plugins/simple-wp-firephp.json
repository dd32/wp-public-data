You can do this at the server level or within your script, either by opening output buffering at the beginning of the output and closing it at the end, or by surrounding the <code>fb()</code> call with buffering statements like so:</p>\n<p>ob_start();</p>\n<p>fb(&#8220;echo some stuff to the console&#8221;);</p>\n<p>ob_end_flush();</p>\n</p>\n\n",
