Sell Membership as a WooCommerce Product</h3>\n<p>Each product can be assigned as a &#8220;Membership Product&#8221;. Customers that purchase this product in WooCommerce will be assigned a membership level in Paid Memberships Pro. Using the features of PMPro, you can restrict member access to all types of premium content, courses, and community features.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/paid-memberships-pro/\" rel=\"ugc\">Paid Memberships Pro</a> has recurring subscriptions built-in, the default WooCommerce plugin only allows products to have a one-time payment. If you must use this plugin to sell recurring memberships through WooCommerce, you will also need WooCommerce Subscriptions.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how to <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-woocommerce/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-woocommerce#membership-product\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sell memberships using PMPro and WooCommerce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-woocommerce/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-woocommerce#member-discount\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">how to set members-only pricing in WooCommerce</a> in our documentation site.</p>\n<h3>Bonus Features of the Paid Memberships Pro Integration with WooCommerce</h3>\n<h4>Members Only Products</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to offer certain products to members only, see the <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/custom-post-type-membership-access/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Post Type Membership Access Add On</a>.</p>\n<h4>Members Only Store</h4>\n<p>If your entire store is locked for members only, see this post on <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/lock-entire-ecommerce-shop-members/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Locking Your Entire eCommerce Shop for Members-Only</a>.</p>\n<h4>Catalog Mode for Non-Members</h4>\n<p>If you would like non-members the ability to see your store items but restrict them from seeing prices and ability to purchase, see this post on <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/turn-your-woocommerce-store-into-a-catalog-for-non-members/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Turn your WooCommerce Store into a Catalog for Non Members</a>.</p>\n<h3>About Paid Memberships Pro</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Paid Memberships Pro is a WordPress membership plugin</a> that puts you in control.
