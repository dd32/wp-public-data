Then, follow the steps to resolve the error.<br />\nSync Users first once you update Syncing type as desired.<br />\nOnly Delete ” WooCommerce ” account from Salesforce that was previously mentioned to sync all contacts in Single account. Deleting WooCommerce account will automatically delete Orders and related contracts. There is no need to make any changes with Guest User Account as it will remain with same functionality.<br />\nOnce you delete the ”WooCommerce” account, automatically all the Orders and Contracts linked with this account will get removed. Then, Sync Orders, it will sync all the orders in the corresponding account normally.
