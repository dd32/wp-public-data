        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20wrap%20any%20block%3F'>\nCan I wrap any block?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some blocks that require a specific parent block aren&#8217;t supported. For example, buttons inside a button group, or images within an image gallery. For these you will need to remove them from their container and position them using the column or group blocks first.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20a%20block%20and%20not%20just%20extend%20all%20blocks%3F'>\nWhy a block and not just extend all blocks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This keeps block functionality composable. This block is very lightweight and does the minimum it needs to keep track of the blocks on screen and just animate them in. I want to avoid adding bulk to the front end of the site, so this plugin will remain feature minimum.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20i%20deactivate%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat happens when I deactivate the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because the block wraps other blocks, deactivating the plugin will confuse WordPress and the editor will ask you to either re-install or attempt to recover the block as html. If you must uninstall this plugin, I recommend you drag the inner blocks out of the Animate In View block before deactivating. Open an issue on GitHub if you want to discuss this further.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
