The gateway also supports <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Subscriptions</a> to let you sell products with recurring billing and <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Pre-Orders</a>, which supports accepting payments for upcoming products as they ship or up-front but it&#8217;s important to understand that enabling tokenization in the settings will create a billing agreement ID.

You can use your native currency, or you can add multiple merchant IDs to process different currencies via different Braintree accounts. To use multi-currency, your site must use a <strong>currency switcher</strong> to adjust the order currency (may require purchase).
