        "faq": "<h4>What version of WordPress does Tiny Feedback Bar need</h4>\n<p>As a minimun Tiny Feedback Bar needs WordPress 3.3. For all minimum requirements, please read <a href=\"http://support.tinyfeedbackbar.com/minimum-requirements/minimum-requirements/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a>.</p>\n<h4>What version of jQuery does Tiny Feedback Bar need?</h4>\n<p>As a minimun Tiny Feedback Bar needs jQuery 1.7.0. For all minimum requirements, please read <a href=\"http://support.tinyfeedbackbar.com/minimum-requirements/minimum-requirements/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a>.</p>\n<h4>Right-click menu not working</h4>\n<p>Description: In some themes the right-click option (also known as Point &amp; Click) is not available.</p>\n<p>See what happened: When using Google Chrome you can click F12 to show Developer Tools. Click the Console tab and reload the page.</p>\n<p>If you see any messages like: Uncaught TypeError: Object function (a,b){return new c.fn.init(a,b)} has no method ‘contextMenu’ or Uncaught TypeError: Object # has no method ‘on’</p>\n<p>Known causes: jQuery is known to have a conflict when multiple versions of jQuery are loaded.</p>\n<p>Known solutions: Try to disable all but the first instance in jQuery. Loading multiple instances of jQuery is unnecessary so avoid that anyway. Especially when you first load the latest version of jQuery and then an older version, is a recipe for conflicts.</p>\n<h4>My question isn&#8217;t in this list</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry: visit these two sites: <a href=\"http://support.tinyfeedbackbar.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Support &amp; FAQ</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://forum.tinyfeedbackbar.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Forum</a></p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t find an answer for your question there, drop us an e-mail</p>\n<h4>Credits: Yoast.com</h4>\n<p>This is my first major plugin and &#8211; as you know &#8211; all beginnings are hard. To make a smooth start, I looked into the most succesful WordPress plugins around to see how these were build.</p>\n<p>The biggest lessons were the one that I learned from WordPress SEO &#8211; in<br />\nmy mind &#8211; the best SEO plugin around. As you probably know, that is written<br />\nby a fellow Dutchie: Joost de Valk or &#8216;Yoast&#8217; as most of you know him.</p>\n<p>Tiny Feedback Bar has the same structure as I foun in WordPress SEO by Yoast<br />\nfor which I want to thank Yoast. Because without that example, I would have<br />\nlost ALL my hairs. Those of you who know me know what that means.</p>\n<p>I hope you will all enjoy the plugin as much as we already have. Have fun!</p>\n",
