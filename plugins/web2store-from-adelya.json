It aims to integrate the different modules present in the existing CRM in all the pages thanks to the shortcodes created by Adelya Loyalty Operator. Each shortcode is specific to a module (login, registration, loyalty, information, stores, gift cards &#8230;.).</p>\n<p>When the Group code and the Client&#8217;s server code are stored in the database, the URL of each module will integrate its information in order to redirect the shortcodes on the Web2Store modules corresponding to the store or the client.</p>\n<p>The client can therefore manage the modules he wishes to display from his WordPress platform. The plugin makes it possible or not to resize the modules to the size of the pages of the site. The choice is made in the Settings -&gt; Plugin Name tab.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Web2Store plugin manages the translation of modules from the main WordPress panel. If WordPress has been configured in French, the administration part and the modules will work in French, otherwise it will work entirely in English.</p>\n",
