A lightweight responsive lightbox, which you can activate from the RGG Gallery page in your wordpress dashboard.<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t like the lightbox, or you think it&#8217;s too lightweight, you can keep it disabled and install a third party lightbox plugin. Most lightboxes that work with the native WP gallery will work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20images%20to%20the%20left%20and%20right%20of%20the%20grid%20are%20cut%20of%20when%20i%20mouse%20over%20them.%20how%20do%20i%20solve%20this%3F'>\nThe images to the left and right of the grid are cut of when I mouse over them. How do I solve this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This will happen if one of the grid containers have the CSS property <code>overflow:hidden</code>. If possible, you will<br />\nneed to change this to <code>overflow:visible</code>. If not, you can<br />\nwrap the gallery inside a div, and assign some margins to it. If that&#8217;s no option either, you should just disable scaling, or use negative scaling<br />\nby setting the <code>scale</code> property to a value between 0.5 and 1 in the schortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20further%20configure%20and%20modify%20the%20gallery%20to%20my%20needs%3F'>\nHow can I further configure and modify the gallery to my needs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please take a look here: https://responsive-gallery-grid.bdwm.be/shortcode-parameters/</p>\n<p>Need anything else?

Preparing to release some more updates in the near future.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.6 (Dec 10, 2020)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabled Swipebox because it&#8217;s not compatible with jQuery 3.5.1 included with WP 5.6. Swipebox now automatically falls back to SimpleLightbox. (Thanks to Christopher Jones for the detailed report)</li>\n<li>Include slick library in project instead of loading it from CDN</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.5 (Sep 25, 2020)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make even more compatible with Real Media Gallery plugin (thanks to the guys who make RML)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.4 (Apr 9, 2020)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove print_r statement</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.3 (Apr 29, 2020)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make compatibel with Real Media Library plugin (https://bit.ly/3d9QSUb) &#8211; Big thanks to @mguenter for the patch and @bit024 for reporting</li>\n<li>Add the image alt text as aria-label (can&#8217;t use alt attribute because the images are CSS background-images)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.2 (Apr 11, 2020)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WP 5.4 (no other changes)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.1 (Apr 19, 2019)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed small bug after resizing window + some code re-organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3 (Apr 19, 2019)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added alternative to lightbox: Show image above gallery. This will create a synchronized slider above the gallery. On clicking an image in the gallery, the corresponding image becomes the active slide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.2 (Apr 16, 2019)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>added additional lightbox: simplelightbox (https://simplelightbox.com/). I recommend using simplelightbox as swipebox seems to be no longer maintained by its developer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1 (Jun 7, 2018)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that was breaking gallery after update 2.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2 (Jun 6, 2018)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Swipebox as a built-in lighthbox. Plugin still works fine with Responsve Lightbox. But Responsve Lightbox is getting a bit heavy and recently added it&#8217;s own gallery solution, which looks confusing if you want to use it together with RGG.
