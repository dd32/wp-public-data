See https://uplexa.com for more information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is a uPlexa wallet?<br />\nA uPlexa wallet is a piece of software that allows you to store your funds and interact with the uPlexa network. You can get a uPlexa wallet from https://uplexa.com/downloads</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is uplexa-wallet-rpc ?<br />\nThe uplexa-wallet-rpc is an RPC server that will allow this plugin to communicate with the uPlexa network. You can download it from https://uplexa.com/downloads with the command-line tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do I see <code>[ERROR] Failed to connect to uplexa-wallet-rpc at localhost port 21060<br />\nSyntax error: Invalid response data structure: Request id: 1 is different from Response id:</code> ?<br />\nThis is most likely because this plugin can not reach your uplexa-wallet-rpc. Make sure that you have supplied the correct host IP and port to the plugin in their fields. If your uplexa-wallet-rpc is on a different server than your wordpress site, make sure that the appropriate port is open with port forwarding enabled.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
