We recommend monthly scans as a baseline.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20sitecare%20score%20represent%3F'>\nWhat does the SiteCare Score represent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SiteCare Score is a numerical value (out of 100) that reflects the overall health and security of your WordPress site based on the scan results. A higher score indicates better site health and security.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20email%20reports%3F'>\nDoes the plugin email reports?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does.
