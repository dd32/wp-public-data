How much you make using Pixter.me depends on you. We offer two business models &#8211; our default, allows you to set your own account margin. This margin is effective for all the products you sell. The default, “out-of-the-box” margin is 20% but you can change it and set any margin you want. With our second business model you have the flexibility to set your precise prices and margins per product.  Your profit from your Pixter.me store therefore depends on whatever margin you set over the products Base Prices. Note that 4% off your margin will be deducted in order to cover the Payment Processing Services. An example of profit calculation: In case you set your margin to 50%, so for an example Product Base Price of $50, The Customer price will therefore be $100 and your profit will be $50 minus $2 for the Payment Processing. Altogether, your profit in such case is $48.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What else do I have to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing.
