The plugin allows visitors to such websites to buy prepaid airtime and internet subscriptions for their mobile networks. The publisher earns a commission for airtime sales that originate from their website.</p>\n<p>The publisher will contact Techzim to be on-boarded as a vendor so that they may begin to sell airtime on their website. Essentially, the plugin displays a form for website visitors who wish to buy airtime to fill in. The information gathered by this form is sent to <a href=\"https://europe-west2-techzim-airtime-system.cloudfunctions.net/create_order\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">techzim market airtime system</a> where the buying request is processed. The customer will be sent a message on their mobile phone to confirm the transaction.
