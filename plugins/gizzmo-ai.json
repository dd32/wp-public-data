Gizzmo offers several subscription plans with different features and pricing. Upgrading your subscription will unlock additional features and benefits, such as increased content generation limits, access to advanced customization options, and priority support.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I use Gizzmo on multiple sites with one account?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! With our latest update, you can now manage multiple domains under a single Gizzmo account. This feature allows for more efficient management of your affiliate marketing efforts across various websites.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I cancel my Gizzmo subscription?</strong></p>\n<p>To cancel your Gizzmo subscription, go to &#8220;My Account&#8221; &gt; &#8220;CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION&#8221;. Please note that canceling your subscription will terminate your access to Gizzmo&#8217;s features and benefits at the end of your current billing cycle. Any remaining credits can be used until the end of the month, and the articles you have created will remain yours forever. If you have any questions or need assistance with the cancellation process, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to our support team.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='plugin%20features'>\nPlugin Features\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Does Gizzmo support bulk uploads?</strong></p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t believe in bulk posting. Relying 100% on AI can be misleading, and we strongly recommend a human check on the outcomes. While AI-generated content can be a valuable tool for content creation, it&#8217;s essential to maintain human oversight to ensure the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the content. Bulk uploading AI-generated content without human review can lead to issues such as factual inaccuracies, inconsistencies in tone and style, and potential plagiarism. To maintain the highest standards of content quality, we encourage users to review and edit AI-generated content before publishing.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I edit Gizzmo-generated content within WordPress editors like Gutenberg or Elementor without losing formatting?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Gizzmo is compatible with standard WordPress editors. However, it&#8217;s advised to edit carefully to maintain formatting. For simple edits, such as changing text, adding images, or adjusting headings, you can use the WordPress editors without issues. However, for more complex changes, such as modifying the layout or structure of the content, direct HTML editing might be necessary to ensure that the formatting remains intact.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I use Gizzmo for Amazon affiliate sites in languages other than English?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Gizzmo now supports content creation in 44 different languages. This multi-language support allows you to create affiliate content for various markets and audiences worldwide.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I add my Amazon Affiliate ID in Gizzmo?</strong></p>\n<p>To add or remove your Amazon affiliate tag, click on the &#8220;ADD/DELETE&#8221; button and fill in your data. Gizzmo will automatically integrate your affiliate tag into the relevant product links within the content it generates, ensuring that you receive credit for any resulting sales. You can also update or remove your affiliate tag at any time using the same process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='additional%20features'>\nAdditional Features\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Can Gizzmo work with Amazon sites in different countries?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Gizzmo supports all Amazon English-speaking stores, including Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.ca, Amazon.in, Amazon.sg, and Amazon.com.au. Gizzmo is designed to work seamlessly with these Amazon stores, allowing you to create content tailored to specific markets. We are continuously working on expanding our support to more Amazon stores worldwide and will update our users as new store integrations become available.</p>\n<p><strong>Does Gizzmo offer a free trial?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, Gizzmo offers a free version with limited features, allowing users to test the plugin before committing to a paid subscription. The free version includes basic content generation capabilities, such as product reviews and informative articles, with a limited number of monthly credits. Users can upgrade to a paid subscription at any time to unlock additional features, such as product comparisons, listicles, and increased content generation limits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='support%20and%20resources'>\nSupport and Resources\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Where can I find Gizzmo tutorials or guides?</strong></p>\n<p>Tutorials, guides, and additional learning resources can be found on the <a href=\"https://gizzmo.helpscoutdocs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gizzmo support site</a>.
