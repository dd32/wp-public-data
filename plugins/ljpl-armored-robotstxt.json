But the plugin is better:<br />\n* Set it and forget it &#8211; if there&#8217;s an update, you&#8217;ll know<br />\n* Instaling a plugin is simpler than manualy creating and uploading a file<br />\n* Most importantly &#8211; creating a <code>robots.txt</code> file manualy turns all WordPress filters for robots.txt off. It may (and most probably will) practicaly turn off your sitemap generator! (it will not be able to write it&#8217;s directives to the <code>robots.txt</code> file</p>\n</p>\n\n",
