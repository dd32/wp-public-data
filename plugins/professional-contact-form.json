        "description": "<h4>Hi Everyone!</h4>\n<p>Having a contact form on your website is a pretty basic feature these days. People want to be able to contact you, without having to copy your email address and go to a different app. Problem is, most contact form plugins either require a half hour of complex and code-filled setup, or they don&#8217;t really work that well. A professional grade contact form needs to come with all the features, without settling. With this plugin, you get:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for: AJAX form submissions (how is this not standard with all contact forms yet?)</li>\n<li>Support for: Google&#8217;s Invisible reCaptcha (the new 2017 reCaptcha that doesn&#8217;t require a checkbox)</li>\n<li>Support for: Users who have Javascript disabled.</li>\n<li>Easy Setup: This plugin only takes minute to setup. You simply put in your email address, and place the provided shortcode on any page.</li>\n<li>Customization Options: Entirely optional, you can tweak and customize the contact form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>&#8211;Instructions&#8211;</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>After you install the plugin, go to it&#8217;s Settings page (either from Settings link the Plugin list, or under the WP admin area&#8217;s main Settings-&gt;Contact Form page).</li>\n<li>Follow instructions provided (which boils down to providing an email address and adding the shortcode)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Want to Help?</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;d love some help with internationalization, because I still don&#8217;t really understand how to do that.</p>\n",

I get that. But I recently was working on a new website for a large manufacturing company and I couldn&#8217;t find a single plugin which met all of the requirements. AJAX, Invisible reCaptcha, no-JS support, no manditory code editing, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it be improved?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. I plan on redoing the Customization pages to be more graphical. Additionally, I plan on adding filters to allow people to rework any of the fields if they know PHP. Additionally, I want to add Internationalization, and maybe support for multiple contact forms on a single website.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
