The published spreadsheet must be set to &#8220;Anyone with the link can view&#8221; so that the plugin can access the data. Once the spreadsheet is published, users can retrieve the URL and use it in the shortcode <code>[jojokcreator_picturetable url=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/${spreadsheetId}/gviz/tq\"<br />\n title=${chosen_title}]</code> to display the data on their WordPress website</p>\n</p>\n\n",
