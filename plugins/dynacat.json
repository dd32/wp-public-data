When your website has many categories, selecting your required category from the drop-down selector can lead to tiresome scrolling – especially when the category you want to select is near the bottom of the list.</p>\n<p>Dynacat takes away that problem by replacing the standard drop-down list selection with a dynamic search box. To select the category for your post, simply begin to type in the search box. As you type, a list of categories appears that matches your criteria. The list changes with each letter you type, before your chosen category is easy to select.</p>\n<p>This is designed for sites with a large selection of categories.</p>\n",
