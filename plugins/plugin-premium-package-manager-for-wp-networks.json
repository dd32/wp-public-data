Super Admins still have access to all plugins on any Site Admin Plugin screen.</p>\n<p>In the Network Admin Plugins screen an action link (Make Visible) is added to each plugin that normally shows on the Site Admin Plugin screen. Clicking the Make Visible link adds that plugin to the Site Admin Plugin list for non-Super Admins. If a plugin is made visible on the Site Admin Plugin screen, the action link in the network admin plugins screen shows Make Invisible. The two versions of the link are in effect a toggle of the visibility on the Site Admin Plugin screen.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super Admin Menu Manager</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Manage menu visibility in the site dashboard</em></p>\n<p>The Menu Manager does not affect menu visibility for Super Admins. When the Menu Manager is activated it adds a Manage Menus item to Site Admin Tools menu for Super Admins. On the main site of the network, the menu Manager allows Super Admins to edit the default menu visibility for Site Admins across the network. On any subsite, the Menu Manager allows Super Admins to set the menu visibility for that subsite.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Space</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Allows a site to have unlimited media upload space</em></p>\n<p>When Unlimited Space is active on any site on the network, it allows that site to have unlimited media upload space.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add Domain Mapping Menu</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Adds the user domain mapping menu item under the Tools menu if Donncha&#8217;s Domain Mapping plugin is installed</em></p>\n<p>Requires <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/\" rel=\"ugc\">Domain Mapping</a></p>\n<p>The Domain Mapping plugin has the option to turn off the User domain mapping screen.
