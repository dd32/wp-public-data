Also, we put the default wordpress, checkout requirred fields as mandatory before the Quikly Modal pop ups like, #billing_email&#8221; if you add your custom requirred fields, please add them on the Form Validation Fields area in Quikly tab, on this format: Ex: #billing_email&#8221;, &#8220;#my_custom_field&#8221;, &#8220;#my_custom_field2&#8221; always use the #id css format. If requirred fields are not filled then Quikly Modal is not going to PopUp. So check this detail before implementing.</p>\n<h3>Security Tips</h3>\n<p>Before using Quikly, enable the sandbox option, to test the gateway. Only the paranoid survive as Andy Grove, CEO of Intel once said. So test before implementing, here is some sandbox credit card numbers and data to test, https://pay.quikly.app/web/developer Once you see that the order has been marked on the checkout page as processed (not really its, sandbox), disable sandbox.
