        "description": "<p>&#8220;Read More Right Here&#8221; uses the jQuery framework already included with WordPress installations. RMRH hooks into the WordPress creation of the<br />\n&#8220;more&#8221; link and adds a custom class.  When your blog is loaded, all links of this custom class are modified to no longer send the user to that post&#8217;s<br />\nsingle page display when clicked. Instead, the WordPress database is queried for that specific post, and all content after the <!--more--> tag (i.e. only what you need) is returned.<br />\nThe new content is then immediately displayed to the user, inline with the opening content.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.wooliet.com/wp-plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Woolie T. WP plugins page</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>read-more-right-here</code> directory (&#8220;unzipped&#8221;) to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Find &#8220;Read More Right Here&#8221; in the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress and click &#8220;Activate&#8221;</li>\n<li>Visit &#8220;Settings &gt; Read More Right Here&#8221; to customize</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>After the post content is pulled, how can I change the &#8216;red more&#8217; text to something more accurate, like &#8216;read less?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;Link Text On Expanded Content&#8221; option is avaiable on the plugin&#8217;s Settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am using a lightbox plugin, and none of the &#8216;more&#8217; content that is pulled down gets lightbox-ized.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some plugins, like this one, depend on javascript to implement much of its functionality. The javascript code that searches your page looking<br />\nfor images to lightbox or &#8216;more links&#8217; to modify, is triggered <em>once</em>, when the page has completely loaded.  New content dynamically added to the<br />\npage later will not receive this special treatment.</p>\n<p>Starting with WordPress 3.0, jQuery 1.4.2 is included. Plugin authors who make use of its <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/live/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">live</a> or <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/delegate/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">delegate</a><br />\nfunctions will most likely be able to avoid this issue.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there anyway to determine when new content has been displayed for a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8216;Read More Right Here&#8217; plugin client-side code triggers custom &#8220;events&#8221; using jQuery&#8217;s <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/trigger/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">trigger</a> method. Other scripts loaded to the page can hook into these events to offer additional functionality.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;RMRHContentExpanded&#8217; is triggered when the new content is displayed</li>\n<li>&#8216;RMRHContentCollapsed&#8217; is triggered when the new content is hidden</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The events are triggered by the &#8216;more-link&#8217; anchor element. Any element futher up the DOM can handle them.<br />\nExample code for handling these events:</p>\n<pre><code>// '.post' is the post containing element. \njQuery('.post').bind('RMRHContentExpanded RMRHContentCollapsed',function(e,data)\n{\n    console.log(e.type);\n    console.log(data.itemId);\n    console.log(data.moreContentEl);\n    console.log(data.linkEl);\n\n    // return false; // prevents event from bubbling up the DOM\n});\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>When the new content is loaded on the page, there are a bunch of weird looking characters in the text that shouldn&#8217;t be there. What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One option is to visit the plugin&#8217;s Settings page and select the &#8220;Use UTF-8 Decode&#8221; option, which runs the returned content through PHP&#8217;s <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.utf8-decode.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">utf8_decode</a> function.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-read-more-right-here-god-but-international-character-display-bug#post-1476984\" rel=\"ugc\">This thread</a> suggests modifying the .htaccess file of the site to include &#8220;AddDefaultCharset UTF-8&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Another solution is to change the string encoding at the database level, though that is beyond the scope of this FAQ (because I don&#8217;t know how).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have adsense ads within the content of my post.  This plugin causes weird issues.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a limit to the number of adsense ads you can have on a page. If your &#8216;front page&#8217; has ads, and the content pulled by this plugins also<br />\ncontains ads, then you might inadvertantly step over the limit once that new content is inserted into the page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the &#8216;read more&#8217; click sometimes take me directly to the single post view of the post, instead of expanding dynamically with the new content (like it should)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, with IE 7 and 8, embedded flash content cannot be dynamically inserted inline with the rest of the post content.  If that is the browser in use, and if an &#8216;object&#8217; element is found in the new content, the user is immediately sent to the single post view.  Sorry.  For more history on the matter see <a href=\"http://www.wooliet.com/2009/07/22/swfobject-ie-and-dynamic-content-a-problem/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the &#8220;loading&#8221; image?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;loading&#8221; image used to visually inform the user that the new content is arriving was created using the excellent <a href=\"http://www.ajaxload.info/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ajax Load</a> website. To use a different image you<br />\ncan create a new one and drop it into this plugin&#8217;s root directory (<em>plugins/read-more-right-here/loader</em>).  Then visit the plugin&#8217;s Settings page and select that image using the &#8216;Loader Image&#8217; option.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the &#8220;wt_rmrh-debug.js&#8221; file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The javascript used for this plugin is found in &#8220;<em>read-more-right-here/js/wt_rmrh.js</em>&#8220;. It has been compressed using Google&#8217;s <a href=\"http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Closure Compiler</a>. The original, uncompressed javascript is also included and is named &#8220;wt_rmrh-debug.js&#8221;. To use the uncompressed javascript file, visit the plugin&#8217;s Settings page and check the &#8216;Use Debug Script&#8217; option.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
