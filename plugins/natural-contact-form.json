        "description": "<p>Natural Contact Form provides contact forms that are easy to create and use.  Unlike general purpose form generators, it focuses on one thing (contact forms) and does it well.</p>\n<p>Features include:</p>\n<h4>More Natural &#8220;Reply To&#8221;</h4>\n<p>Most WordPress plugins that generate input forms, especially those that are general purpose (not specialized to strictly &#8220;contact me&#8221; forms), typically send you an email from yourself (or some address in your domain like <code>donotreply</code>) and spew user&#8217;s input as key value pairs in the email body.  Something like:</p>\n<pre><code>Name: Arthur Dent\nEmail: dent@example.com\nMessage: I seem to have misplaced my towel...\n</code></pre>\n<p>This makes replying to the message awkward.  Natural Contact Form does just one thing, contact forms, and does it in (as the name suggests) a more natural way.  The user&#8217;s name and email are set as the <code>reply-to</code> field in the email headers, and the email body is just the user&#8217;s message.</p>\n<p>This makes replying no different than it normally is when someone emails you directly.</p>\n<h4>Spam protection</h4>\n<p>Natural Contact Form has built in &#8220;Honey pot&#8221; spam protection.  If a bot fills in the hidden honey pot form field, you don&#8217;t receive the mail.</p>\n<h4>Unlimited contact forms for different parts of the site</h4>\n<p>Each contact form is configured separately in the WordPress dashboard.  In order to specify which form should appear on a given page in the site, the form&#8217;s ID is given to the plugin&#8217;s shortcode:</p>\n<pre><code>[natural-contact-form id=\"case-study\"]\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Easy styling beyond what your theme may provide</h4>\n<p>Most themes do some degree of styling on text inputs.  However, they rarely put any whitespace between the different form fields, or have a way to highlight a field where an error occurred.  This plugin provides two ways to deal with that.</p>\n<p>One, if you aren&#8217;t a developer, there are options to easily size the contact form input fields, the space between them, and change the color to highlight them when a required field is left blank.  No coding necessary.</p>\n<p>Or two, if you are a developer or work with one, the plugin makes it easy to add arbitrary CSS to style each contact form individually.</p>\n<h4>Optional &#8220;Page Guard&#8221; disallows direct navigation to the &#8220;Thank you&#8221; page</h4>\n<p>Typically the &#8220;thank you&#8221; page displayed after a contact form is a regular WordPress &#8220;Page&#8221; that can be visited simply by typing in it&#8217;s URL directly into the browser address bar.  Usually this is harmless, but if you have something on a &#8220;thank you&#8221; page, like a lead magnet download, that you don&#8217;t want visitors to get to without actually providing their contact info, it can be a problem.  Plus, direct navigation to &#8220;thank you&#8221; pages can skew analytics.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Page Guard&#8221; features allows you to require that a particular contact form be filled in successfully before displaying the guarded page.  If direct navigation is attempted, the visitor will either be shown a 404 or be bounced to a different page (likely the home or the contact page), depending on your settings.  Behind the scenes, this is handled with a cookie.  The contact form sets the cookie, and if the &#8220;thank you&#8221; page doesn&#8217;t find the required cookie, the visitor is redirected.</p>\n<h4>Optional integration with popular Email Service Providers</h4>\n<p>If you want to be contacted directly through an opt-in so you can follow up with new subscribers personally, contact forms can be configured to serve as both a &#8220;contact me&#8221; and an email list sign up.</p>\n<p>Currently MailChimp is supported.  Other email providers coming soon!</p>\n<h4>Best of all, it&#8217;s free!</h4>\n<p>General purpose form generators charge a premium for providing functionality you don&#8217;t need if all you need is a contact form.</p>\n<h4>Full User Guide</h4>\n<p>For a more detailed user guide, visit <a href=\"http://www.kirkbowers.com/plugins/natural-contact-form\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the Natural Contact Form homepage</a>.</p>\n",

Whether to ask for &#8220;Name&#8221; or &#8220;First Name&#8221; and &#8220;Last Name&#8221; is a configurable option.  In fact, you can even change how the input fields are labeled.  You can call it &#8220;Full Name&#8221; or &#8220;Given name&#8221; if you like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get rid of the &#8220;Message&#8221; field if I&#8217;m using the contact form as an opt-in for a newsletter?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Or you can change the label on the message field to anything you like, such as &#8220;Ask me anything&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s your fondest wish?&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t currently support my email service provider. Will you ever add support for &#8220;XYZ&#8221; in the future?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely, yes.  I started with support for MailChimp for a few reasons. Someone I&#8217;m working with had a direct need for it, MailChimp&#8217;s developer tools are fantastic, and it&#8217;s free to set up a test account with them to develop an integration.</p>\n<p>If you need this plugin to integrate with your email provider, drop me a note <a href=\"http://www.kirkbowers.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">at my contact form</a> and tell me which provider you need me to add.  I&#8217;ll have to look into their developer tools and see if they allow something similar to what I did with MailChimp.  If so, I&#8217;ll hook you up!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>You mentioned your own contact page in the last FAQ. Is that powered by this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Naturally!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
