        "description": "<p>This plugin will add a count of page views to your bbPress 2 forum.  The plugin inserts the count into two places,<br />\nonce on the forum listing page and once at the top of each post.</p>\n<p>You can select whether you want a simple hit count, or a unique count of member views.  Or both.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hit count literally counts every time the page is displayed.</li>\n<li>The member count increases each time a member views the page for the first time.  It is a unique count.  This tracks users using their WordPress user ID so if you mess with the user table the tracking will likely break.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that this is a new plugin and has not been tested on high volume sites so please perform your own tests<br />\nbefore implementing.  Feedback on performance greatly appreciated.  Please post in the plugin&#8217;s WP forum area or<br />\nmention @jezza101 in a tweet.  This plugin is maintained, I use it on my own forums,  but unless I have a request or it<br />\nbreaks I will not be adding new features as it works how I want it to work.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this plugin slow down my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It works fine on low volume sites, however it does generate an additional db write on every page load so this will<br />\ncause additional db load.  This could have an impact on a high volume site, the truth is I don&#8217;t know what the affect<br />\nmight be.</p>\n<p>Tracking member views is likely to be more resource intensive, but only if you have a lot of members.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin doesn&#8217;t work quite how I&#8217;d like it, can I make a suggestion?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, get in touch.  The plugin works as I want it to so it is unlikely I will change it unless it breaks.  But sure, feel free to make a<br />\nrequest, the member tracking was added by request!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s hardcoded in English, can you make it language friendly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this will be added in a future version.  Please do let me know if this is important to you and I will prioritise this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you add a unique count?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After careful consideration I have decided not to do this.  Tracking unique views is a whole different ball game and is not easy to do.  Even forum software<br />\nsuch as vBulletin shows a hit count.  I want this plugin to stay simple.  If you need to track unique views you are better off using Googe Analytics or<br />\nWordPress Stats.</p>\n<p>I may add session tracking, so the count won&#8217;t go up if you just sit an hit F5. But it will if you come back at a later date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work with caching plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have no idea, I don&#8217;t use any.  But let me know.  I suspect the only way to make this work would be to regnerate the page on each load but that would defeat<br />\nthe point of the page cache.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t like where the counts show, can you change it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, where would you like it to show?  I might replace the voice count as suggested by a user.  But other opinions welcome!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.2.1</h4>\n<p>Rename class to avoid clash in rare instance</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>Added member tracking.  The plugin can now give a unique count of member views.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
