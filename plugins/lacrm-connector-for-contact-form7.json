If the details appear in the search results, it works!</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>The submitted information was not sent to LACRM. Now what?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most often the reason is that the Site Admin skipped step 3 of Installation. Step 3 tells this plugin the details it needs to connect to LACRM. If the plugin doesn&#8217;t have these details, it&#8217;s like not having the username and password for an LACRM account&#8230;hence the plugin can not log into LACRM and add any info.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I find the LACRM user code and token required in step 3 of Installation?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the <a href=\"https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/account/api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LACRM API page</a></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
