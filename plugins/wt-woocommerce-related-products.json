You can show related products by category, tags, or choose products to show as related products on the product details page of a specific product.</p>\n<p>Showing related products recommendation brings customers&#8217; attention to other products in your store that they might be interested in. This persuades them to try those products, thus resulting in an increase in the average order value.</p>\n<p>You can also make use of the related product&#8217;s functionality in your WooCommerce store to suggest products to your customers and boost your sales.</p>\n<h3>Key features of WooCommerce Related Products Plugin</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Disable default WooCommerce related products</strong> functionality</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>custom related products</strong></li>\n<li>Option to <strong>set up related products for the entire store</strong> (by category, tags)</li>\n<li><strong>Set up related products for individual products</strong> (by category, attributes, tags, or products)</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude selected categories</strong> from showing as related products</li>\n<li><strong>Exclude out of stock products</strong> from showing as related products</li>\n<li>Displays <strong>related products</strong> in the slider</li>\n<li><strong>Customize the related products section</strong> on the front-end (heading, order of items,  number of products, and more)</li>\n<li>Relate <a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/related-products-woocommerce-user-guide/#sub_category\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">products by subcategory</a> using a filter.</li>\n<li>Use WooCommerce <strong>related products shortcode ([wt-related-products product_id=&#8221;xx&#8221;])</strong> to display related products for any posts/pages on your site</li>\n<li><strong>Show the same set of related products for their translated versions</strong> as well when using <strong>WPML</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>Override your theme&#8217;s default related products template</strong></li>\n<li>Import related products using the default WooCommerce importer<a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/how-to-import-related-products-using-woocommerce-importer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> Learn more </a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#9989; Tested OK with WooCommerce 9.1.4</p>\n<h3>Related Products for WooCommerce &#8211; Installation and Setup</h3>\n<p>You can learn about the installation and setup of the WooCommerce related products plugin with the help of this <a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/related-products-woocommerce-user-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">setup guide</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also check out this video to get a quick understanding of the plugin.<br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KOMx3g-ZMQs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Compatible plugins</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/product/product-import-export-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Product import export for WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP all import export for WooCommerce</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Related Products as a Powerful Marketing Tool</h3>\n<p>Displaying related products has become the best strategy for selling products. This feature has a great influence on making customers purchase from your store. Showing related products at each stage of a product purchase increases the stores&#8217; profit multiple times. eCommerce giant Amazon&#8217;s success is the best example of the related products technique. It acts literally like a virtual salesperson who accompanies us with better recommendations of choices throughout our purchase in the store.</p>\n<p>It is also seen that when customers keep getting recommendations while purchasing a product it increases their confidence in the product thereby simplifying the decision making process without spending a lot of time on it. Thus online purchasing would be a great option for people who hate shopping or who do not have the time or patience for it.</p>\n<h3>Different ways to Show Related products on your WooCommerce store</h3>\n<p>WooCommerce Related Products feature is one of the important sales tools available for store owners. &#8220;Related products&#8221; can be employed on your website in different forms. When built-in features in WooCommerce enable you to manually list related products like upsells and cross-sells, with the help of third-party plugins you can equip your store to automatically list related products depending upon the activities of customers on your WooCommerce store.</p>\n<p><strong>Up-sells</strong> &#8211;   These products are shown on the product page as an alternative to the product customers have chosen to purchase. There will be an upgrade of the chosen product either in quality or price thereby persuading the customer to choose the better one. It comes under the default text &#8220;you may also like&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-sells</strong> &#8211; On contrary to up-sells cross-sells are displayed on the cart page under the title &#8220;you may be interested in&#8221;.  These products would complement the products currently in the cart. On seeing this customers would feel an urge to buy the complementary products along with the products in their cart thereby selling more products for the store. Notifying customers about phone cases while purchasing a phone would be a perfect example of cross-selling.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Product Recommendations &#8211; Premium Version</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/product/woocommerce-product-recommendations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Product Recommendations</a> is an advanced recommendation tool for WooCommerce stores. The plugin offers multiple recommendation templates such as Related Products, Bestsellers, Top-rated Products, Frequently Bought Together, New Arrivals, Recently Viewed, and more. Apart from these recommendations, you can create manual recommendations, with custom rules and conditions.</p>\n<h4>Major features of WooCommerce Product Recommendations (Premium)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multiple pre-built recommendation templates:</strong> Related products, recently viewed, bestsellers, top-rated, frequently bought together, new arrivals, and more. </li>\n<li><strong>Advanced filters for recommendations:</strong> Choose various filters and conditions to show recommendations. </li>\n<li><strong>Display product recommendations on multiple store pages:</strong> Recommend products on multiple store pages, such as product page, category page, shop page, cart page, checkout page, and order received page.</li>\n<li><strong>Create custom recommendations with custom rules:</strong> Create flexible recommendation campaigns with custom rules and conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize the recommendation widgets:</strong> Customize the appearance of the recommendation widgets.</li>\n<li><strong>Hide out-of-stock products:</strong> Choose to exclude out-of-stock products from the recommendation.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced sorting options:</strong> Sort the products in the recommendation widgets based on rating, price, popularity, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About WebToffee</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebToffee</a> creates quality WordPress/WooCommerce plugins that are easy to use and customise.

This feature has a great influence on making customers purchase from your store. Showing related products at each stage of a product purchase increases the stores&#8217; profit multiple times. eCommerce giant Amazon&#8217;s success is the best example of the related products technique. It acts literally like a virtual salesperson who accompanies us with better recommendations of choices throughout our purchase in the store.</p>\n<p>It is also seen that when customers keep getting recommendations while purchasing a product it increases their confidence in the product thereby simplifying the decision making process without spending a lot of time on it. Thus online purchasing would be a great option for people who hate shopping or who do not have the time or patience for it.</p>\n<h3>Different ways to Show Related products on your WooCommerce store</h3>\n<p>WooCommerce Related Products feature is one of the important sales tools available for store owners. &#8220;Related products&#8221; can be employed on your website in different forms. When built-in features in WooCommerce enable you to manually list related products like upsells and cross-sells, with the help of third-party plugins you can equip your store to automatically list related products depending upon the activities of customers on your WooCommerce store.</p>\n<p><strong>Up-sells</strong> &#8211;   These products are shown on the product page as an alternative to the product customers have chosen to purchase. There will be an upgrade of the chosen product either in quality or price thereby persuading the customer to choose the better one. It comes under the default text &#8220;you may also like&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-sells</strong> &#8211; On contrary to up-sells cross-sells are displayed on the cart page under the title &#8220;you may be interested in&#8221;.  These products would complement the products currently in the cart. On seeing this customers would feel an urge to buy the complementary products along with the products in their cart thereby selling more products for the store. Notifying customers about phone cases while purchasing a phone would be a perfect example of cross-selling.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Product Recommendations &#8211; Premium Version</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.webtoffee.com/product/woocommerce-product-recommendations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Product Recommendations</a> is an advanced recommendation tool for WooCommerce stores.
