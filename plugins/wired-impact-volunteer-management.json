        "description": "<p>A simple, free way to keep track of your nonprofit&#8217;s volunteers and opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>How can the Wired Impact Volunteer Management plugin help your nonprofit?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Post one-time and flexible volunteer opportunities on your website –</strong> Promote volunteer opportunities on any page of your website using a simple block.</li>\n<li><strong>Volunteers can sign up directly on your website –</strong> Make volunteering even easier for your supporters by giving them the option to sign up for an opportunity directly on your website. A confirmation email will be sent to you and the volunteer once they sign up. </li>\n<li><strong>Control the number of signups available for opportunities –</strong> Only need 10 people to help out at an event? Set a cap on the number of people who can sign up. Want as many volunteers as you can get? No problem. You don’t have to set a limit.</li>\n<li><strong>Send reminder emails anytime –</strong> Schedule an automated reminder email a few days in advance or send a one-off email with last-minute details.</li>\n<li><strong>Volunteer profiles that track participation and more –</strong> Keep track of all of your volunteers’ involvement. See what they’ve helped out with in the past, future opportunities they&#8217;re signed up for, how long they’ve been volunteering and notes that will help you stay organized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.habitatebsv.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Habitat for Humanity East Bay/Silicon Valley</a> for being an awesome organization and letting us use the photo above.</em></p>\n",
        "installation": "<p><strong>How do I install the plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>This is the easiest way to install the Wired Impact Volunteer Management plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the WordPress backend, go to Plugins &gt;&gt; Add New Plugin</li>\n<li>Search for “Wired Impact Volunteer Management”</li>\n<li>Click “Install Now”</li>\n<li>Click “Activate”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If this doesn’t work, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the Wired Impact Volunteer Management plugin</li>\n<li>Unzip the files</li>\n<li>Upload the wired-impact-volunteer-management folder to the /wp-content/plugins directory of your website</li>\n<li>Activate the Wired Impact Volunteer Management plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20started%3F'>\nHow do I get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you’ve downloaded the plugin, you’ll want to adjust the settings to fit your specific needs.</p>\n<p>You can do this by visiting the Volunteer Management menu and clicking “Help &amp; Settings”. Here, you can do things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose to include our styles</li>\n<li>Set a default contact and location for volunteer opportunities</li>\n<li>Pick your default form settings</li>\n<li>Write a template message for your confirmation and reminder emails</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20new%20volunteer%20opportunity%3F'>\nHow do I create a new volunteer opportunity?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Volunteer Management menu, click “Opportunities” </li>\n<li>On the Opportunities page, click “Add Volunteer Opportunity”</li>\n<li>Fill in all of the “Volunteer Opportunity Details” fields</li>\n<li>Click the blue “Publish” button</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20display%20a%20list%20of%20volunteer%20opportunities%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow do I display a list of volunteer opportunities on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can display the opportunities by adding the Volunteer Opportunities block to your page content. Once added, use the block’s toolbar to show one-time or flexible opportunities.</p>\n<p>It’s not currently possible to display both types of opportunities in a single list. We recommend showing only one type of opportunity per page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20two%20types%20of%20opportunities%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between the two types of opportunities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One-time volunteer opportunities happen at a fixed date and time. One example might be a trivia night fundraiser where you need volunteers to help check in attendees.</p>\n<p>Flexible volunteer opportunities can happen on different days and times. One example might be weekly tutoring. Another example could be looking for a volunteer to help with your social media or blog.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20a%20volunteer%20to%20our%20database%3F'>\nHow do I add a volunteer to our database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Volunteers appear in the database after signing up for an opportunity. You can’t manually add a volunteer to the database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20notes%20about%20a%20volunteer%3F'>\nHow do I add notes about a volunteer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Volunteer Management menu, click “Volunteers” </li>\n<li>Click the name of the volunteer you’d like to add a note about </li>\n<li>Click “Edit Volunteer Info”</li>\n<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page to the Notes section </li>\n<li>Add or edit any notes</li>\n<li>Click “Update User” to save any changes</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20remove%20a%20volunteer%20from%20a%20specific%20opportunity%3F'>\nHow do I remove a volunteer from a specific opportunity?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a volunteer is no longer able to help out with a specific opportunity, you can remove them from the signup list.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click “Opportunities” from the Volunteer Management menu</li>\n<li>Find the opportunity you need to remove the volunteer from </li>\n<li>Click the opportunity to edit </li>\n<li>Scroll down to the RSVP list, find the volunteer’s name and click “Remove RSVP”</li>\n<li>Confirm their removal by clicking the blue “Remove RSVP” button</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also remove the RSVP through that individual volunteer’s profile.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20recurring%20opportunity%3F'>\nHow do I create a recurring opportunity?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have a recurring opportunity where different people will sign up each time, we recommend creating a one-time opportunity for each date and time. That will allow you to track the RSVPs separately.</p>\n<p>If the recurring opportunity will have the same volunteers each time, we recommend creating one flexible volunteer opportunity.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20adjust%20the%20built-in%20volunteer%20signup%20form%3F'>\nHow can I adjust the built-in volunteer signup form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are three options for handling volunteer signups within the plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the built-in volunteer signup form which includes name, phone number and email address fields. This form can be modified, but only through code using the PHP template files included inside the plugin.</li>\n<li>Choose the option not to show a form, then manually embed a third-party form within the content of each volunteer opportunity.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re utilizing the <a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravity Forms</a> plugin, you can show a form you&#8217;ve built within your volunteer opportunities. Information can be passed into the volunteer management system using a form feed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Within the Help &amp; Settings page, you can set a default form to use when new opportunities are created. You can also modify which form is displayed when editing an individual volunteer opportunity.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
