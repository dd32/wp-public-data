You still can&#8217;t find its children post this way.</p>\n<p>The TukuToi Hierarchical Posts Tree View Plugin adds a WordPress Dashboard Widget to display hierarchical Pages or Posts in a searchable list, which keeps showing the parent and child posts of the search result.<br />\nThus, it resolves this organzational problem.</p>\n<p>By default, the Plugin queries the native WordPress Page post type, and it displays a (foldable and searchable) list of each Parent Pages Children posts.<br />\nThe entire list is searchable, and the search results will be highlighted.<br />\nThe entire &#8220;tree&#8221; of each search result will keep showing, thus allowing you to very easily find related parent or child posts of a search result.</p>\n<p>Links to edit each page are integrated in the results, allowing for a quick navigation to edit each item in the list.</p>\n<p>With filters, the post type to query can be changed to any hierarchical post type, and additional Widgets can be added (one each post type).</p>\n",

You can use the <code>tkt_htv_widgets</code> filter to add as manu additional Widgets you want.<br />\nThe filter accepts one argument, being an array of Post Type Slugs and Post Type Names.</p>\n<p>Example Usage:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('tkt_htv_widgets', 'my_additional_widgets');\n\nfunction my_additional_widgets( $widgets ){\n\n    $widgets['another-post-type'] = 'Another Post Type';\n    $widgets['yet-another-post-type'] = 'Yet Another Post Type';\n\n    return $widgets;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20see%20all%20my%20hierarchical%20posts%20in%20the%20tree%20view'>\nI do not see all my Hierarchical Posts in the Tree View\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This Plugin shows by default the first 100 Top Level Posts, and only if they have children.<br />\nThus, to show more Posts, you can either use a filter to change the default amount of posts shown,<br />\nor paginate using URL parameters.</p>\n<p>To paginate using URL paramters, you can use these URL params:<br />\n    _per_page (<code>?_per_page=100</code>)<br />\n    _offset   (<code>?_offset=100</code>)<br />\nFor example, this query will show the next 100 posts:<br />\n    /?_per_page=100&amp;_offset=100</p>\n<p>If you want to increase the amount of Posts shown by default, or the offset, you can use the filters documented here:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.tukutoi.com/doc/tkt_htv_pagination_default\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>tkt_htv_pagination_default</code></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.tukutoi.com/doc/tkt_htv_offset_default\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>tkt_htv_offset_default</code></a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20the%20message%20%22you%20have%20no%20hierarchical%20%7Bpost%20type%7D%20message%22'>\nI get the message &#8220;You have no hierarchical {Post Type} message&#8221;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can happen for 2 reasons:<br />\n&#8211; You indeed have not a single Post that has Children Posts.<br />\n&#8211; Or, you have more than 100 posts, and the first 100 Posts have no Children assigned.</p>\n<p>In the first case, of course you need to assign some Posts as children to others.<br />\nIn the second case, when you have children posts, but see no results, it is because of the Pagination.<br />\nBy default, this plugin shows only the first 100 Top Level Posts that have children.<br />\nIf it so happens that your first 100 Posts returned by the query have no children, you may use pagination and offset URL paramters,<br />\nin order to see the subsequent batches of results. For example, if your first Post with a Child is number 156 in the results,<br />\nyou would have to add these URL parameters to see the Post in the Widget:<br />\n    /?_per_page=100&amp;_offset=100</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20other%20filters%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat other filters are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the Documentation <a href=\"https://www.tukutoi.com/doc/?wpv_post_search&amp;wpv-relationship-filter=338&amp;wpv_view_count=4635\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
