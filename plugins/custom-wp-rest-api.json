        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20custom%20endpoint%20url'>\nWhat is Custom Endpoint URL\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, Endpoint URL is an API URL, Anyone can send a request to the server with that URL and will get a response from the server after processing the requests. However, Custom Endpoint is user defined in this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20request%E2%80%99s%20parameters%20in%20server%20side'>\nHow Do I get request’s Parameters in server side\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IN the description it has already mentioned, that after registering an endpoint in the backend, you will see an &#8216;INFO&#8217; icon on &#8216;Filter Hook&#8217; Column in Endpoint Listing. If you click on that icon, you will be prompted with a CODE snippet. Hence if you put that code in your any function PHP file, you will see a &#8216;$param&#8217; variable is passing through that callback function. And that variable holding all request parameters.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20a%20response%20from%20api'>\nHow do I get a response from API\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you put that code snippet and return your OBJECT/ARRAY/ STRING, then this plugin will return a JSON array and your &#8216;returned value&#8217; will be on the DATA object.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20turn%20on%20%27enable%20cron%20to%20remove%20backlog%27%2C%20it%20will%20capture%20log%2C%20as%20results%20database%20will%20be%20consumed%20more%20space.%20how%20can%20i%20minimize%20it.%3F'>\nIf I turn on &#8216;Enable CRON to remove backlog&#8217;, it will capture log, as results database will be consumed more space. How can I minimize it.?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For that this plugin providing you an option &#8216;CRON&#8217;, if you put those settings ON, the system will delete the previous log as you saved settings.For e.g.: if you set this &#8216;CRON will run on (Recurrence)&#8217; to &#8216;Once Daily&#8217;, then the CRON job will run once in a day.<br />\nAnd if you set &#8216;Delete Log&#8217; to &#8216;7 Days Before&#8217;, then it will delete all log from the very first to the last seven days.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20cron%3F'>\nWhat is CRON?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please find the link here: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20%27enable%20api%20authentication%20with%20secret%20key%27%3F'>\nWhat about &#8216;Enable API Authentication with Secret Key&#8217;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>if you turn it on, all custom endpoints need no authentication, without secret key, it will be working.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20%27api%20namespace%27%20%3F'>\nWhat about &#8216;Api Namespace&#8217; ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Namespaces are the slugs in the URL before the endpoint. For e.g.: if your endpoint URL is &#8216;www.domain.com/wp-json/wpapi/v1/myapp/&#8217;.<br />\nThen &#8216;wpapi&#8217; is your NAMESPACE. and it would remain the same on all the endpoint URL.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20delete%20any%20endpoint%2C%20the%20system%20will%20be%20damaged.%3F'>\nIf I delete any endpoint, the system will be damaged.?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, only that particular endpoints will be not working or would be invalid.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20only%20name%20and%20email%20is%20required%20while%20creating%20a%20new%20api%20access%3F'>\nWhy only NAME and EMAIL is required while creating a new API access?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To generate a secret key, the plugin needs a user. For that, we used the only name and email.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
