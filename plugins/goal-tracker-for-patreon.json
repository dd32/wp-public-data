You can roll with one of those or you can override the schemes with your own colors. I&#8217;m working on giving you a bit of control over the shape of the progress bar as well.</p>\n<p>You can see the widget in action at <a href=\"http://knives-the-novel.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">knives-the-novel.net</a></p>\n<h3>Road Map</h3>\n<p>= Things I&#8217;d like to put in this plugin =</p>\n<ol>\n<li>More control over widget appearance (partially done, control over the progress bar shape still in the works).</li>\n<li>Live preview on options page.</li>\n<li>Blurb in widget describing the goal, that can optionally be pulled from the Patreon site (partially complete).</li>\n<li>Patron access control to allow &#8220;patron only&#8221; sections of your site.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload Goal Tracker for Patreon to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>In the Settings menu, select Goal Tracker for Patreon.</li>\n<li>Enter your Creator Access Token (see FAQ).</li>\n<li>Now it&#8217;s time to actually put a widget on your page. In the Widgets admin page, drag a Patreon Goal widget into the desired widget area.</li>\n<li>Open the widget and click &#8220;Refresh List&#8221;. This will contact Patreon and load in a list of the goals you have set there.</li>\n<li>Choose a goal and fill out the other stuff.</li>\n<li>View your site and watch the thermometer animate! Pretty!</li>\n<li>Go back to the settings page and fiddle with the color options. Choose hideous colors, have a laugh, and then set the progress bar colors to match your personal aesthetic.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I connect with my Patreon account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a form you fill out on the Patreon site, and when that process is complete, you get your Special Secret Codes. You&#8217;ll be just like James Bond!*</p>\n<p><em>NOTE:</em> If you have already filled out the form for a different Patreon plugin, you will need to do it again for this one (with a different app name), so the plugins don&#8217;t trip over each other.</p>\n<p>Start by logging into your Patreon account, then go to https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/clients. You will find a form with a bunch of stuff that may not make sense to you. App name? What the heck? Just remember: there aren&#8217;t really any wrong answers. Most of that is so you can keep things straight.</p>\n<p>For App name, you can use the name of your WordPress site. For description, a description of your site is fine. I&#8217;m not sure if privacy policy and terms of service URL&#8217;s are required, but on my site I made quickie pages that said I would never ever share info with anyone, and that I reserved the right to ban people who are jerks. For this plugin, those are never used.</p>\n<p>Once you get all that stuff filled out, you will see a Client ID, a Client Secret, Creator&#8217;s Access Token, and Creator&#8217;s Refresh Token. Each of those items has a place on the plugin&#8217;s options page. Paste them in, and when you save, you will see a little message over on the side with your creator id in it. That shows that your info was correct and you have successfully connected with Patreon.</p>\n<p>&#042; Cool gadgets and attractive sidekicks not included.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize the look of the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the settings page, you can set the colors of all the parts. There are two colors for the progress bar and for the background, providing a feeling of dimension.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, but Jerry,&#8221; you say, &#8220;that whole 3-D thing is <em>so</em> 2012.&#8221; No problem; if you want that modern, flat look, just use the same color for the base and the highlight. Personally, I think we let go of 2012 a little too quickly. Not a bad year, as years go.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So your name is Jerry, I take it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is. It&#8217;s a pleasure to meet you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Shouldn&#8217;t I just use the Patreon WordPress plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They are two different animals, and actually complement each other.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides information about your campaign; the other allows your patrons to set up accounts on your site based on their Patreon credentials, which is useful for providing patron-only content.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
