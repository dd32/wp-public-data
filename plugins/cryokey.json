        "description": "<p>This is the CryoKey reference plugin for WordPress. We tested it with WordPress v3.4.1 and v3.5.1, but it should be able to work on all WordPress v3.0 or higher.</p>\n<p>CryoKey is a new single sign-on solution that makes use of digital certificates. Instead of traditional usernames and passwords, CryoKey authentication employs public key cryptography, making authentication simpler and more secure. Since CryoKey uses existing infrastructure, you don&#8217;t have to install any software or buy any hardware. CryoKey makes generating and using credentials easy &#8211; just go to the CryoKey site and generate as many credentials as you like. Then, securely log in to sites that recognize CryoKey by simply selecting an identity with a click.</p>\n<p>To encourage others to recognize CryoKey credentials and make user management more pleasant, we&#8217;ve developed a WordPress plug-in that takes advantage of the convenience and security of CryoKey authentication. The new v2.x implementation utilizes the CryoKey Lite integration model, requiring zero setup on the server. Just throw the files into the plugins directory and you&#8217;re ready to go. To use the more comprehensive CryoKey integration, you can go back to the v1.x series.</p>\n<p>With this plugin, you log in or out using your CryoKey certificate. The login page will have a link to log in with your CryoKey instead of following the standard username and password flow. Furthermore, the login/logout links throughout WordPress will automatically attempt a CryoKey login. If authentication fails (maybe the user doesn&#8217;t have or refuses to present a CryoKey), then the user will see the regular WordPress login prompt.</p>\n<p>If you have a valid CryoKey certificate for an unknown user, the plugin can auto-register new users. Turn on auto-registration from the administrator&#8217;s options page (in <em>Settings</em> submenu <em>CryoKey</em>). CryoKey user names are E-Mail based, so the plugin authenticates users based on their account&#8217;s E-Mail address. Auto-registration creates a new account with the CryoKey credentials E-Mail address and a random password. Auto-registered screen names will be a random string with a &#8220;CK&#8221; prefix; you can change them whenever you want. Auto-registered user names will be the E-Mail address with a &#8220;CK&#8221; prefix.</p>\n<p>Starting in v2.2, the plugin supports multi-factor authentication with CryoKey and the standard WordPress authentication. You can enable it site-wide in the CryoKey settings (as an admin), or you can turn it on per-user in the user profile. With multi-factor authentication, you will need to enter the appropriate username and password while providing CryoKey credentials that match the E-Mail address. Users that need multi-factor authentication must log in by clicking on the &#8220;Log In Using CryoKey&#8221; link from the log-in page.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re already using CryoKey credentials and want to see it in action on WordPress, you can visit:   http://www.authenticade.com/blog</p>\n<p>To generate free CryoKeys, visit:   https://www.cryokey.com</p>\n<p>Follow us on Facebook:   http://www.facebook.com/CryoKey</p>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter:   https://twitter.com/CryoKey</p>\n<p>Follow us on Tumblr:   http://cryokey.tumblr.com/</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Simply copy the following files into your plugins directory (<strong>wp-content/plugins</strong>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ckicon.png</li>\n<li>cryokey.php</li>\n<li>cryokey.js</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then activate the plugin through the <em>Plugins</em> menu in WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you want to authenticate using CryoKey, you and your users may generate them for free at: https://www.cryokey.com</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>v2.4: CryoKey on Android now uses a custom URL scheme. We also use the new Lite Integration Toolkit from the main CryoKey site.</p>\n<p>v2.3: Added support for the CryoKey Android client, which does not work with multi-factor yet. As a result, we added an option to disable multi factor authentication.</p>\n<p>v2.2: Added initial support for multi-factor (CryoKey with standard username/password) authentication. Also, attempt to flush credentials before logging in and after logging out.</p>\n<p>v2.1: If WordPress allows user registrations, then send unknown CryoKey users to registration on failed login (with E-Mail filled in).</p>\n<p>v2.0: Use CryoKey Lite integration model for zero configuration setup</p>\n<p>v1.3: Allow user to manually change user after CryoKey login (by clicking on the username)</p>\n<p>v1.2: Fixed a problem preventing regular login flow for unknown users when auto-login is disabled.</p>\n<p>v1.1: Changed account lookups to use &#8220;email&#8221; instead of &#8220;login&#8221;. Also, added CryoKey options page to change auto-registration settings.</p>\n<p>v1.0: Initial Release</p>\n"
