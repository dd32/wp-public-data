Recently deleted the plugin for Google Analytics tracking, then reinstalled it and forgot to re-enable IP anonymization?</p>\n<p>To ensure the highest security, the plugin regularly checks the settings. Should a setting no longer fit, then an error message appears in the WP Admin (Backend / Dashboad) or you will receive an email.<br />\nYou can freely choose the frequency of the check. The following intervals are available: daily, weekly or monthly.</p>\n<p>The following settings are checked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opt-Out function enabled</li>\n<li>Opt-Out shortcode present on the page</li>\n<li>Page with the shortcode publicly available (published and no password protection)</li>\n<li>Valid UA-Code found (only the formatting is checked)</li>\n<li>IP anonymization enabled (Works only in conjunction with a compatible plugin or the tracking code is stored in the plugin)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Integrated compatibility with the following plugins</strong></p>\n<p>It is not a requirement to use the listed plugins! The Google Analytics Opt-Out Plugin is also compatible with other plugins and can be used even if the Google Analytics code itself was inserted.<br />\nWith integrated compatibility, we make work easier because the current UA-Code is automatically read out and kept up to date.

With this cookie, the system knows that this site visitor should not be tracked on the website.</p>\n<p>This cookie is only valid in the browser with which the site visitor was on the website and clicked on the opt-out link. If the visitor uses a different browser, he would have to click on the link again.</p>\n<p>If the site visitor clears his browser data (cookies, download history, etc.), the cookie is also deleted and the site visitor would have to click on the opt-out link again.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20deactivate%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I deactivate the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can deactivate the status of the plugin under &#8220;Settings &gt; GA Opt-Out&#8221;, there you only have to uncheck &#8220;Activate opt-out function&#8221;.</p>\n<p>You can deactivate the whole plugin under &#8220;Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins&#8221; by clicking on &#8220;Deactivate&#8221; for the &#8220;Opt-Out for Google Analytics&#8221; Plugin.</p>\n<p>After deactivating the plugin, you can remove it completely by clicking on &#8220;Delete&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20use%20the%20shortcode%3F'>\nWhere can I use the shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the shortcode <code>[gaoo_optout]</code> in posts, pages and widgets (text widget).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20as%20a%20developer%20intervene%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I as a developer intervene in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can.

How can I use the function via PHP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It happens that some self-developed themes do not resolve shortcodes and the plugin does not work.<br />\nTo execute the shortcode anyway, you have to use this code in the theme, at the desired position:</p>\n<pre><code>echo do_shortcode('[ga_optout]');\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%20is%20displayed%20that%20the%20settings%20are%20not%20correct%2C%20although%20i%20have%20changed%20them%21'>\nIt is displayed that the settings are not correct, although I have changed them!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the settings have been changed, e.g. in a compatible Google Analytics tracking plugin, then this change will only be noticed during the autom. check (weekly).</p>\n<p>It is possible to perform the check beforehand. To do this, the &#8220;Save changes&#8221; button would have to be clicked under &#8220;Settings &gt; GA Opt-Out&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This will read the new settings and save them for a week until the next automatic check.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20react%20to%20the%20clicks%2C%20e.g.%20with%20another%20plugin%3F'>\nHow can I react to the clicks, e.g. with another plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The JavaScript event <code>gaoptout</code> is fired on the <code>window</code> object, which can be reacted to.</p>\n<p>If the page visitor clicks on the link to perform an opt-out, then a <code>false</code> is passed as the value. If the visitor performs an opt-in, then a <code>true</code> is passed.</p>\n<p>Example code:<br />\n    jQuery(window).on(&#8216;gaoptout&#8217;, function (e) { console.log(e.detail); });</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20appearance%20of%20the%20link%3F'>\nHow do I change the appearance of the link?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have the possibility to change the appearance of the link via CSS in the settings of the plugin. For this purpose, the following CSS classes are available:</p>\n<p><strong>The link itself:</strong><br />\n    #gaoo-link { &#8230; }</p>\n<p><strong>The link if the page visitor has disagreed with the tracking:</strong><br />\n    .gaoo-link-activate { &#8230; }</p>\n<p><strong>The link if the page visitor has NOT disagreed with the tracking:</strong><br />\n    .gaoo-link-deactivate { &#8230; }</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20send%20the%20status%20messages%20to%20multiple%20email%20addresses%3F'>\nHow can I send the status messages to multiple email addresses?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can enter several recipient addresses, separated by a comma, into the input field for the e-mail, which should receive the status message.<br />\nExample: <code>webmaster@example.org,admin@example.org,dev@example.org</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20receive%20emails%20about%20the%20status%20check%3F'>\nI do not receive emails about the status check?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The status check runs in the set interval and only sends e-mails if at least one status is set to red.<br />\nIf you still do not receive any e-mails, it can have the following causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The e-mail has landed in your spam folder. Please check this before and save the sender address in your contact book, this will prevent the emails from ending up in spam.</li>\n<li>You have deactivated the cronjob of WordPress in the wp-config.php. Please make sure that the server-side cronjob works correctly.</li>\n<li>You are using a caching plugin on the installation. If there is no server-side cronjob set up, WordPress will check if there are tasks pending on every page load. If the page is called from the cache, then this is no longer done and no cronjob can be triggered.</li>\n<li>You have too few page visitors who call your website in too large time intervals. Thus the cronjob of WordPress is not triggered.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our recommendation is therefore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a server-side cronjob</li>\n<li>Save the sender address in your contact book</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='use%20google%20tag%20manager'>\nUse Google Tag Manager\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The opt-out cookie is set according to Google&#8217;s specifications. Thus, the GTM (Google Tag Manager) should not need to be adjusted.<br />\nHowever, if the Google Analytics code is not loaded at all, the GTM must check whether the cookie is set or whether the value in the &#8220;HTML5 Local Storage&#8221; is set accordingly.<br />\nOn this basis, it can be decided in the GTM whether the code should be loaded or not.</p>\n<p>If no entry or cookie is present, then no opt-out has taken place. This is also the case if the value &#8220;false&#8221; is returned.<br />\nThe opt-out has only taken place if the value &#8220;true&#8221; is returned.</p>\n<p>Specific cookie, with the corresponding tracking code: ga-disable-UA-XXXXX-YY or ga-disable-G-XXXXXXXXX<br />\nGeneric Cookie: ga-opt-out</p>\n<p>Specific entry in the HTML5 Local Storage:  ga-disable-UA-XXXXX-YY or ga-disable-G-XXXXXXXXX<br />\nGeneric entry in the HTML5 Local Storage: ga-opt-out</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='liability%20%2F%20disclaimer'>\nLiability / Disclaimer\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The use of this plugin is at your own risk. The website operator must be able to ensure the functionality of the plugin itself.<br />\nTo do this, it must be checked, among other things, whether after clicking on the link, a cookie in this format was set: ga-disable-UA-XXXXXXXX-YY<br />\nSupporting, for the Google Tag Manager, another cookie with the name &#8220;ga-opt-out&#8221; is set.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Should a setting no longer fit, then an error message appears in the WP Admin (Backend / Dashboad) or you will receive an email.<br />\nYou can freely choose the frequency of the check. The following intervals are available: daily, weekly or monthly.</p>\n<p>The following settings are checked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Opt-Out function enabled</li>\n<li>Opt-Out shortcode present on the page</li>\n<li>Page with the shortcode publicly available (published and no password protection)</li>\n<li>Valid UA-Code found (only the formatting is checked)</li>\n<li>IP anonymization enabled (Works only in conjunction with a compatible plugin or the tracking code is stored in the plugin)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Integrated compatibility with the following plugins</strong></p>\n<p>It is not a requirement to use the listed plugins! The Google Analytics Opt-Out Plugin is also compatible with other plugins and can be used even if the Google Analytics code itself was inserted.<br />\nWith integrated compatibility, we make work easier because the current UA-Code is automatically read out and kept up to date.
