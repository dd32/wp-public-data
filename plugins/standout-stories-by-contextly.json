This is done on the right rail with a click. This will add a link in your post&#8217;s header that&#8217;s invisible to your readers but visible to web spiders.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>contextly-standout.php</code>, along with the css, img and js folder, to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you select one of your posts as a standout story, the plugin puts a special link in the header of the story, which your readers won&#8217;t see, but Google News will. If you re-blog or reference a great story someone else wrote, you can use the special standout link button on the Visual Editor bar to give them credit. The links in your post&#8217;s header look like this: <code>&lt;link rel='standout' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/business/luck-is-just-the-spark-for-business-giants.html' /&gt;</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I press the Standout Story button in WordPress&#8217;s Visual Editor, nothing happens? Why not?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Standout Story button works just like the Link button. First, you must highlight the text you want to link to in the body of your post, then hit the Standout link button. Then you will be able to link to someone else&#8217;s great story in the body of your post, and the plugin will add the special link into your post&#8217;s header.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will Google News do with the links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google says it will use the standout story links as part of its determination of which stories to feature on its popular news page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So this is Google only? What about Yahoo News?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The tags are visible to any search spider so if it&#8217;s a useful signal, expect other aggregation sites will use it as well.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
