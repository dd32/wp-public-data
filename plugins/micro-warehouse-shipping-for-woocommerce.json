This is a hybrid of the “warehouse” and “dropship” ship-from locations normally found in the Eniture Technology quoting plugins. When an item in the shopping cart is assigned to more than one dropship location, the one closest to the ship-to address is used as the ship-from location for quoting purposes.</p>\n",
