If it doesn&#8217;t exist, before returning 404, MPG will check if the URL is within its database. If it is, it will render the selected template page, replace all URL related data and shortcodes, return status 200, and load the page for the end-user.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20tutorial%3F'>\nIs there a tutorial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, check out our tutorial videos and step-by-steps at <a href=\"https://docs.themeisle.com/collection/1572-multiple-pages-generator?utm_source=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.themeisle.com/collection/1572-multiple-pages-generator</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20mpg%20plugin%20free%3F'>\nIs the MPG plugin free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the main features of the plugin for free to create one project.

If the problem persists:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Check that the requested URL doesn&#039;t belong to an existing page, especially in the trash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check that the requested URL is identically included in the data file uploaded to the MPG plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure to disable any custom 404-page plugins.

Example: where=&#8217;mpg_column_name=value&#8217; or for multi column filter just use comma like where=&#8217;mpg_column_name=value, mpg_column_name2=value2,&#8230;,mpg_column_name7=value7&#8242;. Filtered results can be grouped by the value of any of the columns. Example: group=&#8217;mpg_column_name&#8217;. For filtered data, you can specify your HTML pattern, just insert HTML code inside shortcode like this: [mpg]</p>\n<p>{{column_name}}</p>\n<p>[/mpg]. Full example of new shortcode look like: [mpg where=&#8217;mpg_state=NY&#8217; group=&#8217;mpg_city&#8217;]</p>\n<p>{{city}}</p>\n<p>[/mpg]</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Realize version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
