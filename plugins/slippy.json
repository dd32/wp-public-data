Where required, manual connections can be made using the Linked Notes feature.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow private are Slippy Notes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All data, including Slip Notes, are stored in the WordPress database being used by your WordPress instance.</p>\n<p>Slippy does not send your notes, or any other data to any third party.</p>\n<p>Slippy does not collect any usage information, and does not report back to LMNHQ or any other party.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
