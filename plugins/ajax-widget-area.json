        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want to do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To speed up page load.  The user would have access to the main content on the page faster, and by the time they&#8217;re done with that the widgets will have loaded in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about SEO?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Good question!  Anything place in the ajax widget area won&#8217;t be indexed by the search engines, so you might not want to put everything in there. Future versions will separate options for Desktop, Mobile and Bots.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Only 1 ajax widget area? I need more!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Dive into the code then, creating additional ajax widget areas won&#8217;t take to long!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The styling of the widgets is broken</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry.  In WordPress when you define a widget area you also define what html surrounds the widget, and the widget title.  The html structure is this plugin is consistent with the Twenty Eleven base theme, but other themes use different html.  To fix this you could copy from your theme&#8217;s functions.php &#8211; &#8216;before_widget&#8217;, &#8216;after_widget&#8217;, &#8216;before_title&#8217; and &#8216;after_title&#8217; html into this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
