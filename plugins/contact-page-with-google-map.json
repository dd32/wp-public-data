        "faq": "<p>Q: Why do I need a Google Maps API Key to use the map feature?<br />\nA: Google now requires an API key even if you are just embedding the map with an iframe. Unfortunately, we do not have any control over this and you must sign up for an API key. Google made it easy and free to sign up. You can read more about API keys here: https://developers.google.com/maps/faq</p>\n<p>Q: Why do the URLs for the contact pages not match the title of the page?<br />\nA: This plugin uses the contact page&#8217;s &#8220;slug&#8221; as the URL for syntax reasons. You can change the slug if you enable &#8220;slug&#8221; in the screen settings menu.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is my contact page displaying as a different width than the rest of my theme?<br />\nA: This plugin works best with well coded themes. Well coded themes should define the maximum content width site-wide somewhere in functions.php or in the theme files. This value is what is used to set the width of the contact pages. If you determine your max width, and add &#8220;$content-width = your_max_width_here;&#8221; to functions.php, the issue should be resolved. If you need help, contact a developer or the author of this plugin.</p>\n",
