        "description": "<p>IP Location Block plugin that allows you to block access to your site based on the visitor location while also keeping your site safe from malicious attacks. The plugin brings a smart and powerful protection methods named as &#8220;<strong>WP Zero-day Exploit Prevention</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>WP Metadata Exploit Protection</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Combined with those methods and IP address geolocation, you&#8217;ll be surprised to find a bunch of malicious or undesirable access blocked in the logs of this plugin after several days of installation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This plugin is based on the now abandoned &#8220;IP Geo Block&#8221; plugin by tokkonopapa. I fixed various issues and improved the overall codebase.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Native Geo-Location Provider</strong><br />\nIP Location Block provides <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/native-geo-location-provider/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=wporgpage&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Native Geo-Location Provider</a> that is faster, more secure and provides the needed <strong>precision</strong> for matching <strong>CITY</strong> and <strong>STATE</strong> besides the standard COUNTRY matching.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Privacy by design:</strong><br />\nIP address is always encrypted on recording in logs/cache. Moreover, it can be anonymized and restricted on sending to the 3rd parties such as geolocation APIs or whois service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Immigration control:</strong><br />\nAccess to the basic and important entrances into back-end such as <code>wp-comments-post.php</code>, <code>xmlrpc.php</code>, <code>wp-login.php</code>, <code>wp-signup.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin-ajax.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin-post.php</code> will be validated by means of a country code based on IP address. It allows you to configure either whitelist or blacklist to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements\" title=\"ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">specify the countires</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\" title=\"Classless Inter-Domain Routing - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CIDR notation</a> for a range of IP addresses and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)\" title=\"Autonomous system (Internet) - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AS number</a> for a group of IP networks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zero-day Exploit Prevention:</strong><br />\nUnlike other security firewalls based on attack patterns (vectors), the original feature &#8220;<strong>W</strong>ord<strong>P</strong>ress <strong>Z</strong>ero-day <strong>E</strong>xploit <strong>P</strong>revention&#8221; (WP-ZEP) is focused on patterns of vulnerability. It is simple but still smart and strong enough to block any malicious accesses to <code>wp-admin/*.php</code>, <code>plugins/*.php</code> and <code>themes/*.php</code> even from the permitted countries. It will protect your site against certain types of attack such as CSRF, LFI, SQLi, XSS and so on, <strong>even if you have some vulnerable plugins and themes in your site</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Guard against login attempts:</strong><br />\nIn order to prevent hacking through the login form and XML-RPC by brute-force and the reverse-brute-force attacks, the number of login attempts will be limited per IP address even from the permitted countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minimize server load against brute-force attacks:</strong><br />\nYou can configure this plugin as a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins\" title=\"Must Use Plugins &laquo; WordPress Codex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Must Use Plugins</a> so that this plugin can be loaded prior to regular plugins. It can massively <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/validation-timing/\" title=\"Validation timing | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reduce the load on server</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prevent malicious down/uploading:</strong><br />\nA malicious request such as exposing <code>wp-config.php</code> or uploading malwares via vulnerable plugins/themes can be blocked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Block badly-behaved bots and crawlers:</strong><br />\nA simple logic may help to reduce the number of rogue bots and crawlers scraping your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support of BuddyPress and bbPress:</strong><br />\nYou can configure this plugin so that a registered user can login as a membership from anywhere, while a request such as a new user registration, lost password, creating a new topic and subscribing comment can be blocked by country. It is suitable for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\" title=\"BuddyPress &mdash; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">BuddyPress</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/\" title=\"WordPress &rsaquo; bbPress &laquo; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">bbPress</a> to help reducing spams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Referrer suppressor for external links:</strong><br />\nWhen you click an external hyperlink on admin screens, http referrer will be eliminated to hide a footprint of your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple source of IP Geolocation databases:</strong><br />\nBesides the <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/native-geo-location-provider/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=wporgpage&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Native Geo-Location provider</a>, this plugin supports <a href=\"https://www.maxmind.com\" title=\"MaxMind - IP Geolocation and Online Fraud Prevention\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MaxMind GeoLite2 free databases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ip2location.com/\" title=\"IP Address Geolocation to Identify Website Visitor's Geographical Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IP2Location LITE databases</a>. Also free Geolocation REST APIs and whois information can be available for audit purposes.<br />\nFather more, <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/cloudflare-cloudfront-api-class-library/\" title=\"CloudFlare &amp; CloudFront API class library | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">dedicated API class libraries</a> can be installed for CloudFlare and CloudFront as a reverse proxy service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customizing response:</strong><br />\nHTTP response code can be selectable as <code>403 Forbidden</code> to deny access pages, <code>404 Not Found</code> to hide pages or even <code>200 OK</code> to redirect to the top page.<br />\nYou can also have a human friendly page (like <code>404.php</code>) in your parent/child theme template directory to fit your site design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Validation logs:</strong><br />\nValidation logs for useful information to audit attack patterns can be manageable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cooperation with full spec security plugin:</strong><br />\nThis plugin is lite enough to be able to cooperate with other full spec security plugin such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\" title=\"Wordfence Security &mdash; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">Wordfence Security</a>. See <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/page-speed-performance/\" title=\"Page speed performance | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this report</a> about page speed performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extendability:</strong><br />\nYou can customize the behavior of this plugin via <code>add_filter()</code> with <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/\" title=\"Codex | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre-defined filter hook</a>. See various use cases in <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/example-use-cases-for-the-developer-hooks/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">samples.php</a> bundled within this package.<br />\nYou can also get the extension <a href=\"https://github.com/ddur/WordPress-IP-Geo-Allow\" title=\"GitHub - ddur/WordPress-IP-Geo-Allow: WordPress Plugin Exension for WordPress-IP-Geo-Block Plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IP Geo Allow</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/ddur\" title=\"ddur (Dragan) - GitHub\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dragan</a>. It makes admin screens strictly private with more flexible way than specifying IP addresses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self blocking prevention and easy rescue:</strong><br />\nWebsite owners do not prefer themselves to be blocked. This plugin prevents such a sad thing unless you force it. And futhermore, if such a situation occurs, you can <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/what-should-i-do-when-im-locked-out/\" title=\"What should I do when I'm locked out? | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">rescue yourself</a> easily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clean uninstallation:</strong><br />\nNothing is left in your precious mySQL database after uninstallation.

As guarding against personal data breach, IP addresses in this plugin are encrypted and also can be anonymized by default. It also provides some functions not only to manually erase them but also to automatically remove them when those are exceeded a certain amount/time.</p>\n<p>However, these are the part of GDPR requirements and do not guarantee that the site is compliant with GDPR. Refer to <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/changelog/0-3-0-11-release-note/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">3.0.11 release note</a> for details.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20way%20to%20migrate%20from%20ip%20geo%20block%22'>\nIs there a way to migrate from IP Geo Block&#8221;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if &#8220;IP Geo Block&#8221; settings are detected, you will see migrate option in the Settings last in &#8220;Plugin Settings&#8221; section. This will copy the settings from &#8220;IP Geo Block&#8221; only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20support%20multisite%3F'>\nDoes this plugin support multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can synchronize the settings with all the sites on the network when you activate on network and enable &#8220;<strong>Network wide settings</strong>&#8221; in &#8220;<strong>Plugin settings</strong>&#8221; section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20allows%20blocking%20us%20states%2C%20country%20regions%20or%20cities%3F'>\nDoes this plugin allows blocking US States, Country Regions or Cities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

Does it work correctly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely, YES.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a WordFence Security user would report this type of claim when he/she found some accesses in its Live traffic view. But please don&#8217;t worry. Before WordPress runs, WordFence cleverly filters out malicious requests to your site using <a href=\"https://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file\" title=\"PHP: Description of core php.ini directives - Manual\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">auto_prepend_file</a> directive to include PHP based Web Application Firewall. Then this plugin validates the rest of the requests that pass over Wordfence because those were not in WAF rules, especially you enables &#8220;<strong>Prevent Zero-day Exploit</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>It would also possibly be caused by the accuracy of country code in the geolocation databases. Actually, there is a case that a same IP address has different country code.</p>\n<p>For more detail, please refer to &#8220;<a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/i-still-have-access-from-blacklisted-country/\" title=\"I still have access from blacklisted country. | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">I still have access from blacklisted country.</a>&#8220;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20test%20this%20plugin%20works%3F'>\nHow can I test this plugin works?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way is to use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=free+proxy+browser+addon\" title=\"free proxy browser addon - Google Search\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free proxy browser addon</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one is to use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=browser+add+on+modify+http+header\" title=\"browser add on modify http header - Google Search\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http header browser addon</a>.</p>\n<p>You can add an IP address to the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header to emulate the access behind the proxy.

Roughly speaking, the strategy of this plugin has been constructed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Block by country</strong><br />\nIt blocks malicious requests from outside your country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prevent Zero-day Exploit</strong><br />\nIt blocks malicious requests from your country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Force to load WP core</strong><br />\nIt blocks the request which has not been covered in the above two.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bad signatures in query</strong><br />\nIt blocks the request which has not been covered in the above three.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please try &#8220;<strong>Best for Back-end</strong>&#8221; button at the bottom of this plugin&#8217;s setting page for easy setup.

    "description": "<p>IP Location Block plugin that allows you to block access to your site based on the visitor location while also keeping your site safe from malicious attacks. The plugin brings a smart and powerful protection methods named as &#8220;<strong>WP Zero-day Exploit Prevention</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>WP Metadata Exploit Protection</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Combined with those methods and IP address geolocation, you&#8217;ll be surprised to find a bunch of malicious or undesirable access blocked in the logs of this plugin after several days of installation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This plugin is based on the now abandoned &#8220;IP Geo Block&#8221; plugin by tokkonopapa. I fixed various issues and improved the overall codebase.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Native Geo-Location Provider</strong><br />\nIP Location Block provides <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/native-geo-location-provider/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=wporgpage&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Native Geo-Location Provider</a> that is faster, more secure and provides the needed <strong>precision</strong> for matching <strong>CITY</strong> and <strong>STATE</strong> besides the standard COUNTRY matching.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Privacy by design:</strong><br />\nIP address is always encrypted on recording in logs/cache. Moreover, it can be anonymized and restricted on sending to the 3rd parties such as geolocation APIs or whois service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Immigration control:</strong><br />\nAccess to the basic and important entrances into back-end such as <code>wp-comments-post.php</code>, <code>xmlrpc.php</code>, <code>wp-login.php</code>, <code>wp-signup.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin-ajax.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin-post.php</code> will be validated by means of a country code based on IP address. It allows you to configure either whitelist or blacklist to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements\" title=\"ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">specify the countires</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\" title=\"Classless Inter-Domain Routing - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CIDR notation</a> for a range of IP addresses and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)\" title=\"Autonomous system (Internet) - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AS number</a> for a group of IP networks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zero-day Exploit Prevention:</strong><br />\nUnlike other security firewalls based on attack patterns (vectors), the original feature &#8220;<strong>W</strong>ord<strong>P</strong>ress <strong>Z</strong>ero-day <strong>E</strong>xploit <strong>P</strong>revention&#8221; (WP-ZEP) is focused on patterns of vulnerability. It is simple but still smart and strong enough to block any malicious accesses to <code>wp-admin/*.php</code>, <code>plugins/*.php</code> and <code>themes/*.php</code> even from the permitted countries. It will protect your site against certain types of attack such as CSRF, LFI, SQLi, XSS and so on, <strong>even if you have some vulnerable plugins and themes in your site</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Guard against login attempts:</strong><br />\nIn order to prevent hacking through the login form and XML-RPC by brute-force and the reverse-brute-force attacks, the number of login attempts will be limited per IP address even from the permitted countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minimize server load against brute-force attacks:</strong><br />\nYou can configure this plugin as a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins\" title=\"Must Use Plugins &laquo; WordPress Codex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Must Use Plugins</a> so that this plugin can be loaded prior to regular plugins. It can massively <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/validation-timing/\" title=\"Validation timing | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reduce the load on server</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prevent malicious down/uploading:</strong><br />\nA malicious request such as exposing <code>wp-config.php</code> or uploading malwares via vulnerable plugins/themes can be blocked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Block badly-behaved bots and crawlers:</strong><br />\nA simple logic may help to reduce the number of rogue bots and crawlers scraping your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support of BuddyPress and bbPress:</strong><br />\nYou can configure this plugin so that a registered user can login as a membership from anywhere, while a request such as a new user registration, lost password, creating a new topic and subscribing comment can be blocked by country. It is suitable for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\" title=\"BuddyPress &mdash; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">BuddyPress</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/\" title=\"WordPress &rsaquo; bbPress &laquo; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">bbPress</a> to help reducing spams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Referrer suppressor for external links:</strong><br />\nWhen you click an external hyperlink on admin screens, http referrer will be eliminated to hide a footprint of your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple source of IP Geolocation databases:</strong><br />\nBesides the <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/native-geo-location-provider/?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=wporgpage&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Native Geo-Location provider</a>, this plugin supports <a href=\"https://www.maxmind.com\" title=\"MaxMind - IP Geolocation and Online Fraud Prevention\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MaxMind GeoLite2 free databases</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ip2location.com/\" title=\"IP Address Geolocation to Identify Website Visitor's Geographical Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IP2Location LITE databases</a>. Also free Geolocation REST APIs and whois information can be available for audit purposes.<br />\nFather more, <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/cloudflare-cloudfront-api-class-library/\" title=\"CloudFlare &amp; CloudFront API class library | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">dedicated API class libraries</a> can be installed for CloudFlare and CloudFront as a reverse proxy service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customizing response:</strong><br />\nHTTP response code can be selectable as <code>403 Forbidden</code> to deny access pages, <code>404 Not Found</code> to hide pages or even <code>200 OK</code> to redirect to the top page.<br />\nYou can also have a human friendly page (like <code>404.php</code>) in your parent/child theme template directory to fit your site design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Validation logs:</strong><br />\nValidation logs for useful information to audit attack patterns can be manageable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cooperation with full spec security plugin:</strong><br />\nThis plugin is lite enough to be able to cooperate with other full spec security plugin such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\" title=\"Wordfence Security &mdash; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">Wordfence Security</a>. See <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/page-speed-performance/\" title=\"Page speed performance | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this report</a> about page speed performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extendability:</strong><br />\nYou can customize the behavior of this plugin via <code>add_filter()</code> with <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/\" title=\"Codex | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre-defined filter hook</a>. See various use cases in <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/example-use-cases-for-the-developer-hooks/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">samples.php</a> bundled within this package.<br />\nYou can also get the extension <a href=\"https://github.com/ddur/WordPress-IP-Geo-Allow\" title=\"GitHub - ddur/WordPress-IP-Geo-Allow: WordPress Plugin Exension for WordPress-IP-Geo-Block Plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IP Geo Allow</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/ddur\" title=\"ddur (Dragan) - GitHub\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dragan</a>. It makes admin screens strictly private with more flexible way than specifying IP addresses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self blocking prevention and easy rescue:</strong><br />\nWebsite owners do not prefer themselves to be blocked. This plugin prevents such a sad thing unless you force it. And futhermore, if such a situation occurs, you can <a href=\"https://iplocationblock.com/codex/what-should-i-do-when-im-locked-out/\" title=\"What should I do when I'm locked out? | IP Location Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">rescue yourself</a> easily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clean uninstallation:</strong><br />\nNothing is left in your precious mySQL database after uninstallation.
