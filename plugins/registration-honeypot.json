        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had some sites over the years that would get hit by spambots registering user accounts.  There are WordPress plugins for stopping user registration spam, but I couldn&#8217;t find any simple plugin for handling just this specific type of spam.  Plus, I hate having to go configure a lot of options that other plugins offer.</p>\n<p>I just wanted a plugin that I could set and forget.  I wanted something that would simply do its job and nothing more.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You simply need to activate it.  That&#8217;s it.  It&#8217;ll stop most spambot user registrations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this the best way to stop registration spam?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The absolute best way is to disable open user registration on your site.  A lot of WordPress users don&#8217;t need this functionality but have it turned on anyway.  You can disable it by going to &#8220;Settings &gt; General&#8221; in your WordPress admin and unticking the checkbox for &#8220;Anyone can register&#8221;.  Then, you don&#8217;t need any plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this stop all spam registrations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  This plugin was built for a specific type of spam.  It uses a simple honeypot method to stop most spambots from registering a user account on your site.  For the most part, it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve ever needed to stop spam registrations.</p>\n<p>However, it might not always work in all situations.  It really depends on what type of spam registrations you&#8217;re getting, but spambots are pretty common.  So, this should work for most people.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the &#8220;honeypot&#8221; method?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, the plugin adds a hidden input field on the WordPress user registration form.  It&#8217;s hidden to us humans, but spambots will see this field and enter text into it.  This is what we call &#8220;putting your hand in the honeypot&#8221;.  If a spambot puts his hand in it, the plugin catches it and cuts off the user registration process before a new user account is created.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a pretty simple method, but it will not stop all spammers.  It mostly just stops those that send spambots to automatically fill out forms.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
