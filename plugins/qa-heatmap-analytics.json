Setting the page cache lifetime to 10 hours or less is preferable.</li>\n<li>Some cache plugins create a cache even for bot access. QA does not record bot access. Then, while the cache is being accessed, QA will assume that it is a bot access and will not record it.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20visits%20by%20the%20administrator%20count%3F'>\nDo visits by the administrator count?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Visits by people who logged into WordPress admin are not counted.<br />\nIf you want to exclude your own visits, login the WordPress admin dashboard first, then visit your webpage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20%22qusuke%22%3F%20why%20quokka%3F'>\nWhat is &#8220;Qusuke&#8221;?
