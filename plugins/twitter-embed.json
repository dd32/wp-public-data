If you&#8217;re using twitter.com then take a close look at the tweets and you&#8217;ll see that the date of when the tweet has posted (1 hour ago, etc) is a link. That link is the one you&#8217;re looking for. If you&#8217;re using the Twitter for Mac application, you can right click any of the tweets and select View on Twitter.com which will take you to that particular tweet in your browser.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
