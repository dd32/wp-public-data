We&#8217;re not interested in raising funds or taking investment. We choose the subscription business model rather than surveillance capitalism. We&#8217;re operating a sustainable project funded solely by the fees that our subscribers pay us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plausible.io/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Visit our website</a> for full details.</p>\n<h3>Why use Plausible?</h3>\n<p>Google Analytics is frustrating to use, difficult to understand, slow to load and privacy-invasive. That&#8217;s why we built Plausible Analytics, a simple but powerful, lightweight, open source and privacy-friendly alternative.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what makes Plausible a great Google Analytics alternative and why over 12,000 paying subscribers trust us with their website and business insights:</p>\n<h3>Smooth transition from Google Analytics</h3>\n<p>Plausible features a realtime dashboard, entry pages report and integration with Search Console. You can track your paid campaigns and conversions. You can invite team members. You can even <a href=\"https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">import your historical stats from Google Analytics</a>. Learn how to get the most out of <a href=\"https://plausible.io/docs/your-plausible-experience\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">your Plausible experience</a> and join thousands who have already migrated from Google Analytics.</p>\n<h3>Simple analytics at a glance</h3>\n<p>Plausible is simple analytics. It is easy to understand and it cuts through the noise. Check your site traffic and get all the essential insights on one page in one minute. There are no layers of menus, there is no need for you to build custom reports, custom dashboards or PowerPoint documents.</p>\n<h3>Lightweight script that keeps your site speed fast</h3>\n<p>Plausible is lightweight analytics. Our script is 45 times smaller than Google Analytics. Your page weight will be cut down, your site will load faster and you&#8217;ll reduce your carbon footprint for a greener and more sustainable web. A site with 10,000 monthly visitors can save 4.5 kg of CO2 emissions per year by switching.</p>\n<h3>No need for cookie banners or GDPR consent</h3>\n<p>Plausible is privacy-friendly analytics. All the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not used and no personal data is collected. There are no persistent identifiers. No cross-site or cross-device tracking either. Your site data is not used for any other purposes. All visitor data is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies and it never leaves the EU.</p>\n<h3>Track events and marketing campaigns</h3>\n<p>Plausible is useful. Segment your audience by any metric you click on. Answer the important questions about your visitors, content and referral sources. Analyze paid campaigns using UTM parameters. Track site search terms, outbound link clicks, file downloads, 404 error pages, post authors, post categories and custom taxonomies without manually configuring anything or writing any code.</p>\n<h3>Built-in WooCommerce analytics</h3>\n<p>Plausible provides an automatic WooCommerce analytics solution to track conversions, revenue and attribution. Activities tracked include adding to cart, removing from cart, entering checkout and completing a purchase. A purchase funnel looking at the user journey from viewing a product to making a purchase is enabled to help you see the drop-off rates between the different steps, understand your cart abandonment rate and increase your conversions.</p>\n<h3>Invite team members and share your dashboard</h3>\n<p>Plausible is shareable. Your stats are private by default but you can choose to be transparent and make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them. You can also share your stats privately by generating a secure link. This link is impossible to guess but you can add password protection for extra security. You can invite team members and assign user roles too.</p>\n<h3>Transparent and open source software</h3>\n<p>Plausible is open source analytics. Our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can read it, inspect it and review it to verify that our actions match with our words. We welcome feedback and have a public roadmap. If you&#8217;re happy to manage your own infrastructure, you can self-host Plausible too.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Our product is updated several times per week and with our WordPress plugin you always have access to all the latest features</li>\n<li>Automatically includes tracking code in the header of your site</li>\n<li>Simple plugin settings page with easy options and an onboarding guide </li>\n<li>Get more accurate stats and count those who use adblockers by running the Plausible script as a first-party connection from your domain name</li>\n<li>View your Plausible stats directly in your WordPress dashboard (you can grant access to other user roles too)</li>\n<li>Tracking of admin users is disabled by default (you can also disable tracking of other user roles)</li>\n<li>Enable WooCommerce revenue, file downloads, external link clicks, site search terms and 404 error pages tracking </li>\n<li>Enable automated tracking of post authors, post categories and custom taxonomies for better content analysis</li>\n<li>Custom events and custom dimensions can be setup using CSS class names directly in the WordPress editor</li>\n<li>Integrate with Google Search Console so you can see search queries people use to find your site in Google&#8217;s search results</li>\n<li>Import your historical Google Analytics stats</li>\n<li>Keep an eye on your traffic with weekly and/or monthly email and Slack reports</li>\n<li>Get traffic spike notifications via email or Slack so you don&#8217;t miss being on the Hacker News</li>\n<li>Tag your paid ads, emails and social media posts with UTM tags and analyze your ecommerce and marketing campaigns from click to conversion using marketing funnels </li>\n<li>Filter the dashboard by any metric that you click on to get further insights.

        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Plausible Analytics, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8220;Add New&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Plausible Analytics&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n",

This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties. Since we don&#8217;t make money from targeted advertisement, we must charge a subscription fee.</p>\n<p>Revenue from subscriptions is used to pay our rent, further develop Plausible and allow us to commit to Plausible and open source full time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20demo%20available%3F'>\nIs there a demo available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can check out our demo at https://plausible.io/plausible.io</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20contribute%20to%20plausible%3F'>\nHow can I contribute to Plausible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out our GitHub repository where all the development of Plausible Analytics and of our WordPress plugin are done in the open.</p>\n<p>Main repo: https://github.com/plausible/analytics<br />\nPlugin repo: https://github.com/plausible/wordpress</p>\n<p>You can also blog and in other ways share with the world what you like about Plausible, what you use it for and how it helps you solve your challenges.
