Recommended way to use it, is to insert shortcode you need to be reloadable, then select it and click to Shortcode Ajax button. Basically, final result needs to be: [shortcode_ajax][YOUR SHORTCODE][/shortcode_ajax]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I set reloading interval?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but you need to edit main file to change it. Default is 10 000ms.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which wordpress versions are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It was developed with 3.1rc2. It should work with 2.9.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t know that. Security was not the primary goal, so if you found something, that can break wordpress, please contact me ASAP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don&#8217;t you use ajax-admin.php file for ajax requests?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I tried it. I had some problems to get it working with WP-Table Reloaded, probably caused by is_admin() check, so no shortcodes were registered and reloading tables was impossible. If you know some workaround, you could mention it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to contact you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check plugin&#8217;s main file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
