You can run the plugin on the actual site where you are developing if you don&#8217;t have<br />\na test site. There is virtually no configuration necessary to start writing tests. The overall<br />\nintention of this plugin is to make unit testing more accessible to WordPress plugin developers.</p>\n<p>PHPUnit is a very powerful tool and is great for testing PHP code including WordPress plugins.<br />\nIn fact, if you get into using WP-CLI you will notice that there is built-in support for using<br />\nPHPUnit to test your code. Pound is not intended to replace the need for PHPUnit. It is intended<br />\nto provide an easy way to get started with unit testing WordPress plugins. It&#8217;s a great option<br />\nfor small to medium sized plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is Pound different from PHPUnit?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On one hand, Pound and PHPUnit are both tools to help you run automated tests for your code.<br />\nPound is built as a WordPress plugin, and therefore really only intended to be used for WordPress<br />\ndevelopment. PHPUnit can be used to test any codebase. The main benefits of Pound over PHPUnit<br />\nare ease of use. Pound has one boolean check at the end of each tests. PHPUnit has a very large<br />\nnumber of assertions. Pound requires virtually no configuration to start using. PHPUnit requires<br />\nXML configuration files to set up your testing environment. Pound runs right in your web browser<br />\nwith clean, colorful output. PHPUnit is a command line tool.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
