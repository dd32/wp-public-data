Always create a backup of your site before taking any action that modifies your site data</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20custom%20taxonomies%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with custom taxonomies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Only the standard tag and categories taxonomies are taken into account</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20reassign%20posts%20automatically%3F'>\nDoes the plugin reassign posts automatically?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. All posts tagged or assigned to categories that are merged are automatically reassigned to the merged term.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20automatically%20create%20redirections%20for%20the%20merged%20tags%20and%20categories%3F'>\nDoes the plugin automatically create redirections for the merged tags and categories?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. If you do index individual tag and category pages (not always recommended) you will need to create the redirections manually.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20see%20too%20many%20similar%20tags%2Fcategories%20in%20the%20analysis%20page'>\nI see too many similar tags/categories in the analysis page\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try checking the <em>Equal names only</em> in the <em>Configuration</em> page to avoid considering as similars tags/categories that are substring of other ones (which could trigger many results if you use very short term names).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20merged%20a%20term%20but%20it%20shows%20up%20again%20in%20the%20list%20of%20duplicates'>\nI have merged a term but it shows up again in the list of duplicates\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some hosting provideres are very aggressive with their caching strategy and store the results of some queries to avoid recalculating them. This could produce this effect. Just ignore the duplicate, since it has been already fixed, and it will disappear on its own later on once the provider flushes the cache.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
