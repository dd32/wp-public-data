At the bottom there is a little snippet which looks like this</p>\n<p>https://tithe.ly/give?c=xxxx</p>\n<p>The four digit code (replacing the xxxx) is your Church ID</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Do I Insert My Button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two ways you can insert your button.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Insert the WP Tithely Widget into one of your sidebars. You can insert your Church ID and the text you would like the button to display, along with additional options for specifying a giving reason or amount.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can insert the button into your page content using the shortcode [tithely]. It will use the default Church ID and Button Text defined in the plugin settings, unless you include the additional attributes outlined below: [tithely button=&#8221;Donate Now&#8221; id=&#8221;12345&#8243; amount=&#8221;100&#8243; styling_class=&#8221;button&#8221; give-to=&#8221;Building Fund&#8221;]</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>What additional attributes can I use with the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>button</strong> <br />\n    The text that will appear on the button</p>\n<p><strong>id</strong><br />\n    Your Tithe.ly Church ID</p>\n<p><strong>styling_class</strong><br />\n    Optionally include a CSS class (or classes) for styling</p>\n<p><strong>amount</strong><br />\n    Optionally set a specific amount for the button</p>\n<p><strong>giving-to</strong><br />\n    Optionally set a specific purpose the money will be given to</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whilst Tithely processes payments securely &#8211; we recommend you only use the give button on a page that is protected with SSL encryption. It&#8217;s pretty cheap to add and usually costs around $30-50 a year depending on the service.
