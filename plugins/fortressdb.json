        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20free%20version%3F'>\nIs there a free version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, of course! We encourage you to try out FortressDB using the free version. The free version may provide you with everything you need, and there&#8217;s no need to upgrade if that&#8217;s the case: we&#8217;re happy to support the open source community.</p>\n<p>But if you need more storage, have multiple websites to support or want additional security measures then one of our paid subscription plans may be better for you. We offer Bronze, Silver and Gold packages, so there&#8217;s a price to suit everyone. <a href=\"https://fortressdb.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more on our Pricing page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20fortressdb%20gutenberg%20friendly%3F'>\nIs FortressDB Gutenberg friendly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, and we have our own Gutenberg blocks!</p>\n<p>We love using Gutenberg, it&#8217;s the present and the future of WordPress. To make it easy for you to use our plugin with Gutenberg, have created three types of blocks: a data table block, a Google Maps block, and a chart block. <a href=\"https://fortressdb.com/blocks/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See examples on the FortressDB website</a>.</p>\n<p>Want more blocks? <a href=\"https://help.fortressdb.com/submit-a-ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tell us what other blocks that you want us to create</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20has%20access%20to%20the%20data%3F'>\nWho has access to the data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have absolute control over who can access the data you hold. For each data table, you specify which user roles can interact with the data, and whether they should be able to create, read, update or delete.</p>\n<p>To keep things simple, the user roles in our plugin match the built-in WordPress user roles. Our plugin understands non-standard roles too, like the customer or shop manager user roles for websites with WooCommerce shops.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can choose a &#8220;Not Logged In&#8221; role for data that isn&#8217;t sensitive, or for files that you are happy for anyone to read.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20your%20servers%20located%3F'>\nWhere are your servers located?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have 3 different locations; Europe, USA and the UK. When you create an account you choose which location to use. This is beneficial for companies subject to GDPR and similar laws.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20data%20table%3F'>\nHow do I create a data table?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We designed FortressDB so that it&#8217;s simple and easy to use. You add fields in much the same way you would if you were using a form plugin.</p>\n<p>You have the power to easily create and edit data tables and manage user roles directly from the FortressDB plugin settings in your WordPress admin area.</p>\n<p>We handle all the technical bits behind the scenes for you, like creating the data table on our servers and connecting it to your WordPress website.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
