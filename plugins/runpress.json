This is no problem any longer.</p>\n<p>RunPress gives you the opportunity to query the Runtastic website by using your Runtastic username and password. It imports your Runtastic sports activities into a table of your wordpress installation.</p>\n<p>You will be capable of viewing your runtastic sports activities in the admin backend. By the use of shortcodes you&#8217;re able to show your activities on non-admin pages of your site like posts and pages. Use the shortcode generator to easily create the needed shortcodes without any programming knowledge.</p>\n<p>A widget is included to show your very latest sport activity, your high-scores or the last 5 sports activities in a table.</p>\n<p>RunPress is continuously under development. Just share your wishes with me and I&#8217;ll have a look at them.</p>\n<p>You want to see it in action? Have a look at the plugin homepage <a href=\"http://markusfrenzel.de/wordpress/?page_id=2247\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Do you think RunPress is useful for you? Then please consider to <a href=\"http://markusfrenzel.de/wordpress/?page_id=2336\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donate</a> to keep the developer motivated and the plugin up and running.</p>\n<p>ATTENTION: You MUST have CURL-Support in your PHP.INI active!</p>\n<p>RunPress is now multisite capable (implemented February 2016).</p>\n<p>Please consider a donation if you like RunPress. Every (even the smallest) donation is going to motivate the developer of RunPress to create new functions and additions to the plugin without splitting it up into a free and a buyable edition.</p>\n<h3>Importable Activities</h3>\n<p>The following Activities are importable from the Runtastic Website to your local WordPress Database</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running</li>\n<li>nordicwalking</li>\n<li>cycling</li>\n<li>mountainbiking</li>\n<li>racecycling</li>\n<li>hiking</li>\n<li>treadmill</li>\n<li>ergometer</li>\n<li>elliptical</li>\n<li>spinning</li>\n<li>handbike</li>\n<li>skating</li>\n<li>skateboarding</li>\n<li>rowing</li>\n<li>swimming</li>\n<li>crosscountryskiing</li>\n<li>skiing</li>\n<li>snowboarding</li>\n<li>backcountryskiing</li>\n<li>sledding</li>\n<li>motorbiking</li>\n<li>walking</li>\n<li>riding</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>I like RunPress very much. Is it possible to donate to you to show my appreciation to your development?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. Just place your <a href=\"http://markusfrenzel.de/wordpress/?page_id=2336\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donation</a> here. Even the smallest value will motivate me to keep the development up and running.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I get a fatal error: Call to undefined function curl_init()</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses the PHP curl library. Ask your provider to install / activate the curl library if it is not available on your system.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there some kind of tutorial?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have a look at the plugins webpage <a href=\"http://markusfrenzel.de/wordpress/?page_id=2247\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I find documentation on the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"http://markusfrenzel.de/wordpress/?page_id=2247\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Webpage</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve installed and configured the plugin but I do not see any sports activities on my webpage!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve got to import your activities from Runtastic into your wordpress database and setup a shortcode to display your data in your webpage. Have a look at the admin page, &#8220;RunPress&#8221;, &#8220;Local DB&#8221; or check the documentation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I display my activities on my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible in post and pages (via shortcodes) and there is also a widget to display your very latest sport activity, your High-Scores or the last 5 sports activities in the sidebar of your wordpress page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I create a shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way is to use the integrated shortcode generator. It is located in your admin page, &#8220;RunPress&#8221;, &#8220;Shortcode Generator&#8221;. There a also some examples mentioned.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will happen to the data if I uninstall the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on how you configured RunPress! I&#8217;ve implemented an option which allows you to deactivate or deinstall the plugin without the loss of your data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve forgotten to set the option of deleting all data and uninstalled your plugin. Which table do I have to delete on my database to get rid of the runtastic data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The table is labeled with your MySQL table prefix of your wordpress installation (default: wp_) plus &#8220;runpress_db&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
