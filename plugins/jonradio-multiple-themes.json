If you need a timely reply from the developer, please <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/submit-ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open a ticket</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Settings provide many different ways to Select which Theme should appear where on your WordPress web site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just for Site Home</li>\n<li>By URL (Version 5 adds support for Query keyword=value as part of a unique URL);</li>\n<li>By Prefix URL, matching all URLs that begin with the same characters (&#8220;Prefix URL&#8221;);</li>\n<li>By Wildcard Prefix URL with one or more Asterisks (&#8220;*&#8221;) representing arbritrary subdirectories in the URL;</li>\n<li>By Query Keyword found in any URL, not matter what the Value;</li>\n<li>By Query keyword=value found in any URL;</li>\n<li>By Sticky Query keyword=value that sets the Theme for a given Visitor until an Override Query keyword=value is found in a future URL (Advanced Setting requiring the Visitor&#8217;s browser to accept Cookies; incompatible with certain plugins that block Cookies);</li>\n<li>Everywhere (Advanced Setting that overrides the WordPress Active Theme);</li>\n<li>All Pages (Advanced Setting that works with most, but not all, Themes and Plugins);</li>\n<li>All Posts (Advanced Setting that works with most, but not all, Themes and Plugins).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of the Themes in the WordPress Theme Directory alter the appearance of the WordPress Admin panels.  As a result, this plugin does not allow Theme Selection entries to specify URLs for WordPress Admin panels.</p>\n<p><strong>Use with Paid Themes</strong>:  On-going full scale testing of Themes by this plugin&#8217;s author is only possible if the Theme is found in the WordPress Theme Directory.  Although (Version 5 of) this plugin should now work with all Themes, any problems encountered while using Paid Themes will be difficult to diagnose.  As described in the FAQ tab, a WordPress Network (Multisite) is an alternative to this plugin, as a way to create a single web site with more than one Theme.</p>\n<p>A similar situation exists with Paid Plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>Use with Plugins that Cache</strong>:  You may find that you have to flush the Cache whenever you change Settings in the <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> plugin. Some Caching plugins only cache for visitors who are not logged in as users, so be sure to log out before testing the results of your <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Templates, Background, Header, etc.)?</strong>:  After installing and activating the plugin, see the plugin&#8217;s Settings page and click on the <strong>Theme Options</strong> tab for important information on changing Options for Themes other than the Active Theme.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Works</strong>:  The plugin does not change the Active Theme defined to WordPress in the Appearances-Themes Admin panel.  Instead, it dynamically (and selectively) overrides that setting.  Which means that simply deactivating (or deleting) this plugin will restore the way that Themes were displayed prior to installing this plugin.  However, in some situations, it is possible to inadvertently alter Theme Options for the Active Theme when using either of the Methods described on the plugin&#8217;s Setting page Theme Options tab.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Adoption Notice</strong><br />\n  This plugin was recently adopted by David Gewirtz and ongoing support and updates will continue. Feel free to visit <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/lab-notes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">David&#8217;s Lab Notes</a> for additional details and to sign up for emailed news updates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Special thanks to Jon &#8216;jonradio&#8217; Pearkins for creating the plugin and making adoption possible.</p>\n",

Please visit the new <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/forums/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ZATZLabs Forums</a>. If you need a timely reply from the developer, please <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/submit-ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open a ticket</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>This section describes how to install the <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use <strong>Add Plugin</strong> within the WordPress Admin panel to download and install this <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> plugin from the WordPress.org plugin repository (preferred method).  Or download and unzip this plugin, then upload the <code>/jonradio-multiple-themes/</code> directory to your WordPress web site&#8217;s <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> plugin through the <strong>Installed Plugins</strong> Admin panel in WordPress.  If you have a WordPress Network (&#8220;Multisite&#8221;), you can either <strong>Network Activate</strong> this plugin through the <strong>Installed Plugins</strong> Network Admin panel, or Activate it individually on the sites where you wish to use it.  Activating on individual sites within a Network avoids some of the confusion created by WordPress&#8217; hiding of Network Activated plugins on the Plugin menu of individual sites.  Alternatively, to avoid this confusion, you can install the <em>jonradio Reveal Network Activated Plugins</em> plugin.</li>\n<li>Be sure that all Themes you plan to use have been installed.</li>\n<li>Select Themes to be used on the Settings or Advanced Settings tab of the plugin&#8217;s <strong>Multiple Themes plugin</strong> Settings page in the WordPress Admin panels, which is found in both the <strong>Appearance</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong> sections.  You can also get to this Settings page by clicking on the <strong>Settings</strong> link for this plugin on the <strong>Installed Plugins</strong> page of the Admin panel.</li>\n<li>If you need to change Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Templates, Background, Header, etc.) for any Theme <em>other than</em> the Active Theme, see the plugin&#8217;s Settings page and click on the <strong>Theme Options</strong> tab for important information.</li>\n</ol>\n",

If you need a timely reply from the developer, please <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/submit-ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open a ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>If we cannot solve the problem, please consider using a WordPress Network.  One install of WordPress allows you to have multiple separate Sites (&#8220;MultiSite&#8221;), each with a different Theme, without using the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin.  The sites can look to the outside world as if they are just one web site by using the Sub-directories option.  For example, Site 1 would be at example.com, and Site 2 could be at example.com/forum.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20paid%20themes%3F'>\nWill this plugin work with Paid Themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With the massive rewrite of Theme Selection logic in Version 5 of this plugin, it should now work with all Paid Themes and Plugins.  But we have only tested the few Paid Themes whose authors have provided us with permission to use, without charge, their themes for test purposes.  Elegant, for example, allows us to accept copies of its Themes provided by its customers who require assistance with the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin.  On the other hand, some other Paid Theme authors have simply ignored our requests, despite our stated willingness to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p>\n<p>We do encourage you to contact us if you run into problems when using the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin with a Paid Theme, as the problem may not be unique to the Paid Theme.</p>\n<p>To state the obvious, the cost of purchasing a license for all Paid Themes for testing purposes is prohibitive for an Open Source plugin such as this one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20theme%20options%20%28widgets%2C%20sidebars%2C%20menus%2C%20background%2C%20header%2C%20etc.%29%20used%20for%20each%20theme%3F'>\nHow do I change the Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Background, Header, etc.) used for each Theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the Active Theme, nothing changes when using the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin.  For other Themes, selected using this plugin, changing Theme Options is explained, in detail, on the Theme Options tab of the plugin&#8217;s Settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20template%20for%20a%20specific%20page%20or%20post%3F'>\nHow do I change the Template for a specific Page or Post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the Current Theme, nothing changes when using the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin.  For a Page or Post where another Theme is displayed, as selected by this plugin&#8217;s Settings, specifying the Template to be used is explained, in detail, on the Theme Options tab of the plugin&#8217;s Settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20select%20a%20theme%20for%20a%20category%20of%20posts%3F'>\nHow do I select a Theme for a Category of Posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That functionality, to directly specify a Theme for a Category on the Settings page, is being investigated for a future version of the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin.  But there is already a solution based on Permalinks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the WordPress Admin panels, go to Settings-Permalinks</li>\n<li>Specify a Permalinks structure that begins with /%category%/</li>\n<li>Push the Save Changes button</li>\n<li>Go to Settings-Multiple Themes plugin</li>\n<li>In the Section &#8220;For An Individual Page, Post or other non-Admin page&#8221;, select the Theme for the Category of Posts</li>\n<li>Enter the URL of the Categories page, e.g. &#8211; http://domain.com/news/</li>\n<li>Click the checkbox &#8220;Select here if URL is a Prefix&#8221;</li>\n<li>Push the Save Changes button</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20edit%20a%20theme%3F'>\nHow do I Edit a Theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress includes a built-in Theme Editor.  Select Editor in the Admin panel&#8217;s Appearance menu items on the left sidebar.</p>\n<p>By default, the style.css file of the Current Theme is displayed.  You can edit other Themes by selecting them in the &#8220;Select theme to edit&#8221; field and clicking the Select button.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can edit any Theme on your own computer.  If your computer runs Windows, NotePad++ and FileZilla run very well together, using FileZilla&#8217;s View/Edit feature to provide a Theme Editor with syntax highlighting and other advanced features.</p>\n<p>If one or more of the Active Themes have their own Theme Editor or other type of Theme Options panels, such as Elegant&#8217;s epanel, please read the next FAQ.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20elegant%27s%20epanel%3F'>\nHow do I use Elegant&#8217;s epanel?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing changes for the Current Theme.  epanel can be accessed just as it would be without the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin, simply by selecting the WordPress Admin panel&#8217;s Appearance submenu item titled Theme Options preceded by the name of your Elegant Theme.</p>\n<p>To make changes to other Active Themes that you will be specifying with the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate jonradio Multiple Themes </li>\n<li>Install the Theme Test Drive plugin found at https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-test-drive/</li>\n<li>Activate the Theme Test Drive plugin</li>\n<li>Go to Appearance-Theme Test Drive </li>\n<li>In the Usage section, select an alternate Theme you will be using with jonradio Multiple Themes </li>\n<li>Push the Enable Theme Drive button at the bottom </li>\n<li>Click on the Appearance menu item on the left sidebar of the WordPress Admin panel to refresh the submenu</li>\n<li>Click on the submenu item titled with your Elegant theme&#8217;s name followed by &#8220;Theme Options&#8221;</li>\n<li>Elegant&#8217;s epanel will now appear</li>\n<li>Make all the changes for this Theme, being sure to push the Save button</li>\n<li>If you have more than one alternate Theme with Options you wish to change, repeat Steps 4-10 for each alternate Theme </li>\n<li>Deactivate the Theme Test Drive plugin </li>\n<li>Activate jonradio Multiple Themes</li>\n<li>Changes to the Options for the Current Theme can now be made normally, just as you would without either plugin</li>\n<li>Both the alternate and Current Themes should now display all Theme options properly when selected through the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks to Elegant for allowing us to test copies of any of their Themes provided by their customers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20i%20change%20permalinks%3F'>\nWhat happens when I change Permalinks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although it depends on what kind of change you make to your Permalink structure, you should expect to have to replace (delete and add) all of the plugin&#8217;s Settings that specify a URL.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20added%20a%20new%20entry%20but%20why%20doesn%27t%20it%20appear%20in%20the%20list%20of%20entries%3F'>\nI added a new entry but why doesn&#8217;t it appear in the list of entries?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should have seen an explanatory error message after hitting the Save Changes button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20theme%20for%20an%20entry%3F'>\nHow can I change the Theme for an entry?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need to delete the entry and add it again, with the new Theme specified.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

If you need a timely reply from the developer, please <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/submit-ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open a ticket</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>Settings provide many different ways to Select which Theme should appear where on your WordPress web site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just for Site Home</li>\n<li>By URL (Version 5 adds support for Query keyword=value as part of a unique URL);</li>\n<li>By Prefix URL, matching all URLs that begin with the same characters (&#8220;Prefix URL&#8221;);</li>\n<li>By Wildcard Prefix URL with one or more Asterisks (&#8220;*&#8221;) representing arbritrary subdirectories in the URL;</li>\n<li>By Query Keyword found in any URL, not matter what the Value;</li>\n<li>By Query keyword=value found in any URL;</li>\n<li>By Sticky Query keyword=value that sets the Theme for a given Visitor until an Override Query keyword=value is found in a future URL (Advanced Setting requiring the Visitor&#8217;s browser to accept Cookies; incompatible with certain plugins that block Cookies);</li>\n<li>Everywhere (Advanced Setting that overrides the WordPress Active Theme);</li>\n<li>All Pages (Advanced Setting that works with most, but not all, Themes and Plugins);</li>\n<li>All Posts (Advanced Setting that works with most, but not all, Themes and Plugins).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of the Themes in the WordPress Theme Directory alter the appearance of the WordPress Admin panels.  As a result, this plugin does not allow Theme Selection entries to specify URLs for WordPress Admin panels.</p>\n<p><strong>Use with Paid Themes</strong>:  On-going full scale testing of Themes by this plugin&#8217;s author is only possible if the Theme is found in the WordPress Theme Directory.  Although (Version 5 of) this plugin should now work with all Themes, any problems encountered while using Paid Themes will be difficult to diagnose.  As described in the FAQ tab, a WordPress Network (Multisite) is an alternative to this plugin, as a way to create a single web site with more than one Theme.</p>\n<p>A similar situation exists with Paid Plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>Use with Plugins that Cache</strong>:  You may find that you have to flush the Cache whenever you change Settings in the <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> plugin. Some Caching plugins only cache for visitors who are not logged in as users, so be sure to log out before testing the results of your <em>jonradio Multiple Themes</em> settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Templates, Background, Header, etc.)?</strong>:  After installing and activating the plugin, see the plugin&#8217;s Settings page and click on the <strong>Theme Options</strong> tab for important information on changing Options for Themes other than the Active Theme.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Works</strong>:  The plugin does not change the Active Theme defined to WordPress in the Appearances-Themes Admin panel.  Instead, it dynamically (and selectively) overrides that setting.  Which means that simply deactivating (or deleting) this plugin will restore the way that Themes were displayed prior to installing this plugin.  However, in some situations, it is possible to inadvertently alter Theme Options for the Active Theme when using either of the Methods described on the plugin&#8217;s Setting page Theme Options tab.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Adoption Notice</strong><br />\n  This plugin was recently adopted by David Gewirtz and ongoing support and updates will continue. Feel free to visit <a href=\"http://zatzlabs.com/lab-notes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">David&#8217;s Lab Notes</a> for additional details and to sign up for emailed news updates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Special thanks to Jon &#8216;jonradio&#8217; Pearkins for creating the plugin and making adoption possible.</p>\n",
