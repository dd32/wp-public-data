This information<br />\nis found after clicking &#8216;Get HTML&#8217; for the form you wish to use, and then selecting the &#8216;Raw<br />\nHTML Version&#8217;. Using the new form generator utility, at the end you will need to select &#8216;I Will<br />\nInstall My Form&#8217; to access the &#8216;Raw HTML Version&#8217;.</li>\n<li>The plugin will now automatically integrate with the WordPress registration process unless<br />\nyour settings reflect otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Will the user automatically be registered with AWeber?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The user will still receive a confirmation email from AWeber confirming their intent to register<br />\nfor your mailings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I deactivate the plugin will my settings remain?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Deactivating the plugin through the WordPress Plugin menu will trigger a built in &#8216;clean-up&#8217;<br />\nfunction that will uninstall the plugin. If you wish to turn off the plugin temporarily, you can<br />\nuse the built in setting found in the &#8216;AWeber Integration&#8217; menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are the registered users shown on the Registered Users screen the same as in my AWeber account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. The Registered Users section allows you to see which of your members elected to<br />\nregister with your AWeber account when they signed up with your website. However, since AWeber a<br />\nlso sends a confirmation email before submitting the user&#8217;s information, there is a chance they<br />\nmight not have signed up, thus creating an inconsistency between your AWeber control panel, and<br />\nWordPress users screen. This feature is intended to give you an idea of how many users have elected<br />\nto register without having to go to AWeber to find out.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
