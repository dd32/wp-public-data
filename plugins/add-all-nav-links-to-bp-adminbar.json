Does this plugin affect the adminbar on member sub-blogs too?</strong><br />\nNo. This plugin combines all nav elements on the main site only. The adminbar on sub-blogs remains unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m running WP2.x. How can I prevent specific WP pages from appearing in the menus?</strong><br />\nIn WordPress 2.x installs, this plugin will show ALL your pages in dropdowns by default. If you want to exclude certain WP2.x pages from your menu, install Simon Wheatley&#8217;s excellent &#8220;Exclude Pages from Navigation&#8221; plugin. You can install it through your WordPress dashboard or download it from the repository here: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exclude-pages/ But even with the &#8220;Exclude Pages&#8221; plugin installed, invisible gremlins may cause some WP pages to appear in the backend in some installs (it happened to me). If this happens, go to line 159 of bp-wp-navbar.php and add a comma seperated list of the page IDs of those you want to make go away. Example: wp_list_pages( &#8216;title_li=&amp;depth=20&amp;exclude=100,222,345,1499&#8217; );</p>\n<p><strong>Does this plugin work with any theme?</strong><br />\nIt modifies the behavior of the bp-adminbar, so if Buddypress is installed and your theme is a child theme of bp-default, it will work. Some custom themes may require code adjustments in bp-wp-navbar.php. For example, the user configuration option to hide/show the main nav targets &#8220;ul#nav&#8221;. If your theme uses a different container ID for its main navigation, and you want the plugin to hide it, you will need to change that ID in the hide_main_nav function in bp-wp-navbar.php.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I change my Buddypress component slugs with this plugin?</strong><br />\nNo. It is not advisable for a plugin to change labels or slugs. See the Buddypress codex <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/how-to-guides/customizing-labels-messages-and-urls/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> to learn how to do it the right way.</p>\n<p><strong>I love this thing! Where can I donate?</strong><br />\nYou can show your love by making a donation to help support addiction recovery here: http://nowrecovery.com (donate button in the sidebar).<br />\n<strong>Thanks!</strong></p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.1.2</h4>\n<p>Bug fix! Some users were finding that WP/BP menus were not displaying at all. Yikes!
