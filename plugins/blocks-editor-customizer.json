This plugin allows setting the desired field width for the main editor and the sidebar. And not only that: Gutenberg Customizer provides the Dark Mode for the editor. Configure your work area and let it aid your productivity, not hamper it.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Editor width</strong></p>\n<p>Planning to have a full-screen paragraph on a page? Want to see how long lines of text would look? Customizing the width of the editor can come in really handy in cases like that &#8211; and in many more.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>2. Sidebar width</strong></p>\n<p>Now it’s up to you how much room to leave for tools. Gutenberg Customizer will let you stretch or shrink the sidebar to the perfect size so that it attracts just the right amount of attention.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Dark mode</strong></p>\n<p>However convenient the block editor is, it’s far from pleasant to work in it when it’s much brighter than the surroundings. The Dark Mode feature of the Gutenberg customizer plugin ensures your eyes are comfortable in dim light.</p>\n<p>Coming soon: Eye Care Mode</p>\n<p>Improve your work conditions even more! With the next update, we’re adding the Eye Care Mode with warmer colors. Too much blue light from digital screens is no good for the eyes.
