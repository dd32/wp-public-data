        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this plugin allow me to display my tracks using the SoundCloud player anywhere on the front-end of my site including widget areas?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. To display the SoundCloud player with one of your tracks you simply need to use the plugin&#8217;s shortcode and specify the<br />\nURL of your track. For example:<br />\n[soundcloud_ultimate track=http://soundcloud.com/yoursoundcloudname/your-track-name]</p>\n<p>If you want to display a SoundCloud player in the WordPress widget area you simply need to place the above<br />\nshortcode inside a &#8220;text&#8221; widget.<br />\n(Note: you can easily get the value of your &#8220;track&#8221; url from the plugin&#8217;s administration page by going to the &#8220;Manage Tracks&#8221; tab and copying the &#8220;Track URL&#8221; value)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I set the track to autoplay when I use the player shortcode mentioned above?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. To make a track automatically play when displaying SoundCloud player using the plugin&#8217;s shortcode just specify &#8220;auto_play=true&#8221; option in the shortcode. For example:</p>\n<p>[soundcloud_ultimate track=http://soundcloud.com/yoursoundcloudname/your-track-name auto_play=true]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin allow me to display tracks with the SoundCloud player on the front-end of my site which are from someone else&#8217;s account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can display any SoundCloud track as long as its owner has allowed it to be publicly shown by using the shortcode discussed<br />\nin the section above and pasting the approriate URL of the track.<br />\nNOTE: in the administration settings pages of this plugin you will only have access to tracks from your account.</p>\n<p>Go to the plugins webpage for more details about usage and configuration: <a href=\"http://wpsolutions-hq.com/soundcloud-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp-soundcloud-ultimate</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
