If you want to use it in full capacity, consider getting <a href=\"https://shop.milandinic.com/downloads/simple-email-queue-plus/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plus version</a>.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>First, you need to set what is maximum number of emails that can be sent in a given period. By default, it sends 10 emails in 6 minutes. This means that if you want to send 15 emails in 6 minutes, only 10 emails are sent while rest 5 emails are put in queue and sent in the next period, after 6th minute has passed.</p>\n<p>You can change this limits by using filters from you code. Filter <code>simple_email_queue_max</code> is used to set maximum number of emails that are sent in period. It expects positive integer to be passed.</p>\n<p>To change period length, you can use filter <code>simple_email_queue_interval</code>. It also expects positive integer to be passed but please take care that this number is of seconds, not minutes (for example, if your period is 30 minutes, you would pass <code>1800</code>).</p>\n<p>Different hosts use different limits. Please consult your host&#8217;s documentation or support to find this out.</p>\n<p>If you want user interface in your admin area, use <a href=\"https://shop.milandinic.com/downloads/simple-email-queue-plus/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plus version</a>.</p>\n<p>To use this limits, you need to use function <code>simple_email_queue_add()</code> instead of built-in function <code>wp_mail()</code>. Both accept same parameters.<br />\nEmails that are sent using <code>wp_mail()</code> function are not sent using queue and are not counted for limits. If you want that all emails are sent using queue, even those sent using <code>wp_mail()</code> function, use <a href=\"https://shop.milandinic.com/downloads/simple-email-queue-plus/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plus version</a>.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s on <a href=\"https://github.com/dimadin/simple-email-queue\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n",
