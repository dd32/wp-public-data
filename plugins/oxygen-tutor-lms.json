        "description": "<p>This plugin integrates Tutor LMS with the popular Oxygen Page Builder plugin. It adds all the functionalities needed to create a complete WordPress LMS website using Oxygen Builder.</p>\n<p>To use this plugin, you must first have all the plugins installed and activated. The required plugins are:<br />\n *<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor/\" rel=\"ugc\">Tutor LMS (Free/Pro)</a><br />\n *Integration Plugin<br />\n *<a href=\"https://oxygenbuilder.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Oxygen Builder</a></p>\n<h4>What Oxygen Builder Brings to Tutor LMS</h4>\n<p>Oxygen builder is a very unique and robust page builder, and you can practically create your custom made theme for an LMS platform. Thus you don&#8217;t have to rely on other third-party themes and make your website from the ground up exactly the way you want it.</p>\n<p>Oxygen Builder provides a plethora of features like the header builder, huge design library, and full responsiveness controls. Moreover, it also comes with a library of pre-made design sets that can be imported directly to create rich webpages. We believe with this integration activated, you can create an amazing platform for your instructors and students alike.</p>\n<h4>Oxygen Visual Editor</h4>\n<p>Like all other Oxygen enabled sites, installing Oxygen will strip out all the visuals of your old site. The visuals will now be controlled by Oxygen&#8217;s templates. Therefore, your theme will basically be useless. You will have to create Oxygen templates to properly show your content in a usable layout.</p>\n<p>With this integration plugin enabled, you will see a brand new tab in the editor. This tab labeled &#8220;Tutor LMS&#8221; contains all the necessary elements needed to build a perfect LMS website. Whether you&#8217;re a designer or a WordPress developer, it will suit all your needs.<br />\nThere are two ways of creating a course page, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a single course template</li>\n<li>Build your custom design using single course elements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you add the single course template, you&#8217;ll be able to edit each of the elements. But you won&#8217;t be able to change the layout of the course page itself. To do so, you&#8217;ll need to create a custom course layout with all the necessary elements.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with the Oxygen Builder plugin, creating a new custom layout with custom headers and footers should be a breeze. We&#8217;ve added all the necessary elements needed to create a full Tutor LMS website. We‚Äôve broken down all of Tutor LMS into small elements that you can now use to create a customizable layout for all Tutor LMS pages like course page, quiz page, archive page, and so on.</p>\n<p>To read about every aspect of this plugin, please refer to our <a href=\"https://www.themeum.com/docs/oxygen-builder-introduction/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation on the Oxygen Builder</a> integration plugin. You will find all the information on this plugin in our documentation website.</p>\n",
