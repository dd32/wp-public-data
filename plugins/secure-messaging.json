It <em>does not</em> check for PHP compatibility directly and <em>will not work</em> if installed on an older server.</p>\n<p>The GPG functionality requires GPG to be installed and available to WordPress. The plugin will try to test for this functionality upon activation, but <em>will not work</em> if GPG is unavailable.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>/secure-messaging</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate Secure Messaging through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the server sign messages as well?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not by default. On many installations, the GPG keychain folder needs to live in the <code>/wp-content</code> directory and might be readable by third parties. To avoid leaking GPG secret keys, none are ever added by the system in the first place. This means the server can&#8217;t sign messages before they&#8217;re sent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a limit to the size of the GPG key I can use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not to my knowledge. We&#8217;re using Pear&#8217;s <a href=\"http://pear.php.net/package/Crypt_GPG\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Crypt_GPG</a> module, which defer&#8217;s to the server&#8217;s GPG module directly. So long as GPG itself supports a key, this plugin will as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if my host doesn&#8217;t support GPG?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not every host does. Most self-hosting platforms will have GPG support by default, but some (like <em>WP Engine</em>) do not support the GPG subsystem and will not allow you to proactively encrypt messages.</p>\n<p>I highly suggest you look into a managed host like <a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/managedwordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Liquid Web</a>, who <em>does</em> support GPG, for your hosting needs.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> This plugin has been tested to work with both Liquid Web&#8217;s managed WordPress hosting platform and the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/wp-local-docker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dockerized WordPress</a> system published by <a href=\"https://10up.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">10up</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
