        "description": "<p>Private URL is a plugin for sharing private posts through a special private url which is accessible without requiring readers to register or enter a password.  Private URLs have a structure similar to <code>/private/293/df8eb1583b052b59e2cafc4327214d0/</code>.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>When you edit a private post a new options panel will become available called <em>Private URL</em>.  This provides the private url and a means for changing the <em>salt</em> for the post.  The url is a publicly accessible version of the private post and typically of the form: <code>/private/293/df8eb1583b052b59e2cafc4327214d0/</code></p>\n<h3>What is the <em>salt</em>?</h3>\n<p>The salt is responsible to generating the private url for each post.  It is similar to a passphrase.  By default all posts use the salt provided in the settings page for Private URL.  However, you can specify a post specific salt using the Private URL options panel while editing a post.</p>\n<p>Modifying the salt for a post will cause it to have a new private url and the post&#8217;s old private url will no longer function.  This can be used as a means to <em>expire</em> an old private url for the post.  Changing the default salt in the options menu will cause all posts without their own salt to have new private urls.</p>\n",
