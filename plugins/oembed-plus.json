However, Facebook removed this legacy API in October 2020, and this plugin implements the new APIs to bring back support for Facebook and Instagram content embedding.</p>\n<p>Note that you will need to register a Facebook developer account and create an app to get API credentials that this plugin uses.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='wordpress%20already%20supports%20this%20feature%20in%20core'>\nWordPress already supports this feature in core\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but only in versions prior to 5.5.1, and it used a legacy API that stopped working after October 24, 2020.<br />\nSee <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50861\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#50861</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20version%20requires%20php%207.1'>\nThis version requires PHP 7.1\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin requires PHP 7.1 or later. That is by design.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20add%20support%20for%20service%20x%3F'>\nCan you add support for service X?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. This plugin is intended to bring back functionality the WordPress core eventually drops.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20the%20api%20id%20and%20secret%3F'>\nHow do I set the API ID and secret?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to Settings -&gt; Writing, and you will see a section to enter Facebook App ID and Secret.</p>\n<p>Alternately, you can set the Facebook App ID and secret in the <code>wp-config.php</code> file. If they are set in the <code>wp-config.php</code> file, the settings form in Settings -&gt; Writing section will be disabled.<br />\nTo enter the Facebook App ID and secret, update the <code>wp-config.php</code> file in root of your WordPress installation, and append the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code>define('OEMBED_PLUS_FACEBOOK_APP_ID', '&lt;App ID Here&gt;');\ndefine('OEMBED_PLUS_FACEBOOK_SECRET', '&lt;Secret Here&gt;');\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='optionally%20hide%20the%20admin%20ui'>\nOptionally hide the admin UI\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible to completely hide the administration form added by this plugin in Admin <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Settings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Writing page. This can be helpful if you set the configuration values in the <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and keep the administration UI minimal.</p>\n<p>To hide the administration form, update the <code>wp-config.php</code> file with an extra line:</p>\n<pre><code>define('OEMBED_PLUS_HIDE_ADMIN_UI', true);\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",

It&#8217;s strongly suggested to use more recent and supported PHP versions nonetheless.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1.5</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates to the readme file to make it more clear that this plugin supports both Classic Editor and Block Editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1.6</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the plugin minimum WordPress core requirement to 4.9, along with relevant compatibility changes. The plugin works on all WordPress versions from 4.9 through 5.6 and up.</li>\n</ul>\n"
