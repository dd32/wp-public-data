        "faq": "\n<h4>How does the autolanguage detection works?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For that to work you must have the plugin qTranslate installed and enabled.<br />\nThe GoogleWeather4WP plugin detect&#8217;s the selected language in qTranslate and tries to show acording it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about the language by default?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default language acts if the qTranslate plugin is not installed, or if it cannot detect the used language by qTranslate.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i change the icons to match my style?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. Just head with ftp or file manager to wp-content/plugins/google-weather-4-wp/imgs/ and replate the images.<br />\nDont forget to mantain the icons names.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The widget content is showing nicely in the language i had selected with qTranslate, but the widget title no, is it a bug?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. That is not a bug. For the widget title to change acording to qTranslate language, you must make it this way:<br />\n[:en]widget title in en[:fr]widget de titre en fr[:XX]widget title in XX language<br />\nif you type that in the widget title in the widget configuration, qTranslate will make it availiable in the defined languages.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
