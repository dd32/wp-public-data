You MUST have a Oh Hey World account to use this plugin.</p>\n<p>With the Oh Hey World plugin, travel bloggers can quickly and easily keep their current location up to date using what WordPress calls &#8220;shortcodes&#8221; and into their sidebars using the included widget. Rather than manually changing text within the theme to update your location, you can check-in when you arrive at a new location with one click and that will automatically update the location listed on your travel blog, share your location on Twitter and Facebook, and email or text your parents, significant other, and/or close friends.</p>\n<p>In addition to the sidebar widget, there are two shortcodes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[currentlocation user_slug=&#8221;username&#8221;] &#8211; Pulls in the pure text of your latest check-in on Oh Hey World. For example, if you are checked-in to New York, the text returned will be &#8220;New York, New York, United States&#8221;.</li>\n<li>[currentbadge user_slug=&#8221;username&#8221;] &#8211; Pulls in the widebar widet and embeds it inside of a page or post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Important Notes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your user name can be found in the URL structure of your profile.

        "faq": "\n<h4>How long does it take for my travel blog to update once I check-in on Oh Hey World?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Oh Hey World plugin caches the results for 60 seconds. If a recent check-in is not updating on your blog quickly, it&#8217;s likely the result of a plugin (such as WP Super Cache) that caches your site to improve load time. To resolve, adjust your caching settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I style the widget with custom CSS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widget currently automatically takes on the CSS of your WordPress theme. Longer term  &#8211; we know some people want custom CSS controls, and it’s on our list of enhancements we’re considering.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if the plugin doesn’t work with my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’ve worked hard to make this plugin work on as many themes as possible, but it’s impossible for us to ensure it works with every single theme ever created. Unfortunately we can’t troubleshoot code on individual sites at this time. That said, please leave feedback via our feedback form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I suggest improvements or report bugs with the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please submit them via the feedback page on Oh Hey World.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
