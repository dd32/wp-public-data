        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this work with any theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t guarantee that it works in all themes, but it now works with many more than in earlier versions. It has been tested in Twenty Ten through Twenty Thirteen, themes based on Automattic&#8217;s Underscores base theme, and a number of others. The plugin looks for the &#8220;navigation&#8221; ARIA role rather than any particular ID, so it should work in most themes that correctly implement roles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about child themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin works in a parent theme, it should work in child themes based on that parent. However, because of the nature of child themes, this cannot be guaranteed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Extend to multiple themes: now works with all the Twenties, themes based on Underscores, and many others, provided they correctly use ARIA role=navigation for menus.</li>\n<li>JavaScript refactoring for better performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue that caused the keyboard access code to break mobile navigation.</li>\n<li>Completely replace the original JavaScript to modernize the code and allow for licensing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-release build for client needs. Compatible with Twenty Twelve &amp; Twenty Thirteen.</li>\n<li>Correctly enqueue scripts.</li>\n<li>Reformat README for Plugin Repo submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Original version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
