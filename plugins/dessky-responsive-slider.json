The fastest approach is to use a tool like Firebug to find the snippet you need to override. Then copy it to your theme CSS file (usually &#8216;style.css&#8217;) and edit it there, using a CSS selector with higher priority.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20more%20than%20one%20slider%3F'>\nCan I create more than one slider?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently the plugin can create only one slider.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
