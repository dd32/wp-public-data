The plugin retrieves and parses and RSS feed from your theater&#8217;s Audience1st installation, and renders each performance&#8217;s availability using a simple &#8220;color thermometer&#8221; to indicate whether seat availability is excellent (green), limited (yellow), or sold out/nearly sold out (red).
