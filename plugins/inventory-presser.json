Enables the Load Sample Vehicles button to insert more than 10 vehicles. Stops telling dashboard users when the aspect ratio of thumbnails is not that of a common smartphone camera. Allows a location term street address to be entered on the add term form instead of requiring users to save a location term first.</p>",
        "14.11.2": "<p>Compatibility fixes for WordPress 6.3. Stops using the <code>enqueue_block_editor_assets</code> hook in favor of the new <code>enqueue_block_assets</code>. Stops using the <code>post__not_in</code> query variable on the <code>parse_query</code> hook. Compatibility fixes for PHP 8.1. Stop sending null to the first parameter of strpos(). Stop sending a non-string file name to wp_get_image_mime(). Prevent queries from returning an unlimited number of posts. Caps queries for vehicle photos to 1000. Fixes the Grid Widget to obey the &quot;Newest vehicles first&quot; setting. Fixes in the &quot;down &amp; payment&quot; price display option that prevented down payments and payment frequencies from displaying. Fixes in database queries to always use the proper table prefix.</p>",
        "14.11.1": "<p>Reduces the number of database queries required when adding cache-busting querystrings to photo URLs. Adds caching in invp_get_the_photos() for 5 minutes to reduce database queries. Makes sure invp_get_the_photos() always populates URLs regardless of what sizes are requested. Bug fix in INVP::sluggify(). Do not allow a string that starts with a symbol to create a slug that starts with a hyphen.</p>",
        "14.11.0": "<p>Adds a fullscreen mode to flexsliders so large vehicle photos can bust out of their containers when tapped by users. Cleans up flexslider JavaScript to use much less jQuery and wait for slow images to load before attempting resizes. Fixes a bug where paging was broken for Listings Pages defined at Vehicles â†’ Options. Makes more strings translateable, adds more taxonomy term labels so the Block Editor stops showing &quot;category&quot; instead of &quot;make&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, etc. Allows more than 30 meta keys in the Custom Fields editor panel when editing vehicles. Adds a Contact Form 7 mail tag [invp_adf_vendor] to integrate the location taxonomy into ADF XML leads. More details at https://inventorypresser.com/docs/contact-form-7-integration/how-to-send-adf-xml-leads-using-contact-form-7/. Fixes a CSS issue that caused the Annual fuel consumption line to overlap the combined, city, and highway figures in the Fuel Economy widget.</p>",
        "14.10.2": "<p>Adds a template tag <code>invp_get_the_condition()</code> that returns &quot;Used&quot;, &quot;New&quot;, or empty string. Adds an API method <code>INVP::get_paging_html()</code> that previously lived inside the [invp_archive] shortcode class. Creates better pagination HTML for listings archives. Fixes a bug in the Block Editor sidebar. Stops attempting to save empty strings in numeric meta fields when their text boxes are emptied. Makes more strings translateable. Stops lying about whether vehicle posts have thumbnails unless our archive shortcodes are run or the Divi Blog Module is detected. The lie helps us work on most themes by avoiding the theme and our shortcode from both outputing a thumbnail. There&#039;s no reason to do this unless the shortcode is used.</p>",
        "14.10.1": "<p>Fixes a bug introduced in 14.10.0 that prevented inventory archives from being sorted according to the saved setting.</p>",
        "14.10.0": "<p>Adds a WPForms integration. Adds a Vehicle field type. This field will produce a dropdown on forms not embedded on vehicle singles. On vehicle singles, a hidden input will identify the vehicle the user is looking at. Adds two Smart Tags {invp_adf_vehicle} and {invp_site_url} to make creating ADF XML lead emails easy when following <a href=\"https://inventorypresser.com/docs/capturing-vehicle-leads-with-wpforms/\">these instructions</a>. Adds a parameter to the [invp_inventory_grid] shortcode <code>priced_first</code> to put vehicles with prices first. Adds the list of taxonomy links to the settings page near the checkbox to toggle them in the menu. Performance improvements by avoiding several get_option() calls until they are necesary. Removes a call to load_plugin_textdomain() because it is obsolete. Stop warning users about thumbnail size aspect ratios if they are not 4:3. 16:9 is the new mainstream ratio, so check for either. Fixes CSS in the Listings Pages table of the settings page. Stops loading Classic Editor features when the Classic Editor plugin is not active and other dashboard performance improvements around not loading features until they are necessary. Adds support for SCRIPT_DEBUG in all script and style registrations. Adds plugin version number to script and style registrations so they can be cached appropriately. Changes link labels in the dashboard when editing taxonomy terms for specificity like &quot;model years&quot; instead of &quot;tags&quot;.</p>",
        "14.9.0": "<p>Adds a function invp_get_the_inventory_sentence() that returns an HTML string containing links like, &quot;Browse Car, SUV, Truck, or all 10 vehicles for sale.&quot; Wraps the &quot;/&quot; that separates prices and down payments with a filter <code>invp_price_display_separator</code> so it can be changed by other developers. Adds a parameter to the [invp_sort_by label=&quot;&quot;] shortcode <code>label</code> to let users customize or remove the label text next to the dropdown. Enables the JavaScript filter <code>invp_editor_sidebar_elements</code> that was disabled in 14.8.0. The filter was not the problem. Fixes a bug in the [invp_sort_by] shortcode that prevented any sort from happening when a choice was made in the dropdown. JavaScript was missing from this plugin that powers the feature.</p>",
        "14.7.1": "<p>Adds postmeta fields <code>inventory_presser_rate</code> and <code>inventory_presser_term</code> to the vehicle post type for dealers outside the USA where displaying financing terms without a disclosure may be legal. Adds a &quot;No filter&quot; option to the Additional Listings Pages feature to allow the creation of full, unfiltered archive pages at any URL. Adds a toggle switch to Additional Listings Pages so rules can be saved in an inactive state. Adds a &quot;contains&quot; comparison operator and &quot;Options&quot; to the list of comparison fields in Additional Listings Pages filter rules. Adds a parameter to the [invp_inventory_grid] shortcode to suppress &quot;Call for price&quot; if the sitewide price display setting is ${Price}. This restores behavior produced by a bug described below. Fixes a bug in the [invp_inventory_grid] shortcode that prevented &quot;Call for price&quot; from displaying if show_captions and show_prices were both true and the price display setting sitewide is ${Price}. Fixes syntax errors that impact old versions of PHP including 7.2. Fixes bugs in multiple shortcodes that prevented true/false parameter values from working the way users expect. &quot;true&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and 1 are all now working. Likewise with false values &quot;false&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, and 0. Renames the Additional Listings Pages feature to Listings Pages.</p>",
        "14.6.0": "<p>Stops showing sold vehicles in the [invp_inventory_grid] shortcode and Inventory Grid widget when the &quot;Include sold vehicles&quot; setting is off. Stops hitting inventorypresser.com as often to check for valid add-on licenses. Fixes a bug that showed the Boat Attributes field in the Editor Sidebar for non-boat vehicles. Adds a feature that changes the &lt;title&gt; tag on inventory archives. Adds a JavaScript filter <code>invp_editor_sidebar_elements</code> to let other plugins add to the Editor Sidebar where vehicle attributes are managed. Adds additional meta fields for Carfax &quot;Accident Free&quot; and &quot;Top Condition&quot; badges. Adds a filter <code>invp_meta_fields</code> so other plugins can add meta fields to the vehicle post type.</p>",
        "14.5.0": "<p>Adds a feature enabled by default: Adds a gallery block to new vehicle posts with a specific CSS class that allows users to upload and reorder photos on vehicle posts in the block editor. This is merging the invp-photo-arranger feature plugin into Inventory Presser core. Deactivate and delete invp-photo-arranger after upgrading to 14.5.0.</p>",
        "14.2.1": "<p>Adds two template tags <code>invp_get_the_location_state()</code> and <code>invp_get_the_location_zip()</code>. Wraps vehicle prices in a  element in the [invp_inventory_grid] shortcode so they can be more easily styled.</p>",
        "14.1.0": "<p>Adds a Contact Form 7 mail tag [invp_adf_timestamp] to help insert ISO 8601 timestamps into ADF XML lead emails. Adds a Contact Form 7 mail tag [invp_adf_vehicle] to help insert vehicles into ADF XML lead emails. Adds a &quot;No vehicles found.&quot; message to the [invp_archive] shortcode when there are no vehicle posts that satisfy the query. Adds a default false value for the use_carfax setting so it shows up in REST at /wp-json/invp/v1/settings consistently. Wraps the vehicle YMM string in a link in email sent using our Contact Form 7 form-tag [invp_vehicle].</p>",
        "14.0.0": "<p>Integrates WP All Import to allow CSV feed imports. Integrates Contact Form 7 to add a [invp_vehicle] form tag. Improves [invp_single_vehicle] output and adds a filter <code>invp_single_sections</code> to allow customization. Removes all deprecated methods and constants, all of which have replacements. Removes the [iframe] shortcode that was replaced by [invp_iframe].</p>",
        "13.8.2": "<p>Changes the slider widget to show only 2 vehicles at a time on smaller devices. Bug fixes. Increases compatibility with inventory photos that were inserted by other services and do not have sequence numbers saved in post meta. Relies on the post_date for photo sequence when our meta key is not found.</p>",
        "13.8.1": "<p>Adds a minimized version of the leaflet.js CSS file. This file is used by the Map widget. Bug fix when resizing flexslider images to avoid stretching images wider than their full size dimensions.</p>",
        "13.8.0": "<p>Adds template tags <code>invp_get_the_last_modified()</code> and <code>invp_get_raw_last_modified()</code>. Registers all scripts and styles on the <code>enqueue_block_editor_assets</code> hook so blocks can use them. Adds &amp; implements iFrameResizer.js in the [invp_iframe] shortcode instead of relying on the themes like _dealer to provide the library and resize iframes. Bug fix when looking for an SVG file path in the Carfax Widget. Bug fix in the <code>invp_get_the_transmission_speeds()</code> template tag. The single <code>$post_id</code> argument is now optional, matching all other template tags.</p>",
        "13.7.1": "<p>Changes tested up to version number 5.9.2. Increases compatibility with more themes out of the box, and specifically themes like GeneratePress that call and filter the_content multiple times when rendering a page. Fixes block category creation so all this plugin&#039;s blocks are nicley grouped. Fix in the Sort Vehicles By setting when a date field like last modified is chosen. Fixes plugin update nags in multisite installations to look more like core update nags.</p>",
        "13.6.0": "<p>Upgrades the [invp_archive] shortcode to support taxonomy and querystring filters and sorts. Adds a template tag invp_is_featured(). Changes the &quot;was now discount&quot; price display to fallback to showing the price when the MSRP is empty or the difference is not a positive discount. Previously, the setting would fallback to &quot;Call for Price&quot; even if a price value was available.</p>",
        "13.5.0": "<p>Renames the Google Map widget to Google Map (legacy). It still works for an unknown amount of time. Adds a Google Map widget. This new widget implements the v3 JavaScript API and requires an API key. Adds street address, street address line two, city, state, and zip fields to the Edit form when editing a term in the locations taxonomy. Allows users to specify and save the pieces of the address instead of the whole, multi-line address we store in the term description. This makes latitude and longitude decoding more accessible to users. When a location term is saved, these meta values are used to populate the term description.</p>",
        "13.3.0": "<p>Upgrades the add-on framework to simplify the building and integrating of add-on plugins. Adds a colors taxonomy to help users shop by base color.</p>",
        "13.2.1": "<p>Contains a bug fix in the Map widget to prevent widget titles from sitting underneath the map. Changes tested up to version number to 5.8.0.</p>",

        "13.1.0": "<p>Contains bug fixes and adds a new maps widget called Map that succeeds the Google Map widget. Google deprecated the API upon which the Google Map widget is built, and has indicated it will cease working any day. The new widget is built on leaflet.js and uses map tiles/imagery from MapBox.</p>",
        "13.0.0": "<p>Version 13 is smaller than version 12! Instead of shipping with two sliders, all slideshows are now powered by flexslider. This version drops a dependency on slick.js without losing functionality or changing the look and feel of sliders. Fixes a bug when displaying our placeholder &quot;no photo photo&quot; near vehicles that have zero photos.</p>",
        "12.3.0": "<p>Adds a setting to control whether vehicles use Trash when deleted. Adds a shortcode [invp_photo_slider].
