The most popular<br />\nmethods are used here. The Flesch and Flesch-Kincaid methods use formulas based<br />\non the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables<br />\nper word.

Technical subjects may<br />\nrequire a higher level of education so a higher Fog or Kincaid score is<br />\nacceptable. Informal writing may try for a score in the 7-10 range.
