The plugin will automatically deactivate itself. You are encouraged to use the core feature instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add or remove screen sizes to the tester?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can! In version 2.0, we added a filter that makes it very easy to add or delete screen sizes from the Responsive Page Tester.</p>\n<pre><code>function mythemename_filter_rpt_sizes( $sizes ) {\n    //Add a size\n    $sizes['1024x600'] = array( 'width' =&gt; 1024, 'height' =&gt; 600, 'description' =&gt; '(Galaxy tablet)' );\n\n    //Remove a size\n    unset( $sizes['240x320'] );\n\n    //Return our filtered sizes\n    return $sizes;\n}\nadd_filter( 'rpt_screen_sizes', 'mythemename_filter_rpt_sizes' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t have a WordPress Toolbar on my front end pages.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a setting on your profile edit screen labeled &#8220;Toolbar&#8221;. This needs to be checked for you to see the WordPress Toolbar on the front end of your website.</p>\n<p>If this is checked, and you still are not seeing the Toolbar, then your theme or another plugin is hiding it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My site does not change in the different sized iframes</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the site presentation does not change to fit the width of the iframes, it can be one of two things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your theme is not a responsive WordPress theme. Perhaps try one from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/search.php?q=responsive\" title=\"WordPress Theme Directory\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> that is!</li>\n<li>You are using a browser that does not support <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/\" title=\"Media Queries\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">media queries</a>. While <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-mediaqueries\" title=\"Media query support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">media query support is pretty extensive</a>, Internet Explorer did not add support until version 9.0.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this perform any HiDPI screen responsiveness?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it will not. This plugin does not actually do anything to make your site responsive. It merely presents it to you in different iframes to show you how it will show up. If you want to add some HiDPI support, maybe check out <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj\" title=\"@desrosj's\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@desrosj&#8217;s</a> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-wp-retina/\" title=\"Simple WP Retina plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">Simple WP Retina plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
