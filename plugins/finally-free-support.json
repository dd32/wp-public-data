Ask questions, chat with our support team live, open a support ticket, or even schedule a call with Stoute Web Solutions\\&#8217; owner Paul Stoute. We\\&#8217;ll work together to get your website working to it\\&#8217;s fullest potential, provide free recommendations, and complete a full website audit.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this really free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin and associated support are completely free.<br />\nA majority of the questions we receive are about how to use WordPress or what plugins we recommend to add additional functionality to a website.<br />\nWe understand that some questions might require a more in-depth look into the problem at which point we would provide a fair quote to complete.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is provided in this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Within the plugin you will find the following services:<br />\n* Support Tickets<br />\n* Schedule a call<br />\n* Live Chat<br />\n* Peer Help<br />\n* Recommended Resources<br />\n* WordPress User Manual (Coming soon)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is this plugin for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin provides website owners that run their website using WordPress access to WordPress experts who can help answer quick questions about their website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is this plugin not intended for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This support plugin is not intended to provide support to developers who are building custom plugins or themes and need assistance in completing them or are trying to figure out how to build one. For this, we recommend scheduling a call with one of our developers who can provide a fair quote.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My site is custom. Will your team still be able to help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In most cases, yes!<br />\nThere are a few situations where we&#8217;ll need to have access to your website&#8217;s admin dashboard or server&#8217;s SFTP so that we can take a deeper look and be able to properly answer your questions. If this is the case, we&#8217;ll provide a fair estimate to troubleshoot any issues you may be having.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I use WooCommerce. Can you still help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!<br />\nWe build a majority of our eCommerce websites based on the WordPress + WooCommerce. That means that all of our team members will be able to answer your more complex questions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I need to create a support ticket when I have access to a Live Chat?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes our team is sleeping&#8230; This means that the live chat option isn&#8217;t available. With these requests, you&#8217;ll want to open a support ticket to have our team tackle your question as soon as they come back online.<br />\nOther times we might request that you create a support ticket as the issue might require additional time to work through and a support ticket allows our team the ability to take the appropriate time and energy to put into answering your question.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t speak English. Can you still help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time our team can only properly help people in English.<br />\nIf you submit a ticket, start a live chat, or book a call and don&#8217;t speak English our team will not be able to assist at this time.<br />\nFeel free to use translation software like Google Translate to convert your message into English though. We&#8217;ll reply in English so you&#8217;ll need to keep using the translation tool while we&#8217;re providing you support.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
