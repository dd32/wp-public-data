No database tables are created or manipulated and no activation hook needs to be run for it to function with default settings. The plugin can also work from the <strong>/mu-plugins/</strong> folder where it runs quietly in the background without bothering any blog owner with new options pages or the need for special knowledge about it. Just upload the complete package content under the /cookie-ok/ directory to /mu-plugins/.</p>\n",
