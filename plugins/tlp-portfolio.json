You can create the most beautiful results in</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by adding the various projects that you&#8217;ve completed and want to showcase along with all the image and text content that should accompany it.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now generate the shortcode for your whole portfolio items. Here is how you go about it:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Layout</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It would be best to start by choosing the layout type you want, with grid, isotope, and slider layout options available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next is to choose the particular layout variation you want from the available options by simply clicking on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the number of columns you want for different views, including desktop, tab, and mobile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can then click to enable pagination or just leave the box unchecked if you don&#8217;t want pagination.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the size limit of the images that go on your portfolio items.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to disable images on your portfolios, check the available box.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set the limit of the number of characters you want for your portfolio item&#8217;s short description.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose whether you want to enable the detail page link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the type of detail page link that you want. The available options are inner and external links.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the link target, whether you want it to go on the same window or a new one.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2. Filtering</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a list of the post IDs that you&#8217;d like to show in the &#8216;include only&#8217; section.</li>\n<li>\n<p>List the post IDs of the portfolio items that you don&#8217;t want to display in the &#8216;exclude&#8217; section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The next thing is to set the limit on the number of posts to show. Leaving this part empty will show all of the portfolio posts on your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the categories that you want to filter and leave this part unfilled to filter all categories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the tags you want to filter on your portfolios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the &#8216;taxonomy relation&#8217; if you want over one taxonomy, such as category and tag, or tag, category, and tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the criteria by which you want to order your portfolio items. You can order by date or title before choosing between ascending and descending orders.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>3. Fields Selection</strong></p>\n<p>Check the fields on the fields&#8217; selection part, checking the fields you want to display. The field options you have to work with include name, short description, client name, project URL, completed date, tools, categories, and zoom image.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Styling</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the parent class for adding custom CSS code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the primary color you want for your portfolio items.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the overlay color, button background color, button hover background color, button active background color, and button text color.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the size you want for your padding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the font color, font size, weight, and alignment of the name/ title, name hover, short description, icon style, and meta style.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Call the shortcode in the post or page you want it in with Gutenberg or the Elementor addon. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the shortcode onto the post or page.</p>\n<h3>üèÜ  Available Portfolio Fields</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Title/ Name of the portfolio items</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Category</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short Description</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Client Name</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The date on which it was completed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project URL</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custom URL [PRO]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Portfolio Gallery [PRO]</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üèÜ Some Features of Portfolio plugin Pro version</h3>\n<p><strong>Layouts:</strong> The premium version of this portfolio plugin comes with 17 grids that have grid filters, 15 Sliders &amp; 17 Isotope layouts.</p>\n<p><strong>Detail page popup:</strong> Portfolio supports multiple popups as well as single popups.
