        "faq": "\n<h4>\nMy IP has been blocked, what should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just wait the time indicated in WordPress login screen, the system will release your IP again automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI&#8217;m blocked and I can&#8217;t wait to my IP to be released, what can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can access from another connection from another provider, for example, using a 3G/4G Network instead of your Wifi.</p>\n<p>If you forgot the password and has blocked by this, change the password before trying to access again.</p>\n<p>If you can login in MySQL, you can clean the data on table wp_simple_login_limit_protect, this will give you a fresh start.</p>\n<p>If you can only access by FTP, you can access the wp-content/plugins folder and delete the folder simple-login-limit-protect, this will uninstall the plugin, you can install the plugin again, while logged, you will not be blocked.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t access by MySQL neither FTP, sorry, there is no backdoor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy can&#8217;t I disable GDPR protection?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We understand that this provides a better protection, since we use Data Blurring to anonymize IP Address, like Google Analytics and other tools.</p>\n<p>When Blurring the IP Address we will have a range of IP Address instead of the final IP, for example, if the hacker IP Address was 198.51.100.10, we will block from 198.51.100.0 to 198.51.100.255. With this, without other data sources you can&#8217;t identify the original IP Address.</p>\n<p>If a hacker tries do disconnect and reconnect to his provider, there is a chance to him to receive an IP Address in the same range, that will be already blocked.</p>\n<p>Even if him receive an IP Address of another range, in a few tries his Internet Provider will be full blocked.</p>\n<p>This don&#8217;t prevents him to access content in your site, just to login in administrative area.</p>\n<p>We think that this is a good idea, since we prevent more attacks from the same hacker, and, there&#8217;s only a few chance that your neighbor will be trying to hack in your site.</p>\n<p>If you think otherwise, please <a href=\"https://forms.gle/1fbSCQoyqYLrWJxd8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fill this form</a> with your ideas.</p>\n<p>Other reason is that some hackers will be in Europe Union, thus it&#8217;s better to comply to not be at legal risk.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do you comply with GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GDPR says that we can&#8217;t store personal information, with include IP Address, without consent from the user.</p>\n<p>Sure, a hacker will not consent to store his information, but we need this information stored to block attackers.</p>\n<p>So, a method to do this is using Pseudo Anonymization with Data Blurring.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">same technique used by Google Analytics</a>, so, we think we are backed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy some others plugins don&#8217;t comply with GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They use a technique called hashing to obfuscate the IP Address, normally applying a MD5 Hash Algorithm.</p>\n<p>While this works well for unpredictable data such passwords, IP Address are high predictable (there is only 4 billions of them), and thus can be easily reversed.</p>\n<p>We explored this theme in a Post in our website, but don&#8217;t take our word, we referenced others security specialists about it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://skymonitor.com/why-hash-dont-anonimize-an-ip-address-and-what-this-affects-gdpr/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Why Hash Don&#8217;t Anonimize an IP Address and what this affects GDPR</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nThere is only one Security Mode that is Intelligent, why can&#8217;t I change it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are planning other modes, we though that was a good idea keep this space reserved for options that are coming soon.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI have an idea\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please, <a href=\"https://forms.gle/1fbSCQoyqYLrWJxd8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fill this form</a>, we will be happy to help:</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI need support\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Mail us at <a href=\"mailto:support@skymonitor.com?subject=Simple Login Protect Support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support@skymonitor.com</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
