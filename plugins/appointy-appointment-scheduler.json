No credit card required. Affordable pricing that scales as your business grows. No hidden costs. Most WordPress scheduling plugins just <strong>provide basic features in the free version and then force you to buy premium add-ons</strong> for additional critical features like payments etc. whereas <strong>Appointy provides many of these premium features  in its free forever version</strong> itself. As a result, the standalone WordPress plugins with their add-ons end up being more expensive and bug ridden in the long term over Appointy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins are <strong>often plagued by poor support and long issue resolution turnaround times</strong> but Appointy being one of the biggest players in the appointment scheduling domain, is proud to offer the highest standards of <strong>customer support 24&#215;7 through call/chat/email</strong>. You can even request free setup assistance for your business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins and their add-ons often create <strong>unnecessary bloat in the WordPress dashboard</strong> thus slowing down your website and resulting in compatibility clashes with your theme and other plugins, whereas <strong>Appointy is a SaaS application and all the heavy processing is managed by Appointy’s super fast cloud servers</strong> so that processing is extremely fast and you never lose your precious data or appointments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins require setting up of <strong>server cron jobs and specialized server settings forcing you to either upgrade to higher hosting plans</strong> or losing out on bookings/appointment reminders thus eventually affecting your business’s service quality and customer satisfaction. But with Appointy, you can set up scheduling on your website with just the <strong>basic shared hosting plan as all the sms/email reminders, are taken care of by Appointy</strong> with their efficient cloud service with 99.99% uptime guarantee. This saves you unnecessary hosting costs and ensures professional services to your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins creates <strong>security vulnerabilities</strong>, whereas Appointy being a SaaS application is <strong>100% safe and integrates with your favourite payment processors</strong> out of the box even in its free plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress plugins which have their <strong>working from within WordPress remain exposed to problems caused by WordPress version updates</strong> leading to service downtimes and business losses whereas <strong>Appointy being a SaaS is always resistant to compatibility and functionality issues</strong> arising out of any such updates, thus ensuring robust performance and business reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other scheduling plugins tend to get <strong>limited by features</strong> and as your requirements grow along with your business, you are forced to switch platforms which impacts your business and creates new problems. Whereas, <strong>Appointy offers enterprise level plans and features so that as your business grows Appointy will be your growth partner</strong> throughout your journey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike other plugins, Appointy offers <strong>multi platform access to your business</strong> settings and administration. You can access Appointy on the go through our <strong>Android and iOS apps</strong> as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike other WordPress scheduling plugins, <strong>Appointy has several marketing and analytics features</strong> so that you can get an edge over your competition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike other WordPress scheduling plugins, <strong>Appointy has a very intuitive interface and onboarding process</strong> which enables you to get comfortable with the system within the first 5 minutes itself. In case you need help, our 24&#215;7 support desk is always at your disposal. Appointy also provides you with several third party software integrations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several of the standalone free WordPress plugins compromise your data and the data of your customers and are not GDPR compliant. Appointy being the one of the most trusted and reliable appointment scheduling plugins, is GDPR compliant and provides 100% security for you and your customer&#8217;s data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Translations</h3>\n<p>Appointy appointment booking and online scheduling is available in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chinese</li>\n<li>Croatian</li>\n<li>Czech</li>\n<li>Danish</li>\n<li>Estonian</li>\n<li>French</li>\n<li>Finnish</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Greek</li>\n<li>Hungarian</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n<li>Japanese</li>\n<li>Lithuanian</li>\n<li>Latvian</li>\n<li>Dutch</li>\n<li>Nynorsk</li>\n<li>Portuguese</li>\n<li>Polish</li>\n<li>Russian</li>\n<li>Romanian</li>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>Slovenian</li>\n<li>Serbian</li>\n<li>Slovak</li>\n<li>Swedish</li>\n<li>Turkish</li>\n</ul>\n",

No credit card required. Affordable pricing that scales as your business grows. No hidden costs. Most WordPress scheduling plugins just <strong>provide basic features in the free version and then force you to buy premium add-ons</strong> for additional critical features like payments etc. whereas <strong>Appointy provides many of these premium features  in its free forever version</strong> itself. As a result, the standalone WordPress plugins with their add-ons end up being more expensive and bug ridden in the long term over Appointy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins are <strong>often plagued by poor support and long issue resolution turnaround times</strong> but Appointy being one of the biggest players in the appointment scheduling domain, is proud to offer the highest standards of <strong>customer support 24&#215;7 through call/chat/email</strong>. You can even request free setup assistance for your business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins and their add-ons often create <strong>unnecessary bloat in the WordPress dashboard</strong> thus slowing down your website and resulting in compatibility clashes with your theme and other plugins, whereas <strong>Appointy is a SaaS application and all the heavy processing is managed by Appointy’s super fast cloud servers</strong> so that processing is extremely fast and you never lose your precious data or appointments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins require setting up of <strong>server cron jobs and specialized server settings forcing you to either upgrade to higher hosting plans</strong> or losing out on bookings/appointment reminders thus eventually affecting your business’s service quality and customer satisfaction. But with Appointy, you can set up scheduling on your website with just the <strong>basic shared hosting plan as all the sms/email reminders, are taken care of by Appointy</strong> with their efficient cloud service with 99.99% uptime guarantee. This saves you unnecessary hosting costs and ensures professional services to your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress scheduling plugins creates <strong>security vulnerabilities</strong>, whereas Appointy being a SaaS application is <strong>100% safe and integrates with your favourite payment processors</strong> out of the box even in its free plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other WordPress plugins which have their <strong>working from within WordPress remain exposed to problems caused by WordPress version updates</strong> leading to service downtimes and business losses whereas <strong>Appointy being a SaaS is always resistant to compatibility and functionality issues</strong> arising out of any such updates, thus ensuring robust performance and business reliability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other scheduling plugins tend to get <strong>limited by features</strong> and as your requirements grow along with your business, you are forced to switch platforms which impacts your business and creates new problems. Whereas, <strong>Appointy offers enterprise level plans and features so that as your business grows Appointy will be your growth partner</strong> throughout your journey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike other plugins, Appointy offers <strong>multi platform access to your business</strong> settings and administration. You can access Appointy on the go through our <strong>Android and iOS apps</strong> as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike other WordPress scheduling plugins, <strong>Appointy has several marketing and analytics features</strong> so that you can get an edge over your competition.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike other WordPress scheduling plugins, <strong>Appointy has a very intuitive interface and onboarding process</strong> which enables you to get comfortable with the system within the first 5 minutes itself. In case you need help, our 24&#215;7 support desk is always at your disposal. Appointy also provides you with several third party software integrations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several of the standalone free WordPress plugins compromise your data and the data of your customers and are not GDPR compliant. Appointy being the one of the most trusted and reliable appointment scheduling plugins, is GDPR compliant and provides 100% security for you and your customer&#8217;s data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Translations</h3>\n<p>Appointy appointment booking and online scheduling is available in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chinese</li>\n<li>Croatian</li>\n<li>Czech</li>\n<li>Danish</li>\n<li>Estonian</li>\n<li>French</li>\n<li>Finnish</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Greek</li>\n<li>Hungarian</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n<li>Japanese</li>\n<li>Lithuanian</li>\n<li>Latvian</li>\n<li>Dutch</li>\n<li>Nynorsk</li>\n<li>Portuguese</li>\n<li>Polish</li>\n<li>Russian</li>\n<li>Romanian</li>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>Slovenian</li>\n<li>Serbian</li>\n<li>Slovak</li>\n<li>Swedish</li>\n<li>Turkish</li>\n</ul>\n",
