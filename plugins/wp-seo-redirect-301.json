Now this is fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with https urls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now add define(&#8216;DISABLE_301_SITEMAP&#8217;, &#8216;true&#8217;); to wp-config.php to disable the 301-sitemap.xml file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved code found by WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed vulnerability with delete function found by WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with query string urls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with search results page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes the new url does not exist, especially if it was deleted. So to account for this, send user to home page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Retain query string from old url.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t re redirect to same url even if at some point it had changed.

So I&#8217;ve had to drastically change the plugin to work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Noticed an issue where url has a query string. The fix is to remove query strings from the urls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Able to generate sitemap that you can submit to google or bing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased compatibility across multiple themes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I think I may have fixed template conflictions once and for all. I&#8217;ve placed the redirect on the shutdown event which is the last wordpress event that executes. I think before it tried to redirect before all other code could execute, breaking most templates. Now that this executes on the last event, I think it should create less template issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to create custom urls to redirect to a page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I noticed that SEO Redirect 301 didn&#8217;t want to play nice with some paid themes. I&#8217;ve come up with a solution to SmartStart and the fix could potentially fix other themes that work closely with WordPress Theme code. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed small bug with dependency checker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Better dependency installer. Fixed issue with empty redirect table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added more Tom M8te functions to make it easier to manage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>After looking at logs, I found duplicate entry errors, which didn&#8217;t create them, just warned about them. This patch removes the chance of the warning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small bug fix, happens rarely. If the database is corrupt and post id didn&#8217;t exist it produced an error. This patch fixes it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with redirect. Sometimes the system redirects to an attachment, not a page or post, which makes no sense. Anyways I put a guard on it so if it tries to redirect to the attachment, it redirects to the page instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with https urls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Dependent on plugin Tom M8te to make some features easier to code. There is no new features since 1.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed redirect posts to correct urls. Fixed delete redirects which did delete but didn&#8217;t refresh changes at correct time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed some typos, whoops.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Better description on table when you haven&#8217;t yet changed your urls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>UI to show user which old urls are pointing to the new updated urls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed up updating children urls. So now if parent slug name changes, the child slugs are updated as well. For example, lets say you have a page called http://localhost/cars with a child page http://localhost/cars/holden, if you change the slug name to car and you navigated to http://localhost/cars it will redirect you to http://localhost/car. Similarly if you navigated to http://localhost/cars/holden it will redirect you to http://localhost/car/holden.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Checkin</li>\n</ul>\n"
