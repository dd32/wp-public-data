        "description": "<p>WP Most Popular was born out of frustration in finding a decent plugin which performs one simple task and that is to rank your most popular blog posts.</p>\n<p>The plugin keeps a log of your most popular posts based on views and lets you display them in your blog theme with custom styling. You can display popular posts from the last day, 7 days, 30 days or all time.</p>\n<p>It also comes with a sidebar widget to let you display your popular posts on your blogs sidebar.</p>\n<p>If you are a developer and integrate the plugin in to a theme, you will get a lot more flexibility out of the plugin including the ability to show the most popular custom post types etc.</p>\n<p>This plugin was built and is maintained by <a href=\"https://wpgeeks.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Geeks</a>. For extra documentation, videos, snippets and support, visit the <a href=\"https://wpgeeks.com/product/wp-most-popular/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Most Popular</a> product page.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>There are two ways in which you can use this plugin.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As a sidebar widget</li>\n<li>Custom function in your theme files</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Using the widget is the easiest way and recommended for most users. If you are a developer and want to integrate the plugin in to your existing theme, then read the information below.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the main function which you will need to include in your theme to fetch the popular posts is called <code>wp_most_popular_get_popular()</code>.</p>\n<p>You can pass that function the following parameters in array form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>limit</strong> (integer)\n<ul>\n<li>The number of posts you would like to display i.e. 5</li>\n<li>Default: 5</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>post_type</strong> (string) / (array)\n<ul>\n<li>The post type you would like to display</li>\n<li>Example: post</li>\n<li>Default: All post types</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>range</strong> (string)\n<ul>\n<li>In what date range would you like to display popular posts in</li>\n<li>Accepted: all_time, monthly, weekly, daily</li>\n<li>Default: all_time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the current parameters that the plugin supports. Let&#8217;s look at an example of how to display the most recent popular posts in a unordered list.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\necho '&lt;ul&gt;';\n$posts = wp_most_popular_get_popular( array( 'limit' =&gt; 10, 'post_type' =&gt; 'post', 'range' =&gt; 'all_time' ) );\nglobal $post;\nif ( count( $posts ) &gt; 0 ): foreach ( $posts as $post ):\n    setup_postdata( $post );\n    ?&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"&lt;?php the_permalink() ?&gt;\" title=\"&lt;?php echo esc_attr(get_the_title() ? get_the_title() : get_the_ID()); ?&gt;\"&gt;&lt;?php if ( get_the_title() ) the_title(); else the_ID(); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;?php\nendforeach; endif;\necho '&lt;/ul&gt;';\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>The following filters are available to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wp_most_popular_list_before</strong> &#8211; used to filter the </li>\n</ul>\n<ul> element of the outputted widget list<br />\n* **wp_most_popular_list_after** &#8211; used to filter the </ul>\n<p>element of the outputted widget list<br />\n* <strong>wp_most_popular_list_item_single</strong> &#8211; filters for a the list item generated by the widget</p>\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wp_most_popular_list_item</strong> &#8211; used for modifying the list output</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Setting up WP Most Popular is very simple. Follow these easy steps</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin</li>\n<li>Add sidebar widget or integrate functions in to your theme</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are no posts displaying when I use the widget or call the function in my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>99% of the time this is because no posts have been visited yet to receive a ranking. Simply click on a blog post to read it on your blog and it will receive a ranking and display in the list of most popular posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the minimum requirements for the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need a web server or shared host that supports PHP version 5 or newer. Javascript is also required to log post views.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the plugin use Javascript to track the post views?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The original version of the plugin that I wrote used PHP to track the post views and the reason why I switched to Javascript was because if a caching plugin is enabled on your blog, the page will be loaded statically to your visitor and the PHP code to log a view on a post will not be run.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I request a feature?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, please do so on the WordPress support forum for the plugin. I will consider it and if I feel it is worth adding, I will schedule it for a future release.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I contribute code to the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The plugin is open source and I host it on <a href=\"https://github.com/wpgeeks/WP-Most-Popular\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>. Feel free to send me pull requests.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get support for the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is managed by WP Geeks and you can contact our support team on our <a href=\"https://wpgeeks.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
