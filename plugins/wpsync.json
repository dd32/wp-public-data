This plugin is useful for example if you want to import lot of rows from a spreadsheet into separate posts and it is intended to be used for those who need a simple way to enter blog posts and don&#8217;t like to use the Quick Post feature at WordPress.</p>\n<p>Instead, you can just write your post drafts into a spreadsheet and configure the plugin to synchronize your rows with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I coded this plugin for my personal use but after getting some user&#8217;s feedback I decided to publish it on the WP plugin&#8217;s directory. You can use this plugin to import a Google Spreadsheet as individual blog posts. The plugin also will help you to import custom post types for example if you are preparing a business directory or event website.</p>\n<p>What you can expect from this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helps you importing rows from a Google Spreadsheet into individual posts in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Use the Google Spreadsheet to enter ideas and post drafts, for example if you are developing domain names with WordPress or niche websites, but also useful for directories (ie: with local info, phone numbers, custom fields, etc.)</li>\n<li>Import spreadsheet rows as individual posts or custom post types.</li>\n<li>Support custom fields and taxonomies (categories, tags, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What you shouldn&#8217;t expect from this plugin (at least in the initial releases):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the initial version the utility works from Google Spreadsheets into WordPress but not viceversa. We&#8217;ll eventually add the opposite direction soon.</li>\n<li>This version doesn&#8217;t writes back any change on the Google Spreadsheet so the Spreadsheet is only used as read only.</li>\n<li>Google Spreadsheets doesn&#8217;t support rich text format, so if you need HTML for your content you can do that by using HTML tags in the cells</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Link to <a href=\"http://magn.com/\" title=\"Simple but useful plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Magn</a> and author&#8217;s profile <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109045091422552341246\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Julian Magnone</a></p>\n<h3>Nothing here yet</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" title=\"Your favorite software\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress</a> and one to <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\" title=\"Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Markdown&#8217;s Syntax Documentation</a>.<br />\nTitles are optional, naturally.</p>\n<p>Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I&#8217;ve been told:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Asterisks for <em>emphasis</em>.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Plugin is not working, nothing is synchronized. What to do next?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Google Sheets have changed lot of things since the first version of this plugin was developed. Even the product name was changed<br />\nand renamed to Google Sheets. However, it is possible to make the plugin work and here are a few things you can check:<br />\n1.1. Go to the spreadsheet in Google Sheets that you want to import into WordPress and then go to File -&gt; Publish option.<br />\n1.2. Click Publish Entire Document (or any particular sheet).<br />\n1.3. Click Start Publishing button under &#8220;Published content &amp; settings&#8221; section. Make sure Automatically republish when changes are made is checked.<br />\n1.4. Copy the key and paste it in the WP Magn Sync plugin settings page. Now click Preview and see if the rows are shown in the screen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another reason that could be preventing the plugin to work is if you are using custom post types. If you are using the column post_type in<br />\nthe spreadsheet, make sure the post_type is registered in your WordPress installation. The plugin uses get_post_types function in WP to get<br />\na list of post types registered.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin overwrites the spreadsheet?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t writes the spreadsheet. It is only accessed read only mode (at least for now)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is free.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed query to include registered post types instead of &#8216;any&#8217;</li>\n<li>Small bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix the trim bug in the list of custom values to update</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major upgrade to support new Google Docs API</li>\n<li>Now the required fields are id, post_title, post_content</li>\n<li>Custom post types and taxonomies are supported</li>\n<li>Update from spreadsheet is supported</li>\n</ul>\n"
