        "description": "<p>UsageDD allows administrators to monitor the resource usage of their WordPress installation. It will add a small box at the bottom center of each page, only visible to administrators, that displays the number of MySQL queries, the amount of memory used by the page&#8217;s code, and if you are using a compatible webserver (most are compatible), the &#8220;time to first byte&#8221; (TTFB) and the time required to generate the full page. TTFB is used by Google for page-ranking purposes, and it will be the first of the two displayed.</p>\n<p>You can use the display to determine if your site has too many plugins loaded, if your theme is too &#8220;heavy&#8221;, or if something is wrong on your server. The plugin itself uses virtually no resources and should be compatible with every theme and plugin that outputs HTML.</p>\n<p>Support is available in our <a href=\"https://forum.dion-designs.com/f35/usagedd-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>dedicated support area</strong></a>.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20do%20the%20numbers%20mean%3F'>\nWhat do the numbers mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The number of queries (for example, &#8220;27Q&#8221;) will give you an idea of whether you are having MySQL problems. The number of queries should ideally be under 50. You may start to see slowdowns if the number is above 75. If it is above 150, you have an issue with your theme and/or plugins on that specific page which should be addressed.</p>\n<p>The execution time numbers (for example, &#8220;0.09 | 0.15&#8221;) are explained in the description. The TTFB number should be under 0.2 seconds; a larger number could result in reduced Google page ranks for your site. If the second number is more than one second larger than the first (TTFB) number, your theme is &#8220;heavy&#8221; and might require some optimization.</p>\n<p>The memory usage (for example, &#8220;18.3M&#8221;) will give you an idea of how large your site&#8217;s code is. This number should be under 50 megabytes (MB), and ideally should be under 32 MB. Memory usage can be dramatically reduced by using an opcode cache such as Zend OPcache.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20accurate%20are%20the%20numbers%3F'>\nHow accurate are the numbers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The number of queries and execution times are 100% accurate. The memory usage is very slightly lower than the actual number due to the limitations imposed on WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>Please note that the execution time numbers reported by UsageDD may be different than what are reported from your browser or from external sites. Google Pagespeed removes network latency (also known as &#8220;ping&#8221; time) from its reported TTFB number, so it will be almost exactly the number reported by UsageDD. The numbers you see from sites such as Pingdom and GTMetrix, or from the Network tab in your browser&#8217;s Dev Tools, will be higher than the numbers reported by UsageDD because they include the network latency.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20compatibility%20issues%3F'>\nAre there any compatibility issues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>UsageDD will be compatible with every theme and plugin that outputs correctly-formed HTML pages.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are some plugins that use WordPress to generate non-HTML output. This will not be a problem if the plugin lets other plugins know they are generating non-HTML output. For example, the WordPress REST API and XML-RPC applications generate non-HTML output, but since they let plugins know they are active, UsageDD automatically suppresses its display when these applications generate their output.</p>\n<p>There are also some plugins/themes that generate broken HTML pages. If you activate UsageDD and do not see a usage display at the bottom of each page, this is the likely cause.</p>\n<p>If you find that a plugin has compatibility issues with UsageDD, please let us know by posting a topic in our <a href=\"https://forum.dion-designs.com/f35/usagedd-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>dedicated support area</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>UsageDD may not work if your hosting company provides a non-standard installation of WordPress. For example, GoDaddy&#8217;s WordPress hosting loads &#8220;must-use&#8221; plugins and cache/database drop-ins that cannot be disabled, and these non-standard additions seem to conflict with UsageDD. If you are affected by this issue, please consider switching to a host that provides a standard WordPress installation!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20support%3F'>\nWhere can I find support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support is available in our <a href=\"https://forum.dion-designs.com/f35/usagedd-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>dedicated support area</strong></a>.
