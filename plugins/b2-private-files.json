The token can be only generated from your website, thus its impossible for any other site to crawl your site and scrape the files.</p>\n<p>Each token generated can be also configured to expire after N minutes. So if lets say you generated a download link to a big installer, people cant re-use the same link and paste it in public forums, chats etc.<br />\nBecause the link will expire after few minutes, which makes it hard for user to share file to non-registered users.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Media &gt; Add New (Private)</li>\n<li>Upload any file</li>\n<li>Go to Media &gt; Library (Private)</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Shortcode&#8221; for the file you just uploaded</li>\n<li>Paste the shortcode anywhere you wanted to show the link</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Generally the shortcode looks like this:</p>\n<p>[b2-private-file-button filename=&#8221;my-installer.zip&#8221;]</p>\n<p>the above shortcode will generate a button with caption &#8220;Download&#8221;, pointing to the Backblaze B2 file with token passed to it.</p>\n",

You can use any client to upload large file into B2.<br />\nThe plugin will detect those and generate download link for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20as%20an%20alternative%20to%20cdn%3F'>\nCan i use this as an alternative to CDN?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Its possible, but its not optimized for that use-case.
