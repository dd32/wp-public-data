        "faq": "<p>Q1: What is a cookie anyway?<br />\nA1: A cookie is a digital record, (text files with small pieces of data), stored on your computer, or better, in your browser. This is used to track, personalise and save information about each user&#8217;s session. Any data can be stored and retrieved from a cookie. It is up to the developer of the site or system what goes in there. Cookies let websites remember you, your website logins, shopping carts and much more information. But they can also be a treasure trove of your private information for criminals to spy on.<br />\nThis being said, having a Cookie notice or giving consent to having cookies stored in your browser, is but one small segment of the many regulations to be implemented to Be POPIA compliant.</p>\n<p>Q2: What is POPIA?<br />\nA2: POPIA stands for the Protection of Personal Information Act, Act No. 4 of 2013 or POPI Act. This law has been with us for a while but took effect on July 1, 2020, and enforcement began on July 1, 2021. Due to technical difficulties, small business owners have got until February 1 2022 to get their act together. At this stage, it is still uncertain how strict the authorities will act on those that are not POPIA compliant. The provisions for penalties on the other hand is no mystery, and actually quite alarming!</p>\n<p>Q3: Is there a difference between POPI and POPIA?<br />\nA3: Yes and no. POPI is the act or rather action of Protecting Personal information. This implies that all the policies, procedures, processes and practices in the organisation relating to personal information, are in fact doing POPI. POPIA is merely the name of the law.<br />\nIn summary, to comply with POPIA, you need to implement a POPI programme.</p>\n<p>Q4: What is POPI act compliance?<br />\nA4: Generally, compliance means adhering to a rule, such as a policy, standard, specification, or law. This means to be POPIA compliant you need to follow all the rules and regulations as set out in the POPI Act as well as the code of conduct regarding POPIA.</p>\n<p>Q5: Should I be Compliant?<br />\nA5: According to the POPI Act, if you have a filing system, on paper or digital, localised or scattered containing personal information about ten (10) or more people, you need to be compliant. It is only if you have received an express exemption from the government, that you need not comply.</p>\n<p>Q6: I am running a small online business on the side as a sole proprietor can I be prosecuted?<br />\nA6: Yes, unfortunately, you are directly liable and may be fined or may end up in prison or both. We suggest you register a company to protect yourself from any unforeseen judgements. You will still be held liable, but there is a small barrier between owners of a company and the company, since the company if registered is seen as a juristic person.</p>\n<p>Q7: What happens if we don&#8217;t comply with POPIA?<br />\nA7: There are significant consequences for non-compliance, including up to R10 million rands in fines or up to 10 years in prison, or both.</p>\n<p>Q8: What is considered personal information?<br />\nA8: Personal information is any information about an identifiable living, natural person or a juristic person including but not limited to race, gender, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, nationality, age, physical or mental health, disability, language, education, any data relating to medical, financial or employment records, ID number, email address, physical or postal address, location info, phone numbers, blood type or biometric data, personal opinions or references, private or confidential correspondence or even views or opinions of another person about you.</p>\n<p>Q9: What is a data subject?<br />\nA9: Any person, a living natural person, or a juristic person, that&#8217;s data is being processed.</p>\n<p>Q10: What is generally considered a breach of POPIA?<br />\nA10: The following is the common breaches:<br />\n&#8211; Loss of personal information due to inadequate security safeguards<br />\n&#8211; Collecting personal information without having obtained the necessary consent<br />\n&#8211; Sending personal information to people who are not supposed to have it<br />\n&#8211; Breach of security safeguards (network with personal information is hacked)<br />\n&#8211; Not complying with an enforcement notice issued by the Information Regulator<br />\n&#8211; Processing special personal information without there being a necessity</p>\n<p>Q11: I am a visitor to the site, should I be somehow compliant?<br />\nA11: No, the POPI Act is there for your safety. The regulations imposed by POPIA, all act as safeguards so that each user&#8217;s info gets looked after and is not recklessly being utilised in such a manner that your information may fall into the hands of unauthorised persons. Therefore, it is in your interest to insist on signing a consent form, so you can manage your consent by limiting the data being collected and disseminated.</p>\n<p>Q12: How do I register my information officer with the regulator?<br />\nA12: A responsible party should register their information officer and deputy information officer if relevant on the Information Regulator Registration Portal.</p>\n<p>Q13: Can one person be the information officer for multiple entities?<br />\nA13: Yes, one person can be the information officer of multiple entities. And for now, as long as the deputy information officer is also the same for the same multiple entities, you can manage all those entities from one account on the Be POPIA Compliant platform. If however there are a different data officer or deputy data officer in one of your organisations, we suggest creating a new account for those entities. As for the Information Regulator Portal, it is not currently supported to be the data officer for multiple entities.</p>\n<p>Q14: I am running a small business by myself, do I need a deputy information officer?<br />\nA14: No, by default the head or CEO of an entity is deemed the data officer. If however there is too much work and it is decided that a deputy officer takes over the duties from such head, a deputy officer may be appointed. Note however that the head of the entity remains liable for the actions of the deputy information officer.</p>\n<p>Q15: If my entity is found guilty of an offence, who will pay the fine, or go to jail?<br />\nA15: This is rather a complex matter since it depends on the entity type. If you are a sole proprietor, you are automatically held responsible. In the event of a partnership for instance all partners may be held liable. If a deputy information officer was appointed according to Annexure C of the guidance notes, still, the default information officer or head of entity shall be liable. So if you are the CEO or Managing Director, consider yourself warned. The aforementioned is typically the case, but if it can be proved that a certain employee, for instance, stole and sold personal information, that employee shall be punished for the offence.</p>\n<p>Q16: Does it not make sense that the Chief Information Officer or CTO, from IT, be also appointed as the Information Officer?<br />\nA16: It is best not to since they are largely concerned with the technology aspect of operations. Many other people in the organisation could lead to an offence being committed. In such a case, it would mostly be unfair towards the CTO since they do not likely communicate with anyone in sales or otherwise. It is probably best to assign someone in HR or appoint a new person altogether.</p>\n<p>Q17: Can we outsource this duty of the data officer to someone else?<br />\nA17: This is not recommended, since they might not have a full understanding of your entire process flow in your organisation. And since ultimately the head of the institution shall still bear the responsibility, do you want to take that chance?</p>\n<p>Q18: I was appointed as the information officer, is there some sort of guide?<br />\nA18: The information regulator published a guideline that you can download.</p>\n<p>Q19: Are there any other laws that are linked to POPIA?<br />\nA19: Yes, the following laws have an impact on POPIA:<br />\n&#8211; Consumer Protection Act, or (CPA)<br />\n&#8211; National Credit Act, or (NCA)<br />\n&#8211; Regulation of Interception of Communications Act, also known as (RICA)<br />\n&#8211; Promotion of Access to Information Act, or (PAIA)<br />\n&#8211; Electronic Communication Act<br />\n&#8211; Cybercrime Bill, and<br />\n&#8211; Your Constitutional Right to Privacy as defined in the Bill of Rights</p>\n<p>Q20: Who can use Be POPIA Compliant?<br />\nA20: If you have a website, that collects any data such as customer emails, telephone numbers or addresses, you will have to comply. Any person operating a hobby or a fully-fledged business with more than ten (10) customers needs to comply. If you have a WordPress website, we currently offer an easy to use a plugin for WordPress users. We also offer integration options for custom-developed systems and Apps. If your solution is not a WordPress solution, we shall need to establish through a consultation how your current program works, and how POPIA influences your business flow. From there we will be able to provide you with a detailed report on what changes, your development team need to get into place together with the endpoints that data need to be sent to, and collected from.</p>\n",
