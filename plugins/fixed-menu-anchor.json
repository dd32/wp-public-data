        "faq": "\n<h4>1. Why does it jumps when i click to an entry in my accordion/tab-menu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because the algorithm looks for the # sign in the URL. Unfortunately accordions and other menu-like structures using # to reference a target. That is getting in the way of the plugin. But in version 2 we introduced a new feature, which allows you to set a CSS class and the plugin will ignore all links using that CSS class.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2. Can i forbid the plugin to fire?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you set a CSS class which indicates, that the plugin is prohibit from being activated by a click event.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>3. I am using a mobile first theme and the menu changes based on the screen width. Do you support different menu heights?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, with version 2 (only <a href=\"https://plugins-first.io/en/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PRO-version</a>), we introduced a feature, that lets you set a certain screen width and a value for the distance, which only applies until that width is reached. After the width is higher, the default value will be used.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>4. I got weird behavior after clicking an anchor (e.g. moving to the bottom and jumps back immediately)!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We got feedback from users that they experienced weird behavior when clicking an anchor. In <em>almost all cases</em> another plugin or a custom Java Script of the theme is interfering with the Fixed Menu Anchor plugin. The reason is, that it kinda capturing the click event to apply a certain behavior for anchor-links. If you have the same problem, please deactivate other plugins first and see if the problem goes away. If it persists, create a post in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/fixed-menu-anchor\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>, together with a detailed description of your setup (e.g. installed plugins, active theme). We will look into it and getting back to you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
