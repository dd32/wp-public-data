        "faq": "\n<h4>Will my posts and comments be edited permanently?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Bleep Filter works passively ensuring that your original content, posts, and comments remain the same even if you delete or deactivate the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I prevent certain words from being filtered?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the filter is picking up words that it shouldn&#8217;t you can add exception words or phrases using the plugin&#8217;s exceptions words list to prevent them from being filtered.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most bad word filters use simple one for one matching of words. This makes filtering difficult because it forces you to think of every possible spelling for each word in every situation for it to be effective.</p>\n<p>For example you want to filter the word shazbot. Normally you add the word to the filter and hope the correct spelling is used. What happens if the user types the word shaazzzboughtte! or even sh@zb0t!? Would the filter pick it up? Bleep Filter would.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
