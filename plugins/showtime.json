        "description": "<p>The Showtime plugin allows you to easily manage and display a rotating programming schedule. It was originally built for a college radio station, but it could be used for any kind of schedule that repeats weekly.</p>\n<p>Showtime takes the current time and displays the name of whatever show/event you&#8217;ve placed in the timeslot. If there&#8217;s no show/event, it displays a custom off-air message. You also have the option of displaying the name of the upcoming show/event.</p>\n<h3>New in 3.0</h3>\n<p>This release is a ground-up re-write, so the code is (hopefully) an awful lot better than it was before. The sorting method is better for the days of the week, and the front-end presentation is no longer a horrible, horrible jQuery hack! Everything is more efficient, better-looking, and the shortcode output doesn&#8217;t sit on top of all the content anymore. Also, there&#8217;s some snazzy new AJAX-ification stuff going on in the Schedule manager.</p>\n<p>Current 2.1 users, don&#8217;t worry; there&#8217;s a database upgrader built-in, so you don&#8217;t have to re-enter all of your current show schedules. <strong>That being said</strong>, be sure to backup your database before running the upgrade; it will remove the _showtime database table when it&#8217;s done. I&#8217;m almost certain it won&#8217;t break.</p>\n<p>Timezone support is improved, but please email me if you&#8217;re still having trouble.</p>\n<h3>Current Feature List</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily create editable shows/events by settings start/end times.</li>\n<li>Customizable &#8220;Off-Air Message&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Hide or display upcoming show/event.</li>\n<li>Customizable CSS in the admin panel.</li>\n<li>Shut it Down: Temporarily replace your schedule with off-air message.</li>\n<li>Display your schedule using template tag, widget or shortcode.</li>\n<li>Link your event/show names to URLs.</li>\n<li>Upload images for events/shows and display them in the Now Playing widget.</li>\n<li>New shortcode to easily add the Now Playing widget to Posts and Pages.</li>\n<li>Support for databased that don&#8217;t necessarily use the wp_ prefix.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "<p>Q: I just installed Showtime, and I don&#8217;t see a place to add new shows. Why?</p>\n<p>A: You <strong>absolutely</strong> have to set your timezone city for the plugin to work properly, as it has to have a local timezone to set its clock to. It&#8217;s in your General Settings page.</p>\n<p>Q: After I upload an image and click &#8220;Use as Featured Image&#8221; for a show, nothing happens.</p>\n<p>A: You have to click the &#8220;Insert Into Post&#8221; button, <em>not</em> &#8220;Use as Featured Image.&#8221;</p>\n"
