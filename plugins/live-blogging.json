For<br />\nprofessional bloggers, Meteor is supported, which gives the smoothest updating<br />\nexperience for your viewers and also significantly reduces the load on your<br />\nserver.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the plugin also supports integration with Twitter &#8211; if activated,<br />\nthe first 139 characters of each live blog entry will be posted to Twitter when<br />\nthey are made.</p>\n<p>Using this plugin will give you an advantage over your competitors if you&#8217;re<br />\nblogging from live events &#8211; your readers will get updates quicker, and it will<br />\nintegrate into your blog better than competing systems, such as CoverItLive.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<h4>Internationalisation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chinese language: Haoxian Zeng</li>\n<li>Persian language: Rasoul Moshrefizadeh</li>\n<li>Lithuanian language: Vincent G from http://www.host1free.com/</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Live Blogging v2, like version 1, requires PHP version 5.2 and WordPress 3.0 or<br />\nlater. Please make sure you have these before you attempt to use the plugin.<br />\nIf you get errors whilst activating, it is likely that you are using a version<br />\nof PHP before version 5.2.</p>\n<p>Live Blogging is installed and activated as per normal plugins. Once it has been<br />\nactivated, please read the FAQ about how to use it.</p>\n<p>Once you have installed Live Blogging, then it is most sensible to proceed to<br />\nthe Live Blogging settings, which is included in your &#8216;Settings&#8217; panel in the<br />\nadmin area as &#8216;Live Blogging&#8217;. From here, you can enable functionality such as<br />\nposting to Twitter, changing the method used for live blog updating and<br />\ncustomising the style of the live blog entries.</p>\n<p>If you have installed a Meteor server and intend to use it to stream updates,<br />\nyou must also enter your Meteor server details and set the live blog update<br />\nmethod to &#8216;Stream using Meteor&#8217;.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I start live blogging?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The very first thing you need to do is select a post which to use as the shell<br />\nfor your live blog. Either create a new post, or select an existing one to edit,<br />\nand then to the right of your post screen, there should be an option entitled:<br />\n&#8220;Enable live blogging on this post&#8221;. Without this option being enabled, you<br />\nwill be unable to add new live blog entries to this post!</p>\n<p>The final step is very important. You must insert the shortcode [liveblog]<br />\nsomewhere within your post which indicates where the liveblog is to appear.</p>\n<p>Now, your live blog is set up! You can select &#8216;Add New&#8217; from the sidebar under<br />\n&#8216;Live Blog Entries&#8217;, choose the live blog you want the update to apply to from<br />\nthe list in the sidebar, and then create your entry as per usual.</p>\n<p>Once you have finished with your live blog, untick the &#8220;Enable live blogging on<br />\nthis post&#8221; box. This will stop automatic updating and any new updates to be<br />\nadded to the live blog, but will preserve any existing live blogging<br />\nentries for posterity.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I upgrade my live blogs from version 1.x of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin detects that old data from the plugin exists, then it will prompt<br />\nyou to upgrade on the options screen. Also, a &#8216;Live Blogging Migration&#8217; option<br />\nwill exist under the Tools menu. Run that tool and follow the prompts to upgrade<br />\nall your old entries to the new version.</p>\n<p>Please note that live blogs created in previous versions of the software can<br />\nnot have new entries added to them.</p>\n<p>Please note that it is recommended that you disable posting to Twitter when<br />\nrunning a migration, as the migration will cause all legacy entries to be<br />\nposted to Twitter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I change the time on a live blog entry to appear in the past, then it doesn&#8217;t appear in the right order during automatic updating?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately this is a limitation on the system &#8211; any new entries must appear<br />\nat the top of the live blog. Readers who come in after the blog was posted, or<br />\nusers who subsequentally refresh will see the blog posts in the correct order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using TwentyTen and comment updating doesn&#8217;t look right</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('live_blogging_build_comments', 'twentyten_liveblogging_comments');\nfunction twentyten_liveblogging_comments($a)\n{\n    $a['callback'] = 'twentyten_comment';\n    return $a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>to your functions.php in your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Comment updating does not appear to work on my theme</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For comment updating to work, you must be using a reasonably standard comment<br />\nsetup. That is, your theme must generate comments using <code>wp_list_comments</code> and<br />\nput them in an element with an ID of <code>commentlist</code>. If your theme does not do<br />\nthese things, it is recommended that you disable comment updating in the option<br />\npanel.</p>\n<p>If your theme does support this, but comment updating still does not work<br />\ncorrectly, it is possible that your theme is calling <code>wp_list_comments</code> with<br />\nnon-default arguments. It is possible to account for this using a filter.</p>\n<p>Using the <code>live_blogging_build_comments</code> filter, you can return the arguments<br />\nwhich your theme uses to call to <code>wp_list_comments</code> to get the same effect as<br />\nyour default theme. For an example of how to do this, see above.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I imported my live blog from version 1 of the software, and am continuing to use the same live blog, but comment auto-updating isn&#8217;t working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry, this is a design issue with the software. It is recommended that you do<br />\nnot re-use any imported live blogs in this way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Meteor, and how do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Meteor is a streaming web server that allows you to instantly &#8220;push&#8221; updates out<br />\nto your readers. This is the technology Twitterfall uses, and the advice of the<br />\nTwitterfall creators was useful in developing this functionality. Using Meteor<br />\nallows you to lower your server load, as well as quicker updates for your<br />\nreaders.</p>\n<p>There is a catch, however. Meteor is a web server separate to what servers your<br />\nnormal website and requires special configuration to set up, and your own server<br />\nor VPS to run it on. Shared hosting is, typically, unsuitable.</p>\n<p>If you are a professional blogger, running your blog from a server where you<br />\ncan install things as root, and are wishing to reduce server load, using the<br />\nplugin with Meteor is highly recommended.</p>\n<p>For more about Meteor, please see the <a href=\"http://meteorserver.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meteor website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does deleting a post from inside WordPress also delete it from Twitter?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Editing a post does not change the tweet the software generated</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is impossible to edit tweets. A decision was made not to implement this<br />\nfunctionality, as it may result in out-of-order or duplicate tweets in a user&#8217;s<br />\ntimeline. If you really need to delete a tweet, it is recommended that you<br />\neither delete the tweet manually, or delete the post and create a new one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get an RSS feed containing just my live blog entries?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; if permalinks are enabled. Navigate to: WP-URL/feed/?post_type=liveblog_entry&amp;liveblog=ID<br />\nwhere WP-URL is the address of your WordPress site, and replace ID (right<br />\nat the end) with the ID of the post containing that live blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting multiple bookmarking icons or similar on every live blog post</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some bookmarking plugins work by adding their icons at the end of every post.<br />\nObviously, when you&#8217;re microblogging and adding multiple entries per page, this<br />\ncan get very tiresome. The options screen allows you to workaround this.</p>\n<p>In &#8216;Advanced Settings&#8217; at the bottom is a list of actions which are unhooked<br />\nfrom the <code>the_content</code> display filter, so they do not show up. To hide a<br />\nbookmarking plugin, you must add the name of the function which is called by the<br />\n    the_content filter to this list. The green + allows you to add more text<br />\nboxes, and then red &#8211; allows you to remove a function from being unhooked.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add a hashtag to my tweets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! Just create a custom field on the post/page which contains the live blog<br />\ncalled &#8216;liveblogging_hashtag&#8217; and it will be appended to all of your tweets.</p>\n<p>(Note that this custom field should not contain the # character, that will be<br />\nadded automatically)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>AJAX updating doesn&#8217;t work with multi-site and domain mapping</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This forum topic (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ajax-in-subsite) should<br />\nresolve the issue for you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
