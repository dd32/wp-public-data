Two points that really stuck out: 1. The incredible versatility of the tools provided. The options are limitless, you can pretty much achieve everything you need in terms of customized products. 2. The support team is absolutely amazing. The reply fast, take their time with the answers &amp; help you so long, until your problem is solved. Amazing experience so far, way better than every other app for customization, I can wholeheartedly recommend Zakeke!</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nMY CANS<br />\nWe are very happy with the Zakeke product customizer! Everything works smoothly! A fair price / performance ratio. Handling is clear, for both sides, administrators and users. If there are any problems or questions, a great customer support is available and actively supported. We are very satisfied.</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nPLAYMORE TCG<br />\nI just wanted to give feedback on what an excellent product and service you have provided my business! Zakeke product designer is a miracle and magical!! you have taken so much stress and frustration out from the hassle of using plugins that just don’t work. Most have the processing on the server the plugin is hosted on but having the chance to use a service like this is a major change and certainly a breakthrough for this industry! When I first set it up was easy and super functional. Your team is incredible and I really truly appreciate the quality work you put into this software thanks!</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nENGRAVOLOGIST LLC<br />\nWe searched high and low for a customize product plugin that worked well on both mobile and desktop and THIS IS IT! Most product designers work great on desktop, but really struggle on mobile. The Zakeke product designer on mobile looks just like an app – it’s amazing.</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nSTATUS MUGS<br />\nVery pleased with this app highly recommend it great customer service and the software is absolutely fantastic for what we need.</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nYOUR BREW<br />\nThe real reason why I’m switching several of my stores over to this? The price. It is priced fairly and in a manner that they want you to grow and succeed. They aren’t just trying to recoup their money, they see a long term investment in your functioning business as the better option than large outlandish fees. Massively impressed with this app, I would recommend anyone who is currently using another personalisation app sets aside an hour to test this out – It’s all you&#8217;ll need!</p>\n<p>I genuinely want these guys to become the biggest custom product app because they&#8217;ve done such a good job.</p>\n",

Two points that really stuck out: 1. The incredible versatility of the tools provided. The options are limitless, you can pretty much achieve everything you need in terms of customized products. 2. The support team is absolutely amazing. The reply fast, take their time with the answers &amp; help you so long, until your problem is solved. Amazing experience so far, way better than every other app for customization, I can wholeheartedly recommend Zakeke!</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nMY CANS<br />\nWe are very happy with the Zakeke product customizer! Everything works smoothly! A fair price / performance ratio. Handling is clear, for both sides, administrators and users. If there are any problems or questions, a great customer support is available and actively supported. We are very satisfied.</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nPLAYMORE TCG<br />\nI just wanted to give feedback on what an excellent product and service you have provided my business! Zakeke product designer is a miracle and magical!! you have taken so much stress and frustration out from the hassle of using plugins that just don’t work. Most have the processing on the server the plugin is hosted on but having the chance to use a service like this is a major change and certainly a breakthrough for this industry! When I first set it up was easy and super functional. Your team is incredible and I really truly appreciate the quality work you put into this software thanks!</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nENGRAVOLOGIST LLC<br />\nWe searched high and low for a customize product plugin that worked well on both mobile and desktop and THIS IS IT! Most product designers work great on desktop, but really struggle on mobile. The Zakeke product designer on mobile looks just like an app – it’s amazing.</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nSTATUS MUGS<br />\nVery pleased with this app highly recommend it great customer service and the software is absolutely fantastic for what we need.</p>\n<p>★★★★<br />\nYOUR BREW<br />\nThe real reason why I’m switching several of my stores over to this? The price. It is priced fairly and in a manner that they want you to grow and succeed. They aren’t just trying to recoup their money, they see a long term investment in your functioning business as the better option than large outlandish fees. Massively impressed with this app, I would recommend anyone who is currently using another personalisation app sets aside an hour to test this out – It’s all you&#8217;ll need!</p>\n<p>I genuinely want these guys to become the biggest custom product app because they&#8217;ve done such a good job.</p>\n",
