        "description": "<p>Here’s How Shopper Approved Integrates into Woo Commerce:</p>\n<p>At Shopper Approved, you can either select our Traffic &amp; Conversion Suite for maximum results, or individual tools based on your specific needs. If you choose our T&amp;C Suite, here’s what a typical installation looks like:</p>\n<h3>Special code is added to your &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page</h3>\n<p>This allows you to display our unique Initial Survey as soon as a customer makes a purchase.  Our Initial Survey gives you the opportunity to collect initial feedback while alerting you to any issues during shopping or checkout. It also gives you the ability to collect Buyer Intent.</p>\n<p>Buyer Intent is incredibly valuable, and is strategically displayed on your Shopper Approved certificate and Individual Product Pages to help new potential customers to see why people like them also bought from you.</p>\n<h3>The Shopper Approved Seller Ratings Seal is added to your header or footer</h3>\n<p>This is a quick, universal way to show your visitors that you’re a highly trusted company, because it gives them a way to view your overall star rating and # of reviews at a glance.  We help you to display it in a tasteful way that blends in effortlessly with your brand and<br />\nwebsite design.</p>\n<h3>Seller Rating Widgets can be added to your Landing Pages</h3>\n<p>Seller Rating widgets display individual reviews about your company, and give visitors a way to instantly gauge your overall reputation and trustworthiness while progressing further down the sales funnel.  This kind of initial 3rd party verified social proof is critical in building a relationship of trust with your customers.</p>\n<h3>Product Ratings and # of Reviews are added to your Product Category Pages</h3>\n<p>As your visitors move through your site, Shopper Approved strategically adds Star Ratings and # of Reviews for individual products on your category pages.  This further improves their trust in you, and guides them toward products that they know other people like.</p>\n<h3>Product Reviews, Q&amp;A, and Website Security are Strategically added to your Individual Product Pages</h3>\n<p>This is where traffic meets conversion! Using behavioral psychology and the same proven, high-converting strategies used by Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and other big box brands, we are able to create the highest possible level of credibility, trust, and social proof right on your product page &#8211; where your customer ultimately decides to buy.</p>\n<h3>Seller Rating Widgets, Milestone Awards, and Website Security Seals can be added to your Shopping Cart Page</h3>\n<p>To “seal the deal”, we can add Seller Rating Widgets, a 5-Star Milestone Award (once you qualify) to your checkout pages, and our famous Trust Guard® Security Seal to your checkout pages to reiterate just how much your customers love you and trust your company.</p>\n<h3>Everything is Customized to Match Your Website’s Look and Feel</h3>\n<p>All of these integrations can be customized to match your brand, including the size, color, and placement.  We even provide you with a styling consultant to ensure that you are fully satisfied with how Shopper Approved looks on your site.</p>\n<h3>Once You Start Collecting Reviews, We Syndicate Them Directly to Google</h3>\n<p>As an official Google Review Partner, we can send your Seller Ratings and your Product Reviews to multiple strategic locations in Google, includeing Google Ads, Google Shopping, Google PLA’s, and Google Organic Search.</p>\n<p>We also have the ability to send your reviews to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and dozens of 3rd party Open-Review Platforms online to give your brand the most visibility possible.</p>\n<p>By Integrating Shopper Approved with Woo Commerce, You Get More Reviews, More Traffic, and More Sales.</p>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<p>This plugin is only compatible with WordPress 6.4 or later.</p>\n",
