        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20need%20this%3F'>\nWhy would I need this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This eliminates the need to manually edit the year of your website&#8217;s copyright statement,  usually located at the bottom of each page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20recommended%20way%20to%20use%20it%3F'>\nWhat is the recommended way to use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is recommended to insert it in the footer template part of your block theme, but it can be used anywhere in your content.</p>\n<p>Also, you will probably want to use it within a <strong>Row</strong> block to make it appear horizontally with other text elements, as demonstrated in the fourth screenshot above.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20insert%20text%20before%20and%20after%20the%20current%20year%3F'>\nIs it possible to insert text before and after the current year?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this has been possible since version 0.5.0. You can also align the text. If you do not see these options in the block inspector on your sidebar, update your plugin to the latest version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20hinder%20my%20website%20loading%20performance%3F'>\nWill this plugin hinder my website loading performance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all, the plugin is quite simple. It does not add any CSS or Javascript on its own. If you want to style the text in any way, you will use the Block Editor&#8217;s native features to do so.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20collect%20any%20data%20from%20me%20or%20my%20users%3F'>\nDoes this plugin collect any data from me or my users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not, the plugin respects your privacy. It&#8217;s completely add-free and the code only uses core WordPress functions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20in%20the%20classic%20editor%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work in the Classic Editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this plugin works exclusively in the Block Editor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20use%20the%20client%20time%20%28via%20javascript%29%20or%20the%20server%20time%20%28via%20php%29%20to%20update%20the%20year%3F'>\nDoes the plugin use the client time (via Javascript) or the server time (via PHP) to update the year?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses a WordPress core function (<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/current_datetime/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>current_datetime</code></a>) to get your server time, using the timezone specified in the ‚ÄúSettings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">‚Üí</span> General <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">‚Üí</span> Timezone‚Äù on your WordPress dashboard. So it is important to set your timezone in order to display the year correctly, especially at the turn of the year.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20included%20copyright%20notice%20enough%20to%20safeguard%20my%20website%20regarding%20legal%20issues%3F'>\nIs the included copyright notice enough to safeguard my website regarding legal issues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most probably not. While the plugin offers a basic copyright notice, it doesn&#8217;t automatically solve all legal issues your website may have, nor does it constitute legal advice in any way. The site owner is solely responsible for ensuring that the website respects the law.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20send%20feedback%20or%20support%20questions%3F'>\nWhere can I send feedback or support questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please reach out via the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/dynamic-year-block\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin support forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask questions, request new features or report bugs.</p>\n<p>You can also follow the development of the plugin in the official √âpico Studio <a href=\"https://github.com/EpicoStudio/dynamic-year-block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>, where you can see the complete code.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20support%20the%20development%20of%20the%20dynamic%20year%20block%3F'>\nHow can I support the development of the Dynamic Year Block?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can help with a <a href=\"https://ubr.link/donate-wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donation</a>, by <a href=\"https://epico.studio\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visiting our website</a> or publishing a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/dynamic-year-block/reviews/#new-post\" rel=\"ugc\">positive review</a>, if you find it useful.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
