        "installation": "<p><strong>AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION</strong><br />\nAutomatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.<br />\nIn the search field type &#8220;Recooty&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking Install Now.</p>\n<p><strong>MANUAL INSTALLATION</strong><br />\nThe manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.<br />\n1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it<br />\n2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s wp-content/plugins/ directory.<br />\n3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p><strong>GETTING STARTED</strong><br />\n1. Create a page called &#8220;careers&#8221; and inside place the [recooty] shortcode. This will list your jobs.<br />\n2. Go to Recooty Setting in WP Dashboard and paste the Key which you have obtained from <a href=\"https://dash.recooty.com/settings/job-widget\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Recooty&#8217;s Dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>Note when using shortcodes, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the &#8216;text&#8217; tab. Then remove any &#8216;pre&#8217; or &#8216;code&#8217; tags wrapping your shortcode.</p>\n<p>For more information, read the  <a href=\"https://recooty.com/blog/user-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation</a></p>\n",
