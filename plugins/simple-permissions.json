If you don&#8217;t want an author to have access, you should change the ownership of the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed (hopefully!) an issue where you would not be redirected to the proper page after login when presented with a protected page notice. I&#8217;m getting around this by not redirecting at all. Instead, I&#8217;m replacing the requested pages content with the content of the protected page notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix that was preventing drafts from autosaving.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing category limits was not working under all conditions. Should be fixed now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that would cause Wiki plugin (and anything else that provides an editing interface) to reset permissions on posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick bug fix for major oops in last version. The meta box wasn&#8217;t rendering if a user had a higher role than necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to limit changing permissions to certain WP roles.</li>\n<li>Added ability to prevent posting in categories by SP group.</li>\n<li>Changed the regular express used to find usernames when added users to a group. This will allow spaces in usernames, though WP may have to be changed to allow it.</li>\n<li>above changes per https://wordpress.org/support/topic/couple-issues-3</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed big bug that prevented editing of posts that had no permissions set.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with some extra whitespace killing feeds</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
