        "description": "<p>This WordPress plugin provides automatic syntax highlighting of QlikView and Qlik Sense script on any WordPress page or post. Additionally, it allows for easy addition of QlikView and Qlik Sense user interface icons within pages and posts. It was developed by Matt Fryer, a highly experienced Qlik consultant and author of the popular blog <a href=\"http://www.qlikviewaddict.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QlikViewAddict.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>It currently supports highlighting of the following Qlik script and expression elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Line comments //</li>\n<li>Block comment /<em>..</em>/</li>\n<li>REM comment REM&#8230;;</li>\n<li>Most QlikView 11.20+ and Qlik Sense keywords, statements and functions (that are permitted within the script or expressions)</li>\n<li>Variable definitions (using SET and LET) and variable use (within $())</li>\n<li>Field names in most common situations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, all Qlik Sense Hub and Management Console icons are supported as well as a small number of additional generic icons (eg. Qlik logo).</p>\n<h3>How to use</h3>\n<p>The plugin utilises WordPress shortcodes to apply the highlighting and insert icons.</p>\n<h4>Syntax highlighting</h4>\n<p>Simply wrap any Qlik code blocks within the [qlik-code] &#8230; [/qlik-code] shortcode tags. By default, the plugin will assume that the code contained in the tags is Qlik script and will highlight it accordingly. You can specify an alternative code type using the type parameter within the opening tag. For example [qlikview type=&#8221;exp&#8221;]=num(MyField)[/qlikview]. Currently supported code types are &#8220;qvs&#8221;, &#8220;exp&#8221; (or &#8220;qve&#8221;), &#8220;sql&#8221;, &#8220;vbscript&#8221; and &#8220;javascript&#8221;. If no code type is specified then &#8220;qvs&#8221; will be assumed.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the shortcode can be entered using the buttons within the WordPress text and visual post/page editors. Select the block of code within the post or page, then click the Qlik Code button on the editor menu. You will be prompted for what code type the block should be highlighted as. Once complete, click OK and the shortcode will be added around the code block for you.</p>\n<h4>Icons</h4>\n<p>Simply place the shortcode tag [qlik-icon icon=&#8221;&#8221;] in your post or page where you wish the icon to appear. You can specify the icon you wish to use within the icon parameter of the tag. For example [qlik-icon icon=&#8221;qicon-qlik&#8221;] will insert the Qlik logo. Possible icons and their related codes can be found within the Qlik for WordPress settings page in the WordPress Admin Portal.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the shortcode can be entered using the buttons within the WordPress text and visual post/page editors. Place the cursor within the post or page where you wish the icon to be placed, then click the Qlik Icon button on the editor menu. You will be prompted for the icon code for the icon you wish to insert. Once complete, click OK and the shortcode will be added for you.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>If you spot any issues or have any suggestions to improve the plugin, please let me know either via the support tab here, or via a comment on <a href=\"http://www.qlikviewaddict.com/p/qlikview-wordpress-plugin.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QlikViewAddict.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to thank Ivan Sagalaev and all the other contributors of Highlight.js which this plugin is based upon.</p>\n",

It is not a perfect replication.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it check if my code is valid?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is not designed to validate your Qlik code. Just because it is highlighted it doesn&#8217;t mean your code is valid. For example, the highlighting engine has no way of knowing if field names within an expression/measure are actually contained within a QlikView or Qlik Sense data model.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can it highlight other languages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As well as Qlik script and expressions/measures, it can currently highlight a handful of other languages that are associated with Qlik products. These currently include SQL, VBScript and JavaScript. If you think there is a need for it to support another language, please let me know.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use it with another highlighting plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has not been tested with any other highlighting plugins (syntax or otherwise) and so it cannot be guaranteed to work alongside them, especially those also based on highlight.js.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It uses a custom build of highlight.js to provide the highlighting. The highlighting is applied client-side using javascript when the page is loaded in the browser.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are the icons identical to Qlik?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All Qlik Sense icons are generated using the LeonardoUI vector based font that Qlik Sense uses and so are identical to those seen in the Qlik Sense Hub and Management Console. QlikView icons are approximate representations of the icons found in QlikView desktop and web UI.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
