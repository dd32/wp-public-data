Activating the plugin will automatically add the reading time to the beginning of your post&#8217;s content. This can be deactivated in the Reading Time settings which can be accessed from your Dashboard&#8217;s Settings menu. You can also edit the label and postfix from this menu.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d prefer more control over where you add your reading time you can use the the [rt_reading_time] shortcode to insert the time into a post. This shortcode also excepts values for label and postfix. These are optional. Ex. [rt_reading_time label=&#8221;Reading Time:&#8221; postfix=&#8221;minutes&#8221;].</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20insert%20my%20reading%20time%20before%20posts.'>\nHow do I insert my reading time before posts.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On initial installation your reading time should be showing where the_content is called in your template. If it is not, navigate to the Reading Time WP settings menu in the WP Dashboard Settings menu and make sure the &#8220;Insert Reading Time before content&#8221; option is checked.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='great%2C%20but%20how%20do%20i%20control%20the%20post%20types%2C%20like%20pages%20and%20custom%20post%20types%2C%20the%20reading%20times%20shows%20on%3F'>\nGreat, but how do I control the post types, like pages and custom post types, the reading times shows on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just navigate to the Reading Time WP settings page and select which post types you want your Reading Times to display on. Reading Time WP defaults to posts and pages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='but%20i%20want%20more%20individual%20control%20to%20insert%20reading%20time%20only%20on%20specific%20posts.%20how%20can%20i%20do%20that%3F'>\nBut I want more individual control to insert reading time only on specific posts. How can I do that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy, turn off the &#8220;Insert Reading Time before content&#8221; option form the Reading Time settings within your WP Dashboard&#8217;s settings. Then use the Reading Time WP shortcode [rt_reading_time label=&#8221;Reading Time:&#8221; postfix=&#8221;minutes&#8221;]. Best of all the label and postfix parameters are optional.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='that%27s%20good%20and%20all%2C%20but%20how%20do%20i%20insert%20it%20into%20my%20theme%3F'>\nThat&#8217;s good and all, but how do I insert it into my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Still easy, but you&#8217;ll need to use WordPress&#8217; built in do_shortcode function. Simply place <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[rt_reading_time label=\"Reading Time:\" postfix=\"minutes\"]'); ?&gt;</code> into your theme wherever you please.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ll%20just%20go%20with%20it%20entering%20before%20the_content.%20how%20can%20i%20change%20what%20appears%20before%20and%20after%20the%20reading%20time%3F'>\nI&#8217;ll just go with it entering before the_content. How can I change what appears before and after the reading time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just edit the Reading time label and Reading time postfix fields in the Reading Time WP Settings. The label appears before the time and the postfix after. Feel free to leave either blank to not use that field.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20count%20images%20in%20the%20reading%20time%3F'>\nDoes this count images in the Reading Time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Reading Time WP calculates images based on Medium&#8217;s article on the topic here: https://blog.medium.com/read-time-and-you-bc2048ab620c.</p>\n<p>So for the first image add 12 seconds, second image add 11, &#8230;, for image 10+ add 3 seconds each.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20only%20display%20reading%20time%20on%20single%20posts%3F'>\nHow can I only display reading time on single posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Drop the code from this Gist in your functions.php. https://gist.github.com/jasonyingling/ad2832bc1768d1fbb63341aef072908b</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20remove%20the%20reading%20time%20from%20yoast%27s%20meta%20description%3F'>\nHow do I remove the Reading Time from Yoast&#8217;s meta description?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Drop the code from this Gist in your functions.php https://gist.github.com/jasonyingling/5917dc97b302ca37abce7ceb93a7f4b8</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20add%20meta%20fields%2C%20say%20from%20advanced%20custom%20fields%2C%20into%20the%20reading%20time%20wp%20count%3F'>\nHow can I add meta fields, say from Advanced Custom Fields, into the Reading Time WP count?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just hook into the <code>rtwp_filter_wordcount</code> filter and increment the word count the reading time is based on.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20specify%20a%20different%20post%20id%20in%20the%20shortcode%2C%20e.g.%20to%20show%20each%20post%27s%20reading%20time%20on%20a%20page%20that%20lists%20many%20posts%3F'>\nHow do I specify a different post ID in the shortcode, e.g. to show each post&#8217;s reading time on a page that lists many posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the optional page_id attribute on the shortcode. e.g. [rt_reading_time label=&#8221;Reading Time:&#8221; postfix=&#8221;minutes&#8221; postfix_singular=&#8221;minute&#8221; post_id=&#8221;123&#8243;]</p>\n</p>\n\n",
