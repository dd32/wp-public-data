I didn&#8217;t want to make any decisions about where the assets folder should be for an unsuspecting person who may have been using WordPress for some time. Cleaning <code>wp_head</code> sounds good in practice and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some stuff in there that most people don&#8217;t need, but there&#8217;s a reason it got so messy in the first place.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
