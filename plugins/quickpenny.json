        "description": "<p>QuickPenny is a payment app that bypasses the debit and credit card network to save merchants&#8217; money. All customers pay from their bank account, so QuickPenny can offer payment processing fees that are over 2% of the purchase price less than other payment processors. With the fee savings, merchants can optionally fund a customer loyalty program that we facilitate. Merchants set the loyalty rate and expiration date of any rewards, and we automatically manage everything.</p>\n<p>Merchants do not benefit from credit card points because those points can be used anywhere. With QuickPenny, rewards can only be used at the merchant where the rewards were earned. This will drive repeat business. The first 2% of rewards is essentially free since that is how much more it would cost to process credit and debit cards with an alternative like Stripe or PayPal. Assuming less than half of customers redeem, merchants can offer rewards of 4% or more through QuickPenny and still be as well off financially as if the transaction were processed with credit cards. And if the customer redeems, that&#8217;s good too because it means the merchant is getting a 2nd sale!</p>\n<p>With QuickPenny, consumers benefit from earning rewards without borrowing money. Right now people paying with debit cards do not get any rewards. QuickPenny is a way for consumers to earn rewards without borrowing money on a credit card. Rewards are automatically applied to repeat sales.</p>\n<p>QuickPenny works similar to PayPal. People log in to their account with their cell phone number and a one-time password and they authorize payment. QuickPenny securely gets permission to debit people&#8217;s bank accounts by using Plaid, the same fintech company that works with Venmo and CashApp.</p>\n<p>QuickPenny is secure.</p>\n<p>We safeguard financial information with the latest encryption protocols like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 256) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). All data is secured in transit and at rest.</p>\n<p>QuickPenny is hosted in a mature and secure cloud environment. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, we can bring decades of security experience to protecting financial information.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t sell, rent or share financial data with outside companies.</p>\n<p>We connect your bank account with the same provider that Venmo and CashApp use.
