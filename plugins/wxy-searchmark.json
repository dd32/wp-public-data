        "description": "<p>(See screenshots below)</p>\n<p>BOOKMARKING — I think we are all familiar with the concept of bookmarking — it really helps when we browse the internet, but there really is no convenient way to do it from inside WordPress. Constantly looking for pages and posts with content that needs updates, can really slow down your development cycle. That&#8217;s why Searchmark allows you to bookmark practically anything inside of the WordPress admin panel. If it has a URL, then it can be bookmarked. There is even a way to bookmark links from inside of pages and panels.</p>\n<p>Once you have created some bookmarks, you can export them, share them, duplicate them, edit them, and manage them using a built-in quick-search function in the bookmarks tab, as well as adding bookmarks to folders, which can be nested for even more organization.</p>\n<p>In addition to drag-and-drop organization tools for your bookmarks, you can color-code them and edit their titles using plain text or even by embedding HTML to style the labels any way you want.</p>\n<p>SEARCH &#8211; Ever spend 20, 40, 60 moinutes looking for that one instance of a particular piece of content in your site that needs to be changed? I think most of us have. WXY Searchmark has deep search capabilities. Search in titles, slugs, content, meta data, by date, practically any data type. If it&#8217;s in WordPress, it can be found with WXY Searchmark. Search criteria can also be saved and re-run with a single click.</p>\n<p>HISTORY — Sometimes, when you are knee-deep in a huge website, you end up jumping from page-to-page when suddenly, you realize that you need to go back to a page that you were on ten jumps ago. Well, instead of trying to remember if it was a page or a post, and then searching for it, then paging to it, now you can simply look at the history tab and see the title and time of each page you visited. Now, just scroll to the entry you want and &#8216;click&#8217;, there you are!</p>\n<p>MULTI-USER — Some WordPress sites have dozens of users that sign in to work on the site&#8217;s content. That&#8217;s why Searchmark allows each user to have their own bookmarks list. And sharing from one user to another is as easy as copy-pasting the bookmarks you want to share, or importing an entire batch into their bookmarks list.</p>\n<p>MULTI-SITE — If you have a WordPress multi-site instance installed, then Searchmark allows you to search inside of all of the websites that your main admin panel manages.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Shortcuts — Once you get used to Searchmark, increase your productivity even more using our built-in keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<h3>Copyright</h3>\n<p>WXY Searchmark is Copyright 2017 Clarence &#8220;exoboy&#8221; Bowman and Bowman Design Works.com<br />\nWXY Searchmark is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL</p>\n<p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or<br />\n(at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
