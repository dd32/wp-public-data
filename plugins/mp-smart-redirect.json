This plugin fixes this issue and creates a 301 redirect to your right url. We don&#8217;t save any data to your database! So we also don&#8217;t create logs of your 404&#8217;s. You can use a different plugin for that like Redirection (recommended to install since you can view and add redirections this plugin might missed).</p>\n",
