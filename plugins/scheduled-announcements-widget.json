Each Announcement now includes a numerical Order field.  You can set whether you want the widget to display Announcements in ascending<br />\nor descending order based on this field in the plugin&#8217;s Settings panel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20put%20the%20ticker%20in%20a%20post%20or%20page%3F'>\nCan I put the ticker in a post or page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, using the shortcode <code>[announcements]</code></p>\n<p>The shortcode function will use the default configuration options set in Announcements &gt; Settings, but those settings can be overriden and customized manually using any<br />\nof the following variables.</p>\n<p>title &#8211; Will display a header title above the ticker<br />\nshow_titles &#8211; Will show or hide the title field of the announcements.  Set to 1 for show, 0 for hide.<br />\norder &#8211; Set whether announcements display in ascending or descending order.  Valid options are &#8216;ASC&#8217; or &#8216;DESC&#8217;.<br />\nscroll &#8211; The scroll style of the ticker.  Valid options are &#8216;horizontal&#8217; or &#8216;vertical&#8217;.<br />\nspeed &#8211; The speed in milliseconds at which the ticker will scroll<br />\ntransition &#8211; The length in milliseconds at which the scroll animation will take to complete<br />\nwidth &#8211; The width in pixels of the ticker<br />\nheight &#8211; The height in pixels of the ticker<br />\nlink &#8211; The hexidecimal color code to use for links in the announcments (eg. 0000FF for blue)<br />\ntext &#8211; The hexidecimal color code to use for links in the announcments (eg. 000000 for black)<br />\nsaw_id &#8211; User specificed CSS ID for the ticker.

Assign a category to your announcement, and then select that category from the dropdown menu in the widget settings.  If you are using the shortcode rather<br />\nthan the widget, set the &#8220;tax&#8221; attribute to either the ID or slug of the category you wish to display.  Make sure you are using slugs/IDs for the Announcement Categories<br />\n(displayed under the Announcements tab in the Dashboard) and not the default WordPress Categories.</p>\n<pre><code>[announcements tax=\"news\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>[announcements tax=\"7\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20put%20more%20than%20one%20ticker%20on%20a%20page%2C%20but%20it%20breaks%20when%20i%20try.'>\nI want to put more than one ticker on a page, but it breaks when I try.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to give each ticker its own unique id. In the shortcode this is done with the saw_id attribute (see shortcode example two questions back).  In the widget, just fill in the<br />\ntext box label Ticker ID.</p>\n<p>You should also avoid the use of hypens in your ID names, because it will royally mess up the javascript.  In most cases, if you forget, the plugin will automatically replace them<br />\nwith underscores.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
