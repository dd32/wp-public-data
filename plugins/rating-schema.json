        "faq": "\n<h4>What is WordPress Star Rating Plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress Star Rating Plugin adds  context to your website content by way of using standardized search engine &#8220;Vocabulary&#8221; at schema.org . Once Done correctly , Star Rating<br />\n     increases the chances that search engines like google will show the star rating result as we given in our post/page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does WordPress Star Rating Help With SEO?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! There is no question that WordPress Star Rating that produces rich snippet “bling” that improves SERP click through rates (CTR). Virtually every search engine expert on the planet will tell you that organic click through rates are a major search engine optimization ranking factor. This, structured data has a very high correlation (ie indirect relationship) with search engine rankings.</p>\n<p>Proper structured data and schema markup on a website are also thought to increase a web page’s chances of triggering a “position zero” knowledge box or answer box at the verp top of the SERPs, and may even help improve your rankings in voice search.</p>\n<p>Is there a direct effect on SEO?  Maybe.  Recent communication from Google indicates that <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-may-add-structured-markup-data-to-ranking-algorithm-230402\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">structured data may become a direct ranking factor in the near future</a>.</p>\n<p>Just like all things on the Internet, it’s garbage in, garbage out. Just installing this plugin will not do anything for your website unless you use it correctly, and properly and accurately configure the data.</p>\n<p>In other words, you should never add schema markup code the backside of your web page, if the data does not exist on the front.</p>\n<p>Please don’t use our plugin to spam Google or any other search engine.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why JSON-LD?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In summary, there are three structured data formats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MicroData</strong> (HTML based)</li>\n<li><strong>JSON-LD</strong> (Java Script based)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We used JSON-LD .Why because For one, JSON is less invasive from a coding standpoint. Second, Google can read JSON-LD data that is dynamically injected from Javascript code and embedded widgets. In layman’s terms, JSON is the latest and greatest…it’s where structured schema is headed and in our perspective, it should be used to implement structured data on all WordPress websites.<br />\nRead more about <a href=\"http://json-ld.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JSON-LD</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>We Follow Google Standards</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is modeled and will be updated according to Google guidelines that you will find here:<br />\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/structured-data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://developers.google.com/structured-data/</a></p>\n<p>Pages are tested by<br />\n[https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool]</p>\n<p>-&gt;everything working fine</p>\n</p>\n\n",
