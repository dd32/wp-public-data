Small increments to R/G/B result in big jumps of colour.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are you really limited to WordPress 4.1 and up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not!  I just haven&#8217;t tested it to earlier versions.  Even if it doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s very unlikely to do anything bad.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I make areas of my pictures transparent?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to do this before uploading them. Most image manipulation programs will allow this.  They have to be gifs or pngs (with transparency enabled).  You can&#8217;t do it with jpgs.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
