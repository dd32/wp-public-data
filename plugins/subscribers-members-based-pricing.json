        "description": "<p>The Subscribers &amp; Members Based Pricing plugin allows WooCommerce store owners to offer special pricing based on user membership or subscription status. It integrates with WooCommerce Subscriptions, giving you the chance to apply discounts or special pricing rules for active subscribers. Membership can be defined by any product in your store (if a user purchases a particular product, then they are considered members).</p>\n<h3>Establish a Rewarding Membership System</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offer special discounts and prices to members</strong>: Give your customers exclusive discounts and prices when they become members.</li>\n<li><strong>Make premium products exclusive to members</strong>: Turn chosen products into special items only for members, giving them membership when bought.</li>\n<li><strong>Work smoothly with WooCommerce Subscriptions</strong>: Provide special prices to current subscribers through the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize pricing strategies</strong>: Adjust prices throughout your store, in certain categories, or for specific products, allowing full flexibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pricing Based on Recent Purchase</strong>: Offer tailored prices for customers based on their previous purchases, like memberships.</li>\n<li><strong>Exclusive Subscriber Discounts</strong>: Provide special discounts to active subscribers, like a 20% reduction on selected categories for all who have active subscription.</li>\n<li><strong>Pricing Types</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Flat Price</em>: Users can set a regular and sale price that becomes active when inventory reaches specified levels.</li>\n<li><em>Percentage Discount</em>: Automatically applies a percentage discount to the current product price based on inventory changes <em>[premium version]</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Members price as Sale price</strong>: Can show the price set by pricing rules as a sale price to draw attention and promote sales <em>[premium version]</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Activation Settings</strong>: Specify the status required for subscriptions or orders (active, on hold, canceled, etc.) to trigger the rules <em>[premium version]</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Global pricing rules</strong>: Easily create bulk pricing rules applicable to entire categories, several categories, or a group of products.</li>\n<li><strong>User role conditions</strong>: Implement additional conditions for pricing based on predefined user roles.</li>\n<li><strong>Scenarios for non-logged-in users</strong>: When the userâ€™s status (membership or subscription) isnâ€™t defined because they arenâ€™t logged in, you can disable purchases or hide pricing.</li>\n<li><strong>Quantity limitations</strong>: Define minimum and maximum purchase quantities and set quantity increments specifically for members and subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to use</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Select Activation Settings</strong> &#8211; configure special pricing rules in the Settings, selecting desired order statuses or subscription states. E.g. only users with Active subscription or with Processed Order will be granted special pricing.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Global Pricing Rule</strong> &#8211; set universal, category-based, or pricing rules for a bunch of products for members or subscribers.

Additionally, you have the flexibility to create specific rules for individual products or variations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20there%20are%20conflicting%20pricing%20rules%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if there are conflicting pricing rules for a product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Answer: In cases where there might be conflicting rules (such as a variation-specific rule and a global rule, or rules for several memberships), Subscribers &amp; Members Based Pricing follows a set hierarchy. Variation-specific rules take the highest priority, followed by parent product rules, and then global rules. In case you have two or more global pricing rules for one product &#8211; the one created first will have higher priority.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
