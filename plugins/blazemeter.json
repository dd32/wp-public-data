In the admin section you will find three sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anonymous users</li>\n<li>Authenticated users</li>\n<li>Configuration</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Anonymous access section</strong><br />\nSpecify the maximum amount of concurrent <strong>anonymous</strong> users that will be simulated in the load test. You can further specify the list of pages, each anonymous user will access one after the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Authenticated users section</strong><br />\nNot only you can specify the maximum amount of concurrent <strong>authenticated</strong> users that will be simulated in the load test and the list of pages they will access, you can also specify the number of <strong>unique authenticated users</strong>. This will cause the module to actually create these users with unique credentials in WordPress. The newly created users will be used for the load test.</p>\n<p><strong>Configuration</strong><br />\nThe configuration section includes a few fields that will help build the test and get it ready to run.</p>\n<p><em>Load Scenario</em><br />\nYou have the option to select one of three pre-defined ‘best practice’ load scenarios.</p>\n<p><em>Domain</em><br />\nState the public domain name of your website. Please note that <strong>this doesn’t need to be a real domain</strong>. This is very important. It needs to be the domain name that your WordPress is expecting to see and is configured to use.</p>\n<p><em>IP</em><br />\nState the public IP of your website.</p>\n<p><em>UserKey</em><br />\nAdd the user key that identifies your account at BlazeMeter. This can be found under your BlazeMeter account settings.</p>\n<p><em>Test ID</em><br />\nRead only. The Test ID is automatically set by BlazeMeter.</p>\n<p><em>Test Name</em><br />\nAdd the name of the test as you want it to appear in your BlazeMeter account.</p>\n<p><strong>Signup for a free account or log in with your existing credentials to get your user key and get your test going.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>You must have a valid account and a valid user key. Free or paid accounts are both acceptable.</strong></p>\n<h4>What to expect</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve run the test,  a group of anonymous users will visit your website, going through the list of pages specified in the anonymous list of pages. In parallel, a group of authenticated users will be visiting your website going through the list of pages specified in the authenticated list of pages. These user credentials will become a part of the list of newly created authenticated users.</p>\n<p>The BlazeMeter module, having an insight into your WordPress installation, generates an Apache JMeter and a Selenium script for you automatically. It then provisions and configures a cluster of up to 100 dedicated servers ready to run on demand. All this is done automatically, saving you days of scripting, provisioning and configuring.</p>\n<p>BlazeMeter is a load testing cloud fully compatible with Apache JMeter. BlazeMeter can generate realistic traffic according to any provided JMeter script. With the BlazeMeter module, you do not need to create any script. All scripts are created for you automatically and fit your WordPress installation perfectly.</p>\n<p>The BlazeMeter module will create a JMeter load script that will simulate both anonymous users and authenticated users visiting the WordPress website. During a load test, a dedicated cluster of load engines is launched in a preconfigured geographic location. These servers generate traffic according to the JMeter script generated by the BlazeMeter module according to the parameters set by the user. During the load, real time measurements of KPIs present themselves on the report dashboard, where users can easily evaluate system performance and run numerous iterations, allowing users to locate bugs and bottlenecks, fix and re-test time and time again.</p>\n",
