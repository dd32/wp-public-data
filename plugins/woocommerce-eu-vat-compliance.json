        "description": "<h4>The European/UK VAT (IVA) laws</h4>\n<p>Since January 1st 2015, all digital goods (including electronic, telecommunications, software, ebook and broadcast services), and from 1st July 2021 physical goods sold across EU and UK borders have been liable under law to variable VAT (a.k.a. IVA) charged in the country of <em>purchase</em>, at the VAT rate of that country (background information: <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-09/explanatory_notes_2015_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-09/explanatory_notes_2015_en.pdf</a>). This can apply even if the seller is not based in the EU or UK. It is accompanied by various auditing/recording requirements.</p>\n<h4>How this plugin can take away the pain</h4>\n<p>This WooCommerce plugin provides features to assist with EU, UK, Norwegian and Swiss VAT law compliance. Currently, those features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identify your customers&#8217; locations:</strong> this plugin will record evidence of your customer&#8217;s location, using their billing or shipping address, and their IP address (via a GeoIP lookup).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evidence is recorded, ready for audit:</strong> full information that was used to calculate VAT and customer location is displayed in the WooCommerce order screen in the back-end.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Display prices including correct VAT from the first page:</strong> GeoIP information is also used to show the correct VAT from the first time a customer sees a product. A widget and shortcode are also provided allowing the customer to set their own country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Currency conversions:</strong> Most users (if not everyone) will be required to report VAT information in a specific currency. This may be a different currency from their shop currency. This feature causes conversion rate information to be stored together with the order, at order time. Currently, you can choose from official rates from the European Central Bank (ECB), Danish and Czech National Banks, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and HM Customs &amp; Revenue (UK). You can also over-ride the currency and rate-provider on a per-country basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Entering and maintaining each country&#8217;s VAT rates:</strong> this plugin assists with entering EU and/or UK VAT rates accurately by supplying a single button to press in your WooCommerce tax rates settings, to add or update rates for all countries (standard or reduced) with one click.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reporting:</strong> Advanced reporting capabilities, allowing you to see all the information needed to make a OSS/MOSS/IOSS (one-stop shop) VAT report. The report is sortable and broken down by country, VAT rate, VAT type (traditional/variable) and order status, and can be exported as a CSV.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Forbid vatable sales if any goods have VAT chargeable</strong> &#8211; for shop owners for whom VAT compliance is too burdensome, this feature will allow you to forbid customers from configured VAT territories to check-out if they have selected any goods which are subject to VAT (whilst still allowing purchase of other goods, unlike the built-in WooCommerce feature which allows you to forbid check-out from some countries entirely).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Central control:</strong> brings all settings, reports and other information into a single centralised location, so that you don&#8217;t have to deal with items spread all over the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mixed shops:</strong> You can sell goods subject to your chosen territories&#8217; VAT under the customer-place-of-supply regulations and any other physical goods which are subject to traditional base-country-based VAT regulations. The plugin supports this via allowing you to identify which tax classes in your WooCommerce configuration are used for customer-place-of-supply items. Products are allocated to the correct country according to which country VAT is payable to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Distinguish VAT from other taxes:</strong> if you are in a jurisdiction where you have to apply other taxes also, then this plugin can correctly distinguish which taxes are payable to which jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Add line to invoices:</strong> If VAT was paid on the order, then an extra, configurable line can be added to the footer of the PDF invoice (when using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin</a>, or its premium counterpart).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Refund support:</strong> includes information on refunded VAT, on relevant orders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Same prices:</strong> Not strictly a VAT compliance issue (different pricing per-country is not illegal), but this plugin adds an option to enable WooCommerce&#8217;s hidden support for adjusting pre-tax prices to enable the same post-tax (net) price to apply in all customer locations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Brexit-ready:</strong> The plugin has been audited and appropriately adapted to be usable by both &#8220;EU 27&#8221; and UK (and other) countries after the expiry of the EU and UK&#8217;s transitional period (at the end of December 2020), including the ability to report taxes in multiple currencies using different exchange rate providers. Existing users should take the time to go through their existing settings to adapt to their new situation (e.g. remove tax table entries for countries that they are no longer required to remit taxes to; check that they are using the correct exchange rate provider and reporting currency for each tax region that they remit to).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce high-performance order storage:</strong> This plugin is HPOS-compatible (see: https://woocommerce.com/document/high-performance-order-storage/)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce block cart/checkout:</strong> This plugin is compatible with the WooCommerce block cart and checkout (see: https://woocommerce.com/checkout-blocks/), as well as the traditional shortcode cart/checkout.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">A Premium version is on sale at this link</a>, and currently has these <em>additional</em> features ready:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VAT-registered buyers can be exempted, and their numbers validated:</strong> a VAT number can be entered at the check-out, and it will be validated (via VIES, HMRC or VatSense). Qualifying customers can then be exempted from VAT on their purchase, and their information recorded. The customer&#8217;s VAT number will be appended to the billing address where shown (e.g. order summary email, PDF invoices). An extra, configurable line specific to this situation can be added to the footer of the PDF invoice (when using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Partial VAT exemption:</strong><strong> make VAT-exemption upon supply of a valid VAT number to only apply to products in tax classes specified by the shop owner (rather than to all products)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optionally allow B2B sales only</strong> &#8211; for shop owners who wish to only make sales that are VAT-exempt (i.e. B2B sales only), you can require that any EU and/or UK customers (optionally including or excluding those in your country) enter a valid VAT number at the check-out. (You can have different policies for different VAT regions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change taxation rules based upon year-to-date sales thresholds:</strong> for shop owners who can or must tax differently based upon their total sales in the year so far (e.g. EU shop owners who can take advantage of a â‚¬10,000 threshold for cross-border sales before which they can treat the place of supply as being their own, not the customer&#8217;s location), you can dynamically treat products as having a different taxation class until this threshold is met.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CSV download:</strong> A CSV containing comprehensive information on all orders with VAT data from your configured regions can be downloaded (including full compliance information). Manipulate in your spreadsheet program to make arbitrary calculations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Non-contradictory evidences:</strong> require two non-contradictory evidences of location (if the customer address and GeoIP lookup contradict, then the customer will be asked to self-certify his location, by choosing between them).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Show multiple currencies for VAT taxes on PDF invoices produced by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin</a></strong> (and on credit notes produced by its Premium counterpart).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for the official WooCommerce subscriptions extension, and for Subscriptio (a RightPress/CodeCanyon alternative), and Subscriben.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Value-based exemption:</strong> An order can have VAT removed if the order value passes a configured value and is for a specified country. This features was developed to support the UK&#8217;s 2021 regulations for handling VAT differently on an order depending on whether or not the order passes a Â£135 threshold value, and then expanded to support multiple rules for different countries and amounts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about the Premium version of this plugin at this link.</a></p>\n<p>It is believed (but not legally guaranteed), that armed with the above capabilities, a WooCommerce shop owner will be in a position to fulfil the requirements of EU or UK VAT laws: identifying the customer&#8217;s location and collecting multiple pieces of evidence, applying the correct VAT rate, validating VAT numbers for B2B transactions, and having the data needed to create returns. (If in the EU or UK, then you will also need to make sure that you are issuing your customers with VAT invoices containing the information required in your jurisdiction, via <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">a suitable WooCommerce invoice plugin</a>).</p>\n<h4>Footnotes and legalese</h4>\n<p>This plugin is supported on, and information in this document is for, WooCommerce 4.5 up to the latest release (i.e. current version; you can still <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/advanced/\" rel=\"ugc\">download older versions supporting previous WooCommerce release series if you wish</a>). It fetches data on current VAT rates from Amazon S3 (using SSL if possible); or, upon failure to connect to Amazon S3, from https://raw.githubusercontent.com. If your server&#8217;s firewall does not permit this, then it will use static data contained in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Geographical IP lookups are performed via WooCommerce&#8217;s built-in geo-location features; or, alternatively, if you use CloudFlare, then you can <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168236-What-does-CloudFlare-IP-Geolocation-do-\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">activate the CloudFlare feature for sending geographical information</a>. In some situations, these lookups may be performed via the public API at https://ipapi.co &#8211; if this is undesirable for you, then add <code>define('WC_VAT_COMPLIANCE_DO_REMOTE_IP_LOOKUPS', false);</code> to your wp-config.php file.</p>\n<p>Please make sure that you review this plugin&#8217;s installation instructions and have not missed any important information there.</p>\n<p>Please note that, just as with WordPress and its plugins generally (including WooCommerce), this plugin comes with no warranty of any kind and you deploy it entirely at your own risk. Furthermore, nothing in this plugin (including its documentation) constitutes legal or financial or any other kind of advice of any sort. In particular, you remain completely and solely liable for your own compliance with all taxation laws and regulations at all times, including research into what you must comply with. Installing any version of this plugin does not absolve you of any legal liabilities, or transfer any liabilities of any kind to us, and we provide no guarantee that use of this plugin will cover everything that your store needs to be able to do.</p>\n<p>Whether you think the EU&#8217;s treaties with other jurisdictions will lead to success in enforcing the collection of taxes in other jurisdictions is a question for lawyers and potential tax-payers, not for software developers!</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Diego Zanella, for various ideas we have swapped whilst working on these issues.

You can also display it anywhere in page content, using a shortcode, shown here with the default values for the available parameters: [euvat_country_selector include_notaxes=&#8221;1&#8243; classes=&#8221;&#8221; include_which_countries=&#8221;all&#8221;]. The &#8216;include_notaxes&#8217; parameter controls whether to include a &#8220;I am not liable to VAT&#8221; option.

However, WooCommerce does include <em>experimental</em> support for this (see: <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/How-Taxes-Work-in-WooCommerce#prices-including-tax---experimental-behavior\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/How-Taxes-Work-in-WooCommerce#prices-including-tax&#8212;experimental-behavior</a>), and so we have provided an option in the settings to tell WooCommerce to turn this on.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Consequently, the reports contained incorrect totals.

If using these filters, you will need to re-work them for HPOS compatibility.</li>\n<li>DEVELOPERS: The filter wc_eu_vat_compliance_report_meta_fields is deprecated, and has been replaced with the filter wc_eu_vat_compliance_report_extra_meta_fields. Please adapt your code to use the new filter; the old one will be removed in a future release.

2023-02-07</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add filter wc_vat_woocommerce_product_get_tax_class_zero_rate_class to allow a different tax class to the WooCommerce default one to be used as the designated zero-rate class.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Rename internal &#8220;Date&#8221; column in detailed CSV download to &#8220;Date (local)&#8221; to match the spreadsheet column heading; any developers who had written custom PHP code targetting this column will need to adjust their code.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Filters related to the detailed CSV download did not allow removal of columns from the base spreadsheet;

2022-07-04</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Adjust default filename for saving short summary reports</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add new filters (wc_vat_compliance_currency_converted_order_data_use_order_saved_data, wc_vat_compliance_currency_converted_order_data_use_conversion_time, wc_vat_compliance_currency_converted_order_data_use_rate, wc_vat_compliance_currency_converted_order_data_use_provider) which allow developers to modify the date used for currency conversion lookups for reporting data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.27.5 &#8211;

e.g. order created through custom means) has not recorded a GeoIP lookup for the IP address, then this will now be performed if viewing the order&#8217;s dashboard page. These lookups may be performed via the public API at https://ipapi.co &#8211; if this is undesirable for you, then add <code>define('WC_VAT_COMPLIANCE_DO_REMOTE_IP_LOOKUPS', false);</code> to your wp-config.php file.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Adjust the &#8220;No further information recorded&#8221; message for greater precision.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add the WC_Order to the parameters of the wc_eu_vat_compliance_meta_country_info filter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.27.3 &#8211; 2022-06-11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduce filter wc_vat_order_reporting_currency, useful for providing reports in other currencies</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent type error when taxation country is set but an empty string</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove no-longer-relevant help message from WooCommerce&#8217;s &#8220;Default Customer Address:&#8221; setting</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.27.2 &#8211; 2022-05-10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix a logic error in what country was saved in the session upon order review when taxation was based on shipping country and it differed from the billing country</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Suppress premature &#8220;The VAT number entered is not long enough to be valid for the chosen country&#8221; message that appears in recent WC versions</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Upgraded the .pot file</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Added filter wc_vat_compliance_include_order_in_report upon user request to allow programmer-controlled removal of orders from VAT reports</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.27.0 &#8211; 2022-04-26</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: The capability to use the plugin&#8217;s GeoIP resolution on all relevant pages is now exposed as an option, defaulting to off for new installs (since WooCommerce now has its own GeoIP resolution), and on for upgrades (reflecting the previous default behaviour). As part of the related changes, the country-selection widget and/or dropdown can now be used without having to accept the plugin&#8217;s own GeoIP resolution.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: The class WC_EU_VAT_Compliance_Preselect_Country has been renamed to WC_VAT_Compliance_Preselect_Country; if you had hand-written PHP code that interacted with it, you will want to review it</li>\n<li>TWEAK: The constant WC_EU_VAT_LOAD_ALL_CLASSES has been renamed to WC_VAT_LOAD_ALL_CLASSES</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Mark as requiring WP 4.7+; nothing explicit has been done to remove compatibility with earlier versions, but this is the updated support requirements)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Mark as supporting WooCommerce 3.8+ (nothing has been changed to remove WC 3.5-3.7 support, but this is our official support requirement)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.6 &#8211; 2022-03-29</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add &#8220;Aelia EU VAT Assistant&#8221; as description of source of IP/country data when the data stored so indicates</li>\n<li>TWEAK: The debugging constant WC_EU_VAT_DEBUG has been replaced with WC_VAT_DEBUG</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Do not register certain hooks related to country pre-selection in an admin context</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.5 &#8211; 2022-03-15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Any customer-entered VAT number (available in the Premium version) is now editable in the &#8216;billing address&#8217; section of the WooCommerce order admin screen</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.4 &#8211; 2022-03-09</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Change columns headings &#8220;VAT is variable&#8221; to the more precise &#8220;VAT is based on customer location&#8221; in detailed CSV spreadsheet download</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Make sure that the first parameter to round() is converted to a float, to prevent PHP 8.0+ type errors</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update the detection of buggy third-party plugins calling woocommerce_checkout_order_processed with insufficient actions for PHP 8.0 compliance</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.3 &#8211; 2022-02-05</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Change the multi-select HTML control for forbidding VAT checkout in specified regions into a list of checkboxes, to eliminate support requests from users unfamiliar with multi-selects and unable to succeed even with the attached help-text. Also improves UI consistency with the controls used elsewhere.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update to latest version of the paid plugin updater library</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.2 &#8211; 2022-01-25</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix a couple of cases in which it was possible for the VAT-exemption tatus to change without the checkout summary updating</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update to latest version of the paid plugin updater library</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.1 &#8211; 2022-01-20</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Incorrect checking of the results of jQuery.inArray() led to mishandling of a case for deciding whether to display self-certification fields (regression)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: If WP_DEBUG is active, then show more information about failed VAT numbers at the checkout</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.26.0 &#8211; 2022-01-07</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Add a new possibility, &#8220;United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland)&#8221; to the list of territories selectable for the &#8220;VAT exemption based on value&#8221; feature, allowing correct implementation of cross-border sales with value exemptions to stores selling from the EU to both Northern Ireland and the remainder of the UK.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Cart value-based VAT exemptions are not henceforth applied during product listing, so that VAT display/non-display on products is not dependent upon the current cart (even though the eventual cart and checkout values will be). It is judged that it is potentially confusing to have VAT display on listings change in this way. This behaviour can be controlled using the filter wc_vat_product_tax_class_pass_through_during_filters.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove debugging logging line</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Do not crash if wc_euvat_compliance_wpo_wcpdf_footer is called without an order number having been set (log a PHP error and pass through)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Improve detection of current order in wpo_wcpdf_footer_text filter</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Avoid using deprecated array access method on WC_Order_Item_Tax objects</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Mark as compatible with WP 5.9</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.11 &#8211; 2021-12-02</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Change default settings export filename to remove reference to plugin&#8217;s historically narrower scope</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Adjustment to prevent a couple of possible PHP notices when looking up a region</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.10 &#8211; 2021-11-01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix wrong variable reference when looking up VAT region which could cause an execution error in one combination of circumstances</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.8 &#8211; 2021-10-30</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: When the user had chosen partial VAT exemptions (Premium feature) (i.e. some tax classes and not others), exemption was not being applied to relevant shipping cost classes</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update updater library in Premium version to latest version</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a filter wc_vat_start_session_for_geoip to allow store owners to disable sessions for not-logged-in users before the checkout</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.7 &#8211; 2021-09-16</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Upon login, if the user has a saved billing/shipping country and WooCommerce settings are to use the same for tax calculations, then set this in the session as the chosen taxation country</li>\n<li>TWEAK: This update renames an internal session variable to remove the historic &#8220;eu_&#8221; prefix. Consequently, when you update, customers who had begun sessions in your store and had chosen a VAT country (e.g. via a widget or shortcode that you added) will have that choice forgotten.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Correct the &#8216;You can see your year-to-date sales in the &#8220;Reports&#8221; tab&#8217; link in the &#8216;Tax class translations&#8217; settings section</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP coding notices if the cart contents are invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.6 &#8211; 2021-09-07</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Saving settings after deleting all previously created and saved tax class translation rules did not remove them</li>\n<li>FIX: When getting the VAT region for an order refund for a credit note (when integrating with WP Overnight&#8217;s professional version), identify using the parent order</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.5 &#8211; 2021-08-17</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: If the order and reporting currencies for an order were the same, then the &#8220;VAT refunded (X, reporting currency)&#8221; column in the detailed CSV download was zero</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove the not necessarily pertinent &#8220;eu-&#8221; prefix from the default filename for downloaded detailed CSV files</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.4 &#8211; 2021-08-10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When displaying meta-box information about value-based exemptions, ensure that currency symbols are displayed correctly (i.e. don&#8217;t get double-encoded), in case there was an extension installed that did not follow the convention of get_woocommerce_currency_symbol() in WC core.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.3 &#8211; 2021-08-04</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: In the PDF invoice integration, when adding B2B/reverse charge text, you can include that is displayed only for a B2B (via VAT number) exemption, using the format {b2b_exemption}conditional content{/b2b_exemption}.</li>\n<li>FIX: Local pickup methods are now handled correctly in terms of VAT number entry on the checkout page</li>\n<li>FIX: At some point from 1.24.0, there was a regression in the display of the customer VAT number in invoice footers for at least some stores* TWEAK: Update bundled file with Slovenian e-book reduced VAT rate (5%). (N.B. This data was previously updated online &#8211; the bundled file is only used if the online version cannot be fetched).</li>\n<li>TWEAK: If you were using the constant WC_EU_VAT_NOCOUNTRYPRESELECT, then this is now deprecated; you should switch to using WC_VAT_NO_COUNTRY_PRESELECT</li>\n<li>TWEAK: The constant WC_EU_VAT_Compliance_Disable_Append_To_Billing has been renamed to WC_VAT_COMPLIANCE_DISABLE_APPEND_TO_BILLING</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.25.2 &#8211; 2021-07-01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Added experimental support for support for Norway (which is not a part of the EU).

    "description": "<h4>The European/UK VAT (IVA) laws</h4>\n<p>Since January 1st 2015, all digital goods (including electronic, telecommunications, software, ebook and broadcast services), and from 1st July 2021 physical goods sold across EU and UK borders have been liable under law to variable VAT (a.k.a. IVA) charged in the country of <em>purchase</em>, at the VAT rate of that country (background information: <a href=\"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-09/explanatory_notes_2015_en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-09/explanatory_notes_2015_en.pdf</a>). This can apply even if the seller is not based in the EU or UK. It is accompanied by various auditing/recording requirements.</p>\n<h4>How this plugin can take away the pain</h4>\n<p>This WooCommerce plugin provides features to assist with EU, UK, Norwegian and Swiss VAT law compliance. Currently, those features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identify your customers&#8217; locations:</strong> this plugin will record evidence of your customer&#8217;s location, using their billing or shipping address, and their IP address (via a GeoIP lookup).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Evidence is recorded, ready for audit:</strong> full information that was used to calculate VAT and customer location is displayed in the WooCommerce order screen in the back-end.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Display prices including correct VAT from the first page:</strong> GeoIP information is also used to show the correct VAT from the first time a customer sees a product. A widget and shortcode are also provided allowing the customer to set their own country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Currency conversions:</strong> Most users (if not everyone) will be required to report VAT information in a specific currency. This may be a different currency from their shop currency. This feature causes conversion rate information to be stored together with the order, at order time. Currently, you can choose from official rates from the European Central Bank (ECB), Danish and Czech National Banks, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and HM Customs &amp; Revenue (UK). You can also over-ride the currency and rate-provider on a per-country basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Entering and maintaining each country&#8217;s VAT rates:</strong> this plugin assists with entering EU and/or UK VAT rates accurately by supplying a single button to press in your WooCommerce tax rates settings, to add or update rates for all countries (standard or reduced) with one click.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reporting:</strong> Advanced reporting capabilities, allowing you to see all the information needed to make a OSS/MOSS/IOSS (one-stop shop) VAT report. The report is sortable and broken down by country, VAT rate, VAT type (traditional/variable) and order status, and can be exported as a CSV.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Forbid vatable sales if any goods have VAT chargeable</strong> &#8211; for shop owners for whom VAT compliance is too burdensome, this feature will allow you to forbid customers from configured VAT territories to check-out if they have selected any goods which are subject to VAT (whilst still allowing purchase of other goods, unlike the built-in WooCommerce feature which allows you to forbid check-out from some countries entirely).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Central control:</strong> brings all settings, reports and other information into a single centralised location, so that you don&#8217;t have to deal with items spread all over the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mixed shops:</strong> You can sell goods subject to your chosen territories&#8217; VAT under the customer-place-of-supply regulations and any other physical goods which are subject to traditional base-country-based VAT regulations. The plugin supports this via allowing you to identify which tax classes in your WooCommerce configuration are used for customer-place-of-supply items. Products are allocated to the correct country according to which country VAT is payable to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Distinguish VAT from other taxes:</strong> if you are in a jurisdiction where you have to apply other taxes also, then this plugin can correctly distinguish which taxes are payable to which jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Add line to invoices:</strong> If VAT was paid on the order, then an extra, configurable line can be added to the footer of the PDF invoice (when using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin</a>, or its premium counterpart).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Refund support:</strong> includes information on refunded VAT, on relevant orders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Same prices:</strong> Not strictly a VAT compliance issue (different pricing per-country is not illegal), but this plugin adds an option to enable WooCommerce&#8217;s hidden support for adjusting pre-tax prices to enable the same post-tax (net) price to apply in all customer locations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Brexit-ready:</strong> The plugin has been audited and appropriately adapted to be usable by both &#8220;EU 27&#8221; and UK (and other) countries after the expiry of the EU and UK&#8217;s transitional period (at the end of December 2020), including the ability to report taxes in multiple currencies using different exchange rate providers. Existing users should take the time to go through their existing settings to adapt to their new situation (e.g. remove tax table entries for countries that they are no longer required to remit taxes to; check that they are using the correct exchange rate provider and reporting currency for each tax region that they remit to).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce high-performance order storage:</strong> This plugin is HPOS-compatible (see: https://woocommerce.com/document/high-performance-order-storage/)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce block cart/checkout:</strong> This plugin is compatible with the WooCommerce block cart and checkout (see: https://woocommerce.com/checkout-blocks/), as well as the traditional shortcode cart/checkout.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">A Premium version is on sale at this link</a>, and currently has these <em>additional</em> features ready:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VAT-registered buyers can be exempted, and their numbers validated:</strong> a VAT number can be entered at the check-out, and it will be validated (via VIES, HMRC or VatSense). Qualifying customers can then be exempted from VAT on their purchase, and their information recorded. The customer&#8217;s VAT number will be appended to the billing address where shown (e.g. order summary email, PDF invoices). An extra, configurable line specific to this situation can be added to the footer of the PDF invoice (when using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Partial VAT exemption:</strong><strong> make VAT-exemption upon supply of a valid VAT number to only apply to products in tax classes specified by the shop owner (rather than to all products)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optionally allow B2B sales only</strong> &#8211; for shop owners who wish to only make sales that are VAT-exempt (i.e. B2B sales only), you can require that any EU and/or UK customers (optionally including or excluding those in your country) enter a valid VAT number at the check-out. (You can have different policies for different VAT regions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Change taxation rules based upon year-to-date sales thresholds:</strong> for shop owners who can or must tax differently based upon their total sales in the year so far (e.g. EU shop owners who can take advantage of a â‚¬10,000 threshold for cross-border sales before which they can treat the place of supply as being their own, not the customer&#8217;s location), you can dynamically treat products as having a different taxation class until this threshold is met.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CSV download:</strong> A CSV containing comprehensive information on all orders with VAT data from your configured regions can be downloaded (including full compliance information). Manipulate in your spreadsheet program to make arbitrary calculations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Non-contradictory evidences:</strong> require two non-contradictory evidences of location (if the customer address and GeoIP lookup contradict, then the customer will be asked to self-certify his location, by choosing between them).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Show multiple currencies for VAT taxes on PDF invoices produced by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">the free WooCommerce PDF invoices and packing slips plugin</a></strong> (and on credit notes produced by its Premium counterpart).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support for the official WooCommerce subscriptions extension, and for Subscriptio (a RightPress/CodeCanyon alternative), and Subscriben.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Value-based exemption:</strong> An order can have VAT removed if the order value passes a configured value and is for a specified country. This features was developed to support the UK&#8217;s 2021 regulations for handling VAT differently on an order depending on whether or not the order passes a Â£135 threshold value, and then expanded to support multiple rules for different countries and amounts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about the Premium version of this plugin at this link.</a></p>\n<p>It is believed (but not legally guaranteed), that armed with the above capabilities, a WooCommerce shop owner will be in a position to fulfil the requirements of EU or UK VAT laws: identifying the customer&#8217;s location and collecting multiple pieces of evidence, applying the correct VAT rate, validating VAT numbers for B2B transactions, and having the data needed to create returns. (If in the EU or UK, then you will also need to make sure that you are issuing your customers with VAT invoices containing the information required in your jurisdiction, via <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">a suitable WooCommerce invoice plugin</a>).</p>\n<h4>Footnotes and legalese</h4>\n<p>This plugin is supported on, and information in this document is for, WooCommerce 4.5 up to the latest release (i.e. current version; you can still <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/advanced/\" rel=\"ugc\">download older versions supporting previous WooCommerce release series if you wish</a>). It fetches data on current VAT rates from Amazon S3 (using SSL if possible); or, upon failure to connect to Amazon S3, from https://raw.githubusercontent.com. If your server&#8217;s firewall does not permit this, then it will use static data contained in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Geographical IP lookups are performed via WooCommerce&#8217;s built-in geo-location features; or, alternatively, if you use CloudFlare, then you can <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168236-What-does-CloudFlare-IP-Geolocation-do-\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">activate the CloudFlare feature for sending geographical information</a>. In some situations, these lookups may be performed via the public API at https://ipapi.co &#8211; if this is undesirable for you, then add <code>define('WC_VAT_COMPLIANCE_DO_REMOTE_IP_LOOKUPS', false);</code> to your wp-config.php file.</p>\n<p>Please make sure that you review this plugin&#8217;s installation instructions and have not missed any important information there.</p>\n<p>Please note that, just as with WordPress and its plugins generally (including WooCommerce), this plugin comes with no warranty of any kind and you deploy it entirely at your own risk. Furthermore, nothing in this plugin (including its documentation) constitutes legal or financial or any other kind of advice of any sort. In particular, you remain completely and solely liable for your own compliance with all taxation laws and regulations at all times, including research into what you must comply with. Installing any version of this plugin does not absolve you of any legal liabilities, or transfer any liabilities of any kind to us, and we provide no guarantee that use of this plugin will cover everything that your store needs to be able to do.</p>\n<p>Whether you think the EU&#8217;s treaties with other jurisdictions will lead to success in enforcing the collection of taxes in other jurisdictions is a question for lawyers and potential tax-payers, not for software developers!</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Diego Zanella, for various ideas we have swapped whilst working on these issues.
