All of WordPress&#8217;s built-in functions<br />\nwill use bcrypt too, when intially creating an account, changing your password, or adding a password to a post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if I deactivate the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As long as you have bcrypt support (PHP 5.3.0 or newer) WordPress will happily continue checking passwords that are hashed using<br />\nbcrypt. Everything should work fine. But any new passwords you hash (for a new account, or changing an existing account) will be<br />\nmade using MD5.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
