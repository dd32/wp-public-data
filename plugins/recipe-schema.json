Recipe Schema creates a new type of Posts, not shockingly called recipes. Multiple recipes can be inserted into a single Post and a single recipe can be in a bunch of different Posts.</p>\n<p>You need to create a Recipe before you can insert it into a Post.

The title will be copied to the Title field further down the form.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Continue designating the rest of the relevant information.</li>\n<li>Scroll down and double check that all of the information has been filled in correctly. Make sure you fill in the Source and URL for where you copied the recipe from.\n<ul>\n<li>If the Directions or Ingredients had Section headers you will need to add these.

A Recipe can be inserted into multiple Posts, and a Post can have multiple Recipes.<br />\nHere is how to do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on <strong>Posts</strong> on the left hand side of the WordPress Admin menu</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Edit</strong> on an existing Post you would like to insert a Recipe into</li>\n<li>Scroll down the page til you see the Recipe Schema box</li>\n<li>Begin typing the title of the Recipe you would.

If there is nothing there, or if you want to change it, click <strong>Change Image</strong> and select an image.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By default all of the selected Recipes get added to the end of the Post. If you would like the recipes to be in the middle of the Post, you can use a shortcode. Add the shortcode <strong>[recipes]</strong> into the Post where you would like the Recipes to appear.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>You can download and install the Recipe Schema Plugin using the built-in WordPress plugin installer.</p>\n<p>If you download the Recipe Schema Plugin manually, unzip it and upload the <em>recipe-schema</em> folder to your website. The foler should go in the <em>/wp-content/plugins/</em> directory.</p>\n<p>Activate the Recipe Schema Plugin in the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; admin panel using the &#8220;Activate&#8221; link.</p>\n<h4>Settings</h4>\n<p>There are a couple of Settings for Recipe Schema. To set them, click on Recipe Schema under the Settings menu in the WordPress Admin screen.<br />\n*   You can let readers bookmark recipes on Facebook through Mr. Cookbook. This is a small website I created that makes it possible to collect recipes across website using this plugin.<br />\n*   You can hide/show the Printer button.<br />\n*   The Featured Image for a Recipe can also be shown. This setting won&#8217;t affect whether Google shows thumbnails or not.<br />\n*   You can add to the Recipe Type and Cuisine Taxonomies for Recipes</p>\n<p>** Template **<br />\nTo change the way Recipes get printed out, click on the Templates tab under settings. Make changes to the Template code here. Remove sections you don&#8217;t wanted printed out, like the Prep time for example, or change how they are formatted. It is PHP code, so you will need to know a little about programming.</p>\n<p>Your changes to the Template will get lost whenever this plugin gets updated. If you want to keep your changes, it is probably best to make a copy of /wp-content/plugins/recipe-schema/templates/default.php</p>\n<p>In future version I am going to make this suck less.</p>\n",

You can use the their Schema.org <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">testing tool</a> to make sure they are processing your page correctly.
