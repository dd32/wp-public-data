Just enter a few simple words to describe what you would like to create, then summon Prompt Genie to use it&#8217;s custom-trained machine learning model to turn your boring prompts into amazingly artistic images. Prompt Genie is a great way to create fantastic images with Imajinn without having to learn the complex skill of prompt building that&#8217;s necessary to use other tools like DALLE or Stable Diffusion.</p>\n<h3>Touchup (Inpainting)</h3>\n<p>Touchup mode allows you to customize and make modifications to an image in a more precise way by allowing you to remove or replace parts of the image with new content generated from your prompt. This is useful for removing unwanted objects like watermarks, signatures, or duplicates. Or you can use it to add new objects to the image, such as a forground item or background. Touchup allows you to create the exact image you want by choosing where each element in the image goes. You can create that complex image you have in mind, even if it is too specific to get right with one initial prompt.</p>\n<p>Touchup works by choosing an image as an input, masking an area with the brush that you want to modify, then adjusting your prompt to describe what you want in that area.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>This plugin does not collect or share data other than your prompts and generated images as needed to run our API service. Read our <a href=\"https://infiniteuploads.com/privacy/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=imajinn_readme&amp;utm_term=privacy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>About Us</h3>\n<p>Imajinn AI is built and maintained by the team behind Infinite Uploads &#8211; a premium cloud storage provider and content delivery network (CDN) for all your WordPress media files.

        "installation": "<p>Once you install the plugin, simply insert the &#8220;Imajinn AI&#8221; Gutenberg block in any post or page editor, or visit the Media-&gt;Imajinn AI page. You will be prompted to create a free account or connect to your existing account right in the block, and then you can start generating images right away.</p>\n<p>Running an artificial intelligence neural network requires a lot of computing power. To make this possible, we run a cloud service to run the neural network. This means that you need to connect to our service before you can use the plugin. To connect to Imajinn AI, you need to have a user account. You can create one for free with just your valid email address and a password, or if you already have an account, you can log in with your Infinite Uploads/Imajinn AI email and password.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20it%20good%20at%20generating%3F'>\nWhat is it good at generating?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This AI model can create some amazing images with the right guidance. It especially excels at more artistic images such as paintings, drawings, CG, etc. Think stock photos or art.</p>\n<p>It struggles a bit with photorealistic human faces and body parts, which can appear strangely deformed. This can be avoided by choosing a more artistic style or close-up portrait. Also, if you ask it to generate text the letters are usually mangled or mixed up.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20imajinn%20ai%20plugin%20free%3F'>\nIs the Imajinn AI plugin free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While the plugin is free and can be used on unlimited sites, it does require an account with our cloud service to power the extremely computation-heavy AI algorithms. You can sign up for an account and receive free image credits to try it out. You can also upgrade to one of our paid plans for more image generation credits, at a fraction of the cost of stock photo sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20copyright%20license%20of%20images%20i%20create%3F'>\nWhat is the copyright license of images I create?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All generated images that comply with our service usage terms are public domain and are yours to license as you see fit. We retain no rights to them. Because the public domain is not a unified concept across legal jurisdictions, the specific license of generated images is that of the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20websites%20can%20i%20connect%20to%20one%20cloud%20account%3F'>\nHow many websites can I connect to one cloud account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Connect an unlimited number of sites to your Imajinn account, and they all will share the same image generation credits budget. We will soon have stats and usage reports for each site in your dashboard.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20restrictions%20are%20there%3F'>\nWhat restrictions are there?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our AI has much more relaxed restrictions than ones like DALLE-3. But with great power comes great responsibility, so you must agree to abide by our restrictions for all prompts and generated images:</p>\n<p>You should not attempt to generate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NSFW, lewd, or sexual material</li>\n<li>Hateful or violent imagery, such as antisemitic iconography, racist caricatures, misogynistic and misandrist propaganda, etc.</li>\n<li>Personal information about yourself or any other person.  This includes but is not limited to phone numbers, residential addresses, social security numbers, drivers license numbers, account numbers, etc.</li>\n<li>Copyrighted or trademarked material should be avoided in prompts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More specifically you agree not to use the Model or Derivatives of the Model:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local or international law or regulation;</li>\n<li>For the purpose of exploiting, harming or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way;</li>\n<li>To generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others;</li>\n<li>To generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used to harm an individual;</li>\n<li>To defame, disparage or otherwise harass others;</li>\n<li>For fully automated decision making that adversely impacts an individual‚Äôs legal rights or otherwise creates or modifies a binding, enforceable obligation;</li>\n<li>For any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against or harming individuals or groups based on online or offline social behavior or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics;</li>\n<li>To exploit any of the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons based on their age, social, physical or mental characteristics, in order to materially distort the behavior of a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm;</li>\n<li>For any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against individuals or groups based on legally protected characteristics or categories;</li>\n<li>To provide medical advice and medical results interpretation;</li>\n<li>To generate or disseminate information for the purpose to be used for administration of justice, law enforcement, immigration or asylum processes, such as predicting an individual will commit fraud/crime commitment (e.g. by text profiling, drawing causal relationships between assertions made in documents, indiscriminate and arbitrarily-targeted use).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also will be filtering prompt input and screening output to block the creation of adult content.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
