This reduces the possibility that you&#8217;ll make errors by performing actions on the wrong site.</p>\n<p>If you are using DesktopServer for your local development and would like to use the Admin Color Bar plugin as a Design Time plugin, you can install this in your /Applications/XAMPP/ds-plugins/ directory on Macintosh or the C:\\xampplite\\ds-plugins\\ directory on Windows and it can then be configured to automatically start for all of your local development web sites. This allows you to use the plugin in your Local environment, where it&#8217;s needed and not to deploy it to your Live environment where it may not be needed.

You can also select a message that will be displayed within the Admin Bar to provide additional information to the users of the site.</p>\n<p>The configuration settings will be seen by all users on the site.
