It can be added to your child theme&#8217;s functions.php. Without this, the note position will default to a separate column on the plugins page.</p>\n<pre><code>function pnp_change_note_placement( $note_placement ) {\n\n    $note_placement = 'description';\n\n    return $note_placement;\n\n}\nadd_filter( 'plugin-notes-plus_note_placement', 'pnp_change_note_placement' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20which%20icons%20are%20available%20to%20display%20next%20to%20plugin%20notes%3F'>\nCan I modify which icons are available to display next to plugin notes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can use the filter plugin-notes-plus_icon_options to modify the set of icons available. The icons must be selected from <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the list of available WordPress dashicons</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a snippet that removes one icon and adds an additional icon to the list of options. It can be added to your child theme&#8217;s functions.php:</p>\n<pre><code>function pnp_change_icon_options( $icon_options ) {\n\n    // Remove key option\n    unset( $icon_options['dashicons-admin-network'] );\n\n    // Add smartphone option\n    $icon_options['dashicons-smartphone'] = 'Smartphone';\n\n    return $icon_options;\n}\nadd_filter( 'plugin-notes-plus_icon_options', 'pnp_change_icon_options' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20html%20tags%20are%20permitted%2C%20and%20can%20that%20list%20be%20modified%3F'>\nWhich HTML tags are permitted, and can that list be modified?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the following HTML tags: <code>a</code>, <code>br</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>strong</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>u</code>, <code>hr</code>.</p>\n<p>To modify the list of available tags, use the filter plugin-notes-plus_allowed_html. Be careful, however, to avoid allowing tags that could leave the site vulnerable to an XSS attack.</p>\n<pre><code>function pnp_change_allowed_html_tags( $allowed_tags ) {\n\n    // Remove br from allowed tags\n    unset( $allowed_tags['br'] );\n\n    // Add img to allowed tags\n    $allowed_tags['img'] = array();\n\n    return $allowed_tags;\n}\nadd_filter( 'plugin-notes-plus_allowed_html', 'pnp_change_allowed_html_tags' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20data%20stored%3F'>\nWhere is the data stored?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin notes and note metadata are stored in a custom table whose name ends in <code>plugin_notes_plus</code>. In the initial version (1.0.0), notes were stored in the options table. Version 1.1.0 was released to migrate existing notes from the options table into the <code>plugin_notes_plus</code> table. Upgrading to version 1.1.1 will perform a cleanup, removing any notes from the options table.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%20on%20multisite%20installs%3F'>\nHow does it work on multisite installs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each site within a multisite install maintains its own plugin notes. Additionally, the superadmin can maintain their own plugin notes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20hide%20plugin%20notes%20from%20specific%20users%3F'>\nCan I hide plugin notes from specific users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.2.6, you can use the filter plugin-notes-plus_hide_notes to show or hide plugin notes.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a snippet that hides plugin notes from a specfic user. It can be added to your child theme&#8217;s functions.php. Without this, plugin notes are displayed by default to all users who can view the plugins page.</p>\n<pre><code>function pnp_hide_notes( $hide_notes ) {\n\n    // logic to set $hide_notes to TRUE or FALSE\n\n    return $hide_notes;\n\n}\nadd_filter( 'plugin-notes-plus_hide_notes', 'pnp_hide_notes' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
