        "description": "<p>** WARNING: DON&#8217;T USE THIS PLUGIN IF YOUR PERMALINKS INCLUDE DATES **</p>\n<p>The Republish Old Posts plugin helps revive old posts by resetting the publish date to the current date. This will push old posts to your front page, the top of archive pages, and back into RSS feeds. Ideal for sites with a large repository of evergreen content.</p>\n<p>Why would you want to do this? Here are a few reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>New visitors to your site haven&#8217;t seen your old content. This will help them discover it.</li>\n<li>Old content won&#8217;t show up in date-based searches on search engines, but resetting the date can make them look fresh again.</li>\n<li>People like to share and link to new content and they determine that by looking at the publication date.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://infolific.com/technology/software-worth-using/republish-old-posts-for-wordpress/#pro-version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro version</a> (a lifetime license is less than $15) with many additional options (see screenshots) for controlling when and what posts are republished.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload Republish Old Posts to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Adjust the options as needed to suit your republishing schedule</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='are%20posts%20duplicated%3F'>\nAre posts duplicated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The date on posts is updated to the current date making a post appear new. URLs don&#8217;t change and comments continue to display with the post.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='doesn%27t%20changing%20the%20timestamp%20affect%20permalinks%20that%20include%20dates%3F'>\nDoesn&#8217;t changing the timestamp affect permalinks that include dates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes permalinks with dates would be affected. This plugin shouldn&#8217;t be used if your permalinks include dates since those dates will change when a post is republished.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20like%20this%20plugin%2C%20do%20you%20have%20others%3F'>\nI like this plugin, do you have others?\n</h4>\n<p></p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20wpmu%3F'>\nDoes this work with WPMU?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='two%20posts%20are%20being%20republished%20at%20the%20same%20time.%20how%20do%20i%20fix%20this%3F'>\nTwo posts are being republished at the same time. How do I fix this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Odd behavior has been noticed when both the All in One SEO plugin and the Republish Old Posts plugin are active. If you&#8217;re not using the AIO SEO plugin, but still experiencing issues, please leave a message in the support forum. Republish Old Posts works fine with the Yoast SEO plugin and no other SEO plugin conflicts have been reported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20post%20slugs%20change%20upon%20republishing%3F'>\nWhy do post slugs change upon republishing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t alter post slugs. It changes the post date and, depending on the settings, changes the post&#8217;s status. If you have other plugins that take actions when a post&#8217;s date or status change, you may see some unexpected results. There isn&#8217;t much I can do about the behavior of other plugins.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
