Out of the box, you can hack together a pretty cool front end without worrying about backwards compatibility, while saving you a ton of time by facilitating many time consuming aspects of front end design for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What version of bootstrap does this require?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Bootstrap 4.3</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I enable automatic bootstrap inclusion?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is for people already planning to use bootstrap 4, so if you already included bootstrap, the answer is no.  If you haven&#8217;t included it, then yes.  Keep in mind that it only enqueues bootstrap on the pages where you include Carousels.</p>\n<p>Screenshots and additional info coming soon!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
