Not many visible changes but more stable, and the code is a lot prettier.</p>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed some security thing that someone complained about, where administrator, not using WordFence etc, could add script to their own site in some input field. Luckily this is now fixed. Admins of sites using this plugin now have to use the themes editor, ftp, header or footer script plugins if they, for reasons unknown, would want to trasher their own site.</p>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<p>A bunch of minor stuff, problem with login with facebook-plugin, js files and external content not loaded etc.</p>\n<h4>1.5.5</h4>\n<p>WP 5.7 Version check</p>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<p>Buttons for creating default pages in Settings<br />\nMinor bugfixes.<br />\nWP Version check.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version</li>\n</ul>\n"
