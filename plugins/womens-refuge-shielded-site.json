You can insert the [womens_refuge_shield] shortcode where you want it on the page.<br />\n2. You can insert the Widget into where you wish to use it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20options%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat options are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can control to look of the icon by changing the icon_size parameter (valid options: <em>large</em> (default), <em>small</em>, or <em>button</em>).</p>\n<p>For the more technical users, you can also affect the ID of the inserted image using the element_id parameter, and the ID of the modal overlay using the modal_id parameter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20control%20the%20styling%3F'>\nCan I control the styling?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The link image is inserted to your site inside a</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>div&gt; element, with a class of &#8220;.wrss_container&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20include%20more%20than%20one%20version%20on%20my%20page%3F'>\nCan I include more than one version on my page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. <strong>However</strong> you should note that only the last one on the page will activate when you click on it, due to a limitation from the code provided by https://shielded.co.nz</p>\n</p>\n\n",
