Just adding the # symbol in front of a word or phrase makes<br />\nit a link to the archive page of that hashtag.</p>\n<p>Originally this plugin simply created links to a search results page for the<br />\nhashtags, and that worked well but we got to thinking about SEO and how it<br />\nwould be nice to index the hashtags on your site. So we created a custom taxonomy<br />\n&#8220;Hashtags&#8221; (duh) so now you have some options on how you display the archive<br />\npages and the SEO meta for the pages (if you are so inclinded). You could even<br />\ncreate a tag cloud of all your hashtags using WordPress&#8217; tag cloud widget.</p>\n<p>We are leaving all the customizing of the archive pages and SEO work up to you<br />\nand your theme but your options are much more plentyful since version 2.0</p>\n<p>Have fun!

Moving to custom taxonomy &#8220;hashtag&#8221; instead of simple search<br />\nresults page.</p>\n<p>Warning to the few v1.0 users: you will have to go back and resave any posts<br />\nwith hashtags in order for them to properly be adding the the new custom<br />\ntaxonomy. You can do so in bulk by selecting the posts the clicking &#8220;bulk<br />\nedit&#8221; then &#8220;update&#8221;, you don&#8217;t need to make any changes but the plugin just<br />\nneeds to fire on save.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Plugin launch!</p>\n"
