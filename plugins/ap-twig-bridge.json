        "faq": "\n<h4>What PHP version does this plugin support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin should support php &gt; 5.3.0, but is tested only on php 5.3.8.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I start creating my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can directly edit files in twigbridge theme folder (don&#8217;t forget to copy it to you <code>wp-content/themes</code> directory). You can use functions.php to add some hooks or to load text domain.<br />\nYou must have at least these files: style.css, index.php (must contain php-code to display the template, please check the example), header.php, footer.php, searchform.php.<br />\nAll twig files must be in <code>wp-content/themes/yourthemefolder/Twig</code>. At least <code>index.html.twig</code> must exist.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I create a special template for a page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check please <code>links.php</code> and <code>archives.php</code> about how the php-file should look like. Create a similar file with the name you want (e.g. special.php). Then<br />\nyou just create a <code>special.html.twig</code> file and write all the code you need there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Your plugin lacks some WordPress functions. How can I add them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I know, that I didn&#8217;t include many WordPress API function, because initially this plugin was just a proff of concept. Actually, you can add the functions you need<br />\nto APBridge_TwigExtension module yourself, but your changes will be overwritten next time you update the plugin to a new version. So, creating your own extension<br />\nwill be the best way to add the functions you need. You can do it in <code>index.php</code> this way: <code>$twigBridge-&gt;getTwig()-&gt;addExtension(new YourExtensionClass())</code>.<br />\nIt must be called befor template rendering, of course. You can use <code>APBridge_TwigExtension</code> class as an example. Also you can write to me about the functions you need,<br />\nso that I could include them in future versions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there an easy way to contact the developer of this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course there is.
