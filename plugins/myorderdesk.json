        "installation": "<p>For manual installation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the MyOrderDesk screen to configure the plugin</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='setup'>\nSetup\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To configure your plugin you need your MyOrderDesk Provider ID, site Hosted address, and your WordPress configured landing page.</p>\n<p>To find your Provider ID, log into your MyOrderDesk website with an administrator account. Open the administration menu by clicking the three horizontal lines in the top left corner of the screen.</p>\n<p>You will see a dropdown menu that says &#8220;[#####] Your Company Name&#8221; The numbers inside of the square brackets will be your Provider ID.</p>\n<p>Your Hosted Address can be found from the administration menu by visiting Site Settings &gt; Home Page &amp; Domains.</p>\n<p>Your Landing Page is the WordPress page that contains a shortcode for MyOrderDesk that handles incoming link requests. Typically this will be /w2p. This page should not be nested (/not/like/this).</p>\n<p>Once you successfully enter your information, the page layout should change and you should see a list of shortcodes that can be used to display specific pages based on that Provider ID.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='linking'>\nLinking\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The final step of setup is putting the shortcode onto the respective pages that you want your site to appear on.</p>\n<p>To do this, all you need to do is copy the [mod-xxxxxx] text, and paste it into the page that you want it to display on. The plugin will handle everything else for you, and it\\&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<p>For more complex scenarios, where you want to embed specific order forms, catalgos, or use a branded site, you can implement that by changing the modifier designated to it.<br />\n[mod-orderform form=&#8221;###&#8221;] is used to link specific order forms<br />\n[mod-catalog catalog=&#8221;###&#8221;] is used to link specific catalogs<br />\nsite=&#8221;###&#8221; can be added to any shortcodes as well, to change what site is being displayed, rather than the master set in settings. This lets you link branded websites.</p>\n<p>For the [mod-order] page, in some cases you may want to force the user to log in before they can view the page. For this, you can add &#8220;force&#8221; to the shortcode, like so: [mod-order force]</p>\n</p>\n\n",
