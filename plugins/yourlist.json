The concept for this plugin came about as I was developing my cooking website, <a href=\"http://www.screamingsaucepan.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ScreamingSaucepan.com</a>. It occurred to me it might be nice to be able to remind myself about recipes in some way other than tagging them on del.icio.us, perhaps at a time when I might be wandering around the aisles of the grocery store. This plugin has only the most basic functionality, no administration panel, no options. It simply opens the yourli.st page and prepopulates the Event Title field with the title of the blog posting and inserts the permalink in the Event Summary. All you need to do is fill in your e-mail address, target date, and whatever other options you&#8217;d like to adjust.</p>\n",
