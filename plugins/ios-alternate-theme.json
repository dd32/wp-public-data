        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want to display a different theme to Apple iOS users?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may not. I honestly wouldn&#8217;t unless I was producing a full-Flash website with WordPress as a backend.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not just use WPtouch?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try it! The free version does not currently support iPad, though, and I felt that it was overpowered for my needs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this change the theme for other concurrent users as well, or just specific users?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Theme switching is done independently for each concurrent user. You need not worry about non-iOS users seeing the alternate theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this work with any theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but you may need to conform a few technical things. Continue reading for specific cases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My widgets and/or menus are not appearing in my alternate theme. What&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The internal WordPress <code>id</code>&#8216;s must match in both themes for menus/widgets to work consistently.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can this plugin work with WP Super Cache?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Check out this <strong><a href=\"http://www.bravenewcode.com/2009/01/wptouch-and-wp-super-cache/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPtouch article</a></strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Umm, how/where do I set what the alternate theme is?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time, you will have to edit the plugin file itself on line 16. Put in the folder name of the theme. Eventually, I will create a proper UI.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work for WordPress version x.x.x?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has only been tested with versions of WordPress as early as 3.2. For anything older, you&#8217;ll have to see for yourself.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
