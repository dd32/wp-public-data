We provide detailed security stats for all of our security features to have a full control of security. All security logs are stored in the cloud for 45 days.</p>\n<p>Security FireWall by CleanTalk is a free plugin which works with the premium Cloud security service cleantalk.org. This security plugin as a service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service.</p>\n<p>Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.</p>\n<p>What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details. First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.</p>\n<h4>Limit Login Attempts</h4>\n<p>Limit Login Attempts &#8211; is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall.</p>\n<p>Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks.</p>\n<h4>Brute Force Protection</h4>\n<p>It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security &amp; Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Security Audit Log</em> keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.<br />\nWith the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.<br />\nSecurity Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.</p>\n<h4>Security Traffic Control</h4>\n<p>CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters.</p>\n<p>Another option in Security Traffic Control &#8211; &#8220;Block user after requests amounts more than&#8221; &#8211; blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours.</p>\n<h4>Security Firewall</h4>\n<p>To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.</p>\n<p>Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.</p>\n<p>CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.<br />\nAlso, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.</p>\n<h4>Security Malware Scanner</h4>\n<p>Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.</p>\n<p>Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.</p>\n<p>CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.</p>\n<p>CleanTalk Security has a &#8220;Feedback System&#8221; for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.</p>\n<p>Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.</p>\n<p>Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning.</p>\n<p>Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.<br />\n<a href=\"https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis\" title=\"About Scanner Feedback System\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Scanner Feedback System</a></p>\n<h4>Security Malware Heuristic Check</h4>\n<p>This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.</p>\n<h4>Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections</h4>\n<p>The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.</p>\n<h4>CleanTalk Web Application FireWall for WordPress Security Plugin</h4>\n<p>The main purpose of Security Web Application FireWall is to protect the Web application from unauthorized access, even if there are critical vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.</p>\n<p>In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs_firewall</p>\n<p>Security CleanTalk Web Application FireWall for WordPress is the proactive defense against known and unknown vulnerabilities to prevent hacks in real-time.</p>\n<p>Learn more how to set up and test<br />\n<a href=\"https://cleantalk.org/help/security-waf\" title=\"About Web Application Firewall\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Security Web Application Firewall</a></p>\n<h4>Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication</h4>\n<p>It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.</p>\n<p>With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.</p>\n<h4>Change the URL of the wp-login page</h4>\n<p>This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.</p>\n<p>To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -&gt; Settings -&gt; Security by CleanTalk -&gt; General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.<br />\nThis option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.</p>\n<p>If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.</p>\n<h4>Can I use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence together</h4>\n<p>Sure, you can use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence. Quite often we get question from our customers, will there be a conflict between CleanTalk and Wordfence? We tested CleanTalk Security and Wordfence working together and they work without any conflicts.</p>\n<h4>Email Notifications when administrators are logged in</h4>\n<p>We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.</p>\n<p>You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.</p>\n<h4>Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS?</h4>\n<p>Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.</p>\n<h4>`Send additional HTTP headers` option</h4>\n<p>There are several additional http-headers which added to the every http-requests by the plugin if this option is enabled:<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;X-Content-Type-Options&#8221; improves the security of your site (and your users) against some types of drive-by-downloads.<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;X-XSS-Protection&#8221; header improves the security of your site against some types of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;Strict-Transport-Security&#8221; response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;Referrer-Policy&#8221; make the <code>Referer</code> http-header transferring more strictly.</p>\n<h4>File System Watcher feature</h4>\n<p>File system Watcher monitors changes in the file system. This allows to quickly respond to a site infection by tracking which files were affected. The Watcher makes file system snapshots as often as one hour and show difference up to seven days time frame.</p>\n<h4>CleanTalk Research</h4>\n<p>Attention!

We provide detailed security stats for all of our security features to have a full control of security. All security logs are stored in the cloud for 45 days.</p>\n<p>Security FireWall by CleanTalk is a free plugin which works with the premium Cloud security service cleantalk.org. This security plugin as a service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service.</p>\n<p>Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.</p>\n<p>What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details. First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.</p>\n<h4>Limit Login Attempts</h4>\n<p>Limit Login Attempts &#8211; is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall.</p>\n<p>Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks.</p>\n<h4>Brute Force Protection</h4>\n<p>It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security &amp; Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.</p>\n<p><em>Security Audit Log</em> keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.<br />\nWith the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.<br />\nSecurity Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.</p>\n<h4>Security Traffic Control</h4>\n<p>CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters.</p>\n<p>Another option in Security Traffic Control &#8211; &#8220;Block user after requests amounts more than&#8221; &#8211; blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours.</p>\n<h4>Security Firewall</h4>\n<p>To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.</p>\n<p>Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.</p>\n<p>CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.<br />\nAlso, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.</p>\n<h4>Security Malware Scanner</h4>\n<p>Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.</p>\n<p>Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.</p>\n<p>CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.</p>\n<p>CleanTalk Security has a &#8220;Feedback System&#8221; for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.</p>\n<p>Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.</p>\n<p>Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning.</p>\n<p>Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.<br />\n<a href=\"https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis\" title=\"About Scanner Feedback System\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Scanner Feedback System</a></p>\n<h4>Security Malware Heuristic Check</h4>\n<p>This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.</p>\n<h4>Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections</h4>\n<p>The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.</p>\n<h4>CleanTalk Web Application FireWall for WordPress Security Plugin</h4>\n<p>The main purpose of Security Web Application FireWall is to protect the Web application from unauthorized access, even if there are critical vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.</p>\n<p>In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs_firewall</p>\n<p>Security CleanTalk Web Application FireWall for WordPress is the proactive defense against known and unknown vulnerabilities to prevent hacks in real-time.</p>\n<p>Learn more how to set up and test<br />\n<a href=\"https://cleantalk.org/help/security-waf\" title=\"About Web Application Firewall\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Security Web Application Firewall</a></p>\n<h4>Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication</h4>\n<p>It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.</p>\n<p>With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.</p>\n<h4>Change the URL of the wp-login page</h4>\n<p>This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.</p>\n<p>To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -&gt; Settings -&gt; Security by CleanTalk -&gt; General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.<br />\nThis option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.</p>\n<p>If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.</p>\n<h4>Can I use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence together</h4>\n<p>Sure, you can use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence. Quite often we get question from our customers, will there be a conflict between CleanTalk and Wordfence? We tested CleanTalk Security and Wordfence working together and they work without any conflicts.</p>\n<h4>Email Notifications when administrators are logged in</h4>\n<p>We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.</p>\n<p>You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.</p>\n<h4>Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS?</h4>\n<p>Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.</p>\n<h4>`Send additional HTTP headers` option</h4>\n<p>There are several additional http-headers which added to the every http-requests by the plugin if this option is enabled:<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;X-Content-Type-Options&#8221; improves the security of your site (and your users) against some types of drive-by-downloads.<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;X-XSS-Protection&#8221; header improves the security of your site against some types of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;Strict-Transport-Security&#8221; response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.<br />\n&#8211; &#8220;Referrer-Policy&#8221; make the <code>Referer</code> http-header transferring more strictly.</p>\n<h4>File System Watcher feature</h4>\n<p>File system Watcher monitors changes in the file system. This allows to quickly respond to a site infection by tracking which files were affected. The Watcher makes file system snapshots as often as one hour and show difference up to seven days time frame.</p>\n<h4>CleanTalk Research</h4>\n<p>Attention!
