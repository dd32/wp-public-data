How about you? I&#8217;m shocked, shocked I tell you, that no one has done this before.

This is recommended only for people who like that sort of thing, or who customarily play record albums backwards to listen for hidden messages.</p>\n<p>Why would you bother releasing such a stupid plugin?</p>\n<p>It is not <em>that</em> stupid. It took maybe five minutes to modify Matt&#8217;s code. It made me happier than I was before. Besides, it shows how easy it would be to change the same plugin to put perhaps genuinely useful reminder information on the screen.</p>\n"
