It then creates the taxonomy for you and takes care of the URL rewrites.</p>\n<p>It provides a widget that you can use to display a &#8220;taxonomy cloud&#8221; or a list of all the terms; it allows you to show the taxonomy contents at the end of posts and excerpts as well. To increase flexibility, a shortcode and block has been provided to output these terms wherever desired.</p>\n<p>You can also export the Taxonomy definition to include it directly in your own code.</p>\n<p>You can also create terms easily by typing them into a list; or by copying them from an existing taxonomy.</p>\n<p>A tool has been provided to support changing the taxonomy slug. Any terms and their usages will also be linked to the renamed slug.</p>\n<p>For admin screens displaying multiple taxonomies it is possible to define their display column order.</p>\n<p>A tool is provided to merge a number of terms within a taxonomy into a single one. All usages of the selected terms are changed to the merged one.</p>\n<p>Options are provided to add a selection dropdown in the admin list and to define minimum and maximum required term counts using posts of selected statuses (and not only &#8220;published&#8221;).
