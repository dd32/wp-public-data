        "description": "<p>This plugin adds a shortcode tag that will display a rating in one of several formats. Here is a<br />\nfeature breakdown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Input ratings as a fraction (4/5) or a percentage (80%).</li>\n<li>Use any amount of stars from 2 to 100.</li>\n<li>Set the minimal star fraction allowed, whole, half or quarter.</li>\n<li>Split multiple ratings in one post/page into groups, and have a separate overall rating<br />\ncalculated for each.</li>\n<li>Display the rating as image stars, text stars, a percentage, a fraction, or any combination.</li>\n<li>Multiple star image sets included, others can be easily added.</li>\n<li>Fully templatized output, use whatever tags you want.</li>\n<li>Optionally group ratings in a table or other structure.</li>\n<li>Settings page for global settings and tag defaults.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only required parameter is rating, the rest are optional. Here is a basic example.<br />\n    [xrr rating=4/5]</p>\n<p>This will convert the 60% into a fraction and display it as text stars:<br />\n    [xrr rating=60% display_as=textstars]</p>\n<p>This will display 10 stars from the tiny_star image set and label the rating &#8216;Movie Rating:&#8217;:<br />\n    [xrr rating=7.25/10 imageset=tiny_star label=&#8221;Movie Rating:&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Check the Tag Options section for complete options.</p>\n<p>The global settings on the settings page are documented there.</p>\n<h3>Tag Options</h3>\n<p>Each of these can have their defaults changed on the settings page, or be changed in each tag. You can mix and match<br />\ndisplay styles and options in the same post/page.</p>\n<p><strong>rating</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>rating</code> attribute is required in every xrr tag unless there is an <code>overall</code> attribute. Both fractions and percentages are valid inputs.<br />\nAny fraction is acceptable, the rating is converted to an intermediate format and then to the specified output format. Unless explicitly<br />\noverridden with the <code>max_stars</code> attribute, the plugin assumes you want to use the denominator of the fraction as the number of<br />\nstars, so 4/5 would display 5 stars, and 3/10 would display ten stars.</p>\n<p><strong>max_stars</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>max_stars</code> attribute sets the maximum number of stars the rating will be displayed with. You can set it implicitly by using <code>rating</code><br />\nwith a fraction, or explicitly with the <code>max_stars</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>For exaple, the following tag will display as seven stars even though the fraction used is out of 5:<br />\n    [xrr rating=4/5 max_stars=7]</p>\n<p><strong>display_as</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>display_as</code> attribute determines for the rating will be displayed. The four basic outputs are &#8216;stars&#8217;, &#8216;percentage&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;fraction&#8217;, and &#8216;textstars&#8217;, and they are pretty self explanatory. The basic outputs can also be combined with an underscore<br />\nto display two or more at once, for example this tag will display the fraction and then the image stars:<br />\n    [xrr rating= 4.5/5 display_as=fraction_stars]</p>\n<p><strong>label</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>label</code> attribute sets the label in front of the rating display. Make sure to surround the value with quotes if it contains a space.</p>\n<p><strong>group</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>group</code> attribute sets what named group the rating is in. By default all ratings are in an xrr group. The only use for the group<br />\ncurrently is for <code>overall</code> calculations. Note: This is entirely independent of the <code>[xrrgroup]</code> tag.</p>\n<p><strong>overall</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>overall</code> attribute has one valid value, &#8216;true&#8217;. If set it will ignore any <code>rating</code> attribute in the tag and instead calculate<br />\nthe average of all the ratings on the post/page that have the same <code>group</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>imageset</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>imageset</code> attribute determines what set of star images to use. The imagesets are auto-detected, either in the plugin directory<br />\nfor the imagesets that come with the plugin, or in the wp-content/uploads/xavins-review-ratings/ directory for imagesets you add.<br />\nAll usable imagesets are detected and displayed on the settings page.</p>\n<p><strong>fraction_separator</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>fraction_separator</code> attribute determines the separator between the numerator and denominator when displaying ratings as a<br />\nfraction. By default it is &#8216;/&#8217;, although another common option would be &#8216; of &#8216;.</p>\n<p><strong>max_fraction</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>max_fraction</code> attribute sets how far stars can be broken up, there are three valid values, none=1 half=2 quarter=4. If you set it<br />\nto 1, all ratings will be calculated out of whole stars, and if you set it to 4 they will be calculated to quarter stars, etc.</p>\n<h3>The [xrrgroup] Tag</h3>\n<p>The <code>[xrrgroup][/xrrgroup]</code> tag is used to activate group rendering in the <code>[xrr]</code> tags it surrounds. Any attributes<br />\nset in the <code>[xrrgroup]</code> will be used in the contained tags unless they have attributes of their own.<br />\nBy default it renders all the contained <code>[xrr]</code> tags in a table, but this can be changed by modifying the templates on<br />\nthe settings screen. Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>[xrrgroup][xrr rating=4/5 label=\"DVD:\"][xrr rating=3/5 label=\"Movie:\"][/xrrgroup]\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are some things to keep in mind. Don&#8217;t put line breaks inside the <code>[xrrgroup]</code> tags, since WordPress doesn&#8217;t properly recognize<br />\nbeing inside a shortcode tag, and will insert <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags that will make your HTML invalid. Also, the <code>[xrrgroup]</code> tag is entirely independent<br />\nof the <code>group</code> attribute in the <code>[xrr]</code> tag.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>xavins-review-ratings</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Place <code>[xrr rating=4/5]</code> in your pages. Check the<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.jonathanspence.com/software/wordpress-plugins/xavins-review-ratings/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin homepage</a><br />\nfor complete documentation and inline examples.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I add custom image sets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Upload a directory containing the five star images in png, jpg, or gif format into your wp-content/uploads/xavins-review-ratings<br />\ndirectory. If you put the correct files in the right place, the plugin will detect it and show them on the settings screen. You<br />\ncan look in the plugin directory to find the correct file names. The imageset directory name can be whatever you want, as long as<br />\nit doesn&#8217;t conflict with another imageset. You also only need the star images you plan on using, if you are only going to be<br />\nshowing whole or blank stars, you only need those two images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Sometimes the shortcodes don&#8217;t get processed, what&#8217;s going on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In WordPress 2.8-3.0 there is a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10082\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bug</a> where shortcodes sometimes don&#8217;t get processed<br />\nif they are directly next to each other. Until this gets fixed the solution is to make sure there is a space between shortcodes if<br />\nyou get rendering problems. It only happened to me a few times out of my many examples, so you shouldn&#8217;t worry about unless you<br />\nhave an issue.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
