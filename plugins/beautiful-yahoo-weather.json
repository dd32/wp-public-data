It is removing the p= part and replacing it with w= to use the more powerful new WOEID codes.<br />\nSo if you find that your weather stops working, try to change that. Some skins use p= and some use w=, so far p= is still the main and supports more locations but it will soon change.</p>\n<p>To get the weather-code if you use w=, do this:<br />\n1-2. Same as above.<br />\n3. Look at the URL.
