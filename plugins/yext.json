After that, any changes you make to the content, either in WordPress or in the Yext Platform, will be automatically synced to your site. If you use the plugin to embed social posts, new posts will be synced to your site as you create them through Yext.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20can%20i%20edit%20embedded%20content%3F'>\nHow often can I edit embedded content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can change your embedded content as often as you like.
