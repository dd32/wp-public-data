Get the full power of WordPress publishing and plugins, with the familiar and established community format of phpBB.</p>\n<p>WP-United is fully modular and individual features can be turned on and off. These features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User integration</strong>: including single sign-on, synchronised profiles and avatars, and user management. Works with external registration modules such as social login plugins. Users in phpBB get accounts in WordPress and vice versa. Completely controllable and customisable by setting permissions for who can integrate and at what level, using a unique drag-and-drop interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Template integration</strong>: Have your phpBB forum appear inside your WordPress site. Or vice-versa; integrate your WordPress blog inside your phpBB header and footer. Includes a &#8220;one-click&#8221; mode that analyses your theme&#8217;s CSS and modifies it on the fly to avoid CSS and HTML conflicts. This is no iFrame solution, it is a complete and automatic template integration.</li>\n<li><strong>Behaviour integration</strong>: Use phpBB smilies and word censor features in WordPress </li>\n<li><strong>Cross-posting</strong>: Post something in WordPress and have it cross-posted to your forum &#8212; Automatically or manually, you choose! Once an item is cross-posted, comments in phpBB and WordPress can be set to sync up under the blog item too!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP-United also includes TEN widgets for you to drop into your WordPress page. Each widget is configurable and displays a wealth of forum information to increase engagement on your site. All of these widgets work even with the above modules turned off. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Latest forum posts</li>\n<li>Latest forum topics</li>\n<li>users online list</li>\n<li>Forum statistics</li>\n<li>An integrated login/meta/avatar/profile block</li>\n<li>Birthday list</li>\n<li>Quick poll (select from active phpBB polls in an ajax widget)</li>\n<li>Useful forum links list</li>\n<li>Forum top bar (with breadcrumbs that work in WordPress)</li>\n<li>Forum bottom bar (to match the top bar!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.wp-united.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp-united.com</a> for more information and to view example integrations in the gallery.</p>\n<p>The download iincludes the following languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>Français</li>\n<li>Deutsch</li>\n<li>中文（简体）</li>\n<li>русский</li>\n<li>Srpski (Latinica)</li>\n<li>Português Brasileiro</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Does this work with WordPress multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It works but is not recommended for use, especially with single sign-on currently, as it does not behave as expected. In future versions WP-United will allow per-user blogs with WordPress multisite, so stay tuned.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I enabled the plugin but nothing is happening!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Follow the instructions to connect to your phpBB forum in the WP-United section of the admin panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t connect, I am getting errors.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ensure you have installed the phpBB modification package. You can download it from (WP-United.com)[http://www.wp-united.com/releases/wp-united-latest-phpbb] .

It is just doing what you ask. To link together existing accounts, please disable &#8220;automatically create users in WordPress&#8221; option, and visit the WP-United User Mapper. There, you can clean up an unneeded accounts and link together the ones you want. When done, you can re-enable automatic user creation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>User creation is turned on, but users keep getting logged out</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check your phpBB cookie settings.
