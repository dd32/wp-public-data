Click that.<br />\n3) You will find two textboxes. Pase the first section of code from the Get HTML code page into the Header Code textbox. Paste the second section code into the second textbox.<br />\n4) If you want to customize the location of the icon, that can be done as well. Just edit the div tag code pasted in the second textbox.</p>\n",
