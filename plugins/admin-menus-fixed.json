It works all by itself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This is cool. How can I support your effort?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to help a real starving artist, please <a href=\"https://bengalmania.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help us buy food and medical care for our Bengal and Maine Coon rescues.</a>= When Ozh&#8217; Admin Drop Down Menu headers wrap to one or more lines, why do they cover Admin Page content at the very top? =</p>\n<p>One size does not fit all and it&#8217;s a difficult, if not impossible, task to find a sweet spot that incnveiences the least number of users.</p>\n<p>The content partially covered is the top of the page title (Dashboard, Posts, Media, Links, Pages&#8230; etc.) This isn&#8217;t a serious thing, as Ozh&#8217; menu itself indicates the page you are on; thereby rendering the page title redundant.<br />\nThe &#8220;Add New&#8221; Button is redundant, as the functionality is also available in each of the Drop Downs that need that functionality.<br />\nThe &#8220;Screen Options&#8221; and &#8220;Help&#8221; tabs are another matter. They provide access to functionality unobtainable by other means.</p>\n<p>I set break points to accommodate 5 extra menu header items in addition to the 11 WordPress standard entries. I figure that there will be at least 3 plugin headers added to an average WordPress install menu. When the plugin count exceeds 5, the menu will wrap earlier.</p>\n<p>The standard WordPress menu headers are between 4 and 10 characters long. I have seen one plugin suite that adds 10 separate menu headers that are between 11 and 17 characters long&#8230; each. That gobbles up a lot of horizontal space right quick, adding up to being <em>longer</em> than the WordPress default set. Effectively doubling the horizontal space required makes things near impossible to predict. At a browser window width where the WordPress default set would not wrap, the menu is already wrapping once and is near to wrapping a second time, but the vertical spacing hasn&#8217;t changed to accommodate. The problem gets far worse at mobile screen widths; where this condition would cause Ozh&#8217; menu to wrap 10 times!</p>\n<p>In order to have Ozh&#8217; menu wrap as needed and accurately adjust the vertical spacing of the Admin Page content for every situation out there, I&#8217;d have to sniff the sheer number of plugins installed, determine which ones add menu entries AND determine how long each of those entries are. I could increase the default break point widths to accommodate an even larger default number but, then, I&#8217;d get users wondering why there is so much blank area above the page content when the menu wraps way earlier than necessary on their install. The idea is to save space, not squander it.</p>\n<p><strong>Workarounds</strong> (Not elegant but, if it is only a sometime thing, )</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Setting Ozh&#8217; Admin Drop Down Menu to Icons Only can solve the issue, as they are small and all the same width.</li>\n<li>Drag the browser window narrower temporarily until the vertical adjustment kicks in, exposing the hidden button/tabs.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
