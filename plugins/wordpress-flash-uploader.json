        "description": "<p>&#8216;WordPress Flash Uploader&#8217; is a flash uploader that replaces the existing flash uploader and let you manage your whole WordPress installation. You can also include the flash to your site and enable your users to upload/manage files based on user names, groups or roles.<br />\nThe WordPress Flash Uploader does contain 2 plugins: &#8216;WordPress Flash Uploader&#8217; and &#8216;Sync Media Library&#8217;.<br />\n&#8216;Sync Media Library&#8217; is a plugin which allows you to synchronize the WordPress database with your<br />\nupload folder. You can upload by WFU, FTP or whatever and import this files to the Media Library.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support of all features of TFU: http://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/tfu/web_overview.php </li>\n<li>Add the flash uploader to the site! You can define different profiles for users, groups and roles! So you can define exactly who can do/upload what and where on the server! See the frontend settings for details. </li>\n<li>Manage your WordPress installation with WFU.</li>\n<li>Synchronize the upload folder with the media library. </li>\n<li>Synchronize the media library automatically using the wordpress cron </li>\n<li>Define the extensions that should be synchronized.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Motivation:</h4>\n<p>WordPress has a flash uploader which was not working on any of my servers. So I decided to write a<br />\nwrapper for the TWG Flash Uploader which works on most servers so far.<br />\nWordPress 2.5+ includes a new Media manager, However, it only knows about files which have been uploaded<br />\nvia the WordPress interface, not files which have been uploaded via other means (eg, FTP or WFU).<br />\nSo I had to implement something that does the synchronisation.<br />\nThe final result are actually two plugins in one.  The &#8216;WordPress Flash Uploader &#8211; WFU&#8217; and the<br />\n&#8216;Sync Media Library&#8217;. WFU is the wrapper for the TWG Flash Uploader and with &#8216;Sync Media Library&#8217;<br />\nyou can syncronize the upload folder with the WordPress database. I implemented this as seperate<br />\nmenu items because maybe you want to upload your files with FTP and you can syncronize your<br />\nfiles without using WFU.</p>\n<p>Have fun using WFU,<br />\nMichael</p>\n<h3>Website / Help / Forum</h3>\n<p>Website:    http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/wfu/<br />\nForum:      http://www.tinywebgallery.com/en/forum.php</p>\n<h3>Donation</h3>\n<p>Please go to the settings page of WordPress Flash Uploader.

        "installation": "<p>Please make a backup of your images when you use the synch the first time!<br />\nOn some systems WordPress does remove the images once.<br />\nIf you have this problem please contact me to fix this because it is not reproduceable on my systems.</p>\n<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from plugins page.<br />\nYou get &#8216;WP Flash Uploader&#8217; and &#8216;Sync Media Library&#8217; in the &#8216;Media&#8217; menu and &#8216;WP Flash Uploader&#8217; in the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu.</p>\n<p>Go to Settings-&gt;WP Flash Uploader and check the &#8216;Limitations&#8217; part. Most of the users can upload and are<br />\nonly restricted by their servers. And most if the problems can be solved!</p>\n<p>If you want to use the automatic sync please add<br />\ndefine(&#8216;ALTERNATE_WP_CRON&#8217;, true);<br />\nin the wp-config.php<br />\nto enable the cron job!<br />\nPlease note that this is not a real cron job. So if you set 5 minutes then it is syncronized at the next request that happens after 5 minutes waiting!</p>\n<p>Please make a backup of your images when you use the synch the first time!<br />\nOn some systems WordPress does remove the images once.<br />\nIf you have this problem please contact me to fix this because it is not reproduceable on my systems.</p>\n",
