You can have multiple locations on the same page with the same name, like <code>after_post</code>.<br />\nHere the index field becomes handy, because it allows you to set the ad to be displayed after the Nth location.<br />\nTo add index support to your location simply append the <code>:index</code> keyword to the first argument you pass to <code>registerAdLocation()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>if(class_exists('AdManager'))\n  AdManager()-&gt;registerAdLocation('after_post:index', __('After post'));\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Where does this plugin store my ads?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The options table. I didn&#8217;t think it was worth it to create a custom table, since most sites won&#8217;t have more than 10-20 ads on them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I manually display an ad?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the <code>[ad n]</code> shortcode, where <code>n</code> is the ID of the ad</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t create / edit / manage any ads from my dashboard!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is most likely because a naughty plugin throws javascript errors, and since Ad Manager interface is currently entirely ajax-based,<br />\nany subsequent javascript will break.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
