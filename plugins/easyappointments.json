Take advantage of the scheduling power of Easy!Appointment which will run smoothly with your WordPress installation. Include the booking form in your pages with the [easyappointments] shortcode.</p>\n<p><em>Minimum Requirements: WordPress v5.0 &amp; PHP v5.6</em></p>\n<h4>Connecting Easy!Appointments with WordPress</h4>\n<p>Install and activate the plugin and navigate to <code>Easy!Appointments</code> menu of the WordPress admin section. Connect to an existing Easy!Appointments installation by providing the preferred URL in the page form. Once a connection is established you&#8217;ll be able to include the booking form in your pages.</p>\n<h4>Include Booking in your Pages</h4>\n<p>WordPress supports the use of custom shortcodes which allows plugins to insert custom content into pages. This plugin takes advantage of this functionality and creates an iframe that displays the booking form of Easy!Appointments. Include the <code>[easyappointments]</code> shortcode in the correct place of your published contents as shown in the following example.</p>\n<pre><code>[easyappointments width=\"100%\" height=\"500px\" style=\"border: 5px solid #1A865F; box-shadow: #454545 1px 1px 5px;\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The &#8220;width&#8221;, &#8220;height&#8221; and &#8220;style&#8221; attributes are optional but can help you to fine tune the styling of the iframe.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use the &#8220;provider&#8221; and &#8220;service&#8221; shortcode attributes to preselect a provider or a service or both on a certain page (e.g. <code>[easyappointments provider=\"2\" service=\"1\"]</code>, where &#8220;2&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221; are the record IDs, they can be fetched from the Easy!Appointments backend section, in the users and services page accordingly by clicking the dedicated link of a record).</p>\n<p><em>Find out more about Easy!Appointments at https://easyappointments.org/wordpress</em></p>\n",
