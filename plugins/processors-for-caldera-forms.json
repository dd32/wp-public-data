In other words, it is like a username and password used when saving details of new leads into your Zoho CRM installation. Authetincation token allows Zoho CRM to check that the submission that your website makes is legit. It also allows to identify what Zoho CRM account to save the lead information to.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>(Zoho CRM) How do I find what my authentication token is?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please see instructions at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/api/using-authentication-token.html</p>\n</p>\n<h4>(Zoho CRM) I want different Caldera Forms to submit to different Zoho CRM installations. In this possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, definitely. For each Caldera Form, enter authentication tokens of the Zoho CRM installations that you need those form to send leads to.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>(Zoho CRM) I want one Caldera Form to submit to two or more different Zoho CRM installations. In this possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, definitely. Add multiple Zoho CRM processors to the same form and configure them using different authentication aokens.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
