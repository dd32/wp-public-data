Please contact us directly if you have a dataset you would like to import to DiDi.</p>\n<h3>Visualising</h3>\n<p>If you become a certified user, you will be able to share the total number of violations added by your organisation through the map-and-graph-tool at the DiDi web page. The data can then be filtered according to the wishes of the visitor. The data is always anonymised.</p>\n<h3>Plugin</h3>\n<p>The DiDi WordPress plugin allows users to visualise aggregated datasets depending on need and preference. Through the WordPress plugin you can show data from DiDi on your WordPress based website to advocate for human rights in your country or region.</p>\n<p>The visualisation offers many possibilities for customisation.
