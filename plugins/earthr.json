By installing our free plugin on your e-commerce site, your business can give your customers the ability to easily contribute to climate initiatives by rounding up their purchases to the nearest dollar. This simple yet effective method helps reduce emissions and supports eco-friendly initiatives while improving your brand&#8217;s image and customer loyalty. Our plugin is free and easy to install, making it the ideal choice for retail companies who want to give back to the planet. Join the movement towards sustainability today and install our plugin to start making a difference.</p>\n<h4>How our Plugin Works:</h4>\n<p>To get started with the Earthr plugin, simply download it and give your customers the option to round-up their purchases to the nearest dollar. You&#8217;ll receive a welcome packet from the Earthr team that includes potential projects for your brand, along with terms and conditions and contacts for any questions or concerns you may have. From there, you can choose the projects that align with your brand&#8217;s ideology and the round-up funds will be contributed accordingly. The plugin seamlessly takes care of the rest, so you can sit back and watch your contributions grow. You&#8217;ll receive regular updates on how much your brand is contributing to your chosen projects, which you can then share with your customers to increase sales and brand loyalty.</p>\n<h4>Collections Structure:</h4>\n<p>Our collections structure is designed to maximize the funds that are contributed to your climate initiatives. Here&#8217;s how it works: You agree to collect all Earthr round-up funds and are invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis for these funds for transactions completed in that period. By doing it this way, we avoid transaction fees from payment processing, which means more funds go directly toward your climate initiatives. We hope this fee structure helps you achieve your sustainability goals!</p>\n<p>Click this link here for more information regarding our plugin and our company: <a href=\"https://www.earthr.io/wordpress-details\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.earthr.io/wordpress-details</a></p>\n<p>Please reach out with any questions or concerns to <a href=\"mailto:&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;&#114;&#x74;&#064;&#x65;&#097;&#x72;&#116;&#x68;r&#x2e;i&#111;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support@earthr.io</a></p>\n",
