The Add to Cart interaction is one of the key moments prior to the decision of a customer finishing their checkout. Understanding that, we are trying to deliver the smallest payload possible when it comes to html and assets.<br />\nKeeping our html lightweight already, if objects are not displayed (e.g. title or price) then the html is never generated, rather than relying on css.</p>\n<h4>Smart</h4>\n<p>Keeping with the theme of lightweight and optimized, assets, which are separated by their uses, will only be loaded when they are used!<br />\nNot only that, but the button will become disabled (by default) if the associated product is now out of stock (toggled in the settings).</p>\n<h4>Flexible</h4>\n<p>Through the block interface, you can change entirely the order of all parts of the product info &amp; button. Toggling fields on and off, you can make the area fit the way you dream it!<br />\nMany plugins we have used in the past feel overbearing when it comes to styling, sometimes making it hard to apply styles to help the plugin fit your theme.<br />\nWe left the themeing to you, using some base classes on elements like the buttons and quantity fields that we found let most themes do base styling to the elements.</p>\n<h4>Block Documentation</h4>\n<p><strong>New &#8220;AJAX Add to Cart Block&#8221;!</strong> and <strong>New &#8220;Group AJAX Add to Cart Block&#8221;!</strong><br />\nNew and improved interface to create flexible components on any page of your website that has the block editor enabled!<br />\nEasily toggle displays and drag-and-drop to move around objects to change the appearance of the add to cart component on the front end.</p>\n<p>The major difference between the blocks is the Group AJAX add to cart block allows the selection of multiple products. The selected display settings and styling will be applied to all products the same in that block.</p>\n<p>Not only does the block have all the features the shortcode does, but expands further upon that allowing you to change the display order of each individual component using a visual editor!<br />\nThe block also has a product select tool so you no longer have to remember individual product or variation IDs</p>\n<p>Block fields available:<br />\n&#8211; Title<br />\n&#8211; Separator<br />\n&#8211; Price<br />\n&#8211; Quantity<br />\n&#8211; Button<br />\n&#8211; Image (premium setting)<br />\n&#8211; Custom text field (premium setting)<br />\n&#8211; Short Description (premium setting)</p>\n<h4>Shortcode Documentation</h4>\n<p><strong>New Shorter Shortcode: [a2c_button /] and [ajax_add_to_cart /] are now options for the original [enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button /]</strong><br />\nThe required field for every button is the product, with six optional fields:<br />\n&#8211; variation (used for variable products)<br />\n&#8211; title (to reflect the label before the button)<br />\n&#8211; quantity (sets the default quantity <strong>AND hides the quantity checkbox</strong>)<br />\n&#8211; show_quantity (<strong>if quantity is specified</strong>, re-enables the checkbox)<br />\n&#8211; show_price<br />\n&#8211; button_text<br />\n&#8211; class<br />\n&#8211; order (overrides show_quantity, show_price)</p>\n<p>Original single button shortcode:</p>\n<pre><code>[a2c_button\n   product={pid}\n   variation={vid}\n   class={STRING}\n   order={\"title,quantity,separator,price,description\"} // any order you want, also accepts first letters as arguments \"q,s,t,p,d\" for example.\n   show_price={beginning|b|after|a|rear|r}\n   button_text={STRING}\n   title={none|attributes|att|attribute}\n   quantity={INTEGER}\n   show_quantity={yes}\n/]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Documentation notes:<br />\n&#8211; The curly brackets &#8220;&#123; &#125;&#8221; denote a list of options separated by a pipe &#8221; | &#8221;<br />\n&#8211; With the exception of &#8220;pid&#8221; and &#8220;vid&#8221; options, the lower case &#8220;options&#8221; within the curly braces are to represent different settings available for the front end display order.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20put%20multiple%20words%20on%20the%20button%3F'>\nCan I put multiple words on the button?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!<br />\nShortcode: By using the button_text parameter using double quotes around your phrase. button_text=&#8221;quickly add this product!&#8221;<br />\nBlock: Just put your phrase in the input box!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20separator%20between%20the%20price%20and%20the%20button%20or%20text%3F'>\nHow can I change the separator between the price and the button or text?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a CSS selector available for changing the separator for the plugin as a whole. You can put this in your themes styles.css or &#8220;Additional CSS&#8221; section of theme customizer<br />\nThe default is shown below. To change the character, change the content value from &#8221; &#8211; &#8221; to whatever you see fit. Leave blank quotes for removing it all together (e.g. content: &#8220;&#8221;;)<br />\nThis is the same for blocks and shortcodes.</p>\n<pre><code>.ea-separator::before {\n    content: \" - \";\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='no%20loading%20spinner%20comes%20up%21'>\nNo loading spinner comes up!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, we rely on themes to display a loading icon on the loading class. WooCommerce also provides one.<br />\nOur premium version now loads 2 spinners you can choose from using additional css classes and a setting.<br />\nThe free version will be getting access to those spinners in version 2.3 or later.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20styling%20of%20the%20quantity%20input%3F'>\nCan I change the styling of the quantity input?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! Currently, there are no standard options for styling.<br />\nWe realize that many websites want their own styling or have already hired a designer. We let our elements be as broad and blank as possible while picking up theme standards.<br />\nWe have plans to expand into more blocks that will have styling applied, but these blocks will remain with very few styles bundled.</p>\n<p>If your theme styles are not being applied to the quantity input, you can use the following css selector to edit all of the quantity inputs:</p>\n<pre><code>.add-to-cart-pro .qty {\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20for%20variable%20products%3F'>\nDoes this work for variable products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!<br />\nShortcode: To use variable products, you must specify both the product id and the variation id in the shortcode parameters.<br />\nBlock: Select the product(s) you want to use in the product selector!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='some%20attributes%20for%20variable%20products%20are%20not%20appearing'>\nSome attributes for variable products are not appearing\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can be a compatibility issue with how the store is set up. This plugin uses the variation ID to add the products to the cart. If the variable product with <strong>back end</strong> selected attributes is not a defined variation, then the product will not be able to be used correctly.</p>\n<p>In short: all variable products to be used by this must be defined variations and have a unique id.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20different%20variations%20uniquely%20identified%3F'>\nHow are different variations uniquely identified?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The title attributes are how you can define what is displayed on the frontend. Options are the standard product title (no product attributes), product title + product attributes, or just the product attributes.<br />\nAlternatively, in the premium version, there is a blank text input that can be used in the block editor. This can be used for any text and can be a unique identifier.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20there%20be%20multiple%20ajax%20buttons%20on%20the%20same%20page%3F'>\nCan there be multiple ajax buttons on the same page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can safely use multiple buttons on the same page with confirmed results.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20replace%20the%20add%20to%20cart%20button%20on%20product%20pages%20or%20archives%3F'>\nDoes this replace the add to cart button on product pages or archives?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this point, no. This is designed to supplement your store to let the buttons be anywhere.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated to indicate compatibility with WooCommerce High Performance Order Storage!</li>\n<li>Major upgrade to Block to catch up with updates in core WordPress</li>\n<li>Minor bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: New custom &#8220;View cart&#8221; text setting for the secondary button/link spawned after adding to cart.</li>\n<li>Added: New custom URL for the &#8220;View cart&#8221; (or custom text) button/link.</li>\n<li>Added: New setting to disable an internal &#8220;Refresh Fragments&#8221; for minicart implementations that may be unnecessary overhead for some implementations.</li>\n<li>Fixed: The &#8220;View cart&#8221; button/link would appear even if an item was not added to the cart due to an error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: New &#8220;order&#8221; prop on shortcode to determine display order and visibility of elements in a &#8220;button row&#8221;</li>\n<li>Added: New &#8220;class&#8221; prop on shortcode to add custom css classes to the &#8220;button row&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweaked: Admin facing block generation was using old parent element class name</li>\n<li>Fixed: Removed debug statement leftover in asset</li>\n<li>Fixed: Asset enqueuing had a warning from filemtime</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: When title not displayed, would show lowest available price for variable products, even when variation specified.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Extra checks during Attribute Title generation had namespacing failure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Added extra checks during Attribute Title generation.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Moved Attribute Title generation to its own function to call only when necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Shortcode button text was defaulting to a blank string after the 2.1.0 update. This makes it default to the WooCommerce &#8216;Add to cart&#8217; translation.</li>\n<li>Fixed: The attribute title option was displaying attribute slugs rather than values. This is now fixed with a comma separated string, reflective of WooCommerce style of displaying attribute titles.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Using the block path of code, attribute titles were not being appended correctly on the front end, only in the block editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Product type is now an added class to each Add to Cart Row.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Re-introduced product type to button as a class, which was a selective regression, but was reported to still has use.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Now checking if product is purchasable as well as in stock by default to match WooCommerce (and display consistent behavior).<br />\n        Check the &#8220;stock check&#8221; setting to disable.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Automatic translation of &#8216;Add to cart&#8217; was lost from shortcode upgrade. Using woocommerce as string translator. Notice this is<br />\n        still different behavior as blocks have difficulty with no default set, and there is no default product to query button text<br />\n        at this point. Block editor vs front end behavior might show inconsistencies because of this. A work around is to either use<br />\n        the &#8220;Default button text&#8221; in the settings, or overwrite the button text on each block.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added AJAX Add to Cart block.</li>\n<li>Added additional display order controls, only available in the block.</li>\n<li>Added &#8220;base&#8221; title option for variable products.</li>\n<li>Added extra class parameter &#8220;class&#8221; to add to the wrapper element for all button blocks/shortcodes.</li>\n<li>Added min/max fields for quantity to have basic controls.</li>\n<li>Added &#8220;custom&#8221;, &#8220;image&#8221;, and &#8220;short description&#8221; fields to be displayable.</li>\n<li>Added php filter &#8216;eaa2c_button_row_additional_fields&#8217; to display additional content on a shortcode or block (filter is passed a blank string and the product id).</li>\n<li>Added php filter &#8216;eaa2c_button_row_custom_field&#8217; to allow for the custom field to be flexible with the product (filter is passed default html and the product id).</li>\n<li>Added php filter &#8216;eaa2c_button_row_wrap_override&#8217; to disable the new Group EAA2C display wrapping element.</li>\n<li>Added Namespacing to the project.</li>\n<li>Standardized printing of shortcodes and blocks, along with product types.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug when attribute title was selected but undefined, now printing parent product name rather than nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added button blocking using the disabled html parameter. This prevents requests being skipped when many buttons pressed within short time.</li>\n<li>Tweaked how assets are enqueued to only enqueue on pages when the shortcode is on it. This prevents overriding the AJAX setting in WooCommerce settings page.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where variation was showing with parent product default cost. Now shows correct variation price.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added feature where when product is out of stock the add to cart button displays as &#8220;out of stock&#8221; instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug when using shortcodes in blocks &#8211; blocks try to run shortcode earlier than classic editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug when quantity input was hidden the add to cart button was no longer working.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how javascript selector worked for grabbing quantity from input.

The selected display settings and styling will be applied to all products the same in that block.</p>\n<p>Not only does the block have all the features the shortcode does, but expands further upon that allowing you to change the display order of each individual component using a visual editor!<br />\nThe block also has a product select tool so you no longer have to remember individual product or variation IDs</p>\n<p>Block fields available:<br />\n&#8211; Title<br />\n&#8211; Separator<br />\n&#8211; Price<br />\n&#8211; Quantity<br />\n&#8211; Button<br />\n&#8211; Image (premium setting)<br />\n&#8211; Custom text field (premium setting)<br />\n&#8211; Short Description (premium setting)</p>\n<h4>Shortcode Documentation</h4>\n<p><strong>New Shorter Shortcode: [a2c_button /] and [ajax_add_to_cart /] are now options for the original [enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button /]</strong><br />\nThe required field for every button is the product, with six optional fields:<br />\n&#8211; variation (used for variable products)<br />\n&#8211; title (to reflect the label before the button)<br />\n&#8211; quantity (sets the default quantity <strong>AND hides the quantity checkbox</strong>)<br />\n&#8211; show_quantity (<strong>if quantity is specified</strong>, re-enables the checkbox)<br />\n&#8211; show_price<br />\n&#8211; button_text<br />\n&#8211; class<br />\n&#8211; order (overrides show_quantity, show_price)</p>\n<p>Original single button shortcode:</p>\n<pre><code>[a2c_button\n   product={pid}\n   variation={vid}\n   class={STRING}\n   order={\"title,quantity,separator,price,description\"} // any order you want, also accepts first letters as arguments \"q,s,t,p,d\" for example.\n   show_price={beginning|b|after|a|rear|r}\n   button_text={STRING}\n   title={none|attributes|att|attribute}\n   quantity={INTEGER}\n   show_quantity={yes}\n/]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Documentation notes:<br />\n&#8211; The curly brackets &#8220;&#123; &#125;&#8221; denote a list of options separated by a pipe &#8221; | &#8221;<br />\n&#8211; With the exception of &#8220;pid&#8221; and &#8220;vid&#8221; options, the lower case &#8220;options&#8221; within the curly braces are to represent different settings available for the front end display order.
