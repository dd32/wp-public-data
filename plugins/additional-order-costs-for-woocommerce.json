This starts with 5 additional cost fields that can be changed in the settings page with the plugin. 5 fields too much? Set it to 2! Not enough, set it to 9!<br />\nIn the future we will be looking at making these a repeatable field rather than a set number, but we wanted to get users thinking of other expansions as well!</p>\n<p>Once you start tracking the additional order costs you associate, you’ll want to use our <a href=\"https://www.theritesites.com/plugins/woocommerce-net-profit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Net Profit</a> plugin that will give you beautiful, functional reports to fully analyze your profitability.<br />\nThis also pairs well with our other cost tracking plugin, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-cost-of-shipping/\" rel=\"ugc\">WooCommerce Cost of Shipping</a>.<br />\nWhile using the <a href=\"https://www.theritesites.com/plugins/woocommerce-net-profit/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Net Profit</a> plugin, you will individually be able to track Additional Costs, Cost of Shipping, and Cost of Goods. The Net Profit plugin has recently been expanded to allow for custom costs to be associated from any other third party plugin as well, though coding is necessary.</p>\n<p>This plugin also serves as the first ever example of how to integrate with WooCommerce Net Profit in a dynamic fashion.<br />\nWooCommerce Net Profit as of version 1.5 now has an active filter</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'trs_wc_np_order_cost_extension', 'callback_function', 10, 1 )\n</code></pre>\n<p>How the filter is implemented can be found in additional-oprder-costs-for-woocommerce/includes/class-aoc-wc.php<br />\nThe filter allows for a PHP array of objects to be modified.

This function is called when doing data/reporting queries. The function is only applied to the individual meta keys value.<br />\nFor example: this plugin stores multiple order cost lines with associated labels.
