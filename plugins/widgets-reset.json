This plugin allows you to quickly and easily reset your widgets.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will my widget information be saved?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  No.  No.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t stress enough that this completely resets everything.  So, if you have some important information saved in something like a text widget, you better save it before resetting your widgets.</p>\n<p>In short, don&#8217;t complain if you reset your widgets and lose information that you have been told to save.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
