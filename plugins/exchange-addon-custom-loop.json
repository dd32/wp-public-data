        "description": "<p>This add-on for <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/exchange/\" title=\"iThemes Exchange\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">iThemes Exchange</a> adds the ability to create multiple loops for the products (store) page, including grid/list view selection, pagination, data selections and order by functionality. It allows you to create product category pages, pages per product type etc.</p>\n<p>To create a new store page, in the wp-dashboard go to pages, &#8220;add new&#8221; (or edit an existing page) and tick the box to enable the custom loop. Do not use the Exchange store shortcode on that page.</p>\n<h4>Add Grid / List View</h4>\n<p>Set a default view, either List view, or Grid view. Define how many columns you want in a grid, and how much padding between the items. Define at which viewport width a Grid view should transform in List view.</p>\n<h4>Add Pagination</h4>\n<p>Set the number of products per page, and the Previous / Next Page text.</p>\n<h4>Data Selections</h4>\n<p>Select one, more, or all Categories, or Product Types.</p>\n<h4>Sort Order</h4>\n<p>Set a default Sort order for the products. Order by date, price, name, or use the Exchange default.</p>\n<h4>Frontend Options</h4>\n<p>Enable or disable a grid/list button for the store, so the user can dynamically change the view. Enable or disable a &#8220;order by&#8221; dropdown, so the user can change the order in which products are displayed.</p>\n<h4>New fields to add content before or after the loop</h4>\n<p>This allows you to use a wysiwyg editor to add content before or after the custom loop. Add (for instance) introduction text for your categories or downloads, a slideshow, a video, anything you can thinks of. And at the bottom of your loop, add a newsletter subscription form, social / share and whatever else you wish to add.</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.11</h4>\n<p>Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where editing the Exchange templates would result in an infinite loop<br />\nMinor bug fix</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.10</h4>\n<p>Compatibility Fix: Updated constructor to prevent warnings in PHP 7</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.9</h4>\n<p>Minor bug fix</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.8</h4>\n<p>Fixed version</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.7</h4>\n<p>Minor bug fixes</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.6</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue that caused a (harmless) notification when wp_debug is enabled<br />\nMore localisation enhancements, and I added Serbian translation, kindly provided by Ogi Djuraskovic from <a href=\"http://firstsiteguide.com/\" title=\"firstsiteguide.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">firstsiteguide.com</a></p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.5</h4>\n<p>Is a minor update that enhances translation abilities</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.4</h4>\n<p>Added wysiwyg fields to add content before and after the loop, as well as preserve existing page content and show the loop before or after existing content.</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue where the Default Grid/List View setting wasn&#8217;t being applied when frontend view wasn&#8217;t enabled</p>\n<h4>New in 1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now choose the text (if any) to display in front of the sort order dropdown</li>\n<li>Added grid/list option &#8220;none&#8221; to not affect an existing loop at all, so no need to choose either grid or list. It will default to the Exchange default. Note that this will disable the grid/list selections.</li>\n<li>None relevant options are &#8220;greyed out&#8221; based on selections made.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Translations</h3>\n<p>Translators, you are invited to translate the plugin, send the translated files over, and I will add your translation to the plugin, with an attribution.</p>\n<p>It is common issue with plugin translations that (custom) translations will be overwritten on plugin update. To prevent this, if you have a custom translation, or customised an existing translation, copy the relevant translation (.mo) file to wp-content/languages/plugins/exchange-addon-custom-loop/ The translation file should be named &#8220;rvw-exchange-addon-custom-loop-{locale}&#8221; where {locale} is your language locale, e.g. de_DE or nl_NL.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder &#8216;exchange-addon-custom-loop&#8217; to the &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory</li>\n<li>Activate &#8216;iThemes Exchange &#8211; Custom Loop Add-on&#8217; through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Open the &#8216;Addons&#8217; screen through the &#8216;Exchange&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Custom Loop is not enabled, click Enable beside the &#8216;Custom Loop&#8217; entry in the Addons listing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once enabled, the standard WordPress &#8220;Add Page&#8221; (or when editing an existing page) will have an extra option to enable the custom loop. Upon ticking that option, all custom loop options will become visible and editable.
