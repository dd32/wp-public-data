In order for this plugin to successfully enqueue the child theme AND parent theme&#8217;s style.css, the parent theme has to actually enqueue its own stylesheet (not a given by a long shot), it has to be done using <code>get_template_directory_uri()</code>, not <code>get_stylesheet_directory_uri()</code> (also not a given), and, in order for the child stylesheet to be enqueued <em>after</em> the parent&#8217;s (kind of important for a child theme), there has to be some kind of reliable naming convention for the enqueue ID in the parent theme (no such standard exists). On the other hand, <code>@import</code> just works. It&#8217;s the only available method that gets the child theme working in virtually all cases out of the box.</p>\n<p>And if you really can&#8217;t bear the thought of using <code>@import</code>, just edit the files after creating the theme so that it no longer uses it. It&#8217;s <em>your</em> theme, you can do as you like with it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin <em>only</em> creates the theme for you. It doesn&#8217;t do anything to the database, it doesn&#8217;t do anything to your new child theme after you&#8217;ve created it. It only gives you buttons to create a child theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get some help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;d really prefer that you use <a href=\"https://github.com/johnpbloch/child-themify/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github&#8217;s issue tracker</a>. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/child-themify\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org support forum for the plugin</a> will work too, it will just take longer.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
