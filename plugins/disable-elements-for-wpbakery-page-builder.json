        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy would I use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The WPBakery Page Builder includes many core elements and depending on what theme or addon plugins you are using it could include even more. If there are elements you either don&#8217;t like or don&#8217;t need for your website this plugin can be used to unregister them and remove unnecessary bloat.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20i%20disable%20an%20element%3F'>\nWhat happens when I disable an element?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Disabled elements pass through the WPBakery vc_remove_element which removes them from the page builder &#8220;mapper&#8221; and are also unregistered from the site via the core remove_shortcode function.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20see%20disabled%20elements%20code%20on%20the%20site%3F'>\nWhy do I see disabled elements code on the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not scan your site and remove any previously added elements. When you disable an element it becomes unregistered and won&#8217;t render on the live site so instead you will see the shortcode in text form.</p>\n<p>Technically we could code the plugin to &#8220;hide&#8221; disabled element&#8217;s output on the front-end automaticall. To do so, would require registering disabled elements as shortcodes with an empty output, which, defeats would defeat the purpose of the plugin (slim down bloat).</p>\n<p>If you wish to remove all previously added elements from a site this would require manual site editing.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
