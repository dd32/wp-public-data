Just use our handy dandy shortcode <code>[wpyun]</code> and shazam! The shortcode accepts all the same arguments as the_shortlink(). You can also set &#8220;post_id&#8221; directly if you wish.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I include a shortlink using PHP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>(You don&#8217;t have to include the php comment, but you can if you want.)</em></p>\n</p>\n\n",
