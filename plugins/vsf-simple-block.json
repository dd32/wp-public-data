Add in a value like spider and any hit on your website that contains spider in the browser summary anywhere will be blocked.</p>\n<p>In the settings page enter a bounce address of your chosing which will be used to &#8220;forward&#8221; the users on to if they match a record in the block table.</p>\n<p>Filter Rules:<br />\nThere is also a filter table which is read before the bounce address.  Values in this allow hits from users that match in exactly the same way as the block table.  Because this is queried before the block table any matches will be allowed through.</p>\n<p>Block Records:<br />\nIs a list of all hits that have been bounced and also a single reason why.  for example if you have a block record for browser summary &#8211; bot &#8211; and the google bot arrives on your site, you will get a record that the google bot has been bounced.
