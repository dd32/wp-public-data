        "faq": "\n<h4>I Tried Using Thirteen Colors with a theme other than Twenty Thirteen and &#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thirteen Colors is designed specifically for use with Twenty Thirteen (or a child theme of Twenty Thirteen). If you&#8217;re going to switch themes, be sure to disable Thirteen Colors. There is a known bug where Thirteen Colors runs in the customizer when previewing another theme; it should stop doing anything visible once the new theme is activated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some Colors are Changed Before They&#8217;ve Even been customized</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Twenty Thirteen uses over twenty different colors, many in several different places for both background and text colors. In order to make customization more manageable, these colors are merged into eight color blocks, with visually similar color rules merged. If you aren&#8217;t customizing the colors, be sure to deactivate Thirteen Colors so that you can get all of the more specific original/default color combinations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Child Themes</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thirteen Colors is a plugin, not a child theme, because it is primarily programmatic (ie, it would only consist of a functions.php file) and for flexibility.</p>\n<p>You can use Thirteen Colors with both Twenty Thirteen and child themes. Be aware that the Thirteen Colors settings are stored with the active theme, so if you switch to a child theme or switch child themes, you&#8217;ll need to re-set your colors.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First publicly available version of the plugin.</li>\n<li>Compatible with WordPress 3.6+ (and Twenty Thirteen requires 3.6+ anyway).</li>\n</ul>\n"
