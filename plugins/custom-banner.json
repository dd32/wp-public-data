        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20my%20banner%20updating%20after%20i%20save%20changes%3F'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t my banner updating after I save changes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve saved changes to your banner but don&#8217;t see them reflected on your site, the issue might be related to your browser or site caching old data. To resolve this, please try clearing your browser&#8217;s cache. If you&#8217;re using a caching plugin on your WordPress site, you may also need to clear its cache. This action forces the browser and site to load the most recent version of your pages, including the latest changes to your banner. For a quick check, you can also open your site in an incognito or private browsing tab, which doesn&#8217;t use the same cache as regular tabs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20location%20of%20my%20banner%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow can I change the location of my banner on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, our plugin places your banner at the top of your website. However, you can easily customize its location to better fit your site&#8217;s design and your preferences. This customization is done through the plugin&#8217;s advanced options, where you can specify the action hook that controls where the banner is displayed. Action hooks are specific points within your theme&#8217;s code designed for adding custom content. If you&#8217;re new to using action hooks, think of them as predefined spots where you can &#8216;hook in&#8217; your banner. The right action hook for your needs might vary depending on your theme, so you may need to experiment or consult your theme&#8217;s documentation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20banner%20is%20either%20not%20visible%20or%20it%27s%20covering%20my%20site%27s%20header.%20what%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nMy banner is either not visible or it&#8217;s covering my site&#8217;s header. What can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This issue often arises due to the way your WordPress theme handles the positioning of elements like headers, which may use absolute or fixed positioning. If your banner is not appearing correctly, or if it&#8217;s overlapping with your header, you might need to adjust the banner&#8217;s positioning.</p>\n<p>Our plugin allows you to add a custom class to your banner, enabling you to choose alternative positions that work better with your theme&#8217;s layout. Another solution could be to place the banner directly within your site&#8217;s header area through the plugin&#8217;s advanced settings, ensuring it integrates smoothly with your existing design. If you&#8217;re not comfortable making these adjustments, consider contacting a web developer for further assistance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20use%20cookies%20to%20store%20information%20on%20users%27%20computers%3F'>\nDoes this plugin use cookies to store information on users&#8217; computers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, our plugin does not use cookies. We&#8217;ve designed it to enhance your website&#8217;s functionality and appearance without storing any data on your visitors&#8217; computers. This means you can use our plugin without worrying about cookie-related privacy concerns or regulations, ensuring a seamless experience for both you and your site&#8217;s visitors.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
