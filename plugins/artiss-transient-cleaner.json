If you don&#8217;t access the transient then, even though it&#8217;s expired, WordPress will not remove it. This is <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20316\" title=\"Ticket #20316\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">a known &#8220;issue&#8221;</a> but due to reasons, which are explained in the FAQ, this has not been adequately resolved.</p>\n<p>Why is this a problem?

        "changelog": "<p>I use semantic versioning, with the first release being 1.0.</p>\n<h4>1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Code quality improvements &#8211; major code changes to make sure all code guidelines are met</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Using new cross-plugin shared functions</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Tidy up of this README</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Fixed a bug in the settings screen. Remember kids &#8211; listen to your teachers when they tell you that spelling is important! Especially function names</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Removed the WordPress version check so that the plugin will remain active on all versions</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added new error screens to prevent activation after WordPress 5.8</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Code quality improved</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Removed links to Github repo, as this will be retired</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Changed some of the language used by the plugin to be more inclusive</li>\n<li>Enhancement: New header meta added to the plugin</li>\n<li>Bug: The scheduled event was not being removed during the uninstall routine &#8211; that&#8217;s now been added</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Transient cleaning now takes place as part of WordPress 4.9 and above. Therefore, on all installations &gt;= 4.9, an admin message will be shown to indicate as such</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Some further tidying up of code</li>\n<li>Bug: Fixed a multisite counting issue</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Had changed the settings screen name to fix another issue but forget to change it in one location, which meant settings couldn&#8217;t be saved. Fixed and abject apologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Minor tweaks to how the options screen contents are generated</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved the error reporting when the plugin is used with object caching</li>\n<li>Bug: Settings link on plugin meta no longer appears if you&#8217;re using object cache or using the &#8216;lite&#8217; version of the plugin (i.e. when there is no options screen!)</li>\n<li>Bug: If you were using object cache then the plugin was still queueing up a daily job to run the cleaning anyway. I&#8217;ve now stopped that</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Assorted tweaks to the README</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Removal of donation links BUT addition of Github links</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Changing of some on-screen wording &#8211; correct spelling in some cases and to make US English in others</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: README updates to reflect changed plugin directory</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Minimum WordPress level for the plugin has been raised to 4.6, so various changes have been made to accommodate that</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Because of the new minimum WordPress level loading of the language scripts is no longer required. The folder has also been removed, as has the link to it</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Oops. Although it seemed to work fine on my test system, it looks as if the code for the new &#8216;lite&#8217; mode was causing some users errors. I&#8217;ve now (I hope) corrected that. Apologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Beware the Atom editor and it&#8217;s default setting of appending extra blank lines! Extra lines have now been removed from the bottom of various files</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Also took the opportunity to correct my site URLs, as my domain has recently changed (the old URLs still work as I&#8217;m smart enough to put redirects in place but, still, it&#8217;s neater to do it properly)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: A new option has been added to allow you to run in &#8220;lite&#8221; mode, where no option screen will be present and default settings will be used. Useful for multi-site installations or just where you want to run with minimal performance impact</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Re-instated the code change that I removed in 1.4.1 &#8211; this time it performs a version check and only calls the extra function if available</li>\n<li>Enhancement: After WP 4.6 you no longer need to load the plugin&#8217;s text domain. So I don&#8217;t!</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a links sidebar to the help drop-down</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Changed the menu names so they no longer clash with other plugins</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Making use of Yoda conditions to ensure stability of code</li>\n<li>Bug: Sorted bug which meant that changing the scheduled run time didn&#8217;t work</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Updated branding, inc. adding donation links</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Awww&#8230; biscuits. I was being smart by including a call to a function to check something without realizing you have to have WordPress 4.4 for it to work. Thankfully, it&#8217;s not critical so I&#8217;ve removed it for now and will add a &#8220;proper&#8221; solution in future</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Re-written core code to work better with multisite installations</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Administration screen re-written to be more &#8220;in keeping&#8221; with the WordPress standard layout. More statistics about cleared transients are also shown</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Instead of piggy-backing the existing cleaning schedule (which some people turn off) I&#8217;ve instead implemented my own &#8211; it defaults to midnight but, via the administration screen, you can change it to whatever hour floats your boat</li>\n<li>Enhancement: For those nerdy enough that they want to code links to our amazing cleaning functions, we&#8217;ve added some super whizzy hooks. Check the instructions about for further details</li>\n<li>Maintenance: This is now a Code Art production, so the author name has been updated and the donation link (including matching plugin meta) ripped out. I for one welcome our new overlords.</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Renamed the functions that began with atc_ to tc_</li>\n<li>Maintenance: I admit it, I&#8217;ve been naughty. I&#8217;ve been hard-coding the plugin folder in INCLUDES. Yes, I know. But I&#8217;ve fixed that now</li>\n<li>Maintenance: I&#8217;ve validated, sanitized, escaped and licked the data that&#8217;s sent around the options screen. Okay, I didn&#8217;t do that last one</li>\n<li>Bug: Some PHP errors were vanquished</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Added a text domain and domain path</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added links to settings in plugin meta</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Updated admin screen headings for WP 4.3</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Now used time() instead of gmmktime(), so as to follow strict usage</li>\n<li>Bug: Big PHP error clean-up</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Updated links on plugin meta</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Removed PHP error</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Options are now only available to admin (super admin if a multisite)</li>\n<li>Bug: Removed reporting of &#8220;orphaned&#8221; transients &#8211; these are actually transients without a timeout</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Updated the branding of the plugin</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added support link to plugin meta</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Split files because of additional code size</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Removed run upon activation</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved transient cleaning code efficiency (including cleaning MU wide transients)</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added administration screen (Tools-&gt;Transients) to allow ad-hoc runs and specify run options</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Show within new admin screen whether orphaned transients have been found (in this case full clear of the option table is recommended)</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added internationalization</li>\n<li>Enhancement: If external memory cache is in use display an admin box to indicate this plugin is not required</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Transients will be initially cleaned when the plugin is activated</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
