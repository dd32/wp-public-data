As long as both All-in-One Event Calendar and Ai1ec Rich Snippets are installed and active, your events will be wrapped in schema.org markup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How do I know if this plugin is working?<br />\nPaste an event page URL from your site at Google&#8217;s Rich Snippets Testing Tool https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool and hit &#8220;Run Test&#8221;. If Google is able to parse and structure event details, congrats, everything&#8217;s peachy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see the markup in the page source!<br />\nThis plugin uses JSON-LD for the markup. Hence you&#8217;ll find the markup at the bottom of the page, rather than wrapped around each individual element. This is completely acceptable to, if not recommended by, Google https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
