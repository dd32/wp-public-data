        "faq": "\n<h4>Why not exporting the email lists as files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The very first implementation of this plugin was actually creating files for download. While it&#8217;s a very convenient solution, there are security and privacy issues with it. The simple fact of having, even momentarily, a file on your server that contain the email addresses of all your subscribers is a significant risk. Because of that, it was decided against using downloadable files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I support this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you enjoy this plugin and would like to help with the development, please consider <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=5162912\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donating</a>.
