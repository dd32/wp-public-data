All content after the shortcode will not be shown to the user until the user sends payment.  After the payment is sent, the paywall will be gone forever for a user that was logged into the site, and for users not logged in, will be gone as long as the saved cookie remains in their browser.</p>\n<p>Shortcode Attributes &#8211; the following attributes can be given in the shortcode and override the default values in Settings-&gt;SomeNano.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>account</code>: Nano account to receive payment</li>\n<li><code>currency</code>: Type of currency to convert to Nano for payment</li>\n<li><code>amount</code>: The amount in set currency to charge for the paywall.

Disable caching plugins (and possibly others) to verify that is the problem.  Many caching plugins let you set exceptions, you should do this for pages or posts that have a paywall.
