        "description": "<p>A fully configurable time sheet system which allows for employee time tracking, workflows, time sheet approvals, invoicing and payroll processes.</p>\n<p>The system is pretty straight forward to configure.  It supports a basic workflow of employees submitting timesheets to their supervisor, who then approves or denies the time sheet. Once approved the time sheets go over to the accounts receivable queue (we call it the Invoicing Queue) so that the customer can be invoiced.  From there if needed it goes to the payroll queue so that expenses can be paid back to the employee.  There&#8217;s even a setting for making all invoices that someone submits go to the invoicing queue in case you have hourly employees that you need to handle.</p>\n<p>When clients are entered into the system, there is security setup on the clients so that only employees who are working with those clients can see them in their drop down.  This makes the drop down smaller for employees and keeps any third party contractors that are working for you from seeing your entire client list.</p>\n<p>The system is configured to allow for retainer projects that get billed automatically and it drops in reminder time sheets to the invoicing queue so that those invoices are invoiced at the beginning of each month.  Reminders are also sent to employees automatically if they have overdue time sheets or if they are working on retainers and they need to get their time sheets in at the end of the month.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the contents of the zip file to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/time-sheets</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Configure the settings through the settings page.</li>\n<li>Begin documenting customers, projects and employee access through the various settings pages.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20more%20workflows%3F'>\nCan I add more workflows?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at this time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20payroll%20workflow%20mandatory%3F'>\nIs the Payroll workflow mandatory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, if you don&#8217;t configure any expense types, and you don&#8217;t configure any employees to force their time sheets to payroll then the payroll queue will not be shown.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20invoicing%20workflow%20mandatory%3F'>\nIs the Invoicing workflow mandatory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depends how you look at things.  If you don&#8217;t approve anyone for the invoicing queue, but then configure the system for parallel queues for Invoicing and Payroll then the payroll queue will still work but the invoicing queue won&#8217;t be used.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20approval%20queue%20mandatory%3F'>\nIs the Approval Queue mandatory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s no way to get invoices into the invoicing and/or payroll queues without someone approving them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20a%20fraction%20shown%20after%20the%20approval%20and%20invoicing%20queues%3F'>\nWhy is there a fraction shown after the approval and invoicing queues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first number shown is the number of non-retainer time sheets which are pending.  The second number is then number of time sheets on projects which are marked as retainer projects.  The approval may have a third number up there. That is the number of time sheets which are under embargo.  The payroll queue doesn&#8217;t have a different between retainer and non-retainer time sheets so there&#8217;s just a single number showing that queue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20way%20to%20turn%20off%20all%20the%20retainer%20settings%20as%20we%20don%27t%20need%20them%3F'>\nIs there a way to turn off all the retainer settings as we don&#8217;t need them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time. If we get some requests to make that an option we&#8217;ll look into it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20headings%20on%20the%20expenses%20section%3F'>\nCan I change the headings on the expenses section?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No you can&#8217;t. If you would like this feature added contact us and we&#8217;ll add it to our backlog.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20do%20retainer%20reminders%20get%20sent%20out%3F'>\nWhen do retainer reminders get sent out?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They are sent out on the last day of the month. (This is based on the time settings of your web server.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20do%20reminders%20for%20late%20time%20sheets%20get%20sent%20out%3F'>\nWhen do reminders for late time sheets get sent out?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They are sent out on Monday mornings. (This is based on the time settings of your web server.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20work%20week%20defined%20as%3F'>\nWhat is a work week defined as?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can configure it to start on whatever day you&#8217;d like. By default it&#8217;ll configure itself for the week starting on Monday, but you can change it.  It wouldn&#8217;t be recommneded to change it after starting to use it, as the old timesheets won&#8217;t be updated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20employees%20start%20getting%20reminders%20about%20retainer%20time%20sheets%20being%20do%3F'>\nHow do employees start getting reminders about retainer time sheets being do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As soon as they create a time sheet for a retainer project, they&#8217;ll start getting the reminders.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20employees%20stop%20getting%20reminders%20about%20retainer%20time%20sheets%20being%20do%3F'>\nHow do employees stop getting reminders about retainer time sheets being do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If they stop submitting time sheets for 60 days or more, then they will no longer receive the retainer reminders.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20there%27s%20multiple%20emails%20of%20the%20same%20time%20which%20need%20to%20be%20sent%2C%20will%20they%20be%20sent%20one%20at%20a%20time%3F'>\nIf there&#8217;s multiple emails of the same time which need to be sent, will they be sent one at a time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the emails are combined before they are sent out.  This helps minimize the number of emails so the employees don&#8217;t get a flood of emails.  If the same email subject is queued for an employee within 5 minutes the employee won&#8217;t get the email until another 5 minutes has passed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20time%20sheets%20which%20have%20been%20sent%20to%20the%20invoicing%20queue%20be%20rejected%3F'>\nCan time sheets which have been sent to the invoicing queue be rejected?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. If an employee has the approval queue and the invoicing queue then they will be able to reject time sheets from the invoicing queue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20time%20sheets%20which%20have%20been%20sent%20to%20the%20payroll%20queue%20be%20rejected%3F'>\nCan time sheets which have been sent to the payroll queue be rejected?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes they can.  Depending on how you have your queue workflows being done this could cause odd things to happen to the timesheet. So be careful.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20clients%20does%20the%20system%20support%3F'>\nHow many clients does the system support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many as you need. Your limits are the numbers of rows supported in the database, and the amount of disk space which the database server has.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20employees%20does%20the%20system%20support%3F'>\nHow many employees does the system support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many users as WordPress supports in the system. Your limits are the numbers of rows supported in the database, and the amount of disk space which the database server has.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20settings%20located%3F'>\nWhere are the settings located?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The settings are located under the Time Sheets parent menu. This includes the Global settings which are only available to people with the &#8220;manage_settings&#8221; WordPress settings (admins for example) as well as the &#8220;My Settings&#8221; page which is available for all users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20are%20specific%20system%20requirements%3F'>\nIs there are specific system requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We run this for our business on a database with a single CPU core and a web server with a single CPU core (two machines) and the performance is exactly as expected (your mileage may vary).  If you see performance problems please let us know.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20multiple%20web%20servers%2C%20but%20i%20only%20want%20to%20run%20the%20email%20jobs%20on%20one%2C%20can%20i%3F'>\nI have multiple web servers, but I only want to run the email jobs on one, can I?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Add the code &#8220;define( &#8216;TIMESHEETS_SKIP_CRON&#8217;, false );&#8221; to your wp-config.php. This will stop that web server from processing the email messages and just about anything else that&#8217;s scheduled through cron. Just make sure that you do not put this setting on every web server otherwise all the cron tasks won&#8217;t run.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

    "description": "<p>A fully configurable time sheet system which allows for employee time tracking, workflows, time sheet approvals, invoicing and payroll processes.</p>\n<p>The system is pretty straight forward to configure.  It supports a basic workflow of employees submitting timesheets to their supervisor, who then approves or denies the time sheet. Once approved the time sheets go over to the accounts receivable queue (we call it the Invoicing Queue) so that the customer can be invoiced.  From there if needed it goes to the payroll queue so that expenses can be paid back to the employee.  There&#8217;s even a setting for making all invoices that someone submits go to the invoicing queue in case you have hourly employees that you need to handle.</p>\n<p>When clients are entered into the system, there is security setup on the clients so that only employees who are working with those clients can see them in their drop down.  This makes the drop down smaller for employees and keeps any third party contractors that are working for you from seeing your entire client list.</p>\n<p>The system is configured to allow for retainer projects that get billed automatically and it drops in reminder time sheets to the invoicing queue so that those invoices are invoiced at the beginning of each month.  Reminders are also sent to employees automatically if they have overdue time sheets or if they are working on retainers and they need to get their time sheets in at the end of the month.</p>\n",
