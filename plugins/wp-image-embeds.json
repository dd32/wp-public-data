But why not encourage linking by making it easy for other webmasters to link to you?</p>\n<p>If you have unique and interesting images, photos, or infographics on your site the chances are that other webmasters are already picking these up and using them on their own sites. That&#8217;s great if they link back to you, but many won&#8217;t. This is why we built WP Image Embeds. It is a simple plugin designed to make it easy for other webmasters to embed your images, while at the same time linking back to you.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Demo</h3>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bs6BlW-r2AA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>When you install and activate the plugin you will have access to a new option in the Customizer, Display Image Embed. Here you can choose to activate the plugin site wide on posts and/or pages. By default the plugin is not active on pages or posts.</p>\n<p>If you only want to run the plugin on certain pages you can leave these site wide settings unchecked and instead simple activate the plugin on a particular page or post. This option appears on the page or post edit screen as a new meta box below the main content editor.</p>\n<p>And that it is. We purposefully tried to make this early version of the plugin very simple to use.
