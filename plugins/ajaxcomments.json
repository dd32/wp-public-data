The comments are send via AJAX, errors that happen will be displayed inline in the form, you can style the error-messages yourself (if you want or have to) and it is even possible to add custom fields to the comment-form, provided the validation for those extra fields is done via the Ajax-Comments callback.</p>\n<p>How is this plugin different from other Ajax-Comment-plugins?</p>\n<p>This plugin uses a comletely rewritten backend and doesn\\&#8217;t use the default wordpress-backend although it is based on that. This plugin displays the errors directly at the field they happened at. Therefore the error-messages are right in the context of the fields. This plugin uses the AJAX-functionality brought to you with the core wordpress, so there are no third-party libraries necessary This plugin can handle custom fields in the form without a problem. If you want to use the error-display-functions of the plugin you will have to use the wp_ajax_comment_validate_form-filter and for storing those metadata-fields you will need to implement the wp_ajax_comment_store_metadata-action. If you find any issues during the usage, feel free to create an issue on the issue tracker on github</p>\n",
