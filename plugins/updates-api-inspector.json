While many externally hosted plugins/themes have been hooking into API for years, the new auto-updates UI has certain requirements for how the site transients are populated and not all externally hosted plugins/themes have populated them such that the new UI will work properly (see <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/30/recommended-usage-of-the-updates-api-to-support-the-auto-updates-ui-for-plugins-and-themes-in-wordpress-5-5/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Recommended usage of the Updates API to support the auto-updates UI for Plugins and Themes in WordPress 5.5</a>).</p>\n<p>My hope is that by providing an easy way for developers to inspect the API queries/responses and the site transients core populates from them, they will more easily be able to update their code so that the new UI works properly for them.</p>\n<p>In future versions, I plan to add many other features, as well as more extensive on-screen help of an &#8220;educational&#8221; nature.</p>\n",

My main motivation for releasing it <em>now</em> is to help developers of externally hosted plugins/themes prepare for the release of 5.5.0, this plugin should work just fine with previous versions (although I have only tested it with 5.5.0).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this plugin work in multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does!</p>\n<p>In non-multisite, the Updates API Inspector menu item appers in <code>Tools</code>.</p>\n<p>In multisite, this plugin can only be network activated (since that&#8217;s where updates happen) and the menu item appears at the top-level of <code>Network Admin</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I contribute to this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can!  Development happens on <a href=\"https://github.com/pbiron/updates-api-inspector\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.  If you find a bug or have other suggestions, please open an issue there.
