Check your site for broken links and easily fix them to improve SEO.</p>\n<h3>Broken Link Checker by AIOSEO &#8211; Easily Fix/Monitor Internal and External links</h3>\n<p>The Broken Link Checker by AIOSEO for WordPress is a must-have tool for website owners and managers. Its granular control and detailed reporting features ensure that your website&#8217;s links are healthy and functioning correctly, providing your visitors with a seamless browsing experience. With this plugin, you can detect and fix broken links quickly and easily, ensuring that your website is always up-to-date and running smoothly.</p>\n<p>Unlike other broken link checker plugins, <strong>AIOSEO&#8217;s Broken Link Checker is offered as a SaaS and requires an AIOSEO account</strong>. This means that the tool is hosted on the AIOSEO servers, rather than being installed on your website&#8217;s server. <strong>This approach has several benefits, including preventing your server IP from being blocked, and avoiding hosting providers from forcing you to upgrade</strong> due to increased resource usage.</p>\n<p>By using Broken Link Checker as a SaaS, you can rest assured that your website&#8217;s performance won&#8217;t be negatively affected, and that you&#8217;ll have access to the most up-to-date version of the service at all times. Additionally, it&#8217;s incredibly user-friendly and provides actionable recommendations for fixing broken links, making it an essential tool for maintaining the health and functionality of your website.</p>\n<p>When you install this plugin, you’ll have the opportunity to register for a free account that includes scanning up to 200 internal links. Those 200 link credits will renew every month for free, and you’ll only be upgraded if you scan more than 200 links during the month. Or, if you already have an AIOSEO Broken Link Checker subscription, you can simply connect this plugin to it.</p>\n<h3>Link Monitoring</h3>\n<p>The Broken Link Checker plugin monitors all internal and external links on your WordPress website, ensuring that they are functioning correctly. It crawls your website periodically and checks each link to ensure that it is not broken. The plugin will also show whether or not a link worked properly (200 status) or worked with redirects (301/302 status) or was broken (404 status).</p>\n<h3>Granular Control</h3>\n<p>The plugin provides granular control over which post types and statuses it will monitor. You can choose which post types, such as pages, posts, or custom post types, the plugin will monitor. You can also choose which post statuses, such as published, draft, or pending review, the plugin will monitor to look for broken links.</p>\n<h3>URL Exclusions</h3>\n<p>You can exclude certain URLs from being checked by the plugin. For example, if you have a third-party tracking link that redirects to another website, you can exclude it from being checked.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitors all internal and external links on your WordPress website.</li>\n<li>Detects valid links, broken links and redirects.</li>\n<li>Provides granular control over which post types and statuses the plugin will monitor.</li>\n<li>Allows you to exclude certain URLs from being checked.</li>\n<li>Schedules checks to run automatically at regular intervals.</li>\n<li>Excludes links that are broken from search engine crawling.</li>\n<li>Allows inline editing of links to reduce time spent updating each post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>This plugin is created by <a href=\"https://benjaminrojas.net/\" title=\"Benjamin Rojas\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Benjamin Rojas</a> and <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\" title=\"Syed Balkhi\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Syed Balkhi</a>.</p>\n<h3>Branding Guideline</h3>\n<p>AIOSEO&reg; is a registered trademark of Semper Plugins LLC.
