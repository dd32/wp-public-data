        "installation": "<p>The two methods of installing the plugin are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for &#8220;Automatic Alternative Text&#8221; in Plugins &gt; Add New and click the Install button.</li>\n<li>Unzip the archive and put the <code>automatic-alt-text</code> folder into your site&#8217;s <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> folder.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then activate Automatic Alt Text from the Plugins menu.</p>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Before the plugin will work you need to supply an API key and endpoint for Microsoft&#8217;s Cognitive Services Computer Vision API. You can learn how to sign up for a free key <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/vision-api-how-to-topics/howtosubscribe\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Go to the Settings &gt; Media page to enter the key and endpoint from Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Once your key and endpoint are entered any image you upload from that point forward will automatically have its alt text set to a caption supplied by Microsoft&#8217;s Cognitive Services where possible.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t my images receiving alt text?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s several reasons an image might not get alt text:<br />\n1. Your API key is missing or incorrect. Make sure that your key is saved and accurate in Settings &gt; Media. Also make sure that the key is for the Computer Vision API.<br />\n2. The service is not confident enough in the caption. By default the plugin will only use the received caption as alt text if the service is at least 15% confident in the result. You can adjust this confidence threshold in Settings &gt; Media.<br />\n3. The service cannot connect to your server or is prevented from accessing the image for any reason. Try entering your image URL on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a> to see if the service can connect outside the context of this plugin.<br />\n4. You&#8217;ve exceeded your key&#8217;s request quota. You can view your usage and upgrade your quota <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I automatically add alt text to images I&#8217;ve already uploaded?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet. I might add this functionality in a future version.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
