        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.blipfoto.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Blipfoto</a> is an online daily photo journal. Each day you can upload one photo and add some words. It is also an extremely friendly community where people comment on and rate each other&#8217;s photos, choose favourite &#8216;blips&#8217; (the informal name given to journal entries), follow journals, join groups and take part in discussions.</p>\n<p>Blipfoto Importer lets you easily import all your photos and journal entries from Blipfoto into your WordPress website. Each imported entry will create a post on your website, with the image set to be the &#8216;featured image&#8217;. You can choose the post status (published, draft, private, or pending review) and if you wish automatically insert the image into the post content.</p>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the &#8216;Blipfoto Importer&#8217; settings page (under the Settings menu).</li>\n<li>In a new tab or window, go to the <a href=\"https://www.blipfoto.com/developer/apps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Blipfoto apps page</a></li>\n<li>Click the &#8216;Create a new app&#8217; button.</li>\n<li>Enter your name.</li>\n<li>Choose &#8216;web application&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Type anything in the description field.</li>\n<li>Enter the address of your website in the &#8216;Website&#8217; field.</li>\n<li>Leave the &#8216;Redirect URI&#8217; field blank.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8216;I agree&#8217; checkbox.</li>\n<li>Copy the &#8216;Client ID&#8217;, &#8216;Client secret&#8217; and &#8216;Access token&#8217; into the relevant fields on the settings page on your WordPress website.</li>\n<li>Set the other options as required.</li>\n<li>To run the import, go to the &#8216;Blipfoto Importer&#8217; page in the &#8216;Tools&#8217; menu. The import is run in batches to prevent timeouts or exceeding the Blipfoto API rate limit. Just keep hitting the &#8216;Go!&#8217; button until all your entries have been imported.</li>\n<li>If you hit the Blipfoto API rate limit (about 500 entries), put your feet up with a nice cup of tea and try again in about 15 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Important notes</h4>\n<p>This is not an official Blipfoto plugin, it is developed and maintained by me in my spare time.
