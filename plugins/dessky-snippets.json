Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20does%20this%20plugin%20require%20theme%20modifications%3F'>\nQ. Does this plugin require theme modifications?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Absolutely not. This plugin is added/configured entirely from the WordPress Admin section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nQ. How does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Just place your PHP code into the textfield and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;. Example of PHP code:<br />\n    function MyAwesomeFunction() {</p>\n<pre><code>    // Content of my awesome function\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20on%20the%20plugin%20settings%20page%2C%20an%20error%20message%20appears.%20what%20could%20be%20wrong%3F'>\nQ. On the plugin settings page, an error message appears. What could be wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Here are a few of the most likely causes of the error message:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You make a syntax error in the code that you have entered. Check the syntax of your code and try again.</li>\n<li>You have entered function with a name that is already occupied by another function. Use a unique name for your function.</li>\n<li>You are trying to overwrite an existing function (of WordPress, theme, or plugin). Instead, use filters and hooks.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20what%20to%20do%20if%20this%20plugin%20caused%20the%20white%20screen%3F'>\nQ. What to do if this plugin caused the white screen?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. It may be that a custom code that you&#8217;ve entered caused the error and white screen of death. If this happened then do the following.</p>\n<p>Go to plugin folder (in <code>wp-content/plugins/dessky-snippets/</code>). Rename the &#8220;<code>START</code>&#8221; file to &#8220;<code>STOP</code>&#8220;. Then you may go to plugin settings page and edit your entered custom code. After editing, just rename the &#8220;<code>STOP</code>&#8221; file that you renamed before back to &#8220;<code>START</code>&#8220;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
