        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uzip the <code>grid-columns.zip</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Upload the <code>grid-columns</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>\n<li>Activate <em>Grid Columns</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many theme developers add several column shortcodes to their themes (note: this isn&#8217;t allowed on WordPress.org).  Essentially, the theme developers are doing a few things wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They lock users into using their themes forever.</li>\n<li>They create 20+ shortcodes for what is possible for one.  This makes it look like their themes have more &#8220;features&#8221;.</li>\n<li>They remove core WordPress filters that other plugins rely on.</li>\n<li>The code is just poorly developed altogether (most likely because they all copied from the same, bad source).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This plugin allows you to switch between any theme (no lock-in to your current theme).  It was also developed with WordPress standards and usability in mind.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the [column] shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find more detailed instructions in the plugin&#8217;s <code>docs/readme.html</code> file.</p>\n<p>Everything is based on a grid.  By default, this grid is &#8220;4&#8221;.  So, you can set up four columns like so:</p>\n<pre><code>[column grid=\"4\" span=\"1\"]Some content[/column]\n\n[column grid=\"4\" span=\"1\"]Some content[/column]\n\n[column grid=\"4\" span=\"1\"]Some content[/column]\n\n[column grid=\"4\" span=\"1\"]Some content[/column]\n</code></pre>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that each &#8220;span&#8221; is equal to the number of columns in the grid.  So, if the span is &#8220;1&#8221;, it&#8217;s equal to one column.  If the span is &#8220;2&#8221;, it&#8217;s equal to two columns.  You can only have as many spans/columns as the grid allows.  Therefore, <code>grid=\"4\"</code> means you can only have four columns.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get more detailed instructions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you need a more detailed guide, see <code>readme.html</code>, which is included with the plugin.  It has a few examples and explains everything.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help!  My site&#8217;s broken!  What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely, it&#8217;s because you either have too many spans or not enough spans for your grid.  Make sure each <code>span</code> argument for your <code>[column]</code> shortcode equals exactly the <code>grid</code> argument.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>But, I did everything right.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re absolutely sure you&#8217;re math is correct, it could be a conflict with your theme.  It&#8217;d be impossible for me to know without seeing it in use on your site, so you&#8217;ll either need to ask on my support forums or get your theme developer to help.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have more than one set of grid columns in a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Absolutely.  Just make sure each grid has the correct number of columns before starting a new one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I nest columns?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  This is a limitation of how WordPress handles shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use other shortcodes within the `[column]` shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can.  However, keep in mind, that I can&#8217;t guarantee that your plugin developer knows what he&#8217;s doing and created his shortcode correctly.  But, yes, you can do this with properly-coded shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I put content between two different column shortcodes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible, but you&#8217;ll probably break something.  I recommend against attempting this.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
