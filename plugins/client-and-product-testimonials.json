We&#8217;ve included the ability to import existing WooCommerce or Easy Digital Download products directly into Client and Product Testimonials. Once you import the products from the chosen plugin, you can begin assigning your testimonials to the respective product.</p>\n<p>On top of that, if you use any of the included shortcodes or widgets on the single_product template (for either plugin) &#8211; the testimonials will be filtered to only return testimonials assigned to that given product. This allows you to quickly and easily display testimonials assigned to a product.</p>\n<p>With the pro version you can add our frontend submission form to start accepting testimonials from your customers, for each of your products.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use my own preloader image?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
