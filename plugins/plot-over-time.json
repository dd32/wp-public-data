        "description": "<p>I ran across Tom Fotherby&#8217;s Fotherplot when I was looking for a slick way to set up graphs for a workout log.  Being the type that can&#8217;t stand to leave things alone, I had to hack on it a bit to change a few things… upgrade it to the most modern version of Google Chart Tools, add multiple data points, etc… until finally, well… I think the only thing left of the original plugin is the GNU license.</p>\n<p>Want to see it in action?  I&#8217;m using it in http://www.midnightryder.org/category/workout-log/</p>\n<p>To get it up and running: first, you&#8217;ll need to put data in your posts.  So, in a post, go to the section under your post called &#8220;Custom Fields&#8221;.  Create a field you want to track (for instance, &#8220;Heart Rate&#8221;) and give it a value.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need at lest two posts with data in them before Plot Over Time can do it&#8217;s thing &#8211; so add data to another post.</p>\n<p>Now that you have at least two posts with data, you can create a post that creates a graph.  For this example, you could simply use:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will go through all posts that have a custom field called &#8220;Heart Rate&#8221; and plot them on a nice Google Chart Tools LineChart.  If you wanted to work with more points of data, simply add more Custom Fields:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" field2=\"Weight\" field3=\"Workout Time\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Plot Over Time support up to 10 fields per graph.</p>\n<p>The legend is automatically added, and each datapoint is able to be clicked to get a callout about it&#8217;s datapoint.  If you want to get rid of the legend:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" legend=\"none\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can move the legend around with legend=&#8221;left&#8221; or legend=&#8221;right&#8221;.</p>\n<p>To use other types of graphs:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" type=\"BarChart\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Valid types chart types for Plot Over Time are:  AreaChart, LineChart, PieChart (not particularly useful in this implementation), BarChart, and ColumnChart.</p>\n<p>You can set your own width and height for the chart with Width and Height:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"] \n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, Plot Over Time uses ALL data from all posts and pops it onto a graph.  You can limit it with two options:</p>\n<p>1)  You can determine the maximum number of days worth of data (starting from now and going backwards) with maydays:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" maxdays=\"30]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would show a one month span of data.</p>\n<p>2)  You can attach a graph to that post&#8217;s published date with usepostdate:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" usepostdate=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>So if the post was 3 weeks old, it would only show data from it&#8217;s publication date of three weeks ago and older.</p>\n<p>The date format defaults to m/d/y &#8211; IE, 12/31/11.  You can change it with dateformat:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" dateformat=\"Y-m-d\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would instead put 2011-12-31 on the graph.</p>\n<p>And finally:  Don&#8217;t like the colors of the graph, or want to add a few new options?  No problem &#8211; any Google Visualization Tools options is available using the option parameter:</p>\n<pre><code>[plotovertime field1=\"Heart Rate\" options=\"title: 'My Cool Graph!';\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would add a title above your graph that reads &#8220;My Cool Graph!&#8221;.  Note &#8211; don&#8217;t change the height or width using the options=&#8221;height: &#8220;, instead use height=&#8221;300&#8221; or similar.  Changing it in the options that are passed to the graph won&#8217;t change the size of the div it exists in.</p>\n<p>For more information on the options available visit the Google Chart Tools homepage: http://code.google.com/apis/chart/index.html</p>\n<p>And of course, you can mix and match any of the shortcode commands in any way you want.  have fun!</p>\n<p>Now, about that data… you&#8217;ll want to know a couple of rules.</p>\n<p>First, if you define 5 fields you want to read from, and a post only had four fields?  It&#8217;s going to ignore you.</p>\n<p>Second, it doesn&#8217;t do data interpolation.  If there&#8217;s a gap in your data, it simply ignores it &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t give it a &#8220;0&#8221;, it just plain doesn&#8217;t plot it.  (That&#8217;s how I wanted it.  Other opinions may differ.)</p>\n<p>Third, if you tell it you want to see 30 days of data, and you&#8217;ve only got three days of data in your posts?  It&#8217;s only going to show a graph that spans three days.</p>\n<p>All data integrity is up to you.</p>\n<p>And it will pull data from ALL posts, not just posts in a specific category.  For future updates I&#8217;ll probably add a category field that allows you to pull data from a single category.</p>\n<p>This plugin is a quick &#8220;one off&#8221; I did for myself &#8211; it&#8217;s not nearly as pretty or efficient as it could be, and I&#8217;ll probably do some refactoring on it in the future if there&#8217;s any interest.  Plus, there&#8217;s probably a couple of other things I&#8217;ll add down the road as the whim strikes.</p>\n",
