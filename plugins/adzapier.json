        "faq": "\n<dt id='q%3A%20what%20companies%20must%20comply%20with%20gdpr%3F'>\nQ: What companies must comply with GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: GDPR affects all companies based in the EU and companies anywhere in the world that retain EU residents’ data.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re in the EU you need to have a CMP today, and if you’re outside the EU but get any site traffic from the EU that you retain you also need a CMP today.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20who%20does%20ccpa%20affect%3F'>\nQ: Who does CCPA affect?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Businesses that buy, receive or sell the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households, or devices. Businesses that derive 50 percent or more of their annual revenue from selling consumers’ personal information; or those that have gross annual revenues greater than $25 million.</p>\n<p>If you are a for-profit company, you do not have to be based in CA – it is applied to the data of CA residents – the fifth-largest economy.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how many states produce their own versions, it is far easier for companies to comply with the toughest versions knowing everyone else will fall within those most of the time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20what%20happens%20if%20i%20don%E2%80%99t%20use%20a%20cmp%3F'>\nQ: What happens if I don’t use a CMP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: If you retain cookie data without consent. Especially if there is a data leak, you may be fined up to 4% of your revenue. Businesses that fail to comply with these requirements could face litigation, as well as other regulatory enforcement actions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20how%20long%20is%20user%20consent%20applicable%3F'>\nQ: How long is user consent applicable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: As there is no specific time limit under the CCPA, consent will last for as long as it is given and can be withdrawn at any time, with consent only applying to the specific purpose for which it was generated. If the parties involved wish to use personal data in a unique way or for a new purpose, then fresh consent must be acquired.</p>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download plugin <code>privacypillar.zip</code> file</li>\n<li>Upload to the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to &#8216;Settings &gt; PrivacyPillar Cookie Banner&#8217; menu in WordPress to insert js code in website head.</li>\n<li>Enjoy!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Screenshots</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>After activate this plugin go to plugin settings by click on &#8220;settings&#8221;.</li>\n<li>You can also find the plugin settings by &#8216;Settings &gt; PrivacyPillar Cookie Banner&#8217; menu in your WordPress backend like as above screen.</li>\n<li>Here, you would be able to enter your PrivacyPillar Cookie Banner Script for your website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Changelog</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='1.0'>\n1.0\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
