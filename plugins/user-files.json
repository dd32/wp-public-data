The manage_userfiles_settings will allow access to the File manager options in the settings menu and the manage_userfiles will create the userfiles admin menu options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can User File Admins manage all users filefrom the front end in a page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there is no in-page option for file management for admins, only users. We have just released a new commercial addon called <a href=\"http://www.whereyoursolutionis.com/user-file-manager-front-end-admin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Front end admin</a> however that will allow you to do this.  It currently features multi-file upload for admin and users.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
