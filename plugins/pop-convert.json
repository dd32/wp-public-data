        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20this%20plugin%20do%3F'>\nWhat does this plugin do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pop Convert&#8217;s suite of lead capture tools allow you to collect more information from your visitors, including email addresses, phone numbers, and more. Pop Convert is your complete solution for lead capture with smart features such as Smart Bar, Popup, Exit intent, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20all%20wordpress%20themes%3F'>\nIs the plugin compatible with all WordPress themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pop Convert is built to be compatible with most themes, but we cannot guarantee full compatibility with all themes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20pop%20up%3F'>\nWhat is a pop up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pop-ups which allow you to collect visitor information at the perfect time. Set up pop-ups that trigger just when your visitor is about to leave your site (exit intent) or automatically display a popup after a set time period. Unlike Smart Bars, Pop Ups generally appear in the center of the customer&#8217;s screen and are full screen.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20smart%20bar%3F'>\nWhat is a smart bar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A smart bar is a header or footer bar that is perfect for drawing your customers&#8217; attention when they land on your site, and Pop Convert&#8217;s Smart Bar allows you to set this up in just a few clicks. Use the Smart Bar for announcements, promotions, or email collection!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20subscriber%20info%20synced%20with%20my%20mailer%20tool%3F'>\nIs subscriber info synced with my mailer tool?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are currently working on building our syncing functionality out.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20further%20help%3F'>\nHow do I get further help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The best way to reach us is by clicking the live chat bubble found on the bottom right of this page.
