The default timeout duration is 3600 seconds (1 hour), but you can adjust this on the Inactivity Logout Settings page.</p>\n<h3>Why should I use such a thing?</h3>\n<p>There may be many reasons to do so!

This means you&#8217;ll have to start the entire process from the beginning again. However, by using this plugin, you&#8217;ll be able to extend the time session to whatever length you need.</p>\n",
