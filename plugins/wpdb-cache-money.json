        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Place entire /wpdb-cache-money/ directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Bling</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>This doesn&#8217;t do anything!</h4>\n<p>Yes it does.  Hey, didn&#8217;t you ask this question over on my other plugin too?</p>\n<h4>I need the cache to be cleared at a different interval than 5 minutes.</h4>\n<p>Change <code>$cacheMoney-&gt;threshold</code> to whatever number of seconds you wish.</p>\n<h4>How can I tell if this is working?</h4>\n<p>The directory wp-content/plugins/wpdb-cache-money/ should be full of files with names similar to <code>4a13fc6a615ac14cc3f58160ce9c52f3.php</code>.  If not, check to make sure this directory is writable by your server. <code>echo $wpdb-&gt;stats(TRUE)</code> will give you a result like <code>q: 9 | c: 6 | m: 9.055 t: 0.171</code>. <code>q</code> is the number of actual database queries, <code>c</code> is the number of cached queries, <code>m</code> is the memory usage in megabytes, and <code>t</code> is the time in seconds to render the page. <code>echo $wpdb-&gt;stats()</code> will do the same, wrapped in an html comment, for times when you need to be discrete. There is also a profiler method &#8211; <code>echo $wpdb-&gt;profiler()</code>.  You will need to make sure <code>$cacheMoney-&gt;useProfiler</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> to use this.  The default for the profiler is to sort the queries by length of time descending. <code>$wpdb-&gt;profiler(FALSE)</code> will show the queries in the order performed.</p>\n",
