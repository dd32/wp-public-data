This change in 6.0.2 was causing the <strong>Days Out</strong> setting to be ignored.</li>\n<li>Changed hook for <code>r34ecre_rss_pre_get_posts()</code> to <code>tribe_events_parse_query</code> as a more reliable way to ensure it only runs on The Events Calendar queries. (This change was also needed to fix the <strong>Days Out</strong> issue.)</li>\n<li>Added logic to check if options are already set; fixes issue of resetting all options to defaults if plugin is deactivated and reactivated.</li>\n<li>Updated &#8220;Tested up to&#8221; to 6.0.3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.0 &#8211; 2021.03.23</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Image Size option.</li>\n<li>Added activation hook to set default options.</li>\n<li>Additional minor refactoring.</li>\n<li>Updated &#8220;Tested up to&#8221; to 5.7.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0.1 &#8211; 2016.12.12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated &#8220;Tested up to&#8221; to 4.7.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0 &#8211; 2016.11.10</h4>\n<p>Initial release in WordPress Plugin Directory.</p>\n"
