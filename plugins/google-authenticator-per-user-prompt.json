This can be confusing for users, which prevents some administrators from using the plugin on multi-user sites.</p>\n<p>This plugin modifies the way that Google Authenticator behaves so that only users who have it enabled are prompted for the token. If a user doesn&#8217;t have it enabled, then they&#8217;ll proceed directly to the Administration Panels; if they do have it enabled then they&#8217;ll be prompted to enter their 2FA code.</p>\n",
