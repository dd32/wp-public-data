When you change domains and you move your WordPress blog from subdomain to parent domain, you need to change base URL in configuration and you need to replace all URLs in database.<br />\nIf you activate Relative URLs all URLs are fine after transfer site: you don&#8217;t need to change base URL and you don&#8217;t need to replace all URLs in database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20to%20change%20something%20after%20change%20domain%3F'>\nI need to change something after change domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin replace URLs before WordPress send output, so you don&#8217;t need any configuration after activate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20it%20works%3F'>\nHow it works?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Relative URLs replace the absolute URL with relative URL before WordPress send output. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20request%20new%20feature%3F'>\nCan I request new feature?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! I love to get your ideas!
