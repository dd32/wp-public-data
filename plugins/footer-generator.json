Another option is the self or blank option, this specifies whether the link will open in the current tab (self) or a new  tab (blank).</p>\n<p>The other settings available are the global footer settings. These include changing the color of the text and icons, the background color of the footer, the padding adding to the top and bottom of each item, the number of pixels (from the top) that the footer will show after scrolling, and the maximum view port size that will show this footer. There is also an option to enable/disable the footer, without having to deactive the whole plugin. The old settings will remain as they were when the footer is disabled.</p>\n",
