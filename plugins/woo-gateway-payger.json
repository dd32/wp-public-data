        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need to have a Payger account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Before using the plugin you will need to register on <a href=\"https://payger.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Payger</a> as Business. This will<br />\nallow you to generate a Key and Secret pair that would than be needed to configure the plugin and start showing crypto currencies as a payment option.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How will underpaid orders work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In case the payment is marked as underpaid, a new email with a new address is sent to the buyer so that he can complete the payment.<br />\nThe order will still be On-hold until the payment isn&#8217;t completed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is my order cancelled after 15 minutes without a payment?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>15 minutes is a Payger limit to finish a payment. Users will get a popup window after &#8220;Place Order&#8221; with a timer counter for 15 minutes.<br />\nOn that popup there will be all the information to make the payment. The buyer must copy the address or scan the QrCode to process the payment.<br />\nIf the buyer does not finish the payment within 15 minutes the order is cancelled. It&#8217;s exactly the same behaviour as if you define 15 minutes as your hold stock time.<br />\nFor that time the order will be &#8220;pending payment&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What to do if the order expires?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The buyer will need to select the products again and go to cart and checkout page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the stock restored if the order expires?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Order gets cancelled but the stock is not restored. As WooCommerce does not restores stock on cancellation we also don&#8217;t do it.<br />\nThere are already some plugins to reduce stock upon cancellation.</p>\n<p>The buyer will need to select the products again and go to cart and checkout page.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
