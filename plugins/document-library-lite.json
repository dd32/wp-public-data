It’s perfect for creating a WordPress document library, resource library, download management, file manager, audio library, video gallery, and much more.</p>\n<p>First, install the plugin and choose your settings at <strong>Documents &gt; Settings</strong>. This page gives you full control over the WordPress file manager including which columns to display, and the text of the document download button.</p>\n<p>Next, you can start adding documents at <strong>Documents &gt; Add New</strong>. The plugin automatically adds a &#8216;Document Library&#8217; page to your WordPress site. This page lists all your documents in a searchable, sortable table. Each file in the download manager appears as a separate row of the table, complete with helpful information such as the filename and summary description. This helps users to learn more about each document before downloading the file to their computer.</p>\n<p>For more flexibility, you can use the <code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode to list different downloads on different parts of your site. Use the <a href=\"https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-wordpress-documentation/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg#doc-library-shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shortcode options</a> to override the global settings and apply different options to each document library. And don’t forget, you can get dozens more shortcode options with our premium <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Document Library Pro</a> plugin!</p>\n<h3>Full List of Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add documents, document data, and upload a file for each document.</li>\n<li>Supports all file types.</li>\n<li>Built-in ‘Document Library’ page which automatically lists all your downloads.</li>\n<li><code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode for added flexibility.</li>\n<li>List documents in a table with sortable columns.</li>\n<li>Choice of 6 styles for your document download links including buttons, download icons, file type icons, and text.</li>\n<li>Instant AJAX search box to find documents more quickly.</li>\n<li>&#8216;Search on click&#8217; feature to filter the WordPress file manager by clicking on a document category.</li>\n<li>Display the number of documents in the table, and allow users to change this number.</li>\n<li>For easier WordPress document management, you can filter the Media Library to view document files only.</li>\n<li>Structure the download manager into categories.</li>\n<li>Choose the number of downloads per page in the document library.</li>\n<li>Optional lazy load setting to list unlimited documents with no performance limitations.</li>\n<li>Change how the WordPress document library is sorted, and customize the sort order for your file manager.</li>\n<li>Display the document featured image and allow users to open the image and view it in a lightbox.</li>\n<li>Configure your file manager centrally on the plugin settings page, and instantly update all your document lists (except where you have overridden specific options in the shortcode).</li>\n<li>Developed, maintained and supported by Barn2 Plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View the <a href=\"https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-wordpress-documentation/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin documentation</a> for full details.</p>\n<h3>Shortcode options</h3>\n<p>Options for the <code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>content</strong> &#8211; The columns to display in the document library. This can be any combination of the following (comma-separated): id, image, title, content, categories, or date.</li>\n<li><strong>doc_category</strong> &#8211; List downloads from a specific category only.</li>\n<li><strong>status</strong> &#8211; List documents based on their status (e.g. published/draft/private).</li>\n<li><strong>lightbox</strong> &#8211; Enable or disable the feature which opens document featured images in a lightbox modal window.</li>\n<li><strong>docs_per_page</strong> &#8211; Change the number of documents on each page of the library.</li>\n<li><strong>link_style</strong> &#8211; Choose the style of the document download links. This can be any of the following: button, button_icon_text, button_icon, icon_only, icon, or text.</li>\n<li><strong>lazy_load</strong> &#8211; List unlimited documents with no performance limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>sort_by</strong> &#8211; Override the sort order of the WordPress download manager library.</li>\n<li><strong>sort_order</strong> &#8211; Choose whether files are ordered alphabetically in ascending or descending order.</li>\n<li><strong>scroll_offset</strong> &#8211; If your theme has a sticky header then you can use this option to ensure that users are jumped to the correct point of the page when they use the pagination buttons at the bottom of the WordPress document library.</li>\n<li><strong>wrap</strong> &#8211; By default, if the document library contains too much text to fit on one row then it wraps onto multiple rows. If you prefer, then you can truncate the text and ensure that each download only takes up 1 row of the library. This helps to save space if you have a large download manager table.</li>\n<li><strong>search_on_click</strong> &#8211; Allow users to click on a category in the ‘Document categories’ column in order to filter the download library by that column.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example: <code>[doc_library doc_category=\"meetings\" content=\"title,content,link\" sort_by=\"date\"]</code><br />\nView the <a href=\"https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-wordpress-documentation?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg#doc-library-shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">full documentation</a>, check out the <a href=\"https://documentlibrary-free.barn2.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo</a>, and if you need more features then have a look at <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Document Library Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you for using our WordPress document library plugin 🙂</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20free%20wordpress%20document%20library%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does the free WordPress document library plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This free download and file manager plugin adds a &#8216;Documents&#8217; section to the WordPress admin. This is where you add and manage your downloadable files.</p>\n<p>Each document is added as a separate &#8216;Post&#8217; within the Document Manager. You add all the information that you want to display about the document, such as the title and a short description. Of course, you also upload a downloadable file. This is what people will click on in order to download the document to their computer/mobile device.</p>\n<p>Once you have added the documents to the library, they will appear in a searchable table on the front end of your website. They appear on a page called ‘Document Library’.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20information%20can%20i%20list%20in%20the%20document%20library%3F'>\nWhat information can I list in the document library?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To control which columns appear on the list of downloads, enter a comma separated list of the following options. You should enter this on the plugin settings page to set the columns for all your document libraries, or enter it as a shortcode option. For example, you might enter title, content, link to create a library containing 3 columns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>id</strong> &#8211; The document&#8217;s WordPress database ID.</li>\n<li><strong>title</strong> &#8211; The document title.</li>\n<li><strong>content</strong> &#8211; The document description or summary that you entered on the &#8216;Add Document&#8217; page.</li>\n<li><strong>image</strong> &#8211; The document&#8217;s featured image.</li>\n<li><strong>date</strong> &#8211; The date that the document was added to your WordPress site.</li>\n<li><strong>doc_categories</strong> &#8211; A comma separated list of the document categories.</li>\n<li><strong>link</strong> &#8211; A download button for each file.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20list%20all%20the%20file%20downloads%20on%20the%20same%20page%3F'>\nDo I have to list all the file downloads on the same page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The main ‘Document Library’ page will list all your documents, and you can delete this if you don’t need it. Instead, you can use the <code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode to list different documents in different parts of your WordPress website. For example, you can list documents by category.</p>\n<p>See the complete list of shortcode options above</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20maximum%20number%20of%20documents%3F'>\nIs there a maximum number of documents?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With the free WordPress document library plugin, the number of documents depends on the overall speed of your website and how good your hosting is. Most sites can happily list several dozen documents per page.</p>\n<p>If you want to list hundreds (or even thousands) of downloads on the same page, then we recommend upgrading to <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Document Library Pro</a>. This comes with built-in lazy load and caching options which allow you to list an unlimited number of documents without any performance issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20make%20the%20document%20library%20private%3F'>\nCan I make the document library private?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want a private WordPress file manager then we recommend using <em>Document Library Lite</em> with our other plugin, <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/password-protected-categories/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Password Protected Categories</a>. This lets you restrict access to any or all of your download categories.</p>\n<p>For example, you can make all the categories private, or show different categories to different people.</p>\n<p>For each category, you can:<br />\n* Make it password protected so that anyone with the password can see the hidden documents and download files.<br />\n* Restrict it to specific WordPress user roles only.<br />\n* Give access to specific logged in users only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20a%20demo%20of%20the%20download%20manager%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I see a demo of the download manager plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely!

It’s perfect for creating a WordPress document library, resource library, download management, file manager, audio library, video gallery, and much more.</p>\n<p>First, install the plugin and choose your settings at <strong>Documents &gt; Settings</strong>. This page gives you full control over the WordPress file manager including which columns to display, and the text of the document download button.</p>\n<p>Next, you can start adding documents at <strong>Documents &gt; Add New</strong>. The plugin automatically adds a &#8216;Document Library&#8217; page to your WordPress site. This page lists all your documents in a searchable, sortable table. Each file in the download manager appears as a separate row of the table, complete with helpful information such as the filename and summary description. This helps users to learn more about each document before downloading the file to their computer.</p>\n<p>For more flexibility, you can use the <code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode to list different downloads on different parts of your site. Use the <a href=\"https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-wordpress-documentation/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg#doc-library-shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shortcode options</a> to override the global settings and apply different options to each document library. And don’t forget, you can get dozens more shortcode options with our premium <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Document Library Pro</a> plugin!</p>\n<h3>Full List of Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add documents, document data, and upload a file for each document.</li>\n<li>Supports all file types.</li>\n<li>Built-in ‘Document Library’ page which automatically lists all your downloads.</li>\n<li><code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode for added flexibility.</li>\n<li>List documents in a table with sortable columns.</li>\n<li>Choice of 6 styles for your document download links including buttons, download icons, file type icons, and text.</li>\n<li>Instant AJAX search box to find documents more quickly.</li>\n<li>&#8216;Search on click&#8217; feature to filter the WordPress file manager by clicking on a document category.</li>\n<li>Display the number of documents in the table, and allow users to change this number.</li>\n<li>For easier WordPress document management, you can filter the Media Library to view document files only.</li>\n<li>Structure the download manager into categories.</li>\n<li>Choose the number of downloads per page in the document library.</li>\n<li>Optional lazy load setting to list unlimited documents with no performance limitations.</li>\n<li>Change how the WordPress document library is sorted, and customize the sort order for your file manager.</li>\n<li>Display the document featured image and allow users to open the image and view it in a lightbox.</li>\n<li>Configure your file manager centrally on the plugin settings page, and instantly update all your document lists (except where you have overridden specific options in the shortcode).</li>\n<li>Developed, maintained and supported by Barn2 Plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View the <a href=\"https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-wordpress-documentation/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin documentation</a> for full details.</p>\n<h3>Shortcode options</h3>\n<p>Options for the <code>[doc_library]</code> shortcode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>content</strong> &#8211; The columns to display in the document library. This can be any combination of the following (comma-separated): id, image, title, content, categories, or date.</li>\n<li><strong>doc_category</strong> &#8211; List downloads from a specific category only.</li>\n<li><strong>status</strong> &#8211; List documents based on their status (e.g. published/draft/private).</li>\n<li><strong>lightbox</strong> &#8211; Enable or disable the feature which opens document featured images in a lightbox modal window.</li>\n<li><strong>docs_per_page</strong> &#8211; Change the number of documents on each page of the library.</li>\n<li><strong>link_style</strong> &#8211; Choose the style of the document download links.

If you prefer, then you can truncate the text and ensure that each download only takes up 1 row of the library. This helps to save space if you have a large download manager table.</li>\n<li><strong>search_on_click</strong> &#8211; Allow users to click on a category in the ‘Document categories’ column in order to filter the download library by that column.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example: <code>[doc_library doc_category=\"meetings\" content=\"title,content,link\" sort_by=\"date\"]</code><br />\nView the <a href=\"https://barn2.com/kb/document-library-wordpress-documentation?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg#doc-library-shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">full documentation</a>, check out the <a href=\"https://documentlibrary-free.barn2.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo</a>, and if you need more features then have a look at <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=freeplugin&amp;utm_campaign=freepluginwporg&amp;utm_content=dlw-wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Document Library Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you for using our WordPress document library plugin 🙂</p>\n",
