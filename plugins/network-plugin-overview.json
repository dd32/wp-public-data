Having a large number of different sites in a network, it&#8217;s sometimes hard to determine which plugins are being used where. This plugin clearly highlights which plugins are not being used at all.</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; \"...if you are not using a specific plugin, delete it from the system.\"\n&gt; https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress#Plugins\n</code></pre>\n<p>When wordpress network installations get large and you want to know what&#8217;s where and what&#8217;s not needed, this plugin is the simplest solution.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use it on a single installation instead of a network?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, just go to &#8220;Plugins&#8221; in the admin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
