        "faq": "\n<h4>Can the redirect be instantaneous?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can set the wait time to 0 seconds, but by doing that people probably will not see your exit warning or advertisement.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can the text be styled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you know CSS the text the shortcode output is inside a div with the class wpexitcode. You should be able to style the div and text how you want.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin create the exit page for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this plugin makes it possible to redirect from the page/post you create in WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin have a block for the new WP 5 block editor?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, creating a block for this plugin would be a waste of time. Use a shortcode block in the new block editor to insert the shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will you be adding new features?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly in the future, but all new features will be for ClassicPress.net not WordPress and will be released through the ClassicPress plugin directory. This is the last version of this plugin for WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
