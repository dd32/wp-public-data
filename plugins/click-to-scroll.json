It uses only action hooks that is necessary for use in each theme and if your theme does not have these hooks, you have bigger problems.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to make modifications to my theme to use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No modifications is needed. The plugin will hook into your theme on activation and will be unhooked on deactivation (if you decide you do not need the amazing scroll-to-top button anymore).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set up the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin does not require any configuration. However, if you want to change the look of the button, you can go to Settings &gt; Click to Scroll and change button style settings as you will.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
