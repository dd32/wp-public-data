It provides a user-friendly interface to set up different shipping rates for different zipcodes.

This feature allows you to manage and update shipping rates in bulk, saving you time and effort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Default Shipping Rate: Define a default shipping rate for zipcodes that are not included in your custom shiprate table. This ensures consistent shipping costs for areas not explicitly configured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sample CSV File: The plugin provides a download button to get a sample CSV file that you can use as a template for importing your shiprate table. This makes it easier to format and structure your shipping data correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quantity Multiplier: The plugin includes a checkbox that allows you to multiply the shipping rate by the product quantity.
