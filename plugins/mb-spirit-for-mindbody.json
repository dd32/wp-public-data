You must<br />\nhave an account with BOTH MINDBODY and MB Spirit to use this plugin. If you already have a MB Spirit<br />\naccount, simply enter your account information under MB Spirit Settings.</p>\n<p>If you do not have an MB Spirit account, you need to register at https://mb-spirit.com. Start with a<br />\nfree trial with access to a demo account. This account will allow you to test MB Spirit and<br />\nconfirm the integration before signing up.</p>\n<p>When you are ready to integrate your data, you  authorize your MINDBODY account with MB Spirit. Once this is<br />\ndone you will have access to your MINDBODY content. WordPress will pre-fetch its content from MB Spirit ensuring fast<br />\nreliable data. MB Spirit users a powerful caching technology to render MINDBODY content instantly on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20cost%20to%20use%20mb%20spirit%3F'>\nIs there a cost to use MB Spirit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In addition to your MINDBODY account, you are registering your site with our API service (MB Spirit).<br />\nMINDBODY charges us on a monthly basis to provide this service to you. When you are using MB Spirit in the<br />\ndemo mode during the trial, there are no charges. Once you have authorized your MINDBODY account to get your<br />\nown data, these charges begin. We pay these charges on your behalf and charge you for use of the MB Spirit<br />\nservice. MB Spirit currently charges $20USD per location per month to provide the full service.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20like%20the%20options%20for%20presenting%20my%20content.%20is%20there%20a%20way%20to%20improve%20it%3F'>\nI don&#8217;t like the options for presenting my content.
