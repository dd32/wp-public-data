What&#8217;s the point of this one?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I created this plugin for a group of writers that needed to publish fiction online. Our requeriments were very specific; also, in these cases, deciding the proper structure of content and taxonomies is even more complicated than just deciding to use a custom post type.</p>\n<p>With a pre-cooked post type there is less need to set-up and configure anything, and since we use the same structure, we can share whatever we learn about how to improve it or connect it with common platforms (i. e. &#8216;robot&#8217; magazines).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;d love to have a similar plugin for a different kind of content</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! Start a thread in the forum to discuss what would be a good structure for that kind of content. Once I feel this plugin is polished I plan to merge it into a generic core with several premade post type templates.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
