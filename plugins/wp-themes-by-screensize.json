Do you</p>\n<p>a) design for greater than 1024 to exploit the width used by the 86%, and thereby risk annoying 14% of your visitors or do you</p>\n<p>b) design for less than 1024 and fail to exploit the maximum design area?</p>\n<p>With WP Themes by Screensize you can now do both. WP Themes by Screensize will allow you to determine which theme to display to the site visitor depending on their browser width. If the width is determined to be above a specific threshold, which you set, it will display one theme. If it is below that threshold, it will display a different one, giving you the opportunity to create a modified theme to use in each case.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses non identifying cookies and javascript… if either of these are not enabled the plugin degrades smoothly to the basic installed theme. The cookie period can be set to anything you want, so that if the user changes their browser size after that time, on the next page change the new settings are detected.</p>\n",

On the other hand, I wanted to be able to accomodate changes in browser size whiole someone was viewing the site. Setting the cookie duration will set the interval between checks. If it is set to say 60 seconds, the browser width will be checked on the first new page or page refresh after that time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
