But don&#8217;t worry, they are encrypted! Only you and any recipients you specified can decrypt them.<br />\nThe XQ Plugin supports html form assembly via the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"ugc\">CoBlocks</a> form builder that comes with your WordPress default installation. You can also create your forms by hand. </li>\n<li>You may not want the encrypted data to flow through our system and instead would prefer to handle the data flow yourself. In that case please uncheck this item and take a look at any of our <a href=\"https://github.com/xqmsg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">APIs</a> of the ecosystem built around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Zero Trust</a> that is available to you when using the XQ Message API.<br />\nOnce you choose to go your own route you also will have to write your own mapper function in order to format the data according to your needs. More on this below. </li>\n<li>Enter the email addresses of the people you want to be authorized to decrypt your form data.</li>\n<li>Enter the URL of a &#8220;thank you&#8221; or &#8220;goodbye&#8221; page to which you would like to redirect users after successful form submission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Screen 3: Confirmation</strong><br />\nThis page confirms that your API key was generated successfully so that your website can<br />\nnow communicate with XQ Message.</p>\n<p><strong>Screen 4: Clients</strong><br />\nThis screen concludes the installation process and contains useful Links to XQ Message<br />\nemail clients which can be used to make decrypting the forms content simpler.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

From here, you can easily remove the authorized user so they will no longer receive the form data.</p>\n<p><strong><em>On The Client</em></strong></p>\n<p>First off, when going through the process of generating a plugin designed to communicate with your own endpoint make sure the following is true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Let XQ send me Emails</code> is unchecked</li>\n<li>You selected one of the available output formats, i.e. either <code>Text</code>, <code>Json</code>, <code>XML</code> or <code>CSV</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon submitting your secure form the plugin gets to work.</p>\n<p>1) It will collect all form elements under the <strong><code>&lt;form&gt;</code></strong> tag, extract their names and values and create the payload,<br />\n      a string of key value pairs.</p>\n<p>2) A quantum key is generated and in order to encrypt that payload.</p>\n<p>3) The key will be uploaded to our servers and token is generated.<br />\n      The token will be neccessary later to download the encryption key.</p>\n<p>4) The payload to be posted to the endpoint,<br />\n      which you specified <code>&lt;form action=\"your-enpoint\"&gt;</code> using the format:</p>\n<p><em><code>\"payload\": {\"token\": &lt;the-token&gt;\",\"data\": \"&lt;the-encrypted-data&gt;\"}</code></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>On The Server</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>1 Authorization</em><br />\n   Before you can communicate with XQ you need to validate your identity using the email with which you registered at XQ Message during the plugin intallation process.</p>\n<p><em><code>call Authorize() with &lt;your-email&gt;</code></em></p>\n<p><em>2 Validation</em><br />\n   An email containing a validation PIN will be sent to that account. Send that PIN back to us using the CodeValidator class.</p>\n<p><em><code>call CodeValidator() with &lt;pin-sent-to-your-email-account&gt;</code></em></p>\n<p><em>3 Decryption</em><br />\n   Just pass payload, i.e the encrypted data and the token to the Decrypt( ) function and you are done.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why pass the token?&#8221; you may ask. This is needed to find your particular encyption key on our servers. Remember that this very token was returned on the client during the form submission process after successful upload of the encryption key to the server.</p>\n<p><em><code>call Decrypt() with &lt;token&gt; and &lt;data&gt;</code></em></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20out%20more%20detail%20about%20the%20apis%20%3F'>\nHow do I find out more detail about the APIs ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To learn more about the full power of our any of our APIs by clicking  <a href=\"https://github.com/xqmsg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
