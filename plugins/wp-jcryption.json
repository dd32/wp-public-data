On the very first activation 1024-bit RSA key pair<br />\nwill be generated and the list of forms the plugin is primarily destinated<br />\nfor will be saved. You may add other form IDs to this list on the plugin<br />\nsettings page: Settings &#8211; WP jCryption.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t use https on your site your password could be stolen through<br />\nman-in-the-middle attack when you are submitting log-in form because form data<br />\n(including password) are being sent as plain text. This plugin encrypts submitted<br />\ndata in a way similar to https transmission.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin encrypts transmission of my site pages entirely?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin encrypts only data being posted from most important forms<br />\n(that contain password fields: login, reset password, user profile)<br />\nand forms you specify additionally. To secure all incoming and<br />\noutgoing traffic of your site a SSL certificate is needed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have SSL certificate installed on my site already. Do I need to install the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I check whether the form data are being sent encrypted?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can do it by means of Firefox LiveHTTPHeaders extension, Fiddler or similar tools.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are system requirements for the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PHP version &gt;= 5.3 with OpenSSL PHP extension.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to generate RSA private and public key files with Linux commands?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. PHP generates keys for you and save them in a database. So, this plugin is usable on (almost) any shared hosting.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin works with login form but disables other form during it&#8217;s being submitted.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try to enable the plugin option: Fix button id=&#8221;submit&#8221; and name=&#8221;submit&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
