If you&#8217;re not, use the included templates as a reference and have fun.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why did you make this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The AgentPress Listings plugin has a lot more features and functionality than I needed for a couple of projects, so I thought I&#8217;d make a simple version which would allow my client to post their own listings on their own site, but optionally link to the outside MLS service listing. They can feature their own listings without having to re-enter all of the data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I start?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple Listings for Genesis works much like creating any other post or page in WordPress. One important thing is that when you are creating a listing, you must set a featured image. If you don&#8217;t, there is a fallback image, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you would rather use your own. Everything else is more or less optional&#8211;whether you want to use a description, an outside MLS link, transaction amount, or location.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
