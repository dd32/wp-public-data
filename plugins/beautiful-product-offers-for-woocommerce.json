Please follow these instructions to install and activate WBPO:</p>\n<p>Log in to your site’s Dashboard (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin)</p>\n<p>Click on the “Plugins” tab in the left panel, then click “Add New”.<br />\nSearch for “Beautiful Product Offers for WooCommerce” and the latest version will appear at the top of the list of results.<br />\nInstall it by clicking the “Install Now” link.<br />\nWhen installation finishes, click “Activate Plugin”.<br />\nYou’re done!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20any%20coding%20skills%20to%20use%20wbpo%3F'>\nDo I need any coding skills to use WBPO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not! You can configure your offers without any coding knowledge.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20with%20any%20wordpress%20theme%3F'>\nDoes It Work With Any WordPress Theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it will work with any WordPress theme as long as you are using WooCommerce plugin as your eCommerce platform.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20the%20free%20version%20installed%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nDo I Need to Have The Free Version Installed On My Website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Woo BPO Pro is an extension of the WooCommerce Beautiful Product Offers plugin, so you need to have the free version installed to get the PRO features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20pay%20full%20price%20when%20i%20upgrade%20my%20plan%3F'>\nDo I pay full price when I upgrade my plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You don’t pay the full price of the new plan when you upgrade. Indeed, because you already paid the smaller plan, you will only pay the difference prorated when you upgrade to a bigger plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20refunds%3F'>\nDo you offer refunds?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are not completely satisfied with WBPO Pro, you can request a refund within the first 14 days, and we will give you 100% of your money back – no questions asked.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
