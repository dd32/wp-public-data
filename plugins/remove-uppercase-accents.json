        "description": "<p>Remove Uppercase Accents is a WordPress plugin that automatically removes accented characters (currently greek) from elements having their text content uppercase transformed through CSS ( with <code>{ text-transform: uppercase; }</code> ). Currently the script transforms only greek text, but it can be easily extended to support other languages.</p>\n<p>Why you would need this: For example, in greek there are accent marks that denote in which syllable you put the stress on when pronouncing a word. However, when words are written in all UPPERCASE, those accent marks are removed. This rule is not followed by the aforementioned CSS rules, as they just use the corresponding uppercase unicode character.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically removes accented characters from text content uppercase transformed through CSS.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the Remove Uppercase Accents plugin to your website and activate it. </li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it. The plugin works out of the box and no special actions needed on behalf of the site administrator. You are encouraged to go to it&#8217;s Settings and check the available options.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20need%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy would I need this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For example, in greek there are accent marks that denote in which syllable you put the stress on when pronouncing a word. However, when words are written in all UPPERCASE, those accent marks are removed. This rule is not followed by the aforementioned CSS rules on some browsers, as they just use the corresponding uppercase unicode character.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20use%20%22text-transform%3Auppercase%22%20in%20greek%20text%20but%20i%20don%27t%20see%20any%20accents'>\nI use &#8220;text-transform:uppercase&#8221; in greek text but I don&#8217;t see any accents\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you use Firefox or a Chromium-based browser like Chrome, the new Edge, Opera etc., and you have set the site language to Greek, accents should be handled correctly. The problem appears on Safari and on older browsers like the Internet Explorer and everywhere if you have a site with mixed content and you don&#8217;t want to set Greek as the site&#8217;s language.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20use%20firefox%2Fchrome%2Fthe%20new%20edge%20but%20the%20problem%20appears%20there%20too.'>\nI use Firefox/Chrome/the new Edge but the problem appears there too.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Then your site&#8217;s language isn&#8217;t set to Greek. If your content is in Greek, you should set it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20%22exclude%22%20option%20works%20on%20javascript%20mode%3F'>\nHow does the &#8220;Exclude&#8221; option works on JavaScript mode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you have JavaScript mode set and the Exclude option enabled, the script will scan the styles of the page and build a list of the selectors containing text-transform:uppercase;. Then, this list gets compared with the selectors that you manually entered, and if there are matches, they get removed from the initial list.</p>\n<p>Therefore, in order for the Exclude option to work, you have to pass your selectors exactly as they appear on your CSS, for the matching to be successful (you can use your browser&#8217;s developer tools to do so).</p>\n<p>Include, on the other hand, will use your selectors as is and will skip entirely the page scanning, which allows you to use any selector you like.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
