While a backup is usually used for long-term data protection.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20wpvivid%20database%20snapshots%20do%3F'>\nWhat does WPvivid Database Snapshots do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WPvivid Database Snapshots enables you to create snapshots of your WordPress database and restore the database from a snapshot.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20snapshots%20stored%3F'>\nWhere are the snapshots stored?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Snapshots are stored in the same database for which the snapshots were made. Each snapshot has a unique prefix for it&#8217;s tables.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20download%20snapshots%3F'>\nIs it possible to download snapshots?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t offer a direct download option for snapshots. However, you can download snapshots by making a backup of the snapshots tables using WPvivid Backup Pro, then downloading the backup of the snapshots.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20wpvivid%20database%20snapshots%20have%20a%20limit%20on%20snapshots%20retention'>\nWhy does WPvivid Database Snapshots have a limit on snapshots retention\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is because snapshots take up database space, too many snapshots may slow down the site, especially on shared web hosting.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wpvivid%20database%20snapshots%20have%20a%20limit%20on%20the%20database%20size%3F'>\nDoes WPvivid Database Snapshots have a limit on the database size?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, WPvivid Database Snapshots does not have a limit on the database size and theoretically works for websites of any sizes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20provide%20support%20for%20the%20free%20version%3F%20where%3F'>\nDo you provide support for the free version?
