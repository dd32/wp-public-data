At each page visit, the plugin checks if there are already &#8220;sells&#8221; are generated for today.<br />\nIf no &#8220;sells&#8221; were already generated, the plugin will automatically generate &#8220;sells&#8221; for each time period you entered in the settings-menu. The generated &#8220;sells&#8221; are randomly determined between the minimum and maximum value from the settings-menu. That means &#8220;sells&#8221; are<br />\ngenerated every day when the first visitor visits your homepage!</p>\n<p>After that check the plugin sums up all sells until the actual time and will replace the content [salescheater] with the output message.</p>\n<h4>Are sells the same every day?</h4>\n<p>No, because sells are generated through a random method!</p>\n<h4>Where can i change the displayed text</h4>\n<p>In the Admin-Panel there is the SalesCheater Menu. Please go to settings and change the text template. You can insert there your html-code you want. Also you can use follwing variables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>%SC_DATE% &#8211; Displays the actual date</li>\n<li>%SC_SELLS% &#8211; Displays the sells until now</li>\n</ul>\n",
