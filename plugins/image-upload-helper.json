It doesn&#8217;t actually do anything by itself. To use it in a plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Include this plugin (in its entirety) in a subdirectory of your plugin. It plays nice with other<br />\nplugins; if a site has multiple plugins activated, each with its own copy of Image Upload Helper, only<br />\none will load.</li>\n<li><code>require_once( 'image-upload-helper/image-upload-helper.php' );</code></li>\n<li>Call <code>image_upload_helper()</code> wherever you want an upload dialog available.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>image_upload_helper()</code> function takes an array of arguments to control exactly what the form<br />\nlooks like.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>field_name</code> &#8211; Required. The name of the form field that will be submitted. Defaults to<br />\n&#8220;image-upload-helper&#8221;. Use this to customize the field to fit in with your form. By changing<br />\nthe <code>field_name</code> value, you can call <code>image_upload_helper()</code> as often as you like on each page.</li>\n<li><code>thumbnail_id</code> &#8211; The attachment ID of the current value of the field.</li>\n<li><code>label</code> &#8211; The label to use for the field. Defaults to &#8220;thumbnail image&#8221;. This will<br />\ndisplay as &#8220;Set thumbnail image&#8221; or &#8220;Remove thumbnail image&#8221; in the form, or &#8220;Use as<br />\nthumbnail image&#8221; in the iframe dialog</li>\n<li><code>size</code> &#8211; The size of the image you want displayed in the form. Defaults to &#8220;post-thumbnail&#8221;.<br />\nIf you want to display a custom size, make sure you register it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a form is submitted with an Image Upload Helper field, the field specified by the <code>field_name</code> argument<br />\nwill contain the attachment ID of the selected image.</p>\n",
