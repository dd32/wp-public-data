        "description": "<p>This plugin can be used to customize php settings for you wordpress installation.</p>\n<p>The plugin will modify either the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file or <strong>.user.ini</strong> file in order to change the current php settings directly from within the settings page.</p>\n<p>Since the configuration file needs to be modified this file <strong>must</strong> be writable for this plugin to work as expected.</p>\n<h4>Apache module</h4>\n<p>When PHP is running as an Apache module the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file will be used to set customized settings; make sure so that this file <strong>exists</strong> and is <strong>writable</strong> by the webserver.</p>\n<h4>CGI/Fast-CGI</h4>\n<p>If instead PHP is running in CGI/Fast-CGI mode then a custom INI file will be used. The name of this file depends on the value of <strong>user_ini.filename</strong> in the php configuration, by default it is <strong>.user.ini</strong>.<br />\nYou can check the name of you custom INI file in the <strong>PHP Information</strong> table. The custom INI file should be placed under the root folder and <strong>most</strong> be <strong>writable</strong> by the webserver.</p>\n<p>Notice that there is also a <strong>User INI file cache TTL</strong> value in the information table, this value tells how long the custom INI file will be cached before it gets reloaded.<br />\nFor instance, if this value is set to 300 then any changes to your custom INI file will not be reflected for up to 5 minutes. The name for this setting in the php configuration is <strong>user_ini.cache_ttl</strong>.</p>\n<p>One important thing is to make sure that your <code>.user.ini</code> file is blocked by your webserver. If you are running NGINX this can be done by adding:</p>\n<pre><code>location ~ /\\.user\\.ini {\n  deny all;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>to your server configuration. The same thing using Apache is done by adding the following to the configuration if not already done:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Files .user.ini&gt;\norder allow,deny\ndeny from all\n&lt;/Files&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Available Settings</h4>\n<p>The settings table will display all non-system php settings that can be customized by the plugin. All modified settings will be displayed in red in this table.</p>\n<p>Some settings might be displayed in red because they are changed somewhere else, perhaps through a customized php.ini file, by wordpress itself, a plugin or in some other way.<br />\nFor instance if you have enabled <strong>WP_DEBUG</strong> in your <strong>wp-config.php</strong> file the <strong>error_reporting</strong> setting will turn red.</p>\n<p>If you have questions or perhaps some idea on things that should be added you can also try <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/cyclonecode/shared_invite/zt-6bdtbdab-n9QaMLM~exHP19zFDPN~AQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">slack</a>.</p>\n<h4>Multiple Configurations</h4>\n<p>The premium version adds support for creating multiple named configurations which all can hold their own custom PHP settings.<br />\nYou will then be able to easily switch between the different configurations entries applying them to you configuration file.</p>\n<h4>Environment Variables</h4>\n<p>In the premium version, when running PHP as an apache module and using an <strong>.htaccess</strong> file for configuration, you are able<br />\nto add custom environment variables. These will be accessible by using the super global <strong>$_SERVER</strong> array.<br />\nIn order for this to work you will need to have the mod_env module enabled in your apache setup.</p>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<p>A complete list of settings that can be modified can be found here: <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">List of php.ini directives</a><br />\nNotice that directives marked as <code>PHP_INI_SYSTEM</code> can not be modified.</p>\n<h3>Warning</h3>\n<p>Make sure you know how a value should be configured and what different settings do before changing anything.<br />\nThis is important since some settings might render your page inaccessible, depending on what value you are using.<br />\nA good example of this is the <strong>variables_order</strong> configuration:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sets the order of the EGPCS (Environment, Get, Post, Cookie, and Server) variable parsing. For example, if variables_order is set to &#8220;SP&#8221; then PHP will create the superglobals $_SERVER and $_POST, but not create $_ENV, $_GET, and $_COOKIE. Setting to &#8220;&#8221; means no superglobals will be set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this value would be configured to <strong>EPCS</strong> then no <strong>$_GET</strong> superglobal would be set which would make your page inaccessible.</p>\n<p>Another example is setting the <strong>post_max_size</strong> to a very low value so that no form data is sent to the server, which in turn would result in that form data is never saved.</p>\n<p>If you by mistake changed some value and your site is now inaccessible you could simply manually remove everything from between the plugin markers in your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file:</p>\n<pre><code># BEGIN CUSTOM PHP SETTINGS PRO\nphp_value variables_order EPCS  &lt;-- Remove\n# END CUSTOM PHP SETTINGS PRO\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If you run into any trouble, donâ€™t hesitate to add a new topic under the support section:<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-php-settings/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-php-settings/</a></p>\n<p>You can also try contacting me on <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/cyclonecode/shared_invite/zt-6bdtbdab-n9QaMLM~exHP19zFDPN~AQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">slack</a>.</p>\n",
