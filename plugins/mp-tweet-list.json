It is fully customizable, allowing you to choose the widget title, how many tweets to display and which user&#8217;s tweets to display. It also allows you to choose whether or not to convert @mentions, #hashtags and links independent of eachother. You can also filter out direct replies and add the timestamp to each tweet.</p>\n<p>This plugin supports up to two Twitter users at the same time. Many blogs and websites have multiple authors and you may want to display two users&#8217; tweets that is where the MP Tweet List comes in handy. If you only want to display one Twitter user, simply leave the second user field blank.</p>\n<p>The widget does not require any javascript or external files to work. It generates pure HTML lists.</p>\n<p>As of June 11th, 2013, Twitter ended the use of its API 1.0 which allowed access to tweets without authentication. The Twitter API 1.1 requires authentication to access tweet data and therefore only Version 3.0 or greater of the MP Tweet List will continue to work.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>\nCan I display x number of tweets from user1 and y number of tweets from user2?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, no. This plugin will evenly distribute the number of tweets displayed. For example, if 10 is selected &#8211; user1 will show 5 tweets and user2 will show 5 tweets. If 9 is selected &#8211; user1 will show 4 tweets and user2 will show 4 tweets. Contact Mike@MikesPickzWS.com to request this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nTweets are no longer showing up on my website, why?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please upgrade to Version 3.0 due to Twitter API changes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
