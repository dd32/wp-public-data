It works nicely and integrates well with Microsoft Office and Windows. Previously it was known as Skydrive.</p>\n<p>One problem is that Onedrive does not easily provide direct-download links for the files located on onedrive. Suppose you would like to share a document that exists on your Skydrive.  You click the &#8220;share&#8221; button, and Skydrive gives you a link which you can then embed into any web page.</p>\n<p>But, that link is not a direct-download link for the file you intend to share. The actual download link will be embedded <em>within that page</em>. Clicking the &#8220;share&#8221; link provided by onedrive takes the user to onedrive, where they need to click another link to download the document.</p>\n<p>This is fine, but perhaps not as convenient as it could be for users, in some cases.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows a wordpress blog to eliminate that extra hop.<br />\nIt automatically convert links to Onedrive documents into direct-download links.</p>\n<p>The way it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You login to Onedrive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select the file you would like to share.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the &#8220;share&#8221; button. (see screenshot #1)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy (ctrl-C) the link for that particular file.  Don&#8217;t use the URL shortener.

In fact that is the entire reason this plugin exists. Set the cache period for the plugin to set the lifetime of any link. Generally, I&#8217;ve found that links are good for at least an hour.</p>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin relies on jQuery.</li>\n<li>Therefore the user viewing your wordpress blog must have browser side Javascript enabled.</li>\n<li>The publisher of the target document must have a Onedrive account.</li>\n<li>The wordpress host must allow outgoing http connections.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would anyone use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Onedrive is a nice service that allows people to host files &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;. It&#8217;s also possible to share some of those files with others. But Skydrive doesn&#8217;t provide an easy way to get a direct-download link for a file that you want to share.</p>\n<p>This plugin lets you do that. It lets you embed a link to a file hosted on skydrive, into any wordpress page or post.  Then viewers will be able to download that file without first connecting directly to the skydrive site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this plugin really work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Warning: geek-speak ahead.</p>\n<p>The plugin is implemented in two pieces.  There is some browser-side Javascript logic, and some server-side PHP logic.</p>\n<p>On the server side, the plugin tells wordpress to append a small javascript module in each page that is rendered. This Javascript module contains client-side logic that relies on jQuery. It scans the rendered page for any anchor tags decorated with the class &#8216;skydrv-hotlink&#8217;.  Upon finding one, it sends an AJAX request to admin-ajax.php, which is a page on the wordpress site. If the client-side logic finds no specially-marked anchor tags, then nothing further happens.</p>\n<p>The skydrv-hotlink plugin registers with wordpress to receive the<br />\nrequests from the client-side logic. Upon receiving such a request,<br />\nWordpress routes the incoming request to the plugin. The plugin checks<br />\nthe cache for the requested link. If it is not available in cache, the<br />\nplugin retrieves the full download page from Onedrive, scrapes the<br />\nresulting HTML page, and extracts the hidden direct-download link. The<br />\nplugin then returns the direct-download link to the javascript logic<br />\nrunning in the browser, as a json blob.</p>\n<p>The javascript in the browser then replaces the href tag in the anchor with the direct download link.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if, for whatever reason, the plugin fails?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is designed so that if the lookup of the direct-download link fails, the original anchor (A tag) continues to work with its original href. In the case of failure, when the user clicks the A link, instead of getting a direct-download, he will visit the usual Onedrive download page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to define a css class called &#8216;skydrv-hotlink&#8217;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s used as a marker for the plugin. You need not attach any css<br />\nstyling to that class name. You can do so if you like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to style my anchor tags with a different class?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can specify multiple classes on html tags.  The syntax is like this:</p>\n<p><a href='http://ksk' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8230;</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can viewers of the site detect that the plugin is in use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Generally, no. A savvy user could examine the source of your wordpress page and see the client-side javascript that does the replacement of hrefs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t this plugin use a shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just a design choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The approach used by this plugin results in faster page loads. The<br />\nreplacement of regular share links with direct download links <em>can</em><br />\nrequire a call out to Microsoft Onedrive, which can take several<br />\nseconds. Doing this on the server-side with a shortcode would simply<br />\nadd those several seconds to the page render time that the user sees.</p>\n<p>But this plugin perfoms the replacement of the href on the<br />\nbrowser-side, using client-side javascript. This replacement occurs<br />\nafter the page has been loaded and rendered. Only the href changes,<br />\nand that happens with no discernable UI update. The result is a faster<br />\npage load time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Also, the approach used by this plugin is also more reliable than a<br />\nshort code. Here&#8217;s why: if for any reason the connection to onedrive<br />\nfails, the anchor link will remain unchanged, pointing to the regular<br />\nshare page on onedrive.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin perform caching?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. On the server side, the plugin caches links and re-uses them.  You can specify the lifetime of the cache in the admin back-end. Caching allows the pages to render more quickly. It will also reduce the number of outbound http connections initiated by your wordpress site, which is a good thing in general.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the cache stored?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The direct links are cached in files in a subdirectory of the wp-content directory.<br />\nThe subdirectory is named skydrv-hotlink-cache . The cache files are very small, around 128 bytes each. There will be at most one cache file per hotlinked file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will I be charged a fee by Onedrive if I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. As far as I know, Onedrive is free.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will I be charged a fee by my hoster if I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. The plugin makes outbound http connections. Most hosters allow this, and don&#8217;t charge a fee for data transmission. If you&#8217;re not sure, check with your hoster.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to do anything special on Onedrive to make this work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to set permissions on the file to be downloaded, to make it publicly accessible. Consult the help for Onedrive to understand how to do this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is the AJAX stuff implemented?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses the recommended wordpress practice of registering an<br />\naction word with admin-ajax.php.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can any user access the AJAX request that provides direct download links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin verifies that the request for download links comes from one of the posts or pages of your blog. It uses WordPress API check_ajax_referer() to do so.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
