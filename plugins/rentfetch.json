Each one has a floorplan listing including availability, image gallery, location map, and more!</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Native WordPress content types are used for everything, so a developer can create their own layouts.</li>\n<li>Google maps integration (both for the property search and for use on each property page. To use this, you&#8217;ll need to set up an API key for the Google Maps Javascript API at <a href=\"https://maps.googleapis.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">maps.googleapis.com</a>)</li>\n<li>Sliders to show property images, floorplan images, and nearby properties (we use the MIT-licensed <a href=\"https://blaze-slider.dev\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Blaze Slider</a> for these, and you don&#8217;t need to set up anything for these to work)</li>\n<li>Your floorplans can display <a href=\"https://my.matterport.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Matterport</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">YouTube</a> tours.</li>\n<li>TONS of hooks, letting you (or your developer) customize to your heart&#8217;s content. The single layouts for both floorplans and properties can be fully replaced by the theme, and we have lots of helpful functions to let you grab preprocessed information for display.</li>\n<li>This plugin works with both single-property websites and websites that showcase hundreds of properties.</li>\n<li>Mini search capability</li>\n</ul>\n",
