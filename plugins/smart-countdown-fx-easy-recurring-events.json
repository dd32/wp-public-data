        "description": "<p>Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events <strong>requires <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-countdown-fx/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Countdown FX</a> version 1.3 or higher</strong>, please do not forget to update before proceeding.</p>\n<p>Up to four independent recurrence patterns can be defined. Supported patterns are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hourly &#8211; every 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 12 hours starting from a given time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Daily &#8211; every day at a given time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Weekly &#8211; every week on chosen week days (more than one day can be selected) at a given time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly &#8211; every month on a given date at a given time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly by week day &#8211; every month on a given week and day (e.g. first monday, last saturday, second friday, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Yearly &#8211; every year on a given month and date at a given time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other features</strong></p>\n<p>When configuring Smart Countdown FX or adding a shortcode to you post you can choose one of or both recirrence patterns defined in &#8220;Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events&#8221; configuration. The opition to use both patterns will merge events from each recurrence into a single timeline. Of course you can merge any kind of patterns but mostly this feature serves for creating different schedules for week days and weekends in a combined &#8220;Weekly&#8221; pattern.</p>\n<p>All events in a recurrence pattern have the same duration which can be set in &#8220;Duration&#8221; option in plugin configuration. When recurring events are imported the widget will show countdown to the next scheduled event and after event starts it will show &#8220;In progress&#8221; (or whatever title you set for &#8220;count up&#8221; mode) while event is in progress (i.e. during the interval set as &#8220;Duration&#8221;). After that the counter will automatically start countdown to the next event.</p>\n<p>Overlapping events are also supported.</p>\n<p>For samples and complete list of features <a href=\"http://wp.smartcalc.org/recurring-events/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see this page</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page. Open &#8220;Settings&#8221; and configure recurrence pattern(s)</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How does one use the shortcode, exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Actually there is a single shortcode &#8211; &#8220;import_config&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wp.smartcalc.org/recurring-events/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://wp.smartcalc.org/recurring-events/</a> &#8211; complete list of attribute values for this shortcode has been provided to answer this exact question.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have installed the plugin, but the counter doesn&#8217;t appear in available widgets list.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Do not forget to install and activate the main plugin &#8211; Smart Countdown FX.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have configured the widget but it is not displayed.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please, check &#8220;Counter display mode&#8221; setting in the widget options. If &#8220;Auto &#8211; both countdown and countup&#8221; is not selected, the widget might have been automatically hidden because the event is still in the future or already in the past. If you are using &#8220;Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events&#8221; plugin check that &#8220;Import events from:&#8221; setting is correct. Then go to &#8220;Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events&#8221; settings and make sure that recurrence pattern selected in &#8220;Import events from:&#8221; is not set to &#8220;Disabled&#8221;.<br />\n<strong>Linking a widget to a disabled recurrence pattern will hide the counter because no events will be found</strong></p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have inserted the countdown in a post, but it is not displayed. What&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the spelling of &#8220;fx_preset&#8221; attribute (if you included it in attributes list). Try the standard fx_preset=&#8221;Sliding_text_fade.xml&#8221;. Also check &#8220;mode&#8221; attribute. Set in to &#8220;auto&#8221;. If you are using &#8220;Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events&#8221; plugin check that import_config attribute is correct, e.g.: import_config=&#8221;scd_easy_recurrence::1&#8243; to use the first pattern. Then go to &#8220;Smart Countdown FX Easy Recurring Events&#8221; settings and make sure that recurrence pattern in Configuration 1 is not set to &#8220;Disabled&#8221;.<br />\n<strong>Linking a widget to a disabled recurrence pattern will hide the counter because no events will be found</strong></p>\n</p>\n\n",
