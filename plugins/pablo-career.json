In case of not smarty can not generate the templates. Check out your server logs. Maybe the plugin has some conflicts with another plugin. In this case, copy the thrown error and feel free to contact me on github or via mail info[at]bl0m[dot]de</p>\n<h4>How can I customize the Plugin-Templates</h4>\n<p>The templates are stored in the <code>templates</code> folder inside the smarty directory beneath the plugin dir. Pablo Career uses Smarty3 which simplifies making changes to the templates. For detailed information about smarty 3 visit the <a href=\"http://www.smarty.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official smarty project page</a></p>\n<h4>How can I edit the Plugin-Styles</h4>\n<p>The Plugin-CSS is located in the <code>/public/css</code> directory inside plugin dir.
