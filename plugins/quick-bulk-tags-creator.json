Anyway copy the list of tags, and try to insert it again this time the plugin would insert the tags that were not inserted in the first round.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if i tries to insert tags that are already in the database?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whenever you try to insert tags the plugin will tell you the number of tags that were successfully inserted, and will show you a list of tags that were not inserted &#8211; so you can know which tags where already there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the use of that PHP Callback optional function?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This function will be called on each tag you insert, allowing you to progrmatically modifiy the slug or the name of the tag.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why i can&#8217;t edit the filter-tags file directly in the settings page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the securirty of your website i made the view of that file a read-only view.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i use this plugin to add terms from other taxonomies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the moment this plugin works only with tags, however it is easy to customize it to work with other taxonomies. If i see requests for such a feature i may add it in the future.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
