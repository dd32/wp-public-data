With custom statuses you can define your own post statuses and assign it to the success or failure path of the workflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Process history lets users retrace their steps</strong><br />\n &#8211; For auditing purposes a record is created every time an article is routed through a workflow process. The process history also captures the comments added by the user during task sign off.</p>\n<p><strong>Reassign &#8211; How to pass the buck?</strong><br />\n &#8211; What if you have been assigned a workflow task, but you feel you are not the appropriate person to complete it?
