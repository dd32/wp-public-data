Once you set up these custom usernames, each time someone tries to register to your WordPress blog/site providing this targeted username, the registration process is getting bailed and the user gets an error message.</li>\n<li><strong>Restrict specific emails:</strong>You can add specific email addresses ( example me@example.com) and they will be automatically ignored and rejected from user registration process.</li>\n<li><strong>Restrict emails from specific domain:</strong> This one can also be an anti-spam tool. Before digging into details about this one, an email service provider is the website (domain name) that follows @ in the email address. An example is gmail.com from Google, you can add these service providers domains and they will be ignored and restricted as well. An example is adding outlook.com to ignore all registrations using an email address ending in @outlook.com ( that&#8217;s a secure one by the way, from Microsoft.)</li>\n<li><strong>Custom error messages:</strong>You can set up custom error messages so that the users trying to register and getting bailed will then know what the issue is and what to do for better experience.</li>\n<li></li>\n<p>If you liked the plugin, please consider rating it, leaving a review, and sharing with others.</p>\n<p>You can use the plugin&#8217;s support section here for your support threads.</p>\n<p>Please try to contact me through <a href=\"http://samelh.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my website</a> if ever you want to get in touch.</p>\n<p>We have great upcoming plugin projects, <a href=\"http://go.samelh.com/newsletter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">join our mailing list</a> to get them first!</p>\n",
