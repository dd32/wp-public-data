However, you require a strategy to ensure that your samples reach the target customers and establish loyalty.<br />\nHere are a few ways in which eCommerce stores are using sample products:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show a sneak peek to the customers into your broad range of offerings with easily consumable and impressive samples</li>\n<li>Launch new and riskier products to a new audience in the market and gauge the reaction of customers by launching free samples</li>\n<li>Get easy feedback and product reviews from customers regarding your products by giving them samples</li>\n<li>Accurately interpret the wants and needs of customers by tracking which samples are ordered the most</li>\n<li>Establish your brand as customer-centric by giving out samples of products that are popular in your store</li>\n<li>Conduct sample product giveaways and offers for recurring customers, and upsell the real product in their next order</li>\n<li>Create a loyal consumer base by offering free products on a timely basis</li>\n<li>Offer samples on bulk orders to ensure the customer comes back again</li>\n<li>Encourage customers to place larger orders by offering sample WooCommerce products after the cart exceeds a certain amount</li>\n<li>Offer samples for high-end products, and encourage customers to try out the more expensive products in your store</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Product Sampling Campaign</h3>\n<h4>A 4-step process to design and launch an effective product sampling campaign for your WooCommerce store</h4>\n<p><strong>Set Realistic Goals</strong><br />\nEstablish realistic goals and objectives for your campaign</p>\n<p><strong>Select Your Target Audience</strong><br />\nSelect a target audience and type of key consumers towards whom you want to direct your campaign marketing</p>\n<p><strong>Decide the Right Time for Campaign Launch</strong><br />\nSet a period for your campaign, i.e., close to festivals, holidays etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Provide Post-launch Updates to Customers</strong><br />\nFollow up on the experience with post-purchase updates after sending out samples</p>\n<h3>Increase Customer Loyalty</h3>\n<h4>Encourage your customers to become recurring buyers</h4>\n<p>Customers directly affect your brand&#8217;s performance and its ability to do well. Therefore, they need to interact with your product before spending money on it.</p>\n<p>Several brands miss out on potential customers by not opening up their products. As a brand, you cannot expect your audience to take your word and order the expensive products you are offering.</p>\n<p>Product samples for your WooCommerce store can be just what you need as they can be a perfect segue to building a loyal consumer base. Customers can try your products at minimum to no cost and choose ones that fit their requirements.</p>\n<p>You can offer personalized recommendations to improve consumer confidence and increase the chances of getting recurring, long-term buyers for your WooCommerce store.</p>\n<h4>üëâ DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LITE AND PRO VERSION</h4>\n<p>Check the detailed difference between the Pro and Lite ‚Äì <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/product-sample-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here</a></p>\n<h3>üíÅ Contact Us or Submit Support Ticket</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free plugin:</strong> Need Technical Help? &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/free-product-sample/\" rel=\"ugc\">Click here</a></li>\n<li><strong>Pro Plugin:</strong>  PRE-SALE Questions &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.thedotstore.com/collection/470-product-sample\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Help Document</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>EXPLORE OUR OTHER PLUGINS TO SUPERCHARGE YOUR WEBSITE:</h3>\n<h3>üëâ Premium WooCommerce Plugins list</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/flat-rate-shipping-plugin-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Flat-rate shipping plugins for WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-extra-fees-plugin/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Extra Fees Plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-advanced-product-size-charts/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Advanced Product Size Charts For WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/hide-shipping-method-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Hide Shipping Method For WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-product-attachment/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Product Attachment For WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-anti-fraud/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Blocker ‚Äì Prevent Fake Orders And Blacklist Fraud Customers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-enhanced-ecommerce-analytics-integration-with-conversion-tracking\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Enhanced Ecommerce Google Analytics for WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/product/woocommerce-category-banner-management/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Category Banner Management for Woocommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-product-finder/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Product Finder For WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/mass-pages-posts-creator/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Mass Pages Posts Creator For WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-conditional-discount-rules-for-checkout/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Conditional Discount Rules For WooCommerce Checkout</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-checkout-for-digital-goods/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Checkout For Digital Goods</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/advance-menu-manager-wordpress/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\">Advance Menu Manager For WordPress</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>üëâ  Some of our other free WooCommerce plugins:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-shipping-display-mode/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Shipping Method Display Style for WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/min-and-max-quantity-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Minimum and Maximum Quantity for WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/commenting-feature/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Multicollab ‚Äì Google Doc-Style Editorial Commenting for WordPress<br />\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/multipurpose-block/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener ugc\">Multipurpose Gutenberg Block</a></li>\n</ol>\n",
