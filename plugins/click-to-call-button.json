        "description": "<p>Research has proven <strong>click to call buttons on mobile friendly websites raise conversions, increase revenues and customer satisfaction</strong>. The easier you make it for your visitors to call you the more times your phone will ring, it really is that simple!</p>\n<p>This plugin was built to help get my own phone ringing. It soon became something more powerful which could answer the phone, record calls, take voicemail when I wasn&#8217;t around and automatically reply to text messages.</p>\n<h4>Basic version</h4>\n<p>This &#8220;<strong>Click to Call Button</strong>&#8221; / &#8220;<strong>Call Now Button</strong>&#8221; plugin will show an icon to your visitors on mobile devices which makes it easy for them to call you.</p>\n<p>This link uses the &#8216;<em>tel</em>&#8216; link protocol which instructs mobile phones to prompt the user to confirm their intent to call, here&#8217;s an example link:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;tel:+447987654321&#x22;&#x3E;Call Me!&#x3C;/a&#x3E;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The button can be styled with options for different colors; curves on corners, transparency / opacity plus control over where it is placed.</p>\n<p>The settings page for the plugin lets you specify what days and times the button should be displayed on your site; it then uses JavaScript to show and hide itself automatically.</p>\n<p>You can choose to show the button the moment a page loads or you can wait thirty, sixty or ninety seconds before making it visible.</p>\n<p>The button will automatically include Google Analytics <em>onclick events tracking</em> so you can monitor the number of calls you get.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re only running the basic version of the plugin the button will be hidden on large screen browsers. That&#8217;s the biggest limitation of all the click to call and call now button plugins which use the tel link protocol: they don&#8217;t work on desktop machines with fully featured browsers like Chrome! That&#8217;s why I wrote some advanced options into the plugin to overcome that restriction.</p>\n<h4>Advanced version</h4>\n<p><strong>The advanced options of the plugin turns your website into a telephone with call recording, voicemail and SMS / text message features thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/docs/api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twilio API</a>.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Please note: you do not need a Twilio account to use the basic features of the plugin, only the advanced ones.</em></p>\n<p>Using <strong>WEBRTC</strong> (<em>web real time communications</em>) it is possible to turn browsers into telephones which enable your users to click and call from their computer, no additional software is required, the user simply clicks the icon and grants your website access to their microphone, see screenshots.</p>\n<p>Within moments the phone number you set in the options will start ringing and you&#8217;ll be able to chat with your visitor; the only difference is instead of them using a phone to call you they&#8217;re using the microphone and speakers on their computer to chat with you.</p>\n<p>The user doesn&#8217;t have to fill in any forms as they call through their computer; this gives them instant satisfaction waiting for a callback; they don&#8217;t need any extra software and most modern browsers are supported. If your user&#8217;s browser does not support the features needed to make a phone call through the web the button will be hidden from their view.</p>\n<p><strong>Advanced features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inbound Call Handler</strong> You can point an unlimited amount of Twilio numbers to the plugin and have them forward calls to the number you set; see the settings page for the Request URL you need to configure your numbers with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Call Recording</strong> Call recording can easily be enabled or disabled. This records both calls through the website button and inbound phone calls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Answering Machine / Voicemail</strong> When you are unable to take a call the built in answering machine will ask your callers to leave a message. This also works on both the button and inbound phone calls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SMS and email notifications</strong> Get recordings of calls and voicemail messages sent to you by SMS text message, email or both.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Control the plugin by SMS</strong> If you point a SMS capable Twilio Number to the plugin you will be able to turn the service on and off by texting <em>on</em> or <em>off</em> to that number. See the settings page for the Request URL to point your numbers to. This gives you control over the button when you&#8217;re away from your desk; at the airport departure lounge or just playing golf!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SMS forwarder</strong> You can point any number of SMS capable Twilio numbers at the plugin and each time someone texts your number they will receive your default reply and you&#8217;ll get their message forwarded on to you by SMS, email or both. This tiny feature turns your site into an SMS to email client and makes it easy to get your inbound text messages sent to an inbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SMS Keywords to PHP Functions</strong> The first word of any inbound text message is called a &#8216;keyword&#8217;, the plugin maps keywords to PHP functions which make the text message gateway flexible and extensible. Start your function names with ctcb_sms_ followed by the keyword, for example: ctcb_sms_hello, this function would then be executed each time you received a message starting with the word hello.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Action Hook&#8217;able</strong> There are action hooks at the core points in the plugin so that you can write your own plugins to extend the functionality of this one.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need a Twilio account to show the basic button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You only need a Twilio account if you want to take advantage of the advanced features in the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the icon?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I wanted to keep the icon uniform on all the sites that use the plugin in the hope that end users will be able to associate the button with the ability to call through the web; that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not actually an option to change the icon. However, if you really want to change the icons just replace the two files in the plugin&#8217;s images directory and you should be sorted. The icons used are 32px by 32px and came from <a href=\"http://www.flaticon.com/search/phone\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Flat Icon</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m not seeing the button, why not?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the basic version of the plugin and are viewing your site on a desktop computer or laptop through a fully featured browser you will not see the button as it is only visible on mobile devices. Check your site on a mobile and you should see the button.</p>\n<p>If you still don&#8217;t see the button when viewing the site on a phone check that the plugin is enabled then check the hours of business, it could be that you&#8217;re trying to view the button outside those hours.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I format / enter my phone number?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to enter all phone numbers on the settings page in full international format including the plus sign at the start, for example: +12345678909 or +447987654321.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/phone-numbers/how-do-i-format-phone-numbers-to-work-internationally\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twilio Guide to Formatting International Phone Numbers</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the browser requirements to turn it into a phone?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-client/what-are-the-minimum-system-requirements-for-twilio-client\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Minimum Web Browser Requirements for Twilio Client</a>.</p>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-client/which-browsers-support-webrtc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Which browsers support WebRTC?</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I record my own voiceovers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can record your own voice prompts or hire a professional voiceover to record them for you.</p>\n<p>The details below include details of the file names used and the suggested wording; please record your files in mp3 format (<em>44,100 / mono</em>) and make sure your file names match: this will ensure the system can use the files.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Voiceover files and script</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>thank-you.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>Thank you</em>&#8221; This is played through the browser when a visitor to your website has clicked your click to call button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>hello-and-thank-you-for-calling.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>Hello and thank you for calling</em>&#8221; This is played down the phone to anyone who calls one of your Twilio numbers which has a request URL pointing to the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>about-to-connect.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>I will try to connect your call</em>&#8221; This is played before the plugin attempts to connect the call to the number you specified in the settings page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>calls-are-recorded.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>Please note all calls are recorded</em>&#8221; This is only played when you&#8217;ve chosen to record calls through the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>im-sorry.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m sorry</em>&#8221; This is played when something hasn&#8217;t gone to plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>closed.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>Lines are currently closed</em>&#8220;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>no-answer.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>There was no answer</em>&#8220;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>cant-connect.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>I was unable to connect your call</em>&#8220;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>engaged.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>That number is busy</em>&#8220;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>please-leave-your-message-after-the-tone.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>Please leave your message after the tone, you&#8217;ll have sixty seconds, remember to include your name, mobile number and email address</em>&#8221; This is only heard if you have voicemail enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>thank-you-for-calling-and-goodbye.mp3</strong> &#8220;<em>Thank you for calling and goodbye</em>&#8220;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once you have your recordings store them in a folder with a name that makes sense, for example: custom-voice-recording-files, then upload that folder to the audio directory, navigate to the plugin&#8217;s settings page and you will see the voiceover in the list, select the voice you want to use and save your settings.</p>\n<p>To test your new recordings just click your button or place a call to any Twilio number which has a request URL of the plugin and you should hear the new prompts you just added to the system.</p>\n<p>Please note: deleting the plugin will also delete any custom recordings you upload.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the &#8216;SMS Keyword to PHP Functions&#8217; feature work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first word of any received text message is called the &#8216;keyword&#8217; and upon receipt of a message the plugin will check to see if there&#8217;s a function for that keyword; this means the plugin doubles up as a powerful text message / SMS gateway which can perform almost any task.</p>\n<p>You can create your own custom functions in your WordPress site&#8217;s functions.php file, these functions need to start <strong>ctcb_sms_</strong> followed by your keyword, for example if the user sent &#8220;<strong>DISCOUNT</strong>&#8221; the script would check to see if a function named <strong>ctcb_sms_discount</strong> exists, if it does it will reply to the user with the return of the function.</p>\n<p>An example function for the keyword DISCOUNT:</p>\n<pre><code>function ctcb_sms_discount(){\n return \"Show this text in store to get a 10% discount on your next order!\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of the POST values from the Twilio request are available to your function, core values are &#8216;From&#8217; which is the international format mobile number which sent the text to you; plus &#8216;Body&#8217; which is the full contents of the message the user sent. The Body value can be exploded by a space to give you all the individual words used in the message; this opens up further possibilities, for example &#8216;WEATHER LONDON&#8217; or &#8216;WEATHER PARIS&#8217; could connect to a remote API and return the forecast for the city which formed the second word.</p>\n<p>If there is no keyword function set the plugin will automatically respond to the user with the contents of the default reply value from the settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can the plugin be made to do X / Y / X?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin is extensible through action hooks at core points in the execution; this makes it easy for you to build your own plugins around this plugin without having to touch the core code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you make it do X / Y / X for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be happy to help extend the plugin for you. <a href=\"https://andymoore.info/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get in touch</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
