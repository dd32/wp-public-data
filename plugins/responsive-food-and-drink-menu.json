        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the un-zipped directory to the &#8220;/wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Now you are ready to create your first menu by going to &#8220;Menus&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Add New&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: How do I display the menu on my website?<br />\nA: You accomplish this using shortcodes. Shortcodes are super handy tools that allow you to display complex content quickly and easily. You simply copy and paste the supplied shortcode anywhere you want &#8211; a post, a page, a widget, or anything else.</p>\n<p>For non-PDF menus, use this shortcode where you choose an individual menu to display in your chosen layout: [display_menu p=1234] (REMEMBER TO USE YOUR ID IN PLACE OF &#8220;1234&#8221;). Remember to choose your layout on the edit page of the menu. The default is the &#8220;Classic&#8221; layout.<br />\nFor PDF menus, use this shortcode to display all your menus where you choose a layout: [display_pdf_menus]</p>\n<p>The default is layout 1 &#8211; Full Width, but all of these are vaild:<br />\n[display_pdf_menus]<br />\n[display_pdf_menus layout=1]<br />\n[display_pdf_menus layout=2]<br />\n[display_pdf_menus layout=3]</p>\n<p>Q: What kinds of layouts are available?<br />\nA: Regular Menus have 3 layouts &#8211; A classic menu look, A menu displaying your menu&#8217;s featured image, and a modern grid layout.</p>\n<p>PDF Menus have 3 layouts too &#8211; A full width layout, a grid layout with circular images, and a grid layout with square images</p>\n<p>Q: My menus are in PDF format, can I still use this plugin?<br />\nA: Yes! Use our &#8220;PDF Menu&#8221; post type to use your existing PDF menu on your website.</p>\n<p>Q: What kind of settings or customizations are available?<br />\nA: Once the plugin is activated, from the dashboard, you can navigate to &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;RFADM Display Options&#8221; to customize the menu display. This page lets you choose which HTML tags to use for each menu&#8217;s various pieces. It is not recommended to change these unless you are familiar with HTML and your theme&#8217;s CSS rules. In case you need them, the default values are:<br />\nMenu Title       &#8211; h3<br />\nMenu Header      &#8211; p<br />\nSection Title    &#8211; h4<br />\nItem Title       &#8211; p<br />\nItem Price       &#8211; h5<br />\nItem Description &#8211; h6<br />\nMenu Footer      &#8211; p</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>1.0 Initial Release</p>\n<p>1.1 General bugfixes</p>\n<p>1.2 Added item images and descriptions to the menu</p>\n<p>1.3 Bugfixes and css updates to the UI on the admin side</p>\n<p>2.0 Major update.
