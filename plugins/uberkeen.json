        "faq": "<h4>Why does the plugin require an external server to function?</h4>\n<p>In order to communicate with another person (i.e., peer) via a web browser, each person&#8217;s web browser must agree to begin communication, know how to locate one another, bypass security and firewall protections, and transmit all multimedia communications in real-time.<br />\nA signalling (external) server is therefore required to achieve all of those tasks. In addition, encryption is mandatory for all WebRTC communications. All the communications are encrypted using Datagram Transport layer Security (DTLS), which is a derivative of SSL. DTLS is build in to all browsers that support WebRTC. In short the keys for the peer-to-peer SSL connection are generated by the peers and exchanged over the signalling protocol. The Peers use a self signed certificate (asymmetric-key) based on RSA to exchange the symmetric keys they will use for the communication.</p>\n<h4>Is WebRTC safe to use?</h4>\n<p>Yes, all the communications are encrypted using Datagram Transport layer Security (DTLS), which is a derivative of SSL.</p>\n",
