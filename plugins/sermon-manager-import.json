When you use a media player (e.g. iTunes, Windows Media Player, etc.) the title, artist, etc. is stored within each file in the ID3 format.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I get a `Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded`</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Likely you are importing a lot of sermons. Refresh the page and import all of the remaining sermons again. Repeat as necessary if that doesn&#8217;t do it. Your server is set to run a process for limited time. When importing many sermons, you reach this limit and the server lets you know.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work with Amazon S3 or other services?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not sure.
