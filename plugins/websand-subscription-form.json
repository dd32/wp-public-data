You can have multiple widgets with different source codes &#8211; just drag new widgets from the left column of the <em>Appearance &gt; Widgets</em> page and add them to the theme areas on the right &#8211; each widget has it&#8217;s own settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My question is not listed</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please head over to the <a href=\"http://websand.helpscoutdocs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Websand knowledge base</a> for more detailed documentation.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
