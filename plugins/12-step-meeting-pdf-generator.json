The day listings are a font size +2.</li>\n<li>Header Font Size: font size in header text, if a header text is used</li>\n<li>Margin: This is the margin around the edge of each page.</li>\n<li>Automatically determine optimum font size: This will attempt to determine the largest font can be used to get the desired page count. works only for columns formats</li>\n<li>Use Custom Meeting HTML: This will determine if the meeting text will use the custom HTML</li>\n<li>Meeting HTML: This is the custom HTML that will be used to create each meeting text. For each item you want listed, use the variables listed to the left. for example if you enter <strong>title</strong> (note, 2 underscores on either side), when the meeting is rendered, it will replace that text with the actual title of the meeting.</li>\n<li>Header Text: (column layout only) This is text that will show up at the top of each page, not each column. So this sometimes doesn&#8217;t look good to have this populated once you fold the list.</li>\n<li>Column2 Indent: This is the amount the pdf will indent to allow for the time. This might need to be changed if you change font size</li>\n<li>HTML before meetings: (column layout only) This is anything you want printed before the meetings. this section can end up being insde a fold once you fold up your meeting list.</li>\n<li>HTML on Specific Column: this section allows you to specify a column to put some html. this lets you fold your list funky ways\n<ul>\n<li>enabled: this enables or disables this feature</li>\n<li>page number: this determines which page number has the custom column html (page numbers start at 1)</li>\n<li>column number: this determines what column number has the custom column html (column numbers start at 1)</li>\n<li>note that if the page and column numbers are not reached during parsing of meetings, the column html will not be included</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>HTML after meetings: (column layout only) This is anything you want printed after the meetings. This section can end up being the front of a folded meeting list.</li>\n<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: the HTML before and after meetings is rendered a div at a time, put all formatting inside your divs. A div will not be split across two columns</li>\n<li>Column Count: (column layout only) How many columns you want printed, normally 3 or 4</li>\n<li>Column Padding: (column layout only) How much of a margin you want around EACH column. this can be helpful so the meeting text doesn&#8217;t end up on a crease once the list is folded.</li>\n<li>Starting Page Number: (table layout only) Let&#8217;s you choose starting page number if you have other pages you will attach</li>\n<li>Include Type Index: (table layout only) Let&#8217;s you include type index at the end of pdf</li>\n<li>Save a copy of File: Do you want a copy of the file automatically saved to the server</li>\n<li>File Name: path &amp; name of file to save.

The optimal font size is the size at which adding 0.1 to it would make a page greater than your desired page count.<br />\nI use this to make a 2 page list, so I can print it double sided and use a single page.<br />\nWhat it does:<br />\n* takes the currently set font size and makes a pdf and sees how many pages it is<br />\n* If the page count is equal to or less then the desired page count, it increases the font size a certain amount<br />\n* If the page count is greater than the desired page count, it decreases the font size a certain amount<br />\n* Once it increases and decreases it will find the largest font size that will fit on the desired page count<br />\n* This can take 30-60 seconds since it is making multiple PDF&#8217;s to check sizes<br />\n* Once it determines the optimal font size, it sets that font size in your settings, and makes your PDF</p>\n</p>\n\n",
