        "installation": "<p>Instructions for implementing the plugin can be found at https://www.fantasynerds.com/wordpress</p>\n<p>First things first &#8211; you&#8217;ll need to download and activate the FN plugin. From the WordPress Administration screen, click on &#8220;Plugins&#8221; and look for the Fantasy Football plugin. When you find it, click the Activate link.</p>\n<p>In order for the plugin to talk to FantasyNerds.com, you&#8217;ll need to create and pay for an API key. This key allows your plugin to tell us who you are, what services your account has access to, and allows us to monitor the resources used so that we can continue to provide a responsive platform for everyone.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have an account at FantasyNerds.com, you&#8217;ll need to create one, but don&#8217;t worry &#8211; it&#8217;s quick and easy. If you already have an account, you&#8217;ll need to sign in to either get your key or to generate one.  Please Note: If you do not generate an API key, the plugin will return test data. Test data can be useful for making sure that the plugin works, but you&#8217;ll want to get an API key to return live data.</p>\n<p>Next, add your API Key to WordPress. Once you have your API key, go back to your WordPress Administration screen and click on the Settings option. From there, look for the &#8220;FN Settings&#8221; link.</p>\n<p>Enter your API key into the appropriate box and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;. Congratulations &#8211; you&#8217;ve just installed the FantasyNerds.com WordPress plugin! Now it&#8217;s time to start plugging it into your website!</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does it cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit https://api.fantasynerds.com for current pricing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20an%20api%20key%20and%20why%20do%20i%20need%20one%3F'>\nWhat is an API key and why do I need one?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An API key is a unique string assigned to you that lets the WordPress plugin talk to FantasyNerds.com. It lets us know who is asking for information, what info they want, and how we should return it. Creating an API key is easy.  If you do not have an API key, the WordPress plugin will return cached, test data which can be useful for testing but not so useful in a production environment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20mention%20that%20the%20data%20comes%20from%20fantasy%20nerds%3F'>\nDo I have to mention that the data comes from Fantasy Nerds?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope &#8211; in fact we&#8217;d prefer that you didn&#8217;t. The plugin is designed to be seamlessly integrated into YOUR website, not ours. There is absolutely no mention of Fantasy Nerds in the content.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
