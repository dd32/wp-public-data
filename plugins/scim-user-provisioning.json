Users&#8217; feeds will be synchronized from the Identity Provider to your WordPress site instantaneously or in a time interval set in your IDP.<br />\nOur SCIM Automated User Sync/Provisioning plugin also allows real-time provisioning with custom Providers. Our User Sync/Provisioning (Auto Provisioning) plugin works with any IDP that conforms to the SCIM standard.</p>\n<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>\n<h3>PHP</h3>\n<p><strong>Minimum PHP version: 5.4.0</strong></p>\n<h3>PHP HTTP Authorization Header enable</h3>\n<p>Most of the shared hosting has disabled the <strong>HTTP Authorization Header</strong> by default.</p>\n<p>To enable this option you&#8217;ll need to edit your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file adding the following code</p>\n<pre><code>RewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)\nRewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]\n</code></pre>\n<h4>WPENGINE</h4>\n<p>To enable this option you&#8217;ll need to edit your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file adding the following code</p>\n<pre><code>SetEnvIf Authorization \"(.*)\" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Bitnami</h3>\n<p>To enable this option you&#8217;ll need to edit your <strong>/opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/conf/htaccess.conf</strong> file adding the following line.</p>\n<p>You can also check this issue using this link https://community.bitnami.com/t/need-to-pass-authorization-headers/44690</p>\n<pre><code>SetEnvIf Authorization \"(.*)\" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Why do you need SCIM User Sync/Provisioning-WordPress plugin?</h3>\n<p>If your team uses Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, G-Suite, or Centrify for employee/User provisioning, you can use SCIM User Sync/Provisioning integration to automatically keep your WordPress employee directory/Users in sync. The SCIM push-based system treats the IdP directory as your source of truth. When changes are made in IdP, they push immediately to WordPress, so you need not worry about the WordPress employee/User directory being out of sync.</p>\n<p>Note: You can manually create new employees/users or add employees/users from other locations while maintaining your directory sync. This feature is helpful for contractors, temps or other people who may host visitors/receive deliveries but are not core team members.</p>\n<p><strong>PRE-INTEGRATED IDPs FOR PROVISIONING</strong></p>\n<p>miniOrange provides pre-integrated IdPs for many applications like Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, G-suite / Google Apps, Centrify, JumpCloud, Keycloak, miniOrange IDP, and Custom Providers. Once you configure the SCIM base URL and Bearer token in your SCIM capable Identity providers (IdPs) they can use the SCIM User Sync/Provisioning plugin for WordPress sites to update, create, delete, deactivate users automatically within seconds. (Auto User Provisioning).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SCIM user sync/provisioning plugin works with JumpCloud and G-Suite.You can always <a href=\"https://www.miniorange.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact Us</a>, or Email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@xecurify.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">info@xecurify.com</a> and we would be happy to help you out in setting up user-provisioning with SCIM supported IdP.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Free Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Create Users</strong>:  You can create users by using the SCIM User Sync/Provisioning plugin supporting IdP (eg Okta, OneLogin AzureAD , Centrify and G-Suite), and then you can sync those users (user create) as configured  in IdP either real-time or one can schedule the Identity-life</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unlimited Users</strong>: There is no restriction for the number of users to be updated to your WordPress site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-time provisioning</strong>: Real-time provisioning permits you to update recently created or updated Identity Authentication clients without physically running a task, or waiting for a scheduled one. This proves to be useful for situations that require coordinated provisioning, similar to client self-enrollment that needs immediate system access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pre-configured IDPs</strong>:  Since SCIM is a standard protocol one can use any SCIM supporting IdP. SCIM User Sync/Provisioning provides pre-integrated IdPs like Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, and miniOrange IdP. The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard for securely synchronizing user (user sync tool) information between multiple applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Premium Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Includes all the Free version features</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delete Users</strong>: The removal of access privilege and system resources for an employee, User, business partner for your WordPress website. It is a security process that removes access of a system to an end-user along with their data in WordPress site when you de-provision the same user in your IdP.  (User delete)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use-case: one can use this feature when a user leaves a company/organization to remove her/his data from your WordPress site.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deactivate Users</strong> or <strong>Soft delete</strong>: Deactivating a user makes a user inactive or ineffective which means that the user will not be deleted from the system but will no longer be able to log in to your WordPress website and their records can be transferred to another user.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use-case: One can use this feature when the admin wants to deny access to the WordPress site but this keeps the user data in the WordPress database.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Update Users</strong>: This integration allows you to automatically (Automated User Provisioning / Auto user provisioning) update the users and groups for your WordPress Website when you make updates in your identity provider. Attributes like firstName, lastName,  are automatically updated ( Auto provisioning ) in the user&#8217;s profile when there are any changes in these attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom attribute mapping</strong>: This feature allows to sync custom attributes sent by IdP in WordPress. We also give the option to show these attributes in the User table list.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT</strong></p>\n<p>miniOrange has various types of deployments that give the customer a safe and protective choice. We provide a reliable plugin with extended functionality in a cost-beneficial manner. Our SCIM Auto User Provisioning for WordPress sites carries a lot of features within it like modifying, creating, deleting, deactivating users.
