        "description": "<p>It is a simple plugin that you can put on your Movie Review Pages and will inform your website users where to watch the movie online after they read your review.</p>\n<p>The design of the plugin is simple and adapts to the design of your website. It has a poster and a list of options to stream the movie or tv show online.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat is FlickZee?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FlickZee is a search engine which helps users find where to watch a movie online.<br />\nMany of us have a few Movies or TV Shows in mind that we want to watch but don&#8217;t know which streaming option will have it. Then we end up seeing something else or mindlessly login and search on all the streaming options we have subscribed to.</p>\n<p>FlickZee comes to the rescue in such situations.<br />\nFlickZee gives a list of all the paid and free platforms where a movie or tv show is available, that too with a single search.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are over 40 online streaming options available in India like Netflix, PrimeVideo, Hotstar, Airtel TV, JioCinema, ErosNow, Zee5, Voot.</p>\n<p>Out of these, we have data for 23 streaming services, for Movies &amp; TV Shows from Hollywood &amp; Bollywood, which cover 99% of the users with an online subscription.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is the ‘Where-to-Watch’ Widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Problem:<br />\nA user comes on your website, reads the reviews and other information about a movie and now wants to watch the movie online. It has to go back to Google to find where they can watch that movie online.</p>\n<p>Even on google, it is not easy to get this information as Google doesn&#8217;t list all the available options, sometimes, not even the popular ones.<br />\nTo log in and search on every portal is a tedious effort.</p>\n<p>Solution:<br />\nThe Where-to-Watch widget tells your users where is that movie currently available online, Netflix, PrimeVideo, Hostar &amp; 22 other platforms.</p>\n<p>Without leaving your site, the user reads about a movie, decides if the movie is worth watching and gets the information about where to watch it as well.</p>\n<p>Thus, more quality time is spent on your site and the user’s experience is enhanced.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy a dedicated widget for this purpose?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can get this data from our site or search it online and put it in your articles.<br />\nHowever, the list of movies available on these services changes every few weeks &amp; a movie gets available online 2-3 months after its release in the theatres.</p>\n<p>So you will have to manually update the list by searching for every movie on 23 portals and update it as a movie gets added or removed on a streaming service.<br />\nWith our widget, this list gets updated in real time by just adding the code at the time of publishing of the article.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does the host site get in it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The users on your website are frequent movie watchers and repeatedly come to your site because they like your content.<br />\nDespite the reviews being available from big players like News18, TOI, Indian Express etc. they come to your website because they like your content.<br />\nFor these users, the experience is an important factor to keep them sticking around your product and this widget will be another help towards that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWill I get paid for implementing this widget on my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you will. Not right now, but we promise you there will be money for you in future.<br />\nCurrently, we don&#8217;t have affiliate marketing tie-ups with Netflix, PrimeVideo, Hotstar, Zee5 etc. and these tie-ups will happen after we reach a certain scale.<br />\nAs we tie-up with them, we will start paying you for the traffic you send to these services.</p>\n<p>At present, we won&#8217;t be able to pay you for keeping this widget but if you stay with us long enough, there is money in it for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy is FlickZee giving this service?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As a part of our mission to help people watch good entertainment, we are giving this service to make it easier for Movie Buffs to watch the movies they like.</p>\n<p>However, if the user clicks on the icon of ‘Netflix’, ‘Zee5’, ‘Hotstar’, he will be sent directly to their website, not on FlickZee.<br />\nA View More button appears if the number of items is more than 3. This button takes the user to our website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nAny Restrictions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because of the content and competitiveness restrictions, you won&#8217;t be able to use this widget more than once on a single page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWill it affect the performance of my Website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it won&#8217;t. The elements of this code render asynchronously, that is after the whole website has loaded.</p>\n<p>If you need any help in changing any part of the widget &amp; tweaking it as per your website, please send us a mail at divyanshu@flickzee.com.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
