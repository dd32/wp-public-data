        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the contents of this zip file to your `/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; folder, or use the built-in Plugin upload tool.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>To configure the cache plugin, see the screenshots.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Where is the options page?</h4>\n<p>You can configure all the options using the &#8216;Shopp Cache Helper&#8217; entry in the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu. Usually the default options are all you need to get started. In fact not many of the options really need to be configured, except possibly the option to flush the cache when Shopp product data is changed. If you want to flush the cache manually whenever you change Shopp<br />\nbackend data (eg Product, Category, etc), just uncheck this option.</p>\n<h4>How do I configure it with W3 Total Cache?</h4>\n<p>You no longer have to do anything &#8211; Shopp Cache Helper will update W3 Total Cache settings automatically.<br />\nAll you have to do is activate this plugin, and Shopp will be completely configured to work with the W3 Total Cache page cache.</p>\n<h4>How do I configure it with (Some other caching plugin)?</h4>\n<p>Currently this plugin automatically integrates with W3 Total Cache. To configure for other caches, do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell your caching plugin to not serve cached pages when the cookie is detected (default cookie is &#8216;shopp_items_in_cart&#8217;) </li>\n<li>Tell your caching plugin to never cache the pages listed in the &#8216;No-cache paths&#8217; setting of this plugin.</li>\n<li>Make sure your caching plugin honours the &#8216;DONOTCACHEPAGE&#8217; constant. Currently W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache are known to honour this constant.</li>\n</ul>\n",
