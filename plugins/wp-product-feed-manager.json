I started with the free version that allowed me to create just a feed for Google Shopping. That worked well. Then I needed to create some additional feeds so I purchased the Pro version which I feel was reasonably priced. I did need to turn to support for assistance on different feed issues along the way and in each instance they successfully responded in one business day. Overall, the &#8216;WooCommerce Google Feed Manager&#8217; plugin is reliable and so is their customer support.</p>\n<p>@fredgerendasy</p>\n<p><strong>Essential for any e-commerce and outstanding support.</strong><br />\n  This plugin is really essential for any shop that wants to be reliably listed by Google.<br />\n  This has become a critical component of my business strategy and when bug appeared after using this plugin smoothly during years, Michel was here and allowed me to keep running my business.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your work!</p>\n<p>@poissonvert</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>WHY WooCommerce Google Feed Manager?</h3>\n<p>Are you grappling with the complexities of managing your WooCommerce product feed for Google Shopping?

I started with the free version that allowed me to create just a feed for Google Shopping. That worked well. Then I needed to create some additional feeds so I purchased the Pro version which I feel was reasonably priced. I did need to turn to support for assistance on different feed issues along the way and in each instance they successfully responded in one business day. Overall, the &#8216;WooCommerce Google Feed Manager&#8217; plugin is reliable and so is their customer support.</p>\n<p>@fredgerendasy</p>\n<p><strong>Essential for any e-commerce and outstanding support.</strong><br />\n  This plugin is really essential for any shop that wants to be reliably listed by Google.<br />\n  This has become a critical component of my business strategy and when bug appeared after using this plugin smoothly during years, Michel was here and allowed me to keep running my business.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your work!</p>\n<p>@poissonvert</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>WHY WooCommerce Google Feed Manager?</h3>\n<p>Are you grappling with the complexities of managing your WooCommerce product feed for Google Shopping?
