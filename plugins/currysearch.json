But CurrySearch does not find it yet!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CurrySearch re-indexes your content once a day.<br />\nBut you also have the option to manually re-index for every change of content.<br />\nGo to Settings -&gt; CurrySearch to do that that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Something is not working as expected!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact us or create an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/CurrySoftware/CurrySearch-WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CurrySearch GitHub Repository</a>. We will be happy to help you!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How long does CurrySearch take to index my content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have fewer than 1000 posts: in a matter of seconds.<br />\nIf you have fewer than 10000 posts: in a matter of minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which post types are indexed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default &#8216;post&#8217; and &#8216;page&#8217; types are indexed. But you can set these yourself.<br />\nGo to Settings -&gt; CurrySearch to do that.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
