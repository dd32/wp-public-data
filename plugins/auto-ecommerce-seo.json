Donations would help!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are you releasing this for free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because most SEO agencies focused on small businesses are overpriced.  Why pay $400+ dollars a month for someone to do a few hours of basic SEO work?  By releasing this plugin for free, it will hopefully force greater accountability from SEO agencies that are focused on volume rather than quality.  That being said, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t turn down a donation!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to contact you.
