        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>native-lazyload</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory or download it through the WordPress backend.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Where are the plugin&#8217;s settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not have a settings screen. Just by activating it, the plugin will work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I prevent an image or iframe from being loaded lazily?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add a class <code>skip-lazy</code> to indicate to the plugin you would like to skip lazy-loading for this image or iframe.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin still loads an extra JavaScript file! I don&#8217;t want that.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is perfectly fair. Note that the plugin only loads the JavaScript file as a fallback for when the user&#8217;s browser does not support the native <code>loading</code> attribute yet. The file includes logic to still autoload the image in a non-native way. If you prefer to purely rely on the <code>loading</code> attribute and not provide any fallback, you can easily disable it by adding a line <code>add_filter( 'native_lazyload_fallback_script_enabled', '__return_false' )</code> somewhere in your site&#8217;s codebase.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work with AMP?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you use AMP, you don&#8217;t actually need this, since AMP intelligently lazy-loads media out of the box. Still, the plugin is built in a way that it will not break AMP compatibility, just to make sure.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where should I submit my support request?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For regular support requests, please use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/native-lazyload\" rel=\"ugc\">wordpress.org support forums</a>. If you have a technical issue with the plugin where you already have more insight on how to fix it, you can also <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wp-native-lazyload/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open an issue on Github instead</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I contribute to the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have some ideas to improve the plugin or to solve a bug, feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request in the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wp-native-lazyload\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github repository for the plugin</a>.
