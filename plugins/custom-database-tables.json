        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>custom-database-tables</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Navigate to the Custom DB Tables submenu in setting menu</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Now you can easily start creating custom table in database of WordPress</p>\n<p>If needed, please install the legacy version any it is from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-database-tables/developers/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>.<br />\nAlso, lastest legacy version is <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/custom-database-tables.1.1.15.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">1.1.15</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can not activate the latest plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin must be working environment of PHP 5.4 since version 2.<br />\nPlease use the version 1 system in previous environment of PHP 5.3.<br />\nYou can be downloaded <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-database-tables/developers/\" rel=\"ugc\">past versions from here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin create table on direct mysql?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, can create tables in a MySQL database and manage that&#8217;s tables while use this plugin.<br />\nHowever, in the current version plugin can connect to only a MySQL database was installed of WordPress, yet. In other words, it can connect only a MySQL database connection settings are defined in &#8220;wp-config.php&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there any limit of the scope of the table?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need a table that is managed by the plug-in is an &#8220;ID&#8221; is the primary key. The column that contains the update date and registration date of the line will also be necessary. Column These keys are added automatically when you create a table.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can put table that have 100,000 or more rows?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no particular restriction on the amount of data that is stored in a table. Processing performance on a table with a large number of rows will depend on the structure such as a table or database server.<br />\nHowever, you should enable the &#8220;Ajax Loading&#8221; in the shortcode&#8217;s options if you want to handle the table that has a large amount of data by the shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What should we do when there is not displayed the data via shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In most cases, that&#8217;s cause of the jQuery file conflict. Therefore please try to do procedures as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;General Settings&#8221; tab on the &#8220;CDBT Plugin Options&#8221; screen.</li>\n<li>Uncheck the checkbox of &#8220;jQuery&#8221; in the &#8220;Front-end Screen&#8221; column at the &#8220;Loading Resources&#8221; item of the &#8220;Advanced Plugin Settings&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: you should change in the &#8220;Administration Screen&#8221; column at above step 2 If the same trouble is occurred in the tables management screen.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do we use the shortcode at the outer the post content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The shortcodes of this plugin basically work within the post content. If you want to work the shortcodes outside of the post content (as direct built-in template, or in the widget), you should insert code below.</p>\n<pre><code>if ( ! is_admin() ) {\n  global $cdbt;\n  add_action( 'init', array( $cdbt, 'cdbt_pre_shortcode_render' ), 10, 2 );\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How can we protect the &#8220;wp-admin&#8221; directory by using as like &#8220;.htaccess&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because this plugin is working all Ajax processing via the &#8220;wp-admin/admin-ajax.php&#8221;, only that file in the &#8220;.htaccess&#8221; must have been to be able to access.<br />\nIn that case, please add a description of the following to the &#8220;.htaccess&#8221; under the &#8220;wp-admin&#8221;.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;FilesMatch \"(admin-ajax.php)$\"&gt;\n  Satisfy Any\n  Order allow,deny\n  Allow from all\n  Deny from none\n&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How shall we act on if using custom permalink structure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you use this plugin on the site that has custom permalink structure as like &#8220;your-domain/custom-path/wp-admin&#8221;, you should add code of filter hook below.</p>\n<pre><code>function my_cdbt_shortcode_custom_component_options( $component_options, $shortcode_name, $table ){\n  if ( is_admin() &amp;&amp; $shortcode_name === \"cdbt-edit\" ) {\n    $component_options['actionUrl'] = admin_url( str_replace( '/wp-admin', '', $component_options['actionUrl'] ) );\n  }\n  return $component_options;\n}\nadd_filter( 'cdbt_shortcode_custom_component_options', 'my_cdbt_shortcode_custom_component_options', 10, 3 );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
