        "faq": "\n<dt id='this%20plugin%20is%20free%20to%20use%20%3F'>\nThis plugin is free to use ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Using this plug-in is free. However, the service offered by our company is based on a contract. The terms and conditions of the contract are negotiated individually.</p>\n<p>After signing the contract, the client will receive a set of credentials (username and password). With these credentials, the customer will be able to use the Sameday Courier<br />\ndelivery service.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20plugin%27s%20source%20code%20%3F'>\nCan I make changes to the plugin&#8217;s source code ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. However, keep in mind that if you make changes to the source code of the plugin you can no longer benefit from the updates we make constantly. Because in a situation like this in case of an update your changes would be overwritten.</p>\n<p>NOTE: We encourage customers to fork our GitHub repository and contribute with their ideas<br />\nLink to GitHub: https://github.com/sameday-courier/woocommerce-plugin</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20all%20easybox%20delivery%20services%20available%20%3F'>\nAre all easyBox delivery services available ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! For the moment only the service Locker NextDay is available.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20activated%20the%20locker%20nextday%20service%2C%20but%20i%20don%27t%20see%20it%20on%20the%20checkout%20page'>\nI activated the Locker NextDay service, but I don&#8217;t see it on the checkout page\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The service is only visible for orders that have a single product in the cart. So make sure you don&#8217;t have more than one product in your cart.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20use%20the%20estimated%20cost%20option%20but%20the%20fixed%20cost%20appears%20on%20the%20order%20page'>\nI use the estimated cost option but the fixed cost appears on the order page\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This situation may be due to the fact that the name of the locality does not match our nomenclature of localities.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
