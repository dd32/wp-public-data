        "installation": "<p>Please note, this payment gateway requires WooCommerce 3.0 and above.</p>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the WooCommerce Postpay plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Postpay&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;, then &#8220;Activate&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='who%20can%20use%20postpay%3F'>\nWho can use Postpay?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to sign up to Postpay is to select Postpay as your payment method at one of our partner retailers. Once you have selected to Postpay simply follow the steps to checkout and you will have an account linked to your mobile phone and ID number.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20can%20i%20spend%3F'>\nHow much can I spend?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your limit will change with regards to several key factors including but not limited to, the nature of the items you are purchasing, the retail merchant where you are purchasing these items and of course your history with Postpay. In short, the longer you have been purchasing using Postpay and successfully repaying on time, the higher your limit will be. We restrict the limits of new shoppers as we need to get to know you better. That being mentioned, we evaluate your repayment capability every time you use Postpay.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20different%20from%20credit%3F'>\nIs this different from credit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Postpay offers an interest-free and fees-free alternative to traditional credit that favors you, the customer. This means that you will have a seamless experience and not pay anything more for it!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20postpay%20secure%3F'>\nIs postpay secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We agree that your security is of utmost importance. We are a PCI DSS compliant company which means that we undergo strict compliance tests from the the Payment Card Industry (PCI) to ensure that your data is safely stored in our systems.
