        "description": "<p>If you are using the <a href=\"http://www.tyk.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tyk API Gateway</a> and have a WordPress site you can use this plugin to integrate a developer portal into your site. This is handy when your API requires a complementary website with information e.g. about the service and you want the developer portal in the same place. It&#8217;s main goal is to offer developer sign up and obtaining access tokens from your WordPress site.</p>\n</p>\n<p>This plugin is a work in progress and currently offers the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatic developer registration on Tyk when developers sign up in WordPress</li>\n<li>configuration of API policies available for token registration</li>\n<li>developers may request an access token for the available API policies</li>\n<li>automatic or manual approval of key requests</li>\n<li>storage of token (references) by name and API policy</li>\n<li>revoking of tokens by developer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What this plugin does not offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Management of Tyk API Gateway (the Tyk Dashboard is best suited for that)</li>\n<li>WordPress user registration (there are enough plugins that do that quite well)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Please note that we, the plugin authors, cannot offer support for this plugin. The code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/liip/wp-tyk-dev-portal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a> however and we are happy to accept pull requests fixing bugs or adding functionality. Also feel free to report any <a href=\"https://github.com/liip/wp-tyk-dev-portal/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issues</a> although we cannot promise when and if they will be fixed.</p>\n<h3>Todos</h3>\n<p>The following changes are in planning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use catalogues on Tyk portal to group policies instead of tags</li>\n<li>make chart colors configurable</li>\n<li>split up template and dashboard.js into multiple components</li>\n<li>build js to vendor/ dir</li>\n<li>~~refactor dashboard a bit considering that there can&#8217;t be more than 1 token per API anyway~~</li>\n<li>~~add option to not include bootstrap altogether~~</li>\n<li>~~do not allow registering for multiple API policies (as it&#8217;s not supported by Tyk)~~</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Further reading</h3>\n<h4>Automatic key approval</h4>\n<p>When <code>TYK_AUTO_APPROVE_KEY_REQUESTS</code> is set to <code>true</code> in wp-config.php, key requests will be approved automatically by this plugin. That means a developer will request an access token on the Dashboard page of your WordPress (where this plugin is running) and they will be processed automatically. For this to work, make sure <em>Require key approval</em> is not active in your Tyk Dashboard at <em>Portal Management &gt; Settings</em>.</p>\n<p>If you wish to approve key requests manually, set <code>TYK_AUTO_APPROVE_KEY_REQUESTS</code> to false and activate <em>Require key approval</em> mentioned above. When a developer requests an access token, he will get a message with his key request ID. The further process is up to you. Key requests can be approved in the Tyk Dashboard at <em>Portal Management &gt; Key Requests</em>. You could configure an email to be sent out in the Portal Management Settings or do it manually.</p>\n<h4>Custom dashboard page</h4>\n<p>The developer dashboard will be displayed in the same layout as your other pages. If you wish to further customize the page, you can create a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/page-templates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">custom page template</a> and embed the dashboard by using this template tag: <code>&lt;?php tyk_dev_portal_dashboard()?&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h4>Styling</h4>\n<p>You may need to fix some styles as this plugin includes a subset of the <a href=\"http://www.getbootstrap.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bootstrap</a> styles with it and the styles of your theme may conflict with some of them. Bootstrap is only included when your theme doesn&#8217;t already include it. You can set <code>TYK_FORCE_DISABLE_BOOTSTRAP</code> to <code>true</code> to force disable the bootstrap styles in case you need to.</p>\n<h4>i18n</h4>\n<p>This plugin is ready for translation and currently supports the following languages:<br />\n* German<br />\n* French<br />\n* Italian</p>\n",
