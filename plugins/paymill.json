The innovative payment solution enables online businesses and services to integrate payments into their websites within a very short time. The developer-friendly REST API is flexibly integrable. Customize the check-out process the way you want or use the PAYMILL PayButton which allows an even easier integration. Super-fast account activation within a few days only. Top-notch customer support. Subscriptions supported and Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android available. Accept payments in up to 100 currencies. All major card brands like MasterCard, VISA, American Express, Diner&#8217;s Club, Maestro etc. supported. Available in 40 countries across Europe so far.</p>\n<h4>Pay Frame</h4>\n<p>We’ve introduced a “payment form” option for easier compliance with PCI requirements.</p>\n<p>In addition to having a payment form directly integrated in your checkout page, you<br />\ncan use our embedded PayFrame solution to ensure that payment data never<br />\ntouches your website.</p>\n<p>PayFrame is enabled by default, but you can choose between both options in the<br />\nplugin settings. Later this year, we’re bringing you the ability to customise the<br />\nappearance and text content of the PayFrame version.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the benefits of PayFrame, please visit our FAQ:<br />\nhttps://www.paymill.com/en/faq/how-does-paymills-payframe-solution-work</p>\n<h4>Team</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially supported by <a href=\"https://paymill.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PAYMILL</a></li>\n<li>Developed and maintenanced by <a href=\"http://straightvisions.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">straightvisions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>End of Service</h3>\n<p>Please note, that there is currently no support available for this plugin through it&#8217;s creators, the straightvisions GmbH. Reason is that service contract with Paymill has not been renewed, there are currently no updates or patches ordered or planned for this repository. If you have any questions or issues using this plugin, please contact Paymill support directly.</p>\n<h3>Missing a feature?</h3>\n<p>Please use the plugin support forum here on WordPress.org. We will add your wished &#8211; if realizable &#8211; on our todo list. Please note that we can not give any time estimate for that list or any feature request.</p>\n<h4>Paid Services</h4>\n<p>Nevertheless, feel free to hire the plugin author Matthias Reuter <a href=\"mailto:i&#110;&#x66;&#111;&#x40;&#x73;&#116;&#x72;a&#105;&#x67;&#104;&#x74;&#x76;&#105;&#x73;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x2e;c&#111;&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">i&#110;&#x66;&#111;&#x40;&#x73;&#116;&#x72;a&#105;&#x67;&#104;&#x74;&#x76;&#105;&#x73;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x2e;c&#111;&#x6d;</a> if you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get a customization</li>\n<li>get a feature rapidly / on time</li>\n<li>get a custom WordPress plugin developed to exactly fit your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<h4>Error: Paymill can be loaded once only on the same page.</h4>\n<p>This error is self explaining but still might be a bit confusing, as some users will be sure that there is no doubled call of the payment form. There actually is one. For example: you may have the Paybutton widget in a sidebar which is loaded, but hidden by a sidebarmanager. In most cases, some plugins or themes cause this issue, so you may want to try deactivating all plugins except Paymill and try a default theme. Our development site is using Mystile from Woothemes, a free theme which is also certified for WooCommerce compatibility.</p>\n<h4>When logging into Paymill Dashboard, once activated Test Mode is switched back to Live Mode</h4>\n<p>Test Mode and Live Mode are both always active simultaneously. Even if the Dashboard is showing Live Mode upon (re-)login per default, both modes remain active, even when switching to Test Mode and vice versa.</p>\n<h4>How can I log API Requests for Subscription Handling?</h4>\n<p>If you feel subscriptions are not handled as intended, you&#8217;ll find logs in directory /wp-content/paymill/lib/debug/<br />\nYou may need to CHMOD 777 logging files to enable logging.</p>\n<h4>What will be logged when enabling plugin logging*</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>all PHP Errors and Notices since start of the plugin</li>\n<li>supported and activated webhooks</li>\n<li>Subscription Cancellation through WooCommerce</li>\n<li>Subscription Pause (on Hold) through WooCommerce</li>\n<li>Subscription Reactivation through WooCommerce</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>There is a manual included in English and German as PDF. But in short:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>paymill</code>-directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Register a free account on https://www.paymill.com/</li>\n<li>Insert TEST Api Keys for testing purposes in plugin settings</li>\n<li>Integrate the widget somewhere in your wordpress. Without one of the supported shops, the easiest method is the pay button, available in the admin interface at <em>Design » Widgets</em>, or as a shortcode (see FAQ) for individual pages.</li>\n<li>Play around in test mode.</li>\n<li>If you are happy how the plugin works, enable your live account on https://www.paymill.com/ &#8211; this could take a couple of days.</li>\n<li>After your paymill account has been activated for LIVE mode, switch your account to live and replace your TEST API Keys with your LIVE API Keys in plugin settings.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20for%20free%3F'>\nIs this plugin for free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is for free and licensed to GPL.<br />\nIt&#8217;s open source following the GPL policy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20revert%20all%20changes%20or%20reset%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow can I revert all changes or reset the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Paymill for WordPress brings an uninstall routine which allows completely removing all data generated by the plugin from WordPress. This is a great feature for a plugin reset, too which helps if there were upgrade or go live issues. You just have to go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard -&gt; Plugins Overview and deactivate Paymill for WordPress. After that, a &#8220;delete&#8221; Link will appear which allows completely removing Paymill for WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20calls%20to%20another%20server%3F'>\nDoes this plugin calls to another server?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. As Pamill is a payment service provider, it is absolutely required to call home to make sure that the payments are valid.<br />\nWe are talking about three different reasons for calling home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>PAYMILL Javascript Bridge makes sure that payment data is correct and creates a payment token delivered to your server after checkout. This avoids delivering payment data to your server, what is -in most cases- absolutely prohibited by all common credit card providers.</li>\n<li>PAYMILL PHP Bridge finishes the order and delivers the generated token to the PAYMILL server.</li>\n<li>For security purposes there is a feature which delivers WordPress version number and PAYMILL Plugin version number upon payment process. This will give us the ability to warn paymill merchants who are using a very outdated WordPress version or about known security holes in specific version when still using them.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20fees%20for%20payments%3F'>\nAre there any fees for payments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Merchants must create an account on https://www.paymill.com/ to use the payment service.<br />\nThe TEST mode is for free, but there are &#8220;per payment&#8221; fees in LIVE mode, see https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/pricing/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20customers%20need%20to%20create%20an%20account%20for%20payment%3F'>\nDo customers need to create an account for payment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. PAYMILL allows payments without annoying your customers creating an account.<br />\nThey&#8217;ll just fill out the payment fields on your checkout-page &#8211; that&#8217;s all.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20redirects%20the%20users%20to%20paymill%20for%20payment%3F'>\nDoes this plugin redirects the users to PAYMILL for payment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. PAYMILL allows payment directly through your website without any extra redirects etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20supports%203d%20secure%3F'>\nDoes this plugin supports 3D secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Please note that you can test 3D secure feature on LIVE mode only.<br />\nThe TEST mode always gives a positive feedback on 3D secure.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20credit%20cards%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhich Credit Cards are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depending on your country and account status, the following credit card provider are currently supported: American Express, CB, Diners Club, Discover, JCB, Maestro, MasterCard, VISA</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20sepa%20and%20why%20it%27s%20supported%3F'>\nWhat is SEPA and why it&#8217;s supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SEPA is a European banking service and stands for &#8220;Single Euro Payments Area&#8221;.<br />\nThis is a very convenience payment solution for European users, as credit cards are not very common in Europe compared to e.g. USA.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20update-safe%20way%20to%20edit%20language%20files%3F'>\nIs there a update-safe way to edit language files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just copy language files from /wp-content/plugins/paymill/lib/translate/ as draft to customize into /wp-content/languages/paymill/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20shortcodes%20to%20display%20the%20pay%20button%3F'>\nCan I use shortcodes to display the Pay Button?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, here&#8217;s an example shortcode with all currently available parameters: &#8216;[paymill_pb title=&#8221;test title&#8221; products_list=&#8221;1,2&#8243;]&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20actions%2Ffilters%2Fhooks%20in%20the%20pay%20button%3F'>\nAre there actions/filters/hooks in the Pay Button?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, all of them have 1 parameter as array with several vars.<br />\nYou may use var_dump to get their content and structure.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='actions'>\nactions\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_client_created</li>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_client_updated</li>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_subscription_created</li>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_order_complete</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='filters'>\nfilters\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_order_desc</li>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_client_desc</li>\n<li>paymill_paybutton_email_text</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20customize%20the%20pay%20button%3F'>\nHow can I customize the Pay Button?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Pay Button is made for customizing and you should make intensive use of CSS to cutomize it.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you may want to replace the default order form with your own. Create a<br />\ncustom theme file on &#8216;THEME_DIR/paymill/pay_button.php&#8217; (it will replace &#8216;/paymill/lib/tpl/pay_button.php&#8217;)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20woocommerce%20subscriptions%20integration%20allows%20setup%20fees%3F%20how%20are%20coupons%20applied%3F'>\nDoes WooCommerce Subscriptions Integration allows setup fees? How are Coupons applied?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but it&#8217;s working through a workaround. There are two transactions made, one for the subscription and one for initial fee.<br />\nSubscriptions fee cannot be changed, even through coupons. Please be aware that coupons are working on initial fee only.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

    "description": "<h4>Requires:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 5.3 or higher</li>\n<li>WordPress 4.8.x or higher</li>\n<li>CuRL PHP extension</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Supported Shops including subscriptions support:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce (2.6.13) + WooCommerce Subscriptions (2.0.13)</li>\n<li>Magic Members (1.8.x)</li>\n<li>Pay Button (independent, light-weight payment form)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Supported Shops without subscriptions support (yet):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>ShopPlugin (1.3.5)</li>\n<li>MarketPress (2.9.x)</li>\n<li>Cart66 Lite (1.5.1.17)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Service Description</h4>\n<p>PAYMILL offers the fastest and easiest way to accept payments online. The innovative payment solution enables online businesses and services to integrate payments into their websites within a very short time. The developer-friendly REST API is flexibly integrable. Customize the check-out process the way you want or use the PAYMILL PayButton which allows an even easier integration. Super-fast account activation within a few days only. Top-notch customer support. Subscriptions supported and Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android available. Accept payments in up to 100 currencies. All major card brands like MasterCard, VISA, American Express, Diner&#8217;s Club, Maestro etc. supported. Available in 40 countries across Europe so far.</p>\n<h4>Pay Frame</h4>\n<p>We’ve introduced a “payment form” option for easier compliance with PCI requirements.</p>\n<p>In addition to having a payment form directly integrated in your checkout page, you<br />\ncan use our embedded PayFrame solution to ensure that payment data never<br />\ntouches your website.</p>\n<p>PayFrame is enabled by default, but you can choose between both options in the<br />\nplugin settings. Later this year, we’re bringing you the ability to customise the<br />\nappearance and text content of the PayFrame version.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the benefits of PayFrame, please visit our FAQ:<br />\nhttps://www.paymill.com/en/faq/how-does-paymills-payframe-solution-work</p>\n<h4>Team</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Officially supported by <a href=\"https://paymill.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PAYMILL</a></li>\n<li>Developed and maintenanced by <a href=\"http://straightvisions.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">straightvisions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>End of Service</h3>\n<p>Please note, that there is currently no support available for this plugin through it&#8217;s creators, the straightvisions GmbH. Reason is that service contract with Paymill has not been renewed, there are currently no updates or patches ordered or planned for this repository. If you have any questions or issues using this plugin, please contact Paymill support directly.</p>\n<h3>Missing a feature?</h3>\n<p>Please use the plugin support forum here on WordPress.org. We will add your wished &#8211; if realizable &#8211; on our todo list. Please note that we can not give any time estimate for that list or any feature request.</p>\n<h4>Paid Services</h4>\n<p>Nevertheless, feel free to hire the plugin author Matthias Reuter <a href=\"mailto:i&#110;&#x66;&#111;&#x40;&#x73;&#116;&#x72;a&#105;&#x67;&#104;&#x74;&#x76;&#105;&#x73;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x2e;c&#111;&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">i&#110;&#x66;&#111;&#x40;&#x73;&#116;&#x72;a&#105;&#x67;&#104;&#x74;&#x76;&#105;&#x73;&#105;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x2e;c&#111;&#x6d;</a> if you need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get a customization</li>\n<li>get a feature rapidly / on time</li>\n<li>get a custom WordPress plugin developed to exactly fit your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<h4>Error: Paymill can be loaded once only on the same page.</h4>\n<p>This error is self explaining but still might be a bit confusing, as some users will be sure that there is no doubled call of the payment form. There actually is one. For example: you may have the Paybutton widget in a sidebar which is loaded, but hidden by a sidebarmanager. In most cases, some plugins or themes cause this issue, so you may want to try deactivating all plugins except Paymill and try a default theme. Our development site is using Mystile from Woothemes, a free theme which is also certified for WooCommerce compatibility.</p>\n<h4>When logging into Paymill Dashboard, once activated Test Mode is switched back to Live Mode</h4>\n<p>Test Mode and Live Mode are both always active simultaneously. Even if the Dashboard is showing Live Mode upon (re-)login per default, both modes remain active, even when switching to Test Mode and vice versa.</p>\n<h4>How can I log API Requests for Subscription Handling?</h4>\n<p>If you feel subscriptions are not handled as intended, you&#8217;ll find logs in directory /wp-content/paymill/lib/debug/<br />\nYou may need to CHMOD 777 logging files to enable logging.</p>\n<h4>What will be logged when enabling plugin logging*</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>all PHP Errors and Notices since start of the plugin</li>\n<li>supported and activated webhooks</li>\n<li>Subscription Cancellation through WooCommerce</li>\n<li>Subscription Pause (on Hold) through WooCommerce</li>\n<li>Subscription Reactivation through WooCommerce</li>\n</ul>\n",
