        "changelog": "<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested compatibility through WordPress 5.2.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>When multiple TypePad posts have the same post name, we now generate<br />\na new unique postname for the duplicately named post(s).  This means that<br />\nall posts will be imported those, even those sharing the same post name /<br />\nslug (though some incoming links will be broken).</li>\n<li>Small optimization to avoid needing to download duplicate linked to files.</li>\n<li>Small formatting fixes / corrections</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid trying to perform redundant symlinks / copies to existing files<br />\nwhen creating the legacy (ie /.a./) style links.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Handle rewriting links to popup versions of images within the plugin<br />\n(previously was only handled in the <a href=\"https://convert.tp2wp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">coversion</a><br />\nprocess.</li>\n<li>Remove some redundant checking on remote mimetypes, for some quicker<br />\nimports.</li>\n<li>Small, code-style cleanups</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Handle much larger data sets by doing some array operations in the database instead of in PHP.  Specifically, find out which posts still need to be imported by using a nested query instead of to different queries and an array_diff, which hits memory limits much quicker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix non-fatal error in attachment importer when referencing an undefined array (ie remove some code cruft).</li>\n<li>Some further code formatting to match WordPress coding standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Further improve duplicate post detection by only using the <code>post_name</code> column, which we&#8217;re sure will exist since its in Typepad data (as BASENAME).  This allows us to avoid an expensive un-indexed query against <code>post_title</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve duplicate post detection method to avoid false positives (previously the importer only checked for posts matching by title and date, which didn&#8217;t work well with Typepad&#8217;s exported data, where the drafts and posts have the same date)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove a non-fatal error by having the TP2WP_Import::bump_request_timeout() signature match the parent, WP_Importer::bump_request_timeout($val) signature.</li>\n<li>Add support for bzip2&#8217;ed .wxr uploads.</li>\n<li>Fix fatal error when zip module wasn&#8217;t loaded / available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Symlink / copy all files into a flat directory structure too, to allow for redirection rules from .a/ (in TypePad) to wp-content/uploads/tp2wp-migration/.</li>\n<li>Also add in-pluguin URL redirection from Typepad attachment URLs to WordPress attachment URLs (when the WordPress equivalent exists in the above described directory)</li>\n<li>Add several checks to the status page (pretty urls, supports symlinks, etc)</li>\n<li>Fix issue with uploaded, zip&#8217;ed wxr files are not properly processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Further corrections to plugin title in WordPress admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrections to plugin title and attribution in WordPress admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates to Status Check portion of the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release of new plugin. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/readymade-wordpress-importer-061/\" rel=\"ugc\">ReadyMade WordPress Importer</a> is superseded by this plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>WordPress Importer</h4>\n<p>Step 2 of our import process is a branch of the default WordPress importer. Our version modifies the default in three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If there is an attachment in the WXR and the importer is not able to determine the file type from the file name (ie missing extension), the patched version will make a light (body-less) request to the web server where the file is hosted for information we can use about the file. The things we&#8217;re interested in are file type, size, and filename.</li>\n<li>If the importer is processing an attachment under the above situation, and it is able to determine the file type, then it will rewrite the local version of the file to have the appropriate file extension.</li>\n<li>When moving from one host to another, or from WordPress.com to a self-hosted site, you may setup hosting for your domain, let&#8217;s call it &#8220;yourdomain.com&#8221; for example, before publicly directing the DNS to the new server. This is the correct thing to do if importing using WXR files. However, some hosts will then process references to &#8220;yourdomain.com&#8221; as internal references, rather than links to outside resources. This means that the importation process is essentially short circuited, with the public version of &#8220;yourdomain.com&#8221; being invisible to your new server. The ReadyMade WordPress Importer solves this problem by using TW2WP.com servers to identify the public IP of the source server and then uses that IP, rather than the domain, to import files.</li>\n</ol>\n"
