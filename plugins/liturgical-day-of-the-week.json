        "description": "<p>Liturgical Day of the Week (LDotW)</p>\n<p>I had a parish requestt that I incorporate the LDotW wording and color onto their newly redesigned website. I was going to initially make this specific to their site, but then realized this could be adapted to serve a lot of Catholic parishes.</p>\n<p>What helps make this plugin a bit unique (especially on its initial release) is the fact that we can handle alternate text as needed. Some Dioceses / Churches need to utilize alternate LDotW titles, which differ from the &#8220;standard&#8221; ones.</p>\n<p>Version 1.0.3 brings the &#8220;Saint of the Day&#8221; plugin completely inside LDotW, allowing me to retire &#8220;SotD&#8221;. The code bases and data structures were nearly identical, so it was logical to bring the two plugins together.</p>\n<p>This version also brings a few more configuration options, allowing you full control of the output. It also brings a nice visual view when configuring the shortcode options via the shortcode builder.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, this version moves the time zone settings to a more centralized location to streamline the plugin. Plus, there was a bit of code clean up to reduce the overall file size and wasted space within the plugin.</p>\n<p>Remember to deactivate and delete the &#8220;Saint of the Day&#8221; plugin, if installed/activated, please.</p>\n<p>PLANNED: Incorporating LDotW calendars for other denominations. Version 1.0.0 &#8211; 1.0.3 is specific for the Roman Catholic Churches of the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Version 1.0.3</strong></p>\n<h4>Features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcode builder lets you set whether to display alternate titles, as a result of your parish having slight deviations from the standard Liturgical Calendar (Boston, Philadelphia, etc, use a slightly modified Liturgical calendar from the rest of the dioceses).</li>\n<li>Saint of the Day, as well as Feast, Memorial and Solemnity indicator.</li>\n<li>Some days have more than one color present. Version 1.0.3 introduces an indicator (color wheel with mouseover visual cue) when present for that day.</li>\n<li>Works anywhere you can use shortcode.</li>\n<li>Only background color and text color defined via CSS. You can control the look/feel by adding your own CSS styling to a specific CSS class</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This plugin is not compatible with WordPress versions less than 5.0. Requires PHP 5.6+ (though you should be on 7.4 or even 8 by now).</p>\n<h4>TROUBLESHOOTING:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the FAQs/Help located on WordPress&#8217; Plugin page, or the Support forum on WordPress.org&#8217;s plugin area.</li>\n<li>The Shortcode Builder has been extensively tested with both jQuery version 1.12.4 and 3.5.1, without any issues. The output, however, does not need jQuery/JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "<p>** As this is the first release of RPU, FAQs are a little minimal right now **</p>\n\n<dt id='help%21%20the%20background%20color%20is%20somewhat%20transparent%21'>\nHelp! The background color is somewhat transparent!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is more than likely a result of how CSS behaves, when the &#8220;opacity&#8221; setting is used. Any elements (including nested elements) contained within that one element will have a semi-transparent/opaque background. The fix for this is to remove any &#8220;opacity&#8221; CSS calls and to replace them with a &#8220;background: rgba()&#8221; call. See the &#8220;Known Issues / Troubleshooting&#8221; section on <a href=\"https://bearlydoug.com/plugins/liturgical-day-of-the-week/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">THIS PAGE</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20with%20the%20animated%20bear%20icon%20%2F%20why%20%22bearlydoug%22%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s with the animated bear icon / Why &#8220;BearlyDoug&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to check out the plugin and click on &#8220;BD Plugins&#8221; after you activate this plugin. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20free%3F%20do%20you%20have%20a%20commercial%20version%2C%20too%3F'>\nWhy free?

What you see is what you get.WordPress has allowed me to advance my career and put me into a position where I&#8217;m doing okay. That said, you can still support this plugin (and others, as I release them) by hittin&#8217; that &#8220;Donate&#8221; link over on the right.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
