        "faq": "\n<h4>Where is my Business Directory search page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve set up the details on the settings page you should see your business directory at www.YOURWEBSITENAME.com/business-directory/.<br />\nUsers can add a new business at www.YOURWEBSITENAME.com/business-directory/new-business/.</p>\n<p>The URL&#8217;s can be changed if required, and all other business directory pages will reside within a sub-directory of the main Business Directory page.<br />\nEg. If your business directory starts at www.YOURWEBSITENAME.com/SOMEPAGE/ , the Add Business page would be located at www.YOURWEBSITENAME.com/SOMEPAGE/new-business/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is my admin area?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All admin sections for the plug-in can be found under the &#8220;WPBD Free&#8221; link in your WordPress admin area.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I customise the look of the business directory?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plug-in was built with customisation in mind. You will require HTML and CSS skills to change the way it looks.<br />\nLocate the &#8220;template&#8221; folder within the plug-in directory. Copy it ad paste it in to your own theme&#8217;s root directory.<br />\nNext, rename this copied folder to &#8220;wpbdf&#8221;. You can now edit any or all of the files within this folder.<br />\nThe plug-in will look for your theme&#8217;s &#8220;wpbdf&#8221; folder first. If it can&#8217;t find a customised version it will revert back to the default version.<br />\nBe careful when editing the files. There are various references to PHP variables and functions. You should avoid editing the PHP code unless you are PHP savvy.</p>\n<p>Avoid amending the files directly in the <code>/wp-business-directory-free/templates/</code> folder, as these will be overwritten when new updates are released. Also please keep in mind future updates to the plug-in may include updates to the original template files, so you may need to modify your custom files as and when they predate newer core versions.<br />\nTo check that your custom files are in-date, navigate to the &#8220;wpbdf-&gt;Custom Theme Files&#8221; option in your WordPress admin area. Out-of-date theme versions will be indicated here.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The website mentioned something about downloading more themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are currently developing this ability now. Over time we hope to provide you with a number of different themes that you can place in your WordPress theme&#8217;s &#8220;wpbdf&#8221; folder.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to customise the look of my business directory but it&#8217;s quite specific and I don&#8217;t know how to do it myself</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please get in touch with us via the forum and we&#8217;ll see if we can help locate a designer for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m not sure what to do&#8230;with any of it :S</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit our tutorial page at http://www.wpbusinessdirectorypro.com/tutorial/ for some pointers. If you are still unsure please get in touch via our email form or the support forum.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this plug-in on another website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>YES! Use it where-ever and whenever you want, provided you don&#8217;t re-sell the plug-in or repackage it in any way (reselling the plug-in is prohibited and protected by governing laws).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve found a bug &#8211; what do I do</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every effort has been made to fix any bugs but, as is always the case, sometimes bugs crop up. Don&#8217;t panic. Simply report the bug to us and we&#8217;ll investigate as soon as possible and if required we&#8217;ll post an update to the plug-in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve got some requests for future updates to the plug-in</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great! We&#8217;re always looking for ways to improve. Please log your ideas on our support forum. We&#8217;ll consider every idea for our future updates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the PRO version offer that the free version doesn&#8217;t?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The PRO version offers an even more comprehensive Business Directory with features including:<br />\n&#8211; A Tiered Subscription System &#8211; flexible, customisable and can be tied to an in-built subscription payment mechanism.<br />\n&#8211; Google friendly Ratings &#8211; Easy to use, SEO friendly ratings system.<br />\n&#8211; User Reviews &#8211; Reviews can be placed and moderated with ease.<br />\n&#8211; Bulk Importing &#8211; Import hundreds of businesses at once with our CSV import tool.<br />\n&#8211; User Ownership / Claiming &#8211; Your users can become &#8220;owners&#8221; of a business. They can edit the business (subject to approval), pay for subscriptions or request additional features such as an upgrade or a feature listing. This is all controlled from their own User Dashboard.<br />\n&#8211; More Business Options &#8211; Additional business details such as opening hours and business awards.</p>\n<p>Check out all the benefits at www.wpbusinessdirectorypro.com</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you have any other plug-ins?
