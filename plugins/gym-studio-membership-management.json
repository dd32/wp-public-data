Your members can use the app to checkin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20added%20a%20login%20to%20my%20post%20but%20where%20is%20the%20member%27s%20area%3F'>\nI have added a login to my post but where is the member&#8217;s area?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You do not need to add in a member&#8217;s area. The login takes care of this. The login directs user to the member&#8217;s area. It will also be in the same post.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20wide%20should%20my%20post%20or%20page%20be%20for%20the%20calendar%3F'>\nHow wide should my post or page be for the calendar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although, the calendar supports mobile view it is your preference how wide to display your calendar. Both desktop view and mobile view display content differently and accordingly to the device screen&#8217;s width and height.</p>\n<p>So keep in mind to give the post area enough room to display calendar information for desktop view.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20override%20the%20plugin%20css%3F'>\nCan I override the plugin CSS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can.

When creating your account you still need to go through the process of entering your domain name so we can setup your plugin credential.</p>\n<p>Once it is finished the username and password is sent to your email address. Here is the step-by-step tutorial: <a href=\"http://news.fitsoft.com/wordpress-plugin-setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> More on Setup</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20a%20calendar%20to%20my%20post%20or%20page%3F'>\nHow do I add a calendar to my post or page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the post or page entry -&gt; Click on &#8220;Visual&#8221; on the to right hand corner of your editor<br />\n-&gt; Click on the calendar icon -&gt; Click on &#8220;Preview Changes&#8221; button<br />\n-&gt; You should see your calendar</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20barcode%20scanning%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with barcode scanning?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it works with usb QR-barcode wedge scanner.</p>\n<p>Members can find their barcode in the membership tab when they are logged into their account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20support%20euro%3F'>\nDoes this plugin support Euro?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n<p>Currency Setting is where you change the content of your site.
