        "description": "<p>PoolParty thesaurus plugin helps to make WordPress blogs and websites more understandable. The website will be improved by linking posts with key terms and key terms with other key terms. The plugin imports a controlled vocabulary (SKOS thesaurus) or retrieves a thesaurus from a (public) SPARQL endpoint via web. Based on the thesaurus, terms in articles are high-lighted automatically, definitions are provided &#8220;inline&#8221; (as mouse-over effect) and links to the thesaurus terms are generated on-the-fly. The thesaurus is available as an extra resource on the blog and can be navigated to learn more about the knowledge domain instantly. The plugin also works with multilingual blogs. Dbpedia (Linked data) is used to retrieve definitions automatically whenever the imported thesaurus lacks of definitions.</p>\n<p>With this plugin any SKOS/RDF thesaurus can be imported or retrieved from a SPARQL endpoint and used within your WordPress blog to underpin articles with key terms.</p>\n<p>On two extra pages (which are generated automatically) the thesaurus can be displayed and used as a browsable glossary on your blog. The main page of the glossary displays all concepts with their preferred labels and their alternative labels (synonyms). The list of concepts is displayed in an alphabetical order and can be filtered by their first letters. The second page represents the detail view of each concept. All kinds of labels and relations (prefLabel, altLabel, hiddenLabel, definition, scopNote, broader, narrower und related) of a given term (concept) can be loaded and displayed.</p>\n<p>Each post is analysed automatically to find words and phrases matching labels of a concept (prefLabel, altLabel or hiddenLabel) in the thesaurus. The first hit will be highlighted automatically. A mousover tooltip shows the short description of the term/phrase and the link points to the more detailed description on the glossary page.</p>\n<h4>Shortcodes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[ppt-abcindex]: displays an abc filter for filtering the concepts alphabetically.</li>\n<li>[ppt-itemlist]: displays a list of concepts (filterd by its first letter).</li>\n<li>[ppt-itemdetails]: displays the detail page of a selected concept.</li>\n<li>[ppt-noparse] &#8230; [/ppt-noparse]: the content between of the shortcode is excluded from autmatic linking.</li>\n<li>[ppt-searchform title=&#8221;&#8230;&#8221; width=&#8221;&#8230;[ px | % ]&#8221;]: displays a search form with a autocomplete field to find a concept.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What&#8217;s new?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Plugin works now with the user-friendly multilingual dynamic content management <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/\" rel=\"ugc\">qTranslate X</a> for a multilingual WordPress</li>\n<li>The URL to the detail page of a concept is now SEO optimized </li>\n<li>The search algorithm behind the search link on top of the concept detail page is extended (searches now for prefered and alternative labels)</li>\n<li>Implemented new shortcode with which you can add a simple glossary search form between content.
