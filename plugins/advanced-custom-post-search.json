For more information on how to do this, see the FAQ.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the main features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited form creation</li>\n<li>Select any of your custom post types (including those created by other plugins)</li>\n<li>Taxonomy filters for selected custom post type</li>\n<li>Optional text input field</li>\n<li>Use custom results pages of your own</li>\n<li>Override default results page/loop via a theme</li>\n<li>Widget Support</li>\n<li>Shortcode Support</li>\n<li>‘Out of the box’ compatibility with numerous WordPress themes (twentyfourteen/ thirteen etc)</li>\n<li>Complete control over form styles</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please visit our website for more <a href=\"http://www.creare.co.uk/services/extensions/wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free WordPress plugins</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Installing and using ACPS couldn’t be simpler:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>/advanced-custom-post-search/</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Access the Form List page through the WordPress admin menu to begin creating forms</li>\n<li>Save your form and add our widgets to your theme, or use the shortcodes at the bottom of each of the form creation pages</li>\n<li>If you want to setup form styles and a custom results page then do this via the plugin’s settings page</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need custom post types setup before I install the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but you will need at least one to create a form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need taxonomies and/or terms before I install the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but you will need at least one of each before you can create a functional form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My shortcode/widget is showing an ACPS error on my site</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The error specifically addresses configuration issues so check you have custom post types, taxonomies and terms created.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I theme my results page/loop?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ACPS allows you to override the default results page and loop by adding the files ‘acps-results_loop.php’ and ‘acps-results.php’ in a number of places in your active theme folder. Either copy the file(s) into the ‘/wp-content/[theme_directory]/acps/templates’ or ‘/wp-content/[theme_directory]/‘ directory to override the default templates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My results pages aren’t listing any results</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The results pages work off of the standard WP_Query loop and therefore list any options based on the filters you selected. Make sure you have published the posts you are trying to find.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I specify my own base results page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.1 you are able to setup your own results pages instead of using the default ‘advanced-search’ page, you can access the options for this on the plugin’s settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My custom results page isn’t displaying results</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Be sure to include the results shortcode [acps_results] in the content area (or in the theme template), without this the results will not load.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My custom results loop isn’t listing results</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The results section is setup through ACPS’ acps_results class, you need to use ‘$this-&gt;acps_args’ in your WP_Query setting otherwise no query parameters will be set.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I style my forms?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 1.1 you can use the built in form style option which can be found on the plugin’s general settings page or alternatively just include any styles in your own stylesheets. Classes are added to your form(s) to make styling easy, they are based on a number of things including the following: labels/no labels, shortcode/ widget, inside titles/ outside titles, custom container class.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
