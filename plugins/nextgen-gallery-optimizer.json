These include new admin notifications to assist users who don&#8217;t have the required NextGEN Gallery plugin installed and activated, new step-by-step installation instructions via the WordPress admin (to ensure the correct file ownership and permissions are set), a streamlined settings page, and improvements to Optimizer&#8217;s automatic Fancybox installation.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.1.1:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Dynamic messaging for admins on unsupported shortcodes (Basic)</li>\n<li>Checks to ensure jQuery isn&#8217;t being deregistered (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Includes blank index.php files for enhanced security (Basic and Premium)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This release aims to improve communication between Optimizer and end-users, including dynamic messaging for admins on unsupported shortcodes, and a clever regex that detects and alerts you if your theme (or child-theme) is deregistering jQuery&#8230;which causes Fancybox to break. Additionally, security is enhanced with the addition of blank index.php files in each folder, preventing bots from scanning your server&#8217;s directory tree.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.1 (first major release):</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Fancybox title now included in image height calculations (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>New options: WordPress&#8217;s included jQuery <strong>or</strong> go Google-hosted (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for the Thickbox effect (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for the Shutter effect (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for JW Image Rotator slideshow integration (Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for AJAX pagination on [imagebrowser id=x] (reqs. Shutter) (Premium)</li>\n<li>Fancybox gets extra fancy&#8230;auto-resizes when the browser is resized (Premium)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This first major release for Optimizer sees a number of new additions and features&#8230;<br />\nFancybox now includes space for a single-line title in its image height calculations, vastly improving vertical alignment of the lightbox. Also, Optimizer now lets you choose between using WordPress&#8217;s included jQuery (for greater compatibility), or the Google-hosted version (for faster page loads). Support for the Thickbox and Shutter effects has also been added thanks to user requests.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the Premium version now includes AJAX pagination when using Shutter on the [imagebrowser id=x] shortcode, supports the JW Image Rotator for slideshows and features a super-fancy, auto-resize function that <em>resizes Fancybox when the browser window is resized!</em></p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.8:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Tested fully-compatible with WordPress 3.4 (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other plugins and themes (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Display fix for Fancybox when no title is available (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Latest jQuery 1.7.2 (Basic and Premium)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This version adds the jQuery.noConflict(); method for improved compatibility with plugins and themes using other javascript libraries/frameworks including script.aculo.us, Prototype and MooTools. It also includes a fix for Fancybox/NextGEN Gallery integration where a small white line would appear underneath the lightbox when no title was set.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.7:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other scripts and plugins. (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Minor bug fix in admin message. (Basic and Premium)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This version enhances compatibility with other plugins and includes a few minor improvements.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.6:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Fully-automated Fancybox installation!

If WordPress doesn&#8217;t detect a shortcode, neither do we!</p>\n<p>Also, this update introduces the new NextGEN Gallery Optimizer <em>Premium</em> version, which adds support for ALL TEN of NextGen&#8217;s shortcodes, support for the [show as slideshow] link, the removal of NextGEN&#8217;s version number comment and more.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.4:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Easier set up</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This version automatically redirects first time users to the options page on activation and sets a default stylesheet for easier set up.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.3:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Optimized code for better compatibility and page load speed</li>\n<li>Improved settings page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This update results in faster page loads on gallery pages by avoiding duplicate scripts.

It gives the following notice on-save when WP_DEBUG is active: &#8220;Notice: Undefined variable: sortArray in &#8230;nextgen-gallery/admin/manage-sort.php on line 19&#8221;. One workaround would be to simply upload your images in the order you want them displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are also a few new notices (when WP_DEBUG is active) in WordPress v4.3, however the widgets do still appear to be working: &#8220;Notice: The called constructor method for WP_Widget is <strong>deprecated</strong> since version 4.3.0! Use __construct() instead. in &#8230;/wp-includes/functions.php on line 3457&#8243;.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t my image uploads working in NextGEN 2.0.xx?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are many possibilities (typically ownership/permissions issues), but here&#8217;s an odd one from personal experience. Hopefully it&#8217;ll help&#8230;</p>\n<p>I had created several development installs across numerous WordPress releases to test Optimizer with the latest NextGEN 2.0.xx version (v2.0.66.37 specifically), but NextGEN&#8217;s image uploads weren&#8217;t working on any of them. All file ownership and permissions were correct, but NextGEN&#8217;s uploads page was just showing a yellow error triangle with a tooltip of &#8220;HTTP error&#8221;.</p>\n<p>After watching the JavaScript console in Chrome, I discovered there was not only a JS error on every NextGEN settings page, but also a &#8220;Not found&#8221; error on the image upload page itself. It turned out this was due to a compatibility issue with WordPress&#8217; default permalink structure (e.g. &#8220;?p=123&#8221;), as &#8220;index.php&#8221; was being inserted after the base URL, causing a 404. Changing the permalink settings in WordPress to the &#8220;Month and name&#8221; structure (e.g. &#8220;/2015/02/sample-post/&#8221;) fixed the issue. Note: this was happening in both WordPress 3.7 and the latest v4.1.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>&#8211;</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Wait&#8230;my galleries are displaying properly, but my images load in a new window!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re sure Fancybox is activated on Optimizer&#8217;s settings page, and the lightbox still won&#8217;t display using the &#8220;Use WordPress jQuery [greater compatibility]&#8221; setting, it is highly likely you have a conflict caused by two or more instances of jQuery loading on the same page. This is typically due to jQuery calls having been hard-coded into your theme.</p>\n<p>Please inspect your theme files (the header.php and footer.php in particular) for lines including jquery.js or jquery.min.js and either comment them out, or remove them altogether.</p>\n<p>Additionally, make sure you have wp_head(); in your theme&#8217;s header.php file. It will usually be right before the closing &lt;/ head &gt; tag, and is an essential hook for plugins such as Optimizer to be able to load the necessary scripts and styles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help!&#8230;I can&#8217;t see the NextGEN &#8220;Gallery&#8221; tab!!!</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Please make sure the &#8220;NextGEN Gallery&#8221; plugin is both installed and activated on your plugins page in the admin (it&#8217;s a separate plugin available <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>). Once activated, the &#8220;Gallery&#8221; options tab should appear near the bottom of your left sidebar in the admin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find the tab for your plugins page either, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;re logged in as a user without administrative privileges. You can verify this by visiting http://www.yoursite.com/wp-admin/plugins.php.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set the Shutter or Thickbox effect?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Firstly, you&#8217;ll need to deactivate Fancybox on the Optimizer settings page and click &#8220;Save Options&#8221;. After that, simply navigate to Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; Effects, select your effect and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin compatible with minification/caching tools?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. However the small, already minified Fancybox script must be excluded from combining/minification or it won&#8217;t function. This is true of any lightbox script.</p>\n<p>For WP Minify, simply add /wp-content/plugins/nextgen-gallery-optimizer/fancybox/jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js in its js file exclusion options and clear the cache.</p>\n<p>For W3 Total Cache, you&#8217;ll need to select the &#8220;manual&#8221; minify option at Performance &#8211;&gt; General Settings. After that, jump to Performance &#8211;&gt; Minify where you can hand-pick the scripts and styles you want minified/combined (excluding Fancybox).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What version of NextGEN Gallery is this plugin compatible with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any version since 1.6.2</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Premium Version</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t my images click-through to a gallery on my [album id=x] shortcodes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It looks as though there may be a bug with one of NextGEN&#8217;s settings. Go to Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; Gallery Settings and make sure the first option &#8220;Deactivate gallery page link&#8221; is checked (as it is by default).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve just added a gallery to an album in NextGEN and I get a &#8220;Notice: Undefined property: stdClass::$gallery_ids&#8221; error message on my page.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The drag-and-drop &#8220;Manage Albums&#8221; page in NextGEN does not auto-save like the WordPress widgets page. Click the &#8220;Update&#8221; button and your albums will display as they should.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help! My slideshows aren&#8217;t working&#8230;they just show a rotating loading circle.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please go to GALLERY -&gt; MANAGE GALLERY and select the gallery that&#8217;s causing you trouble. Inside this gallery, ensure ALL image thumbnails are displaying and re-upload them if necessary. If they&#8217;re missing, the &#8220;Path&#8221; field may have been changed, which will cause the slideshow to break.</p>\n<p>Also, slideshows require two or more images in your galleries to function, else they&#8217;ll break as above.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get regular pagination on NextGEN Album pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, Album pages don&#8217;t include pagination&#8230;but you can activate this feature by adding a custom field called &#8220;ngg_paged_Galleries&#8221; on the edit screen for your album page in the WordPress admin. The value of the custom field should be the number of albums you wish to display per page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t Optimizer support NextGEN widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After spending weeks working on integrating this, I&#8217;ve discovered it&#8217;s not presently possible in WordPress to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Conditionally load the required scripts in the header AND</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ONLY load them if the widget is actually present on the page.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since both the Fancybox and the NextGEN slideshow scripts must be loaded in the head section of the page so they don&#8217;t break, and since the whole point of this plugin is to NOT load scripts on every page, I&#8217;ve had to abandon this idea for the time being. If you know of a solution, do let me know and I&#8217;ll add it in the next version!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t Premium support AJAX pagination on gallery pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Apart from the [imagebrowser id=x] shortcode, I had hoped to add support for this on regular galleries and album galleries too, but unfortunately NextGEN&#8217;s implementation to date is just too buggy, inconsistent and restrictive. For example&#8230;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have to use the Shutter effect across your whole site.</li>\n<li>It breaks the [Show as slideshow] links when activated.</li>\n<li>It causes several error notices per page (visible in debug mode) read: massive error log.</li>\n<li>It isn&#8217;t coded to work at all on album main pages or on most shortcodes (UI inconsistency).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried to iron out some of these issues myself, but to no avail. Hopefully the team at Photocrati will look into this for a future release.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I activate the JW Image Rotator in NextGEN Gallery, my slideshows only display a big black box!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Before you can use JW Image Rotator, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-image-rotator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">download it here</a>, upload it to your wp-content/uploads folder and enter the FULL filepath to its imagerotator.swf file at Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; Slideshow &#8211;&gt; &#8220;Path to the Imagerotator (URL)&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Eg. http://sitename.com/wp-content/uploads/imagerotator/imagerotator.swf</p>\n<p>Click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; when you&#8217;re done and you&#8217;ll be all up and running.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: JW Image Rotator now comes bundled with NextGEN Gallery v1.9.9 and above, and requires no manual installation.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t Optimizer Premium detecting my Album gallery pages or the [Show as slideshow] links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This issue is likely caused by the &#8220;Activate permalinks&#8221; option at Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; General Options, which changes NextGEN&#8217;s URL structure for things such as the &#8220;Show as slideshow&#8221; and &#8220;Show picture list&#8221; links, as well as navigation through your Album pages.</p>\n<p>Optimizer Premium looks for NextGEN&#8217;s default URL structure, which appends query string parameters to much of the navigation. With &#8220;Activate permalinks&#8221; switched on, these parameters are no longer present, which results in the plugin not recognizing where to add the necessary scripts for either Fancybox or slideshow functionality.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently working on a way to target these permalink URLs for a future version of the plugin, but for now, correcting the issue is as simple as navigating to Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; General Options, switching off the &#8220;Activate permalinks&#8221; setting and clicking &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

These dynamic pages are sometimes generated by plugins (e.g. the &#8220;Calculated Fields Form&#8221; plugin) for AJAX calls, to pull in extra data. And where that extra data involves NextGEN functionality, we needed to be able to flag them as Allowed Pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ADDED: Detection of NextGEN&#8217;s &#8220;Manage Gallery&#8221; meta links in NextGEN Gallery Deactivator. The URL&#8217;s of the linked PHP files needed to be flagged as Allowed Pages, as although they&#8217;re loaded in the admin, they&#8217;re actually located in the &#8220;nextgen-gallery&#8221; plugin directory (therefore undetectable by is_admin() checks).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.1.1 &#8211; 2015-6-18</h4>\n<h4>Basic and Pro:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TESTED: Fully compatible with NextGEN Gallery up to v2.1.0.</li>\n<li>TESTED: Fully compatible with NextCellent Gallery up to v1.9.26.</li>\n<li>TESTED: Fully compatible with WordPress up to v4.2.2.</li>\n<li>UPDATED: All in-plugin, repository and website documentation to reflect our new &#8220;tested up to&#8221; compatibility.</li>\n<li>NEW: Added 256&#215;256, 128&#215;128 and svg plugin icons for the new WordPress plugin installer screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.1 &#8211; 2015-3-09</h4>\n<h4>Basic and Pro:</h4>\n<h4>NextGEN Gallery v2.0.71+:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Now fully compatible with the major update of NextGEN Gallery v2.0.71 (up to v2.0.77).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Optimizer&#8217;s Enhanced Fancybox Lightbox is now additionally integrated with the &#8220;C_Lightbox_Library_Manager&#8221; class, for front-end, in-memory lightbox registration in NextGEN v2.0.71+.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Added conditional removal of several script dependencies (when using Optimizer&#8217;s &#8220;Advanced options&#8221;), that were introduced in NextGEN v2.0.71+. This enables us to continue to provide granular control of the scripts that load on posts and pages <em>with</em> NextGEN Gallery content in NextGEN v2.0.71+.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: The exact version of NextGEN Gallery in current use is now taken directly from NextGEN&#8217;s main plugin file header, as we can&#8217;t count on Photocrati to not remove/rename the &#8220;NGG_PLUGIN_VERSION&#8221; constant (which had already replaced Legacy&#8217;s &#8220;$ngg-&gt;version&#8221; in NextGEN v2.0+), nor provide any graceful deprecation or backwards compatibility to prevent errors after doing so (re: the NextGEN v2.0.71+ update. See below…).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: &#8220;Fatal error: Class &#8216;C_Lightbox_Installer&#8217; not found&#8221; after Photocrati completely removed the &#8220;C_Lightbox_Installer&#8221; class in NextGEN v2.0.71 (without any graceful deprecation, or backwards compatibility in place).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: &#8220;Fatal error: Call to undefined method C_Lightbox_Installer::uninstall_lightbox()&#8221; after Photocrati <em>reintroduced</em> the &#8220;C_Lightbox_Installer&#8221; class in NextGEN v2.0.74+, but <em>without</em> the original &#8220;uninstall_lightbox()&#8221; method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: &#8220;Fatal error: Class &#8216;C_NextGen_Settings&#8217; not found&#8221; when activating other plugins. This is caused by new methods introduced by Photocrati in NextGEN v2.0.71+ intended to hide (instead of <em>fix</em>) PHP warnings when using their NextGEN Plus/Pro plugins or their theme. They are called &#8220;is_activating()&#8221; and &#8220;is_not_activating()&#8221;, and are added to the &#8220;C_NextGEN_Bootstrap&#8221; class in &#8220;nggallery.php&#8221;. This appears to prevent NextGEN from initializing on the activation of other plugins, and as a result, NextGEN doesn&#8217;t load its includes&#8230;causing all third-party calls to its &#8220;C_NextGen_Settings&#8221; class in the NextGEN 2.0 API to fail.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>NextCellent Gallery v1.9.25+</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Now fully compatible with the major update of NextCellent Gallery v1.9.25 (up to v1.9.25.3).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Optimizer now deregisters the new sitewide stylesheet &#8220;framework-min.css&#8221; added in NextCellent Gallery 1.9.25+, and only loads it on posts and pages with NextCellent Gallery content.

This ensures we only run the regex operation once per load, speeding up execution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: Small shortcode regex bug that affected some users (replaced our while have posts loop with a foreach iterating over the results of $wp_query-&gt;posts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ADDED: jQuery migrate plugin in NextGEN Legacy (when Google-hosted jQuery is selected on Optimizer&#8217;s Legacy settings page), for backwards compatibility with other themes and plugins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UPDATED: Legacy&#8217;s Google-hosted jQuery is now v1.11.1 to match the WordPress version included in WP 4.0.1.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Fancybox changelog:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Modified the Fancybox script for full compatibility with jQuery v1.9 and v1.10+ (doesn&#8217;t require jQuery migrate).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Rewritten auto Fancybox installation with full integration with NextGEN&#8217;s lightbox select menu at both Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; Effects (NextGEN Legacy) and Gallery &#8211;&gt; Other Options &#8211;&gt; Lightbox Effects (NextGEN 2.0).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Support for AJAX pagination (inc. imagebrowser) when using the Fancybox lightbox (Shutter no longer required).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Improved our Fancybox stylesheet regex to accommodate devs moving sites from development servers to production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Overhauled our responsive resize method. Now much faster!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Uniquely prefixed Fancybox function and selector names to avoid conflicts with themes simultaneously loading other versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Replaced Fancybox&#8217;s fading-out / fading-in of the actual image on resize with a transparent overlay, as it&#8217;s much less processor intensive. This runs a lot smoother in IE6/7/8 especially, and even improves performance in modern browsers when the CPU is being overworked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Expanded the iframe &#8220;allowTransparency&#8221; conditional to include IE7 and 8, as they require this property also.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Improved a previous fix for NextGEN Legacy compatibility (space in empty title issue) so that it works perfectly in IE6 and 7.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Improved the responsive resize method invocation. Instead of firing independently on window.resize, this is now integrated into the Fancybox script itself. It&#8217;s set to only fire once Fancybox&#8217;s wrap centering is fully complete, ensuring smoother animations on older browsers, older equipment, or simply on overworked CPUs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Adjusted vertical positioning of the loading animation, when adding room for the title position in Fancybox&#8217;s image height calculations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NEW: Fancybox now factors in the dynamic address and tab bar in Safari on iOS8 in its height calculations, ensuring perfect vertical centering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: Fancybox&#8217;s overlay width. When our document is wider than the browser window, we need to ensure the overlay covers the whole width (as it does the length), in case a user scrolls horizontally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: The WordPress admin bar was hiding Fancybox&#8217;s background overlay and &#8220;x&#8221; close image. I&#8217;ve increased all z-index values to bring them to the top.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FIXED: Some minor Fancybox errors in JSHint.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.1.2 &#8211; 02/01/2013</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added new checks to make sure NextGEN Gallery is both installed and activated. A new admin notification accompanies this to assist new users with downloading, activating and setting up NextGEN.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Major improvements to Optimizer&#8217;s automatic Fancybox installation. 1. Checks to make sure NextGEN Gallery is actually installed. 2. Automatically resets if the NextGEN database settings are deleted (so it can run again if reinstalled). 3. Now deactivates and restores former NextGEN Effects values when Optimizer&#8217;s Fancybox option is switched off (as well as on plugin deactivation).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved our &#8220;can&#8217;t write css file&#8221; admin notification to include a small &#8220;how to&#8221; guide on changing file permissions, to assist users who are new to managing self-hosted sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replaced all upload instructions with a step-by-step guide to installing Optimizer via the WordPress admin. This method of installation is much faster than FTP, largely automated and most importantly, ensures the correct file ownership and permissions are set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changed Google-hosted jQuery to version 1.8.3 to match the version now included in WordPress 3.5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated the Basic version&#8217;s messaging in regards to the [Show as slideshow] text link for greater clarity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the donate and hire me boxes from the Basic version&#8217;s settings page, as some users had expressed annoyance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explicitly defined database settings variables as globals so they&#8217;re able to be used inside functions called on register_activation_hook().</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.1.1 &#8211; 08/11/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added a dynamic administrative message on the front-end for logged-in admins, which displays on posts/pages where unsupported shortcodes are being used. It&#8217;s intended to inform admins about the Basic version&#8217;s limitations in case they skipped the documentation, and highlight the Premium version&#8217;s feature set in case it would be more appropriate for their requirements. [Basic only]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a check to make sure jQuery isn&#8217;t being deregistered in a user&#8217;s theme, as it will break Fancybox. This regex runs on the plugins page and Optimizer&#8217;s settings page in the admin, and looks for variants of &#8220;wp_deregister_script(&#8216;jquery&#8217;);&#8221; in the functions.php files of both the main active theme and the child theme (if present). If detected (and not re-registered with a CDN version), users are alerted via a message in the admin. [Basic and Premium]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a blank index.php file inside each of Optimizer&#8217;s folders to prevent Google from accessing and indexing the Apache directory tree. [Basic and Premium]</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.1 &#8211; 12/07/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added a conditional bottom margin in Fancybox&#8217;s image height calculations to make room for single-line titles. By default, especially with large images, the titles would be squished against the bottom of the viewport.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added new options that allow users to choose between WordPress&#8217;s included jQuery or Google-hosted jQuery. We used to just run the Google-hosted script, but as users have reported compatibility issues (even with the jQuery.noConflict(); method added in the last update) &#8212; and that those issues have been resolved simply by using the built-in version instead &#8212; I thought it would be best to make WordPress&#8217;s jQuery the default and provide Google-hosted as an option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for WordPress&#8217;s native Thickbox lightbox integrated with NextGEN Gallery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for NextGEN&#8217;s built-in Shutter effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for NextGEN&#8217;s JW Image Rotator assistant (Premium) after permission granted from the authors. Turns out we only needed to include WordPress&#8217;s native swfobject.js on the slideshow shortcode (if activated at Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; Slideshow &#8211;&gt; &#8220;Enable flash slideshow&#8221;), and grab the file path to the user&#8217;s downloaded imagerotator.swf file entered below that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for NextGEN&#8217;s AJAX pagination on the [imagebrowser id=x] shortcode (Premium). NextGEN also applies this to Gallery pages and Album gallery pages, but as I&#8217;ve outlined in the FAQ, the implementation is far too buggy, inconsistent and restrictive to add here. From a user interface perspective, it works rather well with imagebrowser (albeit, issuing notices), so I have added it in&#8230;but for the galleries, it&#8217;s really not necessary. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s better to be without, than have it break the [Show as slideshow] links on the gallery pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a function to Fancybox&#8217;s scripts (Premium) to trigger an auto-resize when a user resizes their browser window. I&#8217;ve also added a slight delay for smooth animation and it looks great! Previously, the lightbox did center itself on window resize, but the image wouldn&#8217;t rescale without first exiting and re-entering the lightbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changed three function names after adding support for Shutter and Thickbox (to be more descriptive and consistent).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>nggo_load_fancybox is now nggo_load_fancybox_scripts</li>\n<li>nggo_fancybox_style is now nggo_load_fancybox_styles</li>\n<li>nggo_nextgen_style is now nggo_load_nextgen_styles</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed nggo_custom_style. Its functionality has been merged into nggo_load_nextgen_styles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added version number to Optimizer&#8217;s HTML comment to assist with support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a link to Premium in the plugin description.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.8 &#8211; 18/06/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Changed &#8220;compatible up to&#8221; version number after thorough testing on WordPress 3.4.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added the jQuery.noConflict(); method to improve compatibility with plugins and themes using other javascript libraries/frameworks including script.aculo.us, Prototype and MooTools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a Fancybox/NextGEN Gallery integration issue where a small white line would appear underneath the lightbox when no title was set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recompiled jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.pack.js with Google Closure Compiler after above fix.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Switched Google-hosted jQuery to the latest version (1.7.2).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.7 &#8211; 29/05/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Converted all jQuery &#8220;$&#8221; selectors in Fancybox&#8217;s invocation code to &#8220;jQuery&#8221; to prevent conflicts with other plugins and scripts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a minor bug in the &#8220;file not writable&#8221; admin message whereby the filename was omitted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.6 &#8211; 04/04/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Installation of Fancybox is now fully automated and set by default.<br />\nThe plugin saves a copy of existing settings on the Gallery &#8211;&gt; Options &#8211;&gt; Effects page, then updates them with the Fancybox code so we don&#8217;t have to enter it manually.<br />\nAny changes to this code are then overridden as long as the Fancybox option on the settings page is checked. This helps prevent accidental changes that would break integration. A safety switch, if you will.<br />\nThere&#8217;s also an admin message that prompts users to uncheck the Fancybox setting on the options page if they want to use another custom lightbox/effect.<br />\nOn deactivation, Optimizer will attempt to restore the former values&#8230;but only if Fancybox is selected (don&#8217;t want to write over newer custom values!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed installation instructions from the options pages as, well, we don&#8217;t need them any more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After discovering WordPress&#8217;s auto-update downloads the full version of the plugin (not just the files that have changed), and with no way to redirect back to the plugin settings page from the upgrade page, I&#8217;ve set the Fancybox stylesheet regex to run on admin_init instead. Since we only want it to run once (on first activation and after auto-update), I&#8217;ve defined a version number in the code and added a &#8220;version&#8221; option to the settings array to check against.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added (if !defined()) to skip_load_scripts to avoid possible error messages when both basic and premium versions of the plugin are installed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added extra fields to the options page for persistent plugin settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.5 &#8211; 20/03/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Replaced my shortcode regex with WordPress&#8217;s native get_shortcode_regex() function for more precise matching.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a pre-emptive fix to solve a common problem where jQuery dependent scripts (such as Fancybox and NextGEN&#8217;s slideshow) break if jQuery doesn&#8217;t load first. Added array(&#8216;jquery&#8217;) dependencies to wp_register_script calls (which forces jQuery to not only load when these scripts are called, but load first), as well as add_action priority values to influence their order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launched my new NextGEN Gallery Optimizer <em>Premium</em> version which supports ALL TEN of NextGen&#8217;s shortcodes, supports the [show as slideshow] link, adds targeting for shortcode sub-pages (eg. stylesheet only on album page / both styles and scripts (if selected) on album GALLERY pages) and adds the removal of NextGEN&#8217;s version number comment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added promotional box to the basic version&#8217;s settings page.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.4 &#8211; 18/03/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added an automatic redirect that sends first time users to the plugin options page on first activation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a one time welcome message on the redirect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a default setting for the stylesheet in case anyone forgets to set it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added email contact to the settings page and main page at the plugin repository.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changed all instances of $nextgen_gallery_optimizer to a global $nggo_options variable for less cumbersome handling of database options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moved the stylesheet drop-down if statements to scripts-and-styles.php to keep them together with their register and enqueue calls.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.3 &#8211; 09/03/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Replaced all hard-coded scripts and styles with WordPress&#8217;s built-in wp_enqueue_scripts and wp_print_styles functions for better compatibility with other plugins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added several instances of wp_deregister_script to pages we&#8217;re serving jquery and jquery.fancybox.js on. This will prevent conflicts (and page load overhead) if any other installed plugins try to serve duplicate scripts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added /wp-content/ url prefix to custom css input box on the settings page. Also made the Fancybox installation instructions clearer with larger text, a link to the NextGEN Effects page, and extra advice in the Tips section on plugin conflicts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.2 &#8211; 07/03/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for WordPress Pages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where some page elements overlap Fancybox and prevent the close button from functioning (in particular the title text, header image and menu bar in Twenty Eleven).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a surprisingly common issue involving Fancybox not working in IE6 &amp; IE8. My solution was to develop a regular expression that runs on the plugin options page ONLY to write the full urls Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader requires into the static Fancybox stylesheet. Much more efficient than some methods I&#8217;ve seen (such as dynamically rebuilding the stylesheet on every page view in php).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Switched JQuery to the latest version 1.7.1 (Google hosted)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0.1 &#8211; 01/03/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolved issue regarding upload to WordPress.org repository</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.0 &#8211; 28/02/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release on February 28th, 2012.</li>\n</ul>\n"

These include new admin notifications to assist users who don&#8217;t have the required NextGEN Gallery plugin installed and activated, new step-by-step installation instructions via the WordPress admin (to ensure the correct file ownership and permissions are set), a streamlined settings page, and improvements to Optimizer&#8217;s automatic Fancybox installation.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.1.1:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Dynamic messaging for admins on unsupported shortcodes (Basic)</li>\n<li>Checks to ensure jQuery isn&#8217;t being deregistered (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Includes blank index.php files for enhanced security (Basic and Premium)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This release aims to improve communication between Optimizer and end-users, including dynamic messaging for admins on unsupported shortcodes, and a clever regex that detects and alerts you if your theme (or child-theme) is deregistering jQuery&#8230;which causes Fancybox to break. Additionally, security is enhanced with the addition of blank index.php files in each folder, preventing bots from scanning your server&#8217;s directory tree.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.1 (first major release):</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Fancybox title now included in image height calculations (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>New options: WordPress&#8217;s included jQuery <strong>or</strong> go Google-hosted (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for the Thickbox effect (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for the Shutter effect (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for JW Image Rotator slideshow integration (Premium)</li>\n<li>Support for AJAX pagination on [imagebrowser id=x] (reqs.

Also, Optimizer now lets you choose between using WordPress&#8217;s included jQuery (for greater compatibility), or the Google-hosted version (for faster page loads). Support for the Thickbox and Shutter effects has also been added thanks to user requests.</p>\n<p>On top of this, the Premium version now includes AJAX pagination when using Shutter on the [imagebrowser id=x] shortcode, supports the JW Image Rotator for slideshows and features a super-fancy, auto-resize function that <em>resizes Fancybox when the browser window is resized!</em></p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.8:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Tested fully-compatible with WordPress 3.4 (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other plugins and themes (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Display fix for Fancybox when no title is available (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Latest jQuery 1.7.2 (Basic and Premium)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This version adds the jQuery.noConflict(); method for improved compatibility with plugins and themes using other javascript libraries/frameworks including script.aculo.us, Prototype and MooTools. It also includes a fix for Fancybox/NextGEN Gallery integration where a small white line would appear underneath the lightbox when no title was set.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.7:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other scripts and plugins. (Basic and Premium)</li>\n<li>Minor bug fix in admin message.

If WordPress doesn&#8217;t detect a shortcode, neither do we!</p>\n<p>Also, this update introduces the new NextGEN Gallery Optimizer <em>Premium</em> version, which adds support for ALL TEN of NextGen&#8217;s shortcodes, support for the [show as slideshow] link, the removal of NextGEN&#8217;s version number comment and more.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.4:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Easier set up</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This version automatically redirects first time users to the options page on activation and sets a default stylesheet for easier set up.</p>\n<h4>NEW in Version 1.0.3:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Optimized code for better compatibility and page load speed</li>\n<li>Improved settings page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This update results in faster page loads on gallery pages by avoiding duplicate scripts.
