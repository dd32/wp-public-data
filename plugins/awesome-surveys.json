PHP 7 is not supported and support will not be added</p>\n<h4>IMPORTANT</h4>\n<p><strong>If you are using a version less than 1.6.1 you need to update NOW</strong></p>\n<p>Version 2.0 is a major rewrite to address the issues of data loss that some users have been experiencing. Surveys are now custom post types and leverage the WordPress post editor. Individual responses are stored as post meta &#8211; each response is represented by one row in the post meta table for the survey.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows you to create surveys with an easy-to-use form builder, publish surveys with a simple shortcode and view survey results in the admin backend. You maintain control of your data. Automatic form validation is included.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>You maintain ownership of your data</strong> &#8211; does not rely on third-party services.</li>\n<li>Allows the creation of any number of surveys to collect data from visitors to your site.</li>\n<li>Build your survey forms with the powerful built-in form builder.</li>\n<li>Optionally require login or cookie authentication in order for a user to take the survey.</li>\n<li>Publish your surveys on pages or posts by including a shortcode <strong>new</strong> or link directly to them.</li>\n<li>Advanced form field validation is included.</li>\n<li>View results of your surveys in the admin area of your WordPress site.</li>\n<li>Extendable through action/filter hooks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Known issues/limitations</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>At this time, it is not possible to edit survey questions if the survey has responses. In the future I plan to re-implement this but only so much as to allow for the editing of text &#8211; You will not be able to add questions to a survey which has responses. You will not be able to add answers to questions if the survey has respones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since the surveys are now custom post types, the actual survey form is saved<br />\nas &#8216;post_content&#8217;. This means that if WordPress was in English when you built the survey, but your site wants to be in another language, the English strings will still be output, i.e. &#8216;Submit Response&#8217; &amp; &#8216;make a selection&#8230;&#8217;. Likewise, even if your WordPress site was in your language but you didn&#8217;t have the translations available, those strings will be output in English. As a workaround, you can append some parameters to your url e.g. when on the general survey options screen, your url would look like this: &#8220;wp-admin/admin.php?page=awesome-surveys.php&#8221; add this to the url: &#8220;&amp;translate-surveys=true&#8221; to force translation of all of your surveys. The translation strings for your language must be present in order for this to work. As another alternative, I would suggest implementing the WordPress &#8216;<code>the_content</code>&#8216; filter to change the strings to whatever you need them to be.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\n<h4>Known Issues:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Versions prior to 1.6.1 are potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks &#8211; please do not use versions prior to 1.6.1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Async JS and CSS plugin can cause the javascript for Awesome Surveys to not be loaded.
