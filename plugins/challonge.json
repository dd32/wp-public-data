The Challonge plugin integrates your Challonge tournaments into your WordPress website so your users may easily see recent tournaments, their progress, and even sign up and participate.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adaptive caching and background refresh allows your pages to load a lot faster than before! &#8211; <strong>New in 1.1.6!</strong></li>\n<li>Only registered users may sign up to your tournaments.</li>\n<li>Likewise, your users may forfeit a tournament after signing up, but only before it begins.</li>\n<li>Participating users may report their own scores.</li>\n<li>Includes role capabilities. You will need a role management plugin to change who has these capabilities.</li>\n<li>Custom participant name templating.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Languages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>Spanish (68%) &#8211; Thanks to Andrew Kurtis from <a href=\"http://www.webhostinghub.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebHostingHub</a> for translating!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<p>In order to use the API, you will need <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cURL</a>. Most PHP installations include cURL.</p>\n<h4>Latest Information</h4>\n<p>Keep up to date with upcoming release information on my website:</p>\n<p>https://zavaboy.org/challonge-wordpress-plugin/</p>\n<h4>Getting Started</h4>\n<p>Before you start using this plugin, here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://challonge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Challonge.com</a> account. Registration is free.</li>\n<li>A valid <a href=\"https://challonge.com/settings/developer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer API Key</a> so the Challonge plugin can talk with your Challonge.com account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have the Challonge plugin installed and activated on your website, you will need to enter your Challonge.com API key in &#8216;Settings&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Challonge&#8217;. Once you have done that, you have unlocked the full power of this nice plugin.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode</h4>\n<p>You may use a shortcode in posts and pages to display a tournament or list out tournaments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>[challonge]</code></strong> &#8211; This will list out all tournament brackets in your account, excluding all organizations.</li>\n<li><strong><code>[challonge url=\"w4la9fs6\"]</code></strong> &#8211; This will embed a tournament bracket. This may be any Challonge bracket, not just your own.</li>\n<li><strong><code>[challonge subdomain=\"my_sub\"]</code></strong> &#8211; This will list out all tournament brackets in the &#8216;my_sub&#8217; organization. (eg: my_sub.challonge.com)</li>\n<li><strong><code>[challonge url=\"w4la9fs6\" theme=\"2\" show_final_results=\"1\" width=\"90%\" height=\"600px\"]</code></strong> &#8211; This is just a more customized version of the first shortcode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a tournament bracket within an organization, you will have to use the <code>subdomain</code> attribute along with the <code>url</code> attribute, like so:</p>\n<p><strong><code>[challonge url=\"w4la9fs6\" subdomain=\"my_sub\"]</code></strong></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s all the shortcode attributes available to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>url</code></strong> &#8211; The URL to a tournament.</li>\n<li><strong><code>subdomain</code></strong> &#8211; The subdomain of the tournament URL or if no tournament URL is provided, the listing will be tournaments within the specified subdomain.</li>\n<li><strong><code>theme</code></strong> &#8211; The theme ID you would like to use.</li>\n<li><strong><code>multiplier</code></strong> &#8211; Scales the entire bracket.</li>\n<li><strong><code>match_width_multiplier</code></strong> &#8211; Scales the width allotted for names.</li>\n<li><strong><code>show_final_results</code></strong> &#8211; Display the final results above your bracket.</li>\n<li><strong><code>show_standings</code></strong> &#8211; For round robin and Swiss tournaments, you can opt to show a table of the standings below your bracket.</li>\n<li><strong><code>width</code></strong> &#8211; The width of the embedded tournament bracket.</li>\n<li><strong><code>height</code></strong> &#8211; The height of the embedded tournament bracket.</li>\n<li><strong><code>limit</code></strong> &#8211; Limit the number of returned results for tournament listings.</li>\n<li><strong><code>allowusers</code></strong> / <strong><code>denyusers</code></strong> / <strong><code>allowroles</code></strong> / <strong><code>denyroles</code></strong> &#8211; A comma separated list of users or roles you would like to specifically allow or deny from viewing the tournament bracket or tournament listings.</li>\n<li><strong><code>statuses</code></strong> / <strong><code>excludestatuses</code></strong> &#8211; A comma separated list of tournament statuses you would like to specifically show or hide from the tournament listings. All statuses: &#8220;Pending,Checking In,Checked In,Underway,Awaiting Review,Complete&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong><code>listparticipants</code></strong> &#8211; List participants currently in the tournament. (Must be used with <code>url</code>) &#8211; <strong>New in 1.1.6!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Widget</h4>\n<p>To allow your users to signup and report their own scores, just add the plugin widget.</p>\n<p>The widget has the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Title</strong> &#8211; The title of the widget, nothing special here. Defaults to &#8216;Challonge&#8217;.</li>\n<li><strong>Subdomain</strong> &#8211; The subdomain to list your tournaments from. (Optional)</li>\n<li><strong>Tournament Filter</strong> &#8211; Only tournament names that match this filter will be listed. (Optional) This may be a simple wildcard filter, for example <code>My * Tournament</code> will match &#8216;My Big Tournament&#8217; but not &#8216;Your Big Tournament&#8217;. If you need a more robust filter, you may use Regular Expressions (PCRE) like so: <code>/My \\d+(st|nd|rd|th) Tournament/i</code> will match &#8216;My 3rd tournament&#8217; but not &#8216;My Third Tournament&#8217;</li>\n<li><strong>Status Filter</strong> &#8211; Only list tournaments with the selected statuses, unless none are selected.</li>\n<li><strong>Max tournaments listed</strong> &#8211; The maximum number of tournaments that the widget will list. Defaults to 10.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Integrating Challonge.com Tournaments</h4>\n<p>Challonge.com tournaments may be easily setup to allow your WordPress users to signup and report scores. Here are a few things you should know when setting up your Challonge.com tournaments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turning &#8216;Host a sign-up page&#8217; on will allow your users to signup through the widget.</li>\n<li>In &#8216;Advanced Options&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Permissions&#8217;: Turning &#8216;Allow participants with Challonge accounts to report their own scores.&#8217; on will allow your users to report their own scores through the widget.</li>\n<li>In &#8216;Advanced Options&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Permissions&#8217;: Turning &#8216;Exclude this event from search engines and the public browsable index.&#8217; on will hide the tournament from the shortcode and widget tournament listings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Did You Know?</h4>\n<p>If you run the same tournaments on multiple WordPress websites, your WordPress users will be tracked in your Challonge.com tournaments by their email address and login name, even if their display name differs. With this in mind, users may signup and report their score using either website. Also note, users who change their email address will lose access to any of their preexisting tournament signups.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>challonge</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>You should add your Challonge.com &#8216;Developer API Key&#8217; to &#8216;Settings&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Challonge&#8217;.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why was this Challonge plugin made?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At first, I needed a WordPress plugin to help with some tournaments I was involved with and nobody had made one or was working on one at that time, so I started making this plugin. Later, I no longer needed a plugin, but I already started the project and people have already noticed. After about a year of life distractions and general procrastination, I completed the first version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a Challonge.com account to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Actually, no you don&#8217;t. (Keep reading!) Without an account, you will only be able to embed tournament brackets into posts and pages with the shortcode, but you will not be able to get any tournament listings with the shortcode or in the widget. You will need a valid Challonge API key, which you can get easily with a <a href=\"https://challonge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Challonge.com</a> account, to use all the Challonge WordPress plugin has to offer. A Challonge.com account is free.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I think I found a bug. What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although I do my best to avoid introducing bugs, especially with complexity growing every release, it gets increasingly difficult for me to squish them all before I make a release. That said, please report any bugs you come across in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/challonge\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>. I try to get to bug reports quickly depending on the severity. If I&#8217;m already aware of the bug, you will find it in the <a href=\"https://zavaboy.org/challonge-wordpress-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">upcoming release notes</a> on my website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you make the plugin do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Got an idea for a new feature or don&#8217;t like how something already is? Please speak up in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/challonge\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>! A lot of the features in the plugin today have been suggested or influenced by the community. If there&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to see, chances are others may want to see it as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I help you out?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I do not have a lot of time to actually test everything I put into this plugin. It has already happened where I make something work and the next thing I know, it doesn&#8217;t work because I forgot one small detail. So, testing this plugin out for me and letting me know what you find would be a big help! If you don&#8217;t want to do that, you could always <a href=\"https://zavaboy.org/challonge-wordpress-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donate</a>. Donating will keep me active on this project.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
