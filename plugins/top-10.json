        "description": "<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t have an in-built system to track page views or displaying popular posts. <a href=\"https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Top 10</a> is an easy to use, yet, powerful WordPress plugin that will count the number of page views of your posts, pages and any custom post types. You can then display the page view counts as well as display your most popular posts.</p>\n<p>Top 10 adds two widgets that you can use to display a list of popular posts and the counta cross all your blog posts.</p>\n<p>Although several similar plugins exist today, Top 10 is one of the most feature-rich popular post plugins with support for thumbnails, shortcodes, widgets, custom post types and CSS styles. The inbuilt caching system also helps reduce server load by caching your popular posts output. The tracking uses ajax and is thus compatible with most popular caching plugins.</p>\n<p>Top 10 also has powerful API and is fully extendable with WordPress actions and filters to allow you easily extend the code base to add new features or tweak existing ones.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Page counter</strong>: Counts page views on single posts, pages and <em>custom post types</em> on an hourly basis which can then be easily displayed automatically, using shortcodes or functions</li>\n<li><strong>Popular posts</strong>: Display a list of popular posts either for total counts or for a custom period.

Top 10 will create a custom image size (<code>tptn_thumbnail</code>) with the dimensions specified in the Settings page</li>\n<li>Auto-extract the first image in your post to be displayed as a thumbnail</li>\n<li>Manually enter the URL of the thumbnail via <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress meta fields</a>. Specify this using the meta box in your Edit screens.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Exclusions</strong>: Exclude posts from select categories from appearing in the top posts list. Also exclude posts by ID from appearing in the list</li>\n<li><strong>Styles</strong>: The output is wrapped in CSS classes which allows you to easily style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area or use the style included.</li>\n<li><strong>Admin interface</strong>: View list of daily and/or overall popular posts from within the dashboard. Top 10 also adds two sortable columns to your All Posts and All Pages pages in your WordPress Admin area</li>\n<li><strong>Export/Import interface</strong>: Export the count tables and settings to restore in the same site or on other installs</li>\n<li><strong>Works with caching plugins</strong> like WP-Super-Cache, W3 Total Cache or Quick Cache</li>\n<li><strong>Extendable code</strong>: Top 10 has tonnes of filters and actions that allow any developer to easily add features, edit outputs, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features in Top 10 Pro</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced Blocks and Widgets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Top 10 Query Block</strong>: Query and display popular posts directly from the block or site editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Top 10 Featured Image Block</strong>: Supports multiple image sources for more flexibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Popular Posts Block Enhancements</strong>: </li>\n<li>Save and clear default block settings with a single click.</li>\n<li>Auto-insert default and global settings attributes with an option to disable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved Admin Tools</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Admin Bar Integration</strong>: New admin bar menu item to view daily, total, and overall post counts, access admin pages, and clear the cache quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Dashboard Access Control</strong>: Control which user roles can view the Top 10 dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Display Settings</strong>: Choose which post type screens display admin columns.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Custom Display Options</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taxonomy-Specific Displays</strong>: Use the <code>display_only_on_tax_ids</code> parameter to restrict popular post displays to specific taxonomy terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Category Inclusion</strong>: Include popular posts from specific categories using a new option in the Edit Post meta box.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Tracking and Performance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast Tracker</strong>: A new, faster tracking method to improve post view speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Query Filters</strong>: Enable parent term inclusion in post queries for more accurate filtering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer-Friendly Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Filters and Hooks</strong>: New filters like <code>top_ten_query_exclude_terms_include_parents</code>, <code>top_ten_query_include_terms_include_parents</code>, and <code>get_tptn_short_circuit</code> for greater customisation.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Post Type Sortable Columns</strong>: Display columns on post types and make them sortable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>GDPR</h4>\n<p>Top 10 is GDPR compliant as it doesn&#8217;t collect any personal data about your visitors when installed out of the box. You can see the data the plugin stores in the <code>wp_top_ten</code> and <code>wp_top_ten_daily</code> tables in the database. Note: the prefix <code>wp</code> might be different if you have changed it from the default.</p>\n<p>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT ALL GDPR REQUIREMENTS ARE MET ON YOUR WEBSITE.</p>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>Top 10 is available for <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/top-10\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translation directly on WordPress.org</a>.
