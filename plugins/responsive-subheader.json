        "description": "<p>This plugin works best when you have set static pages for your Front and Posts pages.</p>\n<p>Easily add a responsive subheader to your pages. There is a separate subheader for your Front page, created when you add a new &#8216;Responsive Subheader&#8217; post and a second type for all other pages. Be sure to add a featured image to your pages if you want the subheader to display on them.</p>\n<p>Features:<br />\n &#8211; Custom, editable subheader on the Front page<br />\n &#8211; Use a featured image as the subheader for all subpages<br />\n &#8211; Attach multiple images to the Front page Responsive Subheader to make a slideshow<br />\n &#8211; Choose your transition type for the slideshow<br />\n &#8211; Choose your custom color for the subheader backgrounds<br />\n &#8211; Each page will have its own unique subheader<br />\n &#8211; The page title is displayed on all subpage subheaders</p>\n<p>Create a new &#8216;Responsive Subheader&#8217; and add a &#8216;Featured Image&#8217; to it. The title is only for reference; it is not displayed on pages. Be sure to add a &#8216;Featured Image&#8217; (at least 720px x 200px) to your pages. You can even add a featured image to the page you set as your &#8216;Posts&#8217; page.</p>\n<p>Be sure to choose a background color and the overlay style you will want displayed on your subheader. On your sub-pages (those not the Front page) the page title will be displayed over the colored background on the right side. The image you choose as the &#8216;Featured Image&#8217; for the page will be displayed on the left side. This is a dynamic, responsive subheader that should display properly on all screens.</p>\n<p>This plugin will add the option for your theme to use thumbnail images automatically. It will also add the image sizes it needs to the list of available sizes.</p>\n<p>If you have not done so already, please, create a child theme for your current theme. Then copy the &#8216;header.php&#8217; file into your child theme folder. Only edit the copied file &#8211; never alter your original theme files!</p>\n<p>Once you have copied over the &#8216;header.php&#8217; file to your child theme, open it up in a text editor and add the following code (including the opening and closing php tags) to the bottom of the file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n// Output of Responsive Subheader block\nif( class_exists( 'ResponsiveSubheader' ) ) {\n  display_responsive_subheader_here();\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#8212; How to use the Slider Feature on the Front Page &#8212;</p>\n<p>Uncheck the setting to use the &#8216;Featured Image&#8217; when you create your Responsive Subheader in the admin area.<br />\nAttach &#8211; do NOT insert &#8211; the images that you would like to use to your Responsive Subheader post. To attach without inserting &#8211; in the Edit Responsive Subheader screen &#8211; click on the &#8216;Add Media&#8217; button. When the &#8216;Insert Media&#8217; modal window opens select the &#8216;Upload Files&#8217; option tab. Upload the files you would like to use for your slider &#8211; Do NOT click on &#8216;Insert into post&#8217; button &#8211; just &#8216;x&#8217; out of the modal window to close it.</p>\n<p>Your attachment images will be automatically resized down to 800px x 432px for this plugin to use, but if you prefer, you may resize them manually before attaching. If your images are smaller than that size, please enlarge them before uploading. Images smaller than 800px x 432px may not display properly and cause problems. The software lacks the capability to resize smaller images to a larger format. This will need to be done manually before uploading.</p>\n<p>Please Note: this plugin currently does not implement the ability to detach files from a post &#8211; not yet anyway. To do this, you will need to add another plugin or delete the image you uploaded as an attachment in the media library to detach it.</p>\n<p>If you have a featured image set to your post, this will not be included as a slide in the slideshow. Unchecking the &#8216;Use Featured Image&#8217; checkbox only tells the plugin to setup display mulitple image attachments as a slideshow, or, if you only have one other image attached to use that instead.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming Releases</h3>\n<p>In future updates I hope to:<br />\n * Add additional features to the front-page sub-header such as font color settings.<br />\n * Add a feature to easily attach and detach images from the Responsive Sub-header for the slider<br />\n * Add more overlays<br />\n * Add a manual cropping function for your sub-page attached images<br />\n * Add translations</p>\n",
