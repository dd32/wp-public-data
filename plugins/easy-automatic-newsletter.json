        "faq": "\n<h4>Is it true that the new version doesn&#8217;t require you to configure a cron job in my cPanel anymore?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We are very excited about version 2.7 and the new WP Cron feature. We witnessed a lot of users struggling with that aspect of our plugin and took action to fix it. However, you may still use the regular CronJob if preferred.</p>\n<p>NOTE: If you wish to use WP Cron then delete your old cronjob if configured.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do about my cron job that is set up in my cPanel, when I used the old version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If upgrading from EAN 2.6 then you may leave your cronjob intact. If you find that your old cronjob is no longer working in 2.7 then try some of the other cronjob commands. Currently the options are php, curl, and wget. Choose which one works best, click save changes, and use that command.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I remove my old cron job?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For users of cPanel 1.0:</p>\n<pre><code>1. Login\n2. Go to cPanel\n3. Scroll down to 'Cron Jobs'\n4. Look for 'Current Cron Jobs'\n5. Find the entry that relates to EAN (and click Delete). Confirm to Delete if asked.\n</code></pre>\n<p>NOTE: Our entry contains &#8220;wp-content/plugins/easy-automatic-newsletter/ean-schedule-newsletter.php&#8221;</p>\n<p>NOTE: If these directions do not work for you, please contact your WEBMASTER or your HOSTING PROVIDER for technical assistance. Tell them &#8220;I&#8217;d like your help in removing a cron job.&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I keep getting after installing EAN &#8220;Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class FacebookApiException in /var/www/vhosts/family-oosten.com/httpdocs/blog/wp-content/plugins/easy-automatic-newsletter/facebook-sdk/base_facebook.php on line 107&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The cause of this problem is another one of your plugins are conflicting with the FaceBook API. Currently a solution is being worked on to avoid this problem. As a temporary solution you can disable the conflicting plugin. One user reported &#8220;Comments Plus&#8221; plugin being a culprit.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: FaceBook timeline removed due to various problems it caused different users&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where does the newsletter content come from?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pulled from your blog posts for the past period (a day ago, a week, a month, the last 2 weeks, quarter, year)  to feed a new period&#8217;s newsletter. You can specify which categories to pull from (so you could create a category called Newsletter). You can even include up to 20 Tweets from one Twitter account too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many subscribers does this support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many as your server will allow (likely a lot). Of course, the more you have (like 10,000) the longer it will take to send out the newsletters.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What customizations do you offer?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>The frequency of your newsletters can be easily modified for daily, weekly, monthly, 2x/month, quarterly and yearly\n<ul>\n<li>The newsletter sent is a simple design allowing the content to get the attention.</li>\n<li>You can customize the masthead with your own logo.</li>\n<li>You can customize where the newsletter comes from and the subject line</li>\n<li>You can customize all the messages sent and that appear when someone subscribes or unsubscribes</li>\n<li>You can customize the titles that appear inside the newsletter</li>\n<li>All the content of the newsletter comes from your blog posts (you can choose which categories)</li>\n<li>You can include up to 20 Tweets from any Twitter user</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there any support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have made every attempt to ensure that this plugin will simply work but as it is with going &#8216;live&#8217; we cannot anticipate every unique scenario. There&#8217;s a Feedback feature included in the plug-in and it&#8217;s at the bottom of the menu. You can send us your comments, questions and feedback to us anonymously or include your email. If you want a chance for us to get back to you, please include your email address.</p>\n<p>Prior to reporting an issue please ensure your WordPress installation updated to at least 3.3.1 (latest is preferred) and PHP is running at least 5.3.17. You can get your PHP version by using the phpinfo() plugin https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-php-info</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I love your plugin, but wish there was a way to white label it.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Actually there will be. We are working on a Premium version of this plugin which will be available in a few weeks. It will be loaded with every single feature request that was provided by our users of the free plugin (approximately 30 new features). Follow us on Twitter @chiefatlarge to stay updated on when this Premium version will be available.</p>\n<p>In addition, it would be greatly appreciated contributing to our beer fund ðŸ™‚<br />\nhttps://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=VH8TK2Z79VM4E</p>\n<p>While your at it why not give us a good rating:<br />\nhttps://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-automatic-newsletter/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
