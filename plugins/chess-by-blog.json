        "installation": "<p>Chess By Blog has been tested on WordPress 2.0.4 to 3.0; it is not<br />\nsupported for earlier versions.</p>\n<p>Before installing, you should back up your WordPress blog,<br />\nparticularly if you intend to use the persistent game feature since<br />\nthis will make changes directly to your database. The changes should<br />\nonly be limited to the body of the post which contains the chess<br />\nboard, and I&#8217;m not aware of any issues with the code &#8211; but better safe<br />\nthan sorry.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading, it is recommended that you first disable the<br />\nplugin, then remove the files in the old chess-by-blog<br />\nsubdirectory. This is optional: however, due to the names of the<br />\nJavascript scripts created by the Google Web Toolkit, new files tend<br />\nto have different names and the old ones aren&#8217;t replaced &#8211; they just<br />\ntake up disk space.</p>\n<p>The top level contents of the zip folder look like this:</p>\n<p>/chess-by-blog<br />\n +&#8211;readme.txt (this file!)<br />\n +&#8211;chess-by-blog.php<br />\n +&#8211;/chess-by-blog<br />\n +&#8212;-/themes<br />\n +&#8212;-(support files)<br />\n +&#8211;/src</p>\n<p>The top level chess-by-blog directory should be copied to your WordPress<br />\nwp-content plugins directory. Optionally, unless you are building the<br />\nclient side code yourself, you can delete the src directory.</p>\n<p>You should now be able to activate the plugin from the WordPress<br />\nPlugins administration panel.</p>\n"
