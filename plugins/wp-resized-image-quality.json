Are they compressed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t currently support PNG compression internally (none at all). There are other image-handling plugins that compress PNGs and GIFs, but they either require server-side tools or a 3rd-party service. For a Plugin using server-side tools, try &#8216;EWWW Image Optimizer&#8217;. For a Plugin using a 3rd-party service, try &#8216;WP Smush.it&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I update JPEGs uploaded before installing this plugin at a different setting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, install this plugin and choose your new compression level. Then install the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin, https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/, and run it. All the regenerated thumbnails will be compressed at the compression % from this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens to uploaded images if I turn the plugin off?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images uploaded while the plugin was active will stay at their original/old compression level (to recompress them, I recommend the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin). After you deactivate the custom compression setting will be removed and all new images will use WP&#8217;s default 90% compression setting.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
