        "installation": "<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/<br />\ndirectory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from<br />\nthe Plugins page.</p>\n<p>To insert the tracker, create a new post (preferably a page) and insert the<br />\nfollowing content in the body:</p>\n<p><!--wp-simpletracker-1--></p>\n<p>And publish! You can now access your tracker via accessing the page you just<br />\ncreated.</p>\n<p>Creating new issues and commenting on them can be done by any regular user.<br />\nEditing issues, changing status, etc, can only be done by a user with the<br />\n&#8216;simpletracker_manager&#8217; capability. Issues can only be assigned to a user<br />\nwith the &#8216;simpletracker_assignee&#8217; capability.</p>\n<p>Two new Roles are created, Issue Manager and Issue Assignee, which can<br />\nnormally be used to control these capabilities. However, for more complex<br />\nsetups, you can install a Role Editing plugin (like &#8220;Members&#8221;) and assign<br />\nthe above capabilities directly to the roles of your choice.</p>\n<p>For best appearance, use a single-column page template for the tracker<br />\n(no sidebar) and disable comments and pingbacks. but it will work either way.</p>\n",
