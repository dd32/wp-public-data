If you find that after you&#8217;ve enabled this plugin, things go horribly wrong, simply disable the plugin and create a support request here.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this work for Woocommerce?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it definitely will! We have added Woocommerce support to our FREE plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do my URL&#8217;s now suddenly have a numerical suffix e.g /name-of-post-1234/</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good question. The answer is a bit technical. Becuase you could technically have a post and a category with exactly the same URL, we&#8217;ve had to add a way of differentiating between the two. For example you could have <code>domain.com/amazing-pictures/</code> which could be a category, but <code>domain.com/amazing-pictures/</code> could also be a single post. In WordPress they&#8217;re treated the same, but we need to know which is which. Therefore, your post will be suffixed by the unique post identifier. This is the industry standard way of doing it and is completely SEO safe.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
