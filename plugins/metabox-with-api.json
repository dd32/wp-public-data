The &#8220;Metabox API setting&#8221; option (under the &#8220;Setting&#8221; section) allows to store category api url and product api url.

We can also fetch the data at regular period of time. The plugin supports two level of category only (i.e. Parent and child category).</p>\n<p>The plugin also generate the metabox (named &#8220;Metabox API&#8221;) on the post or the page. Once you select the category from &#8220;Category&#8221; dropdown / select box, the product specific to that category will be populated to &#8220;Product&#8221; dropdown / select box. After selecting the product, you can generate the shortcode by clicking &#8220;Generate code&#8221; button. The generated shortcode can be used on any post or page which will display as product button in frontend.
