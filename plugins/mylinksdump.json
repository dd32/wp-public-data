        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>myLinksDump</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Move myLDAdd.php, myLDlinker.php and myLDRSS.php files from myLinksDump/extra<br />\nfolder to your wordpress installation root where your wp-config.php is.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Place <code>&lt;?php echo myLinksDump_show() ;?&gt;</code> in your templates. if you prefer you can use [myLinksDump] shortcode instead.</li>\n<li>If you want archive page, then make normal page and find its ID and then go<br />\nto myLinksDump setting page and enter it in Archive Page ID field. Finally<br />\nplace <code>&lt;?php myLinksDump_Archive() ;?&gt;</code> in page.php of your theme.</li>\n<li>You can also activate plug-in&#8217;s widget if you like.</li>\n<li>Some configuration options will be available under setting pane.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Is there any RSS feed for my link dump?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes there is. you can call myLinksDumpRSS.php file to show your link dump RSS feed. There is<br />\nalso an option to replace your feedburner address rather than http://yoursite/myLinksDumpRSS.php .</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can i customize the look of my link dump?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default there are some predefined styles in myLinksDump/styles folder in which you set the<br />\none you like the most. You can also put your stylesheet in  myLinksDump/styles folder and then<br />\nactivate it through admin panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can i find page ID?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on Pages-&gt; Edit link on wp admin area. Then click on the desired link and<br />\nwait for the next page to load. after this watch your browser address bar for<br />\ndestination link it shows. It must be something like this:</p>\n<p>http://www.xyz.com/wp-admin/page.php?action=edit&#038;post=14</p>\n<p>the last number in query string (14) is what we need.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the right places for putting &#8220; and &#8220;?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>&lt;?php echo myLinksDump_show() ;?&gt;</code> must be out of content loop. Because if you put it in content loop,<br />\nyou&#8217;ll see lots of link dumps as much as your post entries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&lt;?php myLinksDump_Archive() ;?&gt;</code> must be in content area. usually the best place to put this code is<br />\nright after <code>&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;</code> line in page.php of your theme.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I share my links with others?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thanks to myLinksDump RSS output you can share your links with others. It&#8217;s good idea to write some lines in<br />\nabout Archive page on how others can grab your links dump RSS output and use that in their blogs or sites.<br />\nNormal RSS address of your links dump is &#8216;/myLDRSS.php&#8217; (e.g: http://www.xyz.com/myLDRSS.php),<br />\nbut if you prefer you can burn this feed in feedburner and provide feedburner address instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Counter format?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>if it&#8217;s choosen for linksdump to be shown with clicks stats of each link then by default you will see click<br />\nstat in a pair of parentheses. So if you would like to change display format you need to put your desired<br />\nformat containig # character in which it reperensts clicks counts. for example if we like to show our stat like<br />\n[450 clicks] then we have to put [# clicks] in Counter format input box.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
