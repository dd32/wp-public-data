What&#8217;s causing the slowdown? Is it a plugin? Is it your host?</p>\n<p>Used with a bit of common sense, this powerful plugin will help blog administrators as well as software developers improve their WordPress blog performance.</p>\n<p>Perfect for WordPress site administrators, plugin and theme designers, developers</p>\n<p>Fully translatable.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Use</h3>\n<p>Here are more advanced ways to make use of <em>WP Tuner</em>. Please <a href=\"http://blogs.icta.net/plugins/wptuner\" title=\"(Visit the WP Tuner home page)\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">share your questions and/or stories</a> examples to share with others!</p>\n<p>1) Hook any WordPress action</p>\n<p>In wptuner.php, you will find a default set of action hooks. You can add as many hooks as you like for other actions. They look like this (just change &#8220;admin_footer&#8221; to the name of the action you want to measure):</p>\n<pre><code>add_action('admin_footer', 'wpTuneFilterTime' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each hook adds a line to the <em>WP Tuner</em> performance analysis table, when that action is triggered.</p>\n<p>2) Time anything at all in WordPress</p>\n<p>WP Tuner contains a function that causes performance analysis for any section of WordPress code. Just use<br />\n  wpTuneMarkTime(&#8216;My Marker string&#8217;);</p>\n<p>&#8230;at the beginning of the code you want analyzed. Add another marker at the end if needed.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose you want to know how much time is spent loading each of the plugins you have enabled. Here&#8217;s how to do it, by adding two simple lines to wp-settings.php:</p>\n<pre><code>if (function_exists(wpTuneMarkTime)) wpTuneMarkTime('Load Plugins'); // ** Add THIS line **\n\nif ( get_option('active_plugins') ) {\n  $current_plugins = get_option('active_plugins');\n  if ( is_array($current_plugins) ) {\n    foreach ($current_plugins as $plugin) {\n      if (function_exists(wpTuneMarkTime)) wpTuneMarkTime('Plugin: '.$plugin); // ** Add THIS line **\n      if ( '' != $plugin &amp;&amp; 0 == validate_file($plugin) &amp;&amp; file_exists(WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/' . $plugin) )\n        include_once(WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/' . $plugin);\n    }\n  }\n}&lt;h3&gt;Credits&lt;/h3&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many thanks to the WP Tuner translation team!</p>\n<p>\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439: <a href=\"http://lecactus.ru\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0441\u0443</a> (updated through WP Tuner 0.9.3)</p>\n<h3>Readme Validator</h3>\n<p>This readme was validated using:<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/validator/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/validator/</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <em>wptuner</em> folder (inside the zip file) to your <em>/wp-content/plugins/</em> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>The plugin management page <em>(Settings-&gt;WPtuner)</em> provides settings, hints, and troubleshooting if the plugin will not fully auto-install.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please report any install errors to me, at <a href=\"http://blogs.icta.net/plugins/wptuner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my site</a>. It will help if you can copy the <em>wpTuner Diagnostics</em> produced when you set the WP Tuner Debug Level to 1.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactive the existing plugin, to remove its hooks (in <em>wp-config.php</em>, etc)</li>\n<li>Copy the new files to replace the old (usually the plugins/wptuner folder)</li>\n<li>Activate the new plugin</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I&#8217;m having trouble getting it to work</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have you looked at the settings page (Settings-&gt;WP Tuner)? You&#8217;ll find installer error notes there. Most common: your WP root folder needs write permission (at least 0755), and <em>WP Tuner</em> must be able to set permissions on your <code>wp-config.php</code> file to make it editable.</li>\n<li>Are you logged in with Administrator permissions (level 10)? Normally, only admins see anything.</li>\n<li>If you continue to have trouble, please set the Debug Level to 1, copy the <em>wpTuner Diagnostics</em> and paste them into an error report at <a href=\"http://blogs.icta.net/plugins/wptuner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my site</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize WP Tuner?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s little reason to bother changing the CSS. This is an admin-only tool; your readers will not see anything. However, there&#8217;s some CSS at the top of <code>wptunershow.php</code>, and further down in <code>wptunersetup.php</code>.</p>\n<p>This is a fully translatable/localizable plugin. See the <code>wptuner.pot</code> file, and the online <em>gettext</em> tools such as poedit. Please send me your translations; I&#8217;ll make them part of the distribution with credit to you!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I examine performance in more detail?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Tuner is an entire performance analysis toolkit. The built-in admin settings provide a set of default measures that can be enabled without manual intervention.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptuner/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Advanced Use</a> hints section for some examples</p>\n</p>\n\n"
