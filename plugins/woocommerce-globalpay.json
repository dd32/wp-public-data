You can configure your permalink settings on the admin end by going to Settings -&gt; Permalinks and ensure that the option selected is NOT the default.</li>\n<li><strong>Configure your merchant credentials:</strong> WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; Payment Gateways -&gt; GlobalPay to configure the merchant credentials (either live or demo) for GlobalPay</li>\n<li><strong>Return URL:</strong> GlobalPay will require that you specify a URL on your site that your users will be redirected to after attempting to pay on GlobalPay. Use the following URL based on your website: <strong>YOURSITE.COM/globalpay-transaction-response</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Template Override:</strong> In the case of a <strong>failed</strong> payment attempt, when the user is redirected to your site from GlobalPay Woocommerce displays the text &#8216;Unfortunately your order cannot be processed as the originating bank/merchant has declined your transaction.&#8217;<br />\nThis text can be misleading. To remove it, an override has been included with WooCommerce GlobalPay. Go to woocommerce-globalpay/resources, copy the woocommerce folder and paste it in the folder of your current theme.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I get a GlobalPay Merchant ID?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to https://www.globalpay.com.ng/ to register. Alternatively, if you have a Zenith Bank account contact your branch to get started.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add the Naira currency to WooCommerce?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When WooCommerce GlobalPay is installed it will automatically add the Naira currency to WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Something went wrong when a user was redirected back from GlobalPay to my site. How do I know the status of the payment?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WooCommerce GlobalPay always confirms a payment transaction&#8217;s status from GlobalPay&#8217;s servers after a user returns to the merchant&#8217;s site. However, if the user for some reason is not properly redirected you can manually confirm the payment anytime. On the admin end, go to WooCommerce -&gt; Orders. Find the order in question and in the &#8220;Actions&#8221; section click on the requery button (see the second image on the [screenshots page] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-globalpay/screenshots/)). Give it a few seconds and the order&#8217;s status icon will change to reflect the payment information received from GlobalPay&#8217;s servers.</p>\n<p>NOTE: In WooCommerce, when an order is paid it is marked &#8220;Processing&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
