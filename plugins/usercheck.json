It works out of the box with a limit of 60 requests per hour. However, if you need higher limits, you can obtain a free API key by signing up at <a href=\"https://app.usercheck.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://app.usercheck.com/</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20the%20usercheck%20api%20is%20unavailable%3F'>\nWhat happens if the UserCheck API is unavailable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the API is unavailable, the plugin will allow the email to be considered valid to prevent disruption to your site&#8217;s functionality. An error message will be logged for your reference.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20increase%20the%20request%20limit%3F'>\nHow can I increase the request limit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To increase the request limit beyond 60 per hour, you can obtain an API key from UserCheck. Once you have the key, go to the UserCheck settings in your WordPress admin panel and enter the key there.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
