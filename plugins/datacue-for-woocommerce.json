        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.datacue.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DataCue</a> shows each customer the right content at the right time on your WooCommerce storefront. Unlike other personalization and recommendation plugins, we change banners, display the right products and notifications to each visitor. For instance, if a visitor is looking at kitchen products, we show related kitchen banners and relevant product recommendations to his/her browsing history. This creates a truly 1:1 engaging shopping experience and grows conversion and sales.<br />\nDataCue clients have seen up to a 30% improvement in conversion and 20% increase in average order value.</p>\n<h4>WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH DATACUE?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase engagement with dynamic banners. Upload banner images on our dashboard and DataCue automatically shows each visitor the banners they are most interested in. No rules, no manual settings. </li>\n<li>Improve conversion and upsell with product recommendations. Display the recommendations on any page. DataCue has multiple product recommedation types for you to choose from (Personalized products, similar products, related products, recently viewed and trending products). Choose what works best for your brand.</li>\n<li>Create urgency with notifications. At DataCue, we think popups are intrusive so we came up with notifications which have been personalized to each visitor&#8217;s browsing history. We show stock and promotion alerts of products each visitor viewed in past 30 days, no more spamming everyone with the same promotion!</li>\n<li>Adjust the look&amp;feel of recommendations to your branding from our dashboard.

        "faq": "\n<h4>How much does DataCue cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our growth plan is 59USD/month with 2% revenue sharing once DataCue starts driving more than 2,950USD in revenue for your store. We offer 30-day money back guarantee so you can test DataCue and measure the value we bring for yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does conversion attribution work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>DataCue is like a concierge or seller inside your e-commerce store. Our job is to give each visitor personalized suggestions on what products best fit what they&#8217;re looking for, making them interact with the website. The ultimate goal is to make them convert. If a visitor clicks on a DataCue suggestion and buys the same product within 5 days (the avg. period of exploration and buy), we&#8217;ll label that order as &#8220;DataCue sale&#8221;. This is a lot stricter than most tools who attribute any purchase after one click!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I set a monthly budget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yup! If you want more predictability, you can set a budget. Your bill will never exceed it. When we’re close to the budget, we’ll let you know so you can decide whether to increase it. When the budget is reached, your store visitors get non-personalized suggestions like top products and banners till the next billing cycle.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to set up any rules?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope! Unlike most similar software, we don’t need you to spend hours setting anything up. We’ll learn from what your customers are actually doing to give them helpful suggestions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who should I contact if I have more questions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can write to support@datacue.co and we&#8217;ll be in touch as soon as possible.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
