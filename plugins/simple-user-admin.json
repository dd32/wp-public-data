You can also easily change roles for a user for all their blogs, or change roles for all users of a particular blog.</p>\n<p>The plugin also makes use of the __() function to allow for easy translation.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to Joost from http://yoast.com/ for fixing the plugin to work with MultiSite.

I&#8217;d noticed that the usual blog admin screen is pretty flaky when trying to edit users, especially if there are a lot of blog options. Hopefully this plugin helps other developers too.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
