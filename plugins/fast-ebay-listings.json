You can narrow down items to display by entering eBay search query, an eBay category, eBay seller(s) or min/max prices.</p>\n<p>The display of the results can be tailored into a grid with dimensions of your choosing and optionally as a slideshow.</p>\n<p>If any parameters are left blank, defaults from the plugin setting will be used.</p>\n<h4>eBay Seller Feedback</h4>\n<p>Present the feedback rating and comments from your eBay seller account or shop, with links to it. A great way to show your reputation on your company website.</p>\n<h4>eBay Item</h4>\n<p>Present details of a single eBay item listing.

You can of course filter this by a given eBay category, seller, price, etc.</p>\n<h4>SmartLinks</h4>\n<p>Fast eBay Listings includes a SmartLinks tool to turn all other eBay links on your site into promotable affiliate links. When enabled, it will automatically convert all of your eBay links and connect them to your Campaign ID.</p>\n<p>This is a great feature if your site already has many links to eBay that you wish to make affiliate links and thus earn on click-throughs via the eBay Partner Network.</p>\n<p>SmartLinks will not update any existing affiliate eBay links, it will only update unaffiliated eBay links you may have on your site.</p>\n<p>Affiliated links will be made &#8216;nofollow&#8217; links and optionally, open in a new window/tab.</p>\n<h4>Terms &amp; Conditions</h4>\n<p>By using this plugin you must abide by the eBay and eBay Partner Network code of conduct. Including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always display the &#8216;Right Now on eBay&#8217; logo alongside eBay results.</li>\n<li>Promote eBay items alongside unacceptable topics, e.g. sexually explicit material, violence, weapons, illegal goods, and discriminatory or hate-orientated content.</li>\n<li>Improper influence, to trick or mislead an end user into clicking a link to eBay (ensure links to eBay contain the term &#8216;eBay&#8217; in their text). </li>\n<li>All sites displaying links monetized via the eBay Partner Network (EPN) must show an ad disclosure notice in accordance with the EPN Network Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fast eBay Listings reserves the right to block usage for non-complying sites.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20just%20show%20items%20from%20my%20own%20ebay%20store%3F'>\nHow do I just show items from my own eBay store?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The simplest method is to enter your eBay user name in the setting field &#8216;Default Seller ID(s)&#8217;. Then all block, shortcode or widget queries will filter results to just the stock you have listed on eBay.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can set the eBay seller to filter results per block or shortcode you add to your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20get%20no%20results%20when%20searching%20by%20my%20seller%20id%3F'>\nWhy do I get no results when searching by my seller id?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The latest eBay APIs mandate that any queries on a seller ID must also search by a category ID or some search query terms. Try setting a search query and/or category ID in addition to your seller id.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20earn%20money%20from%20ebay%20referrals%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I earn money from eBay referrals with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, you need to sign up to the <a href=\"https://partnernetwork.ebay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">eBay Partner Network</a>.<br />\nThen create a Campaign within your EPN account.<br />\nEnter the 10-digit Campaign ID into the &#8216;Affiliate Campaign ID&#8217; plugin settings field.<br />\nDone!</p>\n<p>Note: the free version of this plugin will divert 50% of eBay links generated to earn the developer commission and help maintain and support this plugin&#8217;s development.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20fast%20ebay%20listings%20display%20a%20link%20to%20the%20author%27s%20website%20under%20results%3F'>\nDoes Fast eBay Listings display a link to the author&#8217;s website under results?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No!<br />\nFast eBay Listings <em>does not</em> add any external links on your website back to the author&#8217;s site. This clutters up your website, hurts your search engine ranking and is against WordPress plugin guidelines!<br />\nOnly links to eBay items you want on your website are presented and these are all tagged as &#8216;nofollow&#8217; to avoid any negative SEO impact. You can optionally choose if eBay links should open in a new tab/window.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20slideshows%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat types of slideshows are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fast eBay Listings supports several types of slideshow and pagination; manual, auto, &#8216;load more&#8217; button, list by category.</p>\n<p>Manual: Will present slides that visitors can manually step through using buttons beneath.</p>\n<p>Auto: Will present a slideshow that automatically steps through the slides, fading between each every 10 seconds by default. You can change the slideshow speed in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Load more&#8217; button: Will present a button for visitors to load the next slide/page of results beneath the rest.</p>\n<p>List by Category: Will present a long list of results grouped under eBay category headings.</p>\n<p>All slideshows can be configured with as many slides as desired, limited only by the number of items returned from eBay.</p>\n<p>Each slide can be configured with as many rows and columns as desired to produce a grid of items per slide.</p>\n<p>Manual and Auto slideshow work best when displaying a grid with 1 or 2 rows of results. The &#8216;Load more&#8217; button works best when displaying large numbers of results for a visitor to scroll through (especially mobile users).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20exclude%20keywords%20from%20my%20ebay%20search%20query%3F'>\nHow do exclude keywords from my eBay search query?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The search query field uses standard eBay syntax, so you can prefix a keyword with the minus sign to exclude it. For example:</p>\n<p>Sony TV -CRT</p>\n<p>Will search for all listings with the words &#8216;sony&#8217; and &#8216;tv&#8217;, but exclude those with the word &#8216;crt&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20search%20for%20ebay%20listings%20with%20word-a%20or%20word-b%20in%20the%20title%3F'>\nHow do I search for eBay listings with word-A or word-B in the title?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the parenthesis eBay search syntax. For example:</p>\n<p>Yamaha (motorcycle, motorbike)</p>\n<p>Will search for all eBay listings with the word &#8216;Yamaha&#8217; and &#8216;motorcycle&#8217; or &#8216;motorbike&#8217; in the title.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20show%20ebay%20items%20being%20sold%20by%20different%20wordpress%20users%3F'>\nHow do I show eBay items being sold by different WordPress users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fast eBay Listings has added a new metadata entry to each WordPress user&#8217;s profile page, where they can enter their own eBay username.</p>\n<p>The search shortcode and widgets that can filter results by an eBay seller, also accept a special keyword &#8216;author&#8217;, which will trigger the plugin to look up the current post or page&#8217;s author and retrieve the above eBay username from their profile. This will then be used to filter the eBay search results.</p>\n<p>If the WordPress user has no eBay username set, then the plugin will fall back to the default seller as configured in the plugin options.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20avoid%20ebay%20images%20from%20being%20scaled%20in%20the%20browser%3F'>\nHow do I avoid eBay images from being scaled in the browser?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The latest eBay API serves images in the sizes 225px and 1000px. To avoid in-browser scaling, choose one of these sizes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20customize%20the%20colors%20etc%20of%20listings%3F'>\nHow do I customize the colors etc of listings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Within the settings, you choose to inherit your WordPress theme&#8217;s color scheme (default), black text on white background, or white text on a black background style.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can override the CSS styles manually. Please get in touch with the visual customization you would like in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20customize%20the%20fields%20displayed%20on%20listings%3F'>\nHow do I customize the fields displayed on listings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Within the setting you can choose which fields to display for search results on Blocks/Shortcodes, results shown on widgets and for the single item block/shortcode separately.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20remove%20the%20%27right%20now%20on%20ebay%27%20logo%20that%20is%20always%20shown%3F'>\nCan I remove the &#8216;Right Now on eBay&#8217; logo that is always shown?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ‘Right Now on eBay’ logo is mandated by eBay T&amp;Cs and must be shown next to any eBay content. To remove it would violate eBay’s policies and could put your eBay Partner Network membership at risk.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Including, but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always display the &#8216;Right Now on eBay&#8217; logo alongside eBay results.</li>\n<li>Promote eBay items alongside unacceptable topics, e.g. sexually explicit material, violence, weapons, illegal goods, and discriminatory or hate-orientated content.</li>\n<li>Improper influence, to trick or mislead an end user into clicking a link to eBay (ensure links to eBay contain the term &#8216;eBay&#8217; in their text). </li>\n<li>All sites displaying links monetized via the eBay Partner Network (EPN) must show an ad disclosure notice in accordance with the EPN Network Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fast eBay Listings reserves the right to block usage for non-complying sites.</p>\n",
