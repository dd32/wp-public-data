Posting, voting and commenting on the STEEM platform earns rewards in the form of STEEM tokens, a cryptocurrency that can be traded with anyone with no transaction costs and VERY LOW transaction times.

As a permanent blockchain, it isn&#8217;t susceptible to censorship or centralized control. Also, rewards earned also gain you an entrance to the world of crypto-currency without the hassle of fiat conversion and other headaches.</p>\n<p><strong>DON&#8217;T GET BIT BY CHEETAH!</strong></p>\n<p>The STEEM platform has a great community and seeks to keep the quality of the site high.  If you know about SEO, you know that search engines penalize sites that have content duplicated in various places online.  So plagarism, content spam, and other such activities are not &#8220;victimeless&#8221; for the STEEM community.  Those who engage in these activities hurt the value of not only the STEEM platform, but also decrease the value of the STEEM crypto-currency.</p>\n<p>In an effort to avoid this, some community members have established systems which check for duplicate content and will inform the rest of the community which may impact whether others upvote and comment.
