WP Developers Homepage can pull your ticket information from there too!</p>\n<p>Simply add your GitHub username to the WP Developers Homepage settings.</p>\n<p>Note: Your GitHub repos for your themes/plugins must match your slug.  So for example, this plugin&#8217;s slug is wp-developers-homepage, so the GitHub url for it&#8217;s repo is <a href=\"https://github.com/toolstack/wp-developers-homepage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/toolstack/wp-developers-homepage</a>.</p>\n<p>WP Developers Homepage uses the GitHub API to retrieve the ticket information, which by default has a limit of 60 request/hour for unauthenticated users.  Each plugin/theme you have will generate at least one request, and if you have a significant number of tickets (over 100) it will generate 1 request/repo/100 items.</p>\n<p>So if you have 5 plugins, with 150 tickets per plugin, you&#8217;ll generate 10 requests (2 per plugin).</p>\n<p>If you need more than 60 requests/hour, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/tokens/?type=beta\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create an access token</a> that will increase this limit.  The token should be limited to the plugin/theme repos you have and should have no permission assigned to it.  <em>DO NOT</em> reuse an existing token that you have assigned permissions to.</p>\n<p><em>Warning</em>: The access token will be stored in plain text inside of the WordPress database!</p>\n<p>Once you have the token, go to the WP Developers Homepage settings and save it.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode</h4>\n<p>The shortcode is in the format of <code>[wp-developers-homepage type=tickets|stats]</code>.</p>\n<p>Type came be either left off (tickets are the default in that case), or be set to either <code>tickets</code> or <code>stats</code> to display the respective table.</p>\n<p>Be aware that the stats table is very wide, so if you have a narrow theme installed it may overflow into a scrolling window.</p>\n",

This is done to limit the number of request going to WordPress/GitHub.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20%22retrieve%20all%20tickets%22%20disabled%20by%20default%3F'>\nWhy is &#8220;Retrieve all tickets&#8221; disabled by default?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have a lot of old tickets, or many plugins/themes, it takes quite a bit of processing and data to get <em>all</em> of the tickets.  Instead, by default, only <em>active</em> tickets are retrieved.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20the%20unresolved%2Fresolved%20counts%20on%20the%20statistics%20table%20incorrect%3F'>\nWhy are the Unresolved/Resolved counts on the statistics table incorrect?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The statistics table values for Unresolved/Resolved are calculated based upon the data stored by WP Developers Homepage, and so two options can limit what is retrieved from wordpress.org:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Retrieve all tickets, which is disabled by default.</li>\n<li>Age limit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These options tell WP Developers Homepage to stop retrieving data based upon either status or age of the tickets.  As inactive/old tickets are therefore not stored, they are not reflected in the statistics table.</p>\n<p>If you wish to see a true representation of all your tickets, set the age limit to 0, and enabled the retrieve all tickets options.</p>\n<p>This will significantly increase the time taken to download new data from wordpress.org.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
