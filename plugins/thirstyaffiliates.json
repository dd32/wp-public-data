It’s just another post type in your admin and another button on your Visual editor.</p>\n<p>When you are writing blog posts, you can highlight a word and click the “TA” button. This works just like the built-in link tool, you can search for the affiliate link you created earlier by name.</p>\n<p>You can even use the Quick Add button to add affiliate links to ThirstyAffiliates on the fly while you are writing.</p>\n<p><strong>🔗 BUILT-IN AFFILIATE LINK SHORTNER/LINK CLOAKER</strong><br />\nCreate pretty links from the affiliate links you&#8217;ve placed on the site. ThirstyAffiliates will use a /recommends/ prefix by default for your pretty links, but this can be easily changed to match your preferences.</p>\n<p>**💰 SEAMLESS STRIPE SALES***<br />\nCreate a branded, one-click path to payment with NEW ThirstyPay™ Links. Share your link and start selling anywhere – instantly.</p>\n<p><strong>⚙️ BETTER LINK MANAGEMENT</strong><br />\nYou can group your affiliate links into hierarchical categories. eg. placing all Amazon links within an “Amazon” category, or all software links in a “Software” category.</p>\n<p>Managing your links in ThirstyAffiliates means there is only one place to change the destination URL if required rather than having to go back and replace the link in potentially hundreds of articles.</p>\n<p><strong>🔃 SAFE REDIRECTS &amp; SMART UNCLOAKING</strong><br />\nYou can choose from 301 (default), 302, or 307 redirects, all of which are safe link redirects.</p>\n<p>Link redirects protect your affiliate links from being scraped and replaced by malware in your visitor’s browser.</p>\n<p>There is also a smart uncloaking feature so if the affiliate program you are using (such as Amazon Associates) does not like your links behind a redirect, you can still use ThirstyAffiliates.
