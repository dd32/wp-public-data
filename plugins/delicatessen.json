        "description": "<p>This plug-in works while you sleep and tries to find out who&#8217;s linked your blog posts and/or pages in delicious.com (formerly known as del.icio.us).</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>When installed, the plug-in runs automatically in the background when somebody visits your blog &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to add any tag or edit any template to make it work, just make sure you have visitors ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>You can view the results of these queries by clicking the new <em>Delicatessen</em> option under the <em>Dashboard</em> header on the top left area of the admin area (i.e. exactly the same place where Akismet places its results link).</p>\n<h3>Uninstall</h3>\n<p>Just deactivate the plug-in, and remove its folder from the wp-content/plugins directory.

        "installation": "<ul>\n<li>Upload the full <code>delicatessen</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it!</li>\n<li>If there are any issues, the plug-in will let you know ðŸ˜‰</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> php5 and WP2.8.5+ are required. The plug-in has not been tested with any other configuration.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why are there time limits? Can I just set it to zero and get results more often?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because otherwise the plug-in would end up doing too many requests in too little time and delicious.com won&#8217;t like it &#8212; and will ban you while they are on it.</p>\n<p>The default settings correspond to the absolute minimum they suggest. In fact, if you have to change them, it&#8217;s got to be in order to increase the values, so that the plug-in queries <em>less</em> often.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So how does this work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>OK, let&#8217;s get technical. When somebody visits any post or page in your blog (and I am talking about the WordPress concept of &#8216;page&#8217; here), the plug-in checks if we have any information about this page in delicious. If that&#8217;s the case, and the data hasn&#8217;t expired yet, there&#8217;s nothing else to be done. Otherwise, we&#8217;ll try to query delicious, but only if a minimum amount of time has elapsed since the last time we contacted delicious.</p>\n<p>So for this plug-in to work, you need to have visitors. Although if your blog is indexed by search engines, it should be fine because they act as visitors anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the plug-in say there are only 100 bookmarks for a given page? There are more!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because delicious doesn&#8217;t provide that data. They only show up to the latest 100 bookmarks. If you want to see more, you have to visit the bookmark page in delicious ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Planned features</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a widget so that proud site owners can show how popular their pages are.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.0.2</h4>\n<p>Being a bit more user friendly when there are no bookmarks yet.</p>\n<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<p>Added missing screenshots</p>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Totally revamped version, net friendly and all that.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First public release (2007)</li>\n</ul>\n"
