        "installation": "<p>There are three (3) ways to install my plugin: automatically, upload, or manually.</p>\n<h4>Install Method 1: Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li>\n<li>Where it says “Keyword” in a dropdown, change it to “Author”</li>\n<li>In the search form, type “TessaWatkinsLLC” (results may begin populating as you type but my plugins will only show when the full name is there)</li>\n<li>Once you’ve found my plugin in the search results that appear, click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and wait for the installation process to complete.</li>\n<li>Once the installation process is completed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to activate my plugin.</li>\n<li>After this plugin is activated, see below for additional instructions for setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Install Method 2: Upload via WordPress Admin</h4>\n<p>This method involves is a little more involved. You don’t need to leave your web browser, but you’ll need to download and then upload the files yourself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessible-reading/\" rel=\"ugc\">Download my plugin</a> from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.</li>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Upload Plugin</strong> button at the top of the screen.</li>\n<li>Select the zip file from your local file system that was downloaded in step 1.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and wait for the installation process to complete.</li>\n<li>Once the installation process is completed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to activate my plugin.</li>\n<li>After this plugin is activated, see below for additional instructions for setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Install Method 3: Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>This method is the most involved as it requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessible-reading/\" rel=\"ugc\">Download my plugin</a> from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.</li>\n<li>Unzip the contents; you should have a single folder named <code>accessible-reading</code>.</li>\n<li>Connect to your WordPress server with your favorite SFTP client.</li>\n<li>Copy folder from step 2 to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> folder in your WordPress directory. Once the folder and all of its files are there, installation is complete.</li>\n<li>Now log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong>. You should now see my plugin in your list.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Activate</strong> button under my plugin to activate it.</li>\n<li>After this plugin is installed and activated, see below for additional instructions for setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>After Plugin Installation and Activation</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"https://aurisecreative.com/accessible-reading-api-key/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bionic Reading® on Rapid API</a> to get an API key. Free and paid versions are available.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Tools &gt; Accessible Reading</strong> to add the API key to your settings.</li>\n<li>Optionally modify the fixation and saccade to suit your preferences.</li>\n<li>Creating a new post or updating an existing one will generate the accessible content for that post. Once a post has accessible content, a toggle button will appear on the frontend for site visitors to use.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20an%20api%20key%3F'>\nWhy do I need an API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses the <a href=\"https://aurisecreative.com/accessible-reading-api-key/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bionic Reading® API</a> to generate accessible text and it requires each user to have a unique API key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20an%20api%20key%2C%20how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nI have an API key, how do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can set the API key for the plugin in two ways.</p>\n<p>The first way is adding it in the plugin settings. While logged into WordPress, navigate to Tools &gt; Accessible Reading and then under the Settings tab, you&#8217;ll see a text field for API Key to copy/pase it into. Press the Save All Settings button at the bottom.</p>\n<p>The second way is defining the <code>ACCESSIBLE_READING_API_KEY</code> constant variable in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file and setting it&#8217;s value to your API key. For multisite installations, this will set all of those sites to use the same API key. Example usage:<br />\n    define(&#8216;ACCESSIBLE_READING_API_KEY&#8217;,&#8217;your-api-key-goes-here&#8217;);</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20%60accessible_reading%60%20shortcode%20and%20how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nWhat is the `accessible_reading` shortcode and how do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>accessible_reading</code> shortcode allows you to add accessible text with a toggle switch anywhere on your WordPress website. To ensure your shortcode&#8217;s accessible content is automatically generated, a user with <code>edit post</code> capabilities must preview the page using the shortcode at least once while you have enough API requests for the day.</p>\n<p>To use it, simply wrap the text you want to make accessible with the shortcode while also adding an <code>id</code> attribute. For example:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading id=&#8221;foo&#8221;&#093;This content will become accessible!&#091;/accessible_reading&#093;</p>\n<p>This shortcode will also add the toggle switch to enable/disable the accessible content automatically, so if you&#8217;re using it in multiple locations and want just one switch, set the <code>hide_toggle</code> attribute to <code>1</code>  to disable it like this:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading id=&#8221;bar&#8221; hide_toggle=&#8221;1&#8243;&#093;This content will become accessible but <strong>without showing a toggle!</strong>&#091;/accessible_reading&#093;</p>\n<p>This shortcode saves it&#8217;s content to a post&#8217;s meta data, so if you&#8217;re using it in a global area of your website like your header, footer, or sidebar, you should assign the shortcode a post or page ID to save it once to avoid saving it to every post or page it&#8217;s visible on like this:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading id=&#8221;david&#8221; post_id=&#8221;23&#8243;&#093;This content will always save and pull it&#8217;s accessible content from post ID 23&#091;/accessible_reading&#093;</p>\n<p>If you want to temporarily disable the automatic processing without removing the shortcode, you can set the <code>disable</code> attribute to <code>1</code> like this:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading id=&#8221;bowie&#8221; disabled=&#8221;1&#8243;&#093;This content won&#8217;t be accessible, nor will it have a toggle. <em>Yet</em>.&#091;/accessible_reading&#093;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20%60accessible_reading_toggle%60%20shortcode%20and%20how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nWhat is the `accessible_reading_toggle` shortcode and how do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>accessible_reading_toggle</code> shortcode allows you to add a toggle switch anywhere on your WordPress website. To use it, simply place the self-closing shortcode anywhere on your WordPress website. For example:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading_toggle/&#093;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20%60accessible_reading_content%60%20shortcode%20and%20how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nWhat is the `accessible_reading_content` shortcode and how do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>accessible_reading_content</code> shortcode allows you to add pre-made accessible content anywhere on your WordPress website that a toggle switch will display when turned on.</p>\n<p>To use it, wrap the accessible content with the shortcode. For example:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading_content&#093;&lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;Lor&lt;/b&gt;em&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;ips&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;dol&lt;/b&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;am&lt;/b&gt;et.&lt;/span&gt;&#091;/accessible_reading_content&#093;</p>\n<p>You can optionally add additional HTML classes to the outermost wrapper by setting the value to the <code>classes</code> attribute. If setting multiple classes, they should be separated by a single space. For example:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading_content classes=&#8221;custom-class-1 custom-class-2&#8243;&#093;&lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;Lor&lt;/b&gt;em&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;ips&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;dol&lt;/b&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#8221;bionic-w bionic&#8221;&gt;&lt;b class=&#8221;bionic-b bionic&#8221;&gt;am&lt;/b&gt;et.&lt;/span&gt;&#091;/accessible_reading_content&#093;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20%60accessible_reading_original_content%60%20shortcode%20and%20how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nWhat is the `accessible_reading_original_content` shortcode and how do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To complement the <code>accessible_reading_content</code> shortcode, the <code>accessible_reading_original_content</code> shortcode allows you to add the original content that a toggle switch will hide when accessible reading is turned on.</p>\n<p>To use it, simply wrap the original content with the shortcode. For example:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading_original_content&#093;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&#091;/accessible_reading_original_content&#093;</p>\n<p>You can optionally add additional HTML classes to the outermost wrapper by setting the value to the classes attribute. If setting multiple classes, they should be separated by a single space. For example:<br />\n    &#091;accessible_reading_original_content classes=&#8221;custom-class-1 custom-class-2&#8243;&#093;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&#091;/accessible_reading_original_content&#093;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20adding%20this%20plugin%20to%20an%20existing%20website%2C%20can%20i%20use%20this%20to%20automatically%20generate%20content%20for%20posts%20in%20bulk%3F'>\nI&#8217;m adding this plugin to an existing website, can I use this to automatically generate content for posts in bulk?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! In the plugin settings (Tools &gt; Accessible Reading), you&#8217;ll find the &#8220;Bulk Update&#8221; tab. There you can configure a bulk update. Starting a dry-run first will tell you how many API requests will be used and approximately how long it will take.</p>\n<p>This feature uses the WordPres CRON to reduce your server&#8217;s load and respects your plan&#8217;s daily API limit to prevent overages. If your bulk update uses more than what your plan allows, it will automatically schedule to continue the next day, so larger websites may take a few days to complete.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20the%20official%20bionic%20reading%C2%AE%20wordpress%20plugin%3F'>\nIs this the official Bionic Reading® WordPress plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this WordPress plugin is not a product of Bionic Reading®. It was developed by an independent and disabled web developer that wants to bring more accessibility to the digital space. However, this plugin uses the official Bionic Reading® API to generate accessible text. If you pay for a premium API plan, that money goes toward the official makers of Bionic Reading®, not this plugin developer.
