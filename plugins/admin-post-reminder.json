        "faq": "\n<h4>How does the plugin know if the current logged in user is the admin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Admin Post Reminder checks to see if the current user has the ability to manage (add/edit/delete) users. If so, they are considered an admin and the reminder is displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this plugin work with role-manager plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some plugins allow for custom user roles. This allows people besides just an admin to manage various parts of a site that are usually not allowed by their WordPress user level.</p>\n<p><em>Admin Post Reminder</em> should still work with these types of plugins. If a user has the ability to manage other users information, they are viewed as an admin user and the message is displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the alert only show on the Write Post page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For 2 main reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>An admin can create a new post from any page in the backend by using the admin bar and choosing &#8216;New Post&#8217;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some WordPress plugins provide other places where new posts can be added or edited (<em>Flutter</em>, for example, has the option of writing posts in a custom write panel).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Instead of trying to guess where a user&#8217;s going to be writing their posts or what other plugins are installed, <em>Admin Post Reminder</em> simply displays an alert on all backend pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work on versions of WordPress prior to 2.8?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly. But since this plugin is targeted to security-conscious people, it&#8217;s always best to use the most recent versions fo WordPress.</p>\n<p>To read more about this plugin and why you might want to use it, visit the author&#8217;s site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://esdev.net/wordpress-plugins/admin-post-reminder/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Admin Post Reminder</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
