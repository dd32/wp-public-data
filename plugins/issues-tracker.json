        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20debug%20a%20wordpress%20website%3F'>\nHow do I debug a WordPress website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To debug a WordPress website, follow these steps:<br />\n* Enable needed switchers in header of Issues Tracker plugin.<br />\n* The server will log errors into the <code>wp-content/debug.log</code> file. You can search this log file directly on the server or within your CMS using the Issues Tracker plugin.<br />\n* Keep in mind that after enabling debug mode, your website&#8217;s behavior may change, and errors may be displayed to users or administrators.</p>\n<p>For more detailed information, refer to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/\" rel=\"ugc\">official WP debug guide</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20debug.log%20important%3F'>\nWhy is the debug.log important?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>debug.log</code> is a crucial component of the WordPress system for debugging code, encompassing core, plugins, and themes. It plays a vital role in ensuring code quality and the smooth operation of your website.</p>\n<p>You should aim to maintain an empty <code>debug.log</code> file, free from notices, warnings, or critical errors. If a new line appears in the <code>debug.log</code>, take prompt action to resolve the underlying code issue to provide the highest quality user experience for your website visitors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20should%20i%20do%20with%20404%20errors%20on%20wordpress%3F'>\nWhat should I do with 404 errors on WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In WordPress, a 404 page is displayed when a requested page is not available, often accompanied by the message &#8220;Page Not Found.&#8221; These 404 errors indicate a need for improving the user experience. Numerous errors of this kind can deter users from your website and negatively impact search engine optimization.</p>\n<p>Search engine crawlers do not index 404 pages, which can lead to a decrease in your website&#8217;s search result rankings. It&#8217;s essential to address and resolve 404 errors to enhance your website&#8217;s usability and SEO performance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20common%20wordpress%20issues%20that%20can%20be%20tracked%20in%20the%20debug.log%20file%3F'>\nWhat are the common WordPress issues that can be tracked in the debug.log file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>debug.log</code> file serves as the default issues tracking log for WordPress. It provides valuable insights into various plugin errors. While some of these errors may not be critical immediately, they can lead to severe issues, such as the &#8220;White Screen of Death,&#8221; in the future.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use the <code>debug.log</code> file to track errors in the code of the active theme. Regularly monitoring and addressing these issues is essential for maintaining the stability and functionality of your WordPress website.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
