For WooCommerce 2.1.x, click on the Checkout Tab.</li>\n<li>Select PayHub as the default payment processor and save the changes.</li>\n<li>Click on PayHub Settings button.</li>\n<li>Enter in your PayHub API credentials n the fields provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to find your API credentials</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Log into the PayHub VirtualHub site (go to http://payhub.com and click on Login in the top left)</li>\n<li>Once logged in, click on the Admin navigation link at the top right.</li>\n<li>Under the General heading, click on the 3rd Party API link.</li>\n<li>Copy down your Username, Password, and Terminal ID.  Please note the username and password is case sensitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes on Security</h3>\n<p>This plugin requires validation of the host SSL certificate for PayHub servers.  This is important as it greatly reduces the chance of a successful &#8220;man in the middle&#8221; attack.</p>\n<p>If you go through the installation and everything works fine, then you don&#8217;t have to worry about the rest of this section.  If you are experiencing a problem where you receive a blank error when trying to process cards and the transaction never actually processes then read on&#8230;</p>\n<p>Since our plugin uses cURL (http://curl.haxx.se/) to send transaction requests, you need to make sure that cURL knows where to find the CA certificate with which to validate our API SSL certs.  This is generally not a problem with hosted setups, but if you have built out your own server then you may find that this is a problem because newer versions of cURL don&#8217;t include a CA bundle by default.  In this case, if you are using PHP 5.3.7 or greater you can:</p>\n<p>*download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and save it somewhere on your server.<br />\n*update php.ini &#8212; add curl.cainfo = &#8220;PATH_TO/cacert.pem&#8221;</p>\n<p>This solutions was shamelessly borrowed from the Stack Overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6400300/php-curl-https-causing-exception-ssl-certificate-problem-verify-that-the-ca-cer.  Gotta love Stack Overflow ;^).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can dig into the PayHub plugin itself and add the following key/value pair to the $c_opts array: CURLOPT_CAINFO =&gt; &#8220;payth/to/ca-bundle.pem&#8221;.  See http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php for more info.</p>\n<h3>How to get support</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions you can contact PayHub at:<br />\n(415) 306-9476 from 8AM &#8211; 5PM PST M-F<br />\nor email us at wecare@payhub.com</p>\n",
