By default this will not show on mobile phones.</li>\n<li>To have your contact form shown on all devices (mobile and desktop), add the attribute devices=&#8217;all&#8217;. Example: [BT_BUTTON devices=&#8217;all&#8217;]</li>\n<li>To fix your contact form to the right side of your website add the attribute fixed=&#8221;true&#8221;. You can also change your label with the attribute label=&#8221;Text Us Now&#8221; (&#8220;Text Us Now&#8221; is default). Change the width of your form when open by adding the attribute width=&#8221;500&#8243; (500 is default).

To deactivate a widget and delete its settings, drag it back off the sidebar.</li>\n<li>Under the location of the Biz Text Widget, click the widget and enter a title.</li>\n<li>You can enable, display on Mobile Phone, Show Form, Fix to Right Side, and subjects for that specific form only.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20forms%20can%20i%20fix%20to%20the%20right%20side%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow many forms can I fix to the right side on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>At any time, there will be only one fixed form displayed on your website. If you enable the fixed option for multiple forms, only the first form will appear. </li>\n<li>Fixed forms created by shortcodes take priority over fixed forms created by the widget. </li>\n<li>You are still able to have multiple forms displayed on your website that are not fixed to the right side.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20come%20my%20fixed%20form%20is%20displayed%20behind%20images%20and%20text%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow come my fixed form is displayed behind images and text on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is due to the fact that the z-index attribute of the form is too low, and as a result, other elements of your website will appear above the form. To fix this, you must increase your z-index value until it is higher than other element&#8217;s z-index.</li>\n<li>We recommend incrementing your z-index value by 200 until your fixed form is displayed above any overlapping images and/or text. </li>\n<li>In the Biz Text Contact Form plugin, the z-index value can be found in &#8216;Edit Contact Form&#8217; under &#8216;Fixed Form Sidebar CSS Options&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20not%20receiving%20any%20email%20notifications%20from%20the%20contact%20form.%20what%20is%20happening%3F'>\nI am not receiving any email notifications from the contact form. What is happening?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, ensure you have to send to email option enabled. This checkbox can be found in the admin section, in &#8216;Settings&#8217; under  &#8216;Allow to Receive Email&#8217;. If you are using shortcodes to display the contact form, you can also enable the send to email option by adding the attribute email=&#8221;True&#8221; to your shortcode. </li>\n<li>Another possible solution is to install a third-party SMTP plugin to help with your configurations.</li>\n<li>You can also add your phone number to recieve text notifications about email inquiries from the contact. This feature allows you to remain informed about any emails even if there are issues with email notifications.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20my%20forms%20showing%20up%20on%20the%20page%3F'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t my forms showing up on the page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, check if you have a verified Biz Text Id saved in the administrative settings in your WordPress Dashboard. Next, check if you have clicked in the &#8220;Activate Form&#8221; checkbox in the administrative settings. Without these two values, no forms will appear on the website.</li>\n<li>If you are adding a form via widgets, ensure that you have clicked the &#8220;Show Form&#8221; checkbox in the widget settings.</li>\n<li>If you are adding a form via shortcode, double-check the formatting of your attributes.<br />\nEvery attribute must enclose their values within a pair of quotes like this: [BT_CONTACT_FORM email=&#8221;choose&#8221;].</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20my%20own%20styles%20or%20classes%20to%20the%20form%3F'>\nCan I add my own styles or classes to the Form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, under &#8216;Edit Contact Form&#8217; in Admin you can enter one or many classes, with each class separated by a comma.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20roles%20can%20see%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat roles can see the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Biz Text Admin, Editor, and Administrator.
