It&#8217;s very effective. We put it on one site that was getting a lot of comment spam, and now there is none. Not one. And we don&#8217;t get any contact form spam on sites that use the technique.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;Block Comment Spam Bots&#8221;, and can be found in the WP plugin repository.

The current htaccess file is shown for information purposes.</li>\n<li>Added suggestions for the htaccess file, and advice on how to work with your hosting company to make changes.</li>\n<li>Added a new option to limit login attempts at 4 failed. Any more will cause a timeout delay of 5 minutes befor another login can be attempted. This eliminates login brute force attacks.</li>\n<li>Changed the process that adds the site logo shown at the top of the optional login screen (if enabled). If there is no site logo defined in the theme, the default logo is used.</li>\n<li>Changed the rendering of settings to use one function, not individual &#8216;renders&#8217; for each add_setting field. This allows for easier formatting of the settings and text area. The old individual rendering functions were removed.</li>\n<li>Added a &#8216;Save Options&#8221; button at the top of the form for convenience.</li>\n<li>CSS for the optional login screen only added if optional login enabled.</li>\n<li>Enhanced the showing of the login/logout links on the site menu bar.

(And other plugins do it better.)</li>\n<li>Removed the numbers in front of each settings.</li>\n<li>Changed the login form code to only change the header image of the login form. Other settings, like the background for the login page, are done by the theme.</li>\n<li>The login form background is set to white.</li>\n<li>Changed logos and supporting images (part of re-branding on all plugins).</li>\n<li>Changes to Settings screen to show new logos and sidebar information.</li>\n<li>Changed title shown in the Settings list.</li>\n<li>Removed inline CSS from added footer if enabled, so it will use inherited colors/etc.</li>\n<li>Put all filters/actions in one area for convenience of the coding team.</li>\n<li>Version number is a defined constant for convenience in display, and displayed under the heading image.</li>\n<li>Some minor CSS changes to the Settings screen for slightly larger text and compatible background colors.</li>\n<li>Text corrections, additional info on the settings, and other changes on the Settings screen.</li>\n<li>Some code efficiencies; removing obsolete or unneeded code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>These prior versions were not publicly released</h4>\n<h4>2.08 (2 Mar 2020)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>changed when the htaccess is updates; now happens after theme_setup so that the switch_to_locale function is not called before it was available.

    "description": "<p>Secure your WP site with common security settings that you can selectively enable. Includes several security and anti-hacking features, plus some customization of your login screen. Disables certain functions/processes that are potential security issues. Can block some comment spam (although our Block Comment Spam plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-comment-spam-bots/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-comment-spam-bots/</a> is more effective). Can ncrease memory allocations. Shows your current htaccess file contents with suggestions for improvements, so you can monitor any changes.</p>\n<p>NEW FEATURES:<br />\n &#8211; Optionally adds directives to the WordPress virtual robots.txt file to block site scanning by AI bots. This blocks the use of your site content by those AI agents, such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, Bard, and others. It does not affect search engine scanning or any SEO, nor does it affect the user experience of your site.<br />\n&#8211; Now shows any hidden plugins (which might be malicious), plus lists all plugins with versions and status (active, inactive).</p>\n<p>We use this on all of our managed WordPress sites, as a convenient way to secure the sites without using a bunch of different plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>This plugin can be downloaded for free without any paid subscription from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cellarweb-privacy-and-security-options/\" rel=\"ugc\">official WordPress repository</a>.</strong></p>\n<h3>BEGIN &#8211; Added by ChatBot Blocker by CellarWeb plugin (Version 1.03)</h3>\n<pre><code>      #  Blocks ChatGPT bot scanning\n            User-agent: GPTBot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks Bard bot scanning\n            User-agent: Bard\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks Bing bot scanning\n            User-agent: bingbot-chat/2.0\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks Common Crawl bot scanning\n            User-agent: CCBot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks omgili bot scanning\n            User-agent: Omgili\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks omgilibot bot scanning\n            User-agent: Omgili Bot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks Diffbot bot scanning\n            User-agent: Diffbot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks MJ12bot bot scanning\n            User-agent: MJ12bot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks anthropic-ai bot scanning\n            User-agent: anthropic-ai\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks ClaudeBot bot scanning\n            User-agent: ClaudeBot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks FacebookBot bot scanning\n            User-agent: FacebookBot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks Google-Extended bot scanning\n            User-agent: Google-Extended\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks SentiBot bot scanning\n            User-agent: SentiBot\n            Disallow: /\n      #  Blocks sentibot bot scanning\n            User-agent: sentibot\n            Disallow: /&lt;h3&gt;END    - Added by ChatBot Blocker by CellarWeb plugin (Version 1.03)&lt;/h3&gt;\n`\n</code></pre>\n<p>See additional chatbot agents added in the changelog below.</p>\n<h4>htaccess Security Settings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows the current htaccess file for review. (Hackers like to change it, so it&#8217;s good to take a peek at it now and again.)</li>\n<li>Some suggestions for additional htaccess commands are shown.</li>\n<li>No changes are made to the htaccess file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Wow! That&#8217;s a lot of settings!</h4>\n<p>Yep. But they are ones that we commonly use in all of our managed WP sites, so putting them into one plugin was easier than doing it manually on every site.</p>\n<h4>What if I want an additional setting?</h4>\n<p>Just add a message in the plugin&#8217;s support area. We&#8217;ll consider it.</p>\n<h4>Do you have other security-related plugins?</h4>\n<p>Yep!  One of our favorites will block all comment spam &#8211; and another that blocks bots from contact forms. It&#8217;s very effective. We put it on one site that was getting a lot of comment spam, and now there is none. Not one. And we don&#8217;t get any contact form spam on sites that use the technique.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;Block Comment Spam Bots&#8221;, and can be found in the WP plugin repository. And there&#8217;s a link to it (and other plugins we&#8217;ve done) on this plugin&#8217;s Settings/Information page.
