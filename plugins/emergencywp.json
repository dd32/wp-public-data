Clicking that link or button will reset the EmergencyWP counter. If a life check stays unconfirmed for a preconfigured time frame (of your choice), a reminder will be sent. If the reminder is being ignored as well, EmergencyWP will trigger the famous process it was designed for (sending messages, delivering information, handling your assets – you name it).</p>\n<p>Life checks can be setup between 24 hours and 6 months, while the time frames for the confirmation can be setup between 12 hours and 30 days.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20safe%20is%20that%20emergencywp%20process%3F'>\nHow safe is that EmergencyWP process?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We had more than 650 beta testers using EmergencyWP since 2016. Since more than 36 months, we had no negative feedback on any process-related issues.<br />\nSoftware is, however, steadily improving and we need the feedback of your users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20multisite%20compatible%3F'>\nIs it multisite compatible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not from the beginning. In order to have life checks working all subsites, you will need to have an extra add-on to make EmergencyWP multisite compatible. Get more information on emergencywp.net.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
