That’s an increase in transfer size of 4533%. Adding a Vimeo video increased the transfer from 21 kb to 276 kb, an increase in transfer size of 1214%, and loaded an additional 7 resources.</p>\n<p>The Lazy Embed plugin defers the loading of any resource required for playing the video until the video is requested to be played. It does this by adding a srcdoc attribute to the iframe which shows in place of the normal iframe content.</p>\n<p>Currently the following third parties are supported</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Youtube</li>\n<li>Vimeo</li>\n<li>Dailymotion</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20settings'>\nAre there any settings\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope, install the plugin and you are good to go. There are some filters available for modifying the behaviour though.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20stop%20the%20plugin%20from%20modifying%20an%20iframe'>\nCan I stop the plugin from modifying an iframe\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, add the &#8220;lazy-embed-ignore&#8221; class to the iframe itself or using the gutenberg editor</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20have%20to%20click%20a%20video%20twice%20somtimes%20for%20it%20to%20play%3F'>\nWhy do I have to click a video twice somtimes for it to play?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Browsers have become more restrictive around autoplaying a video. The first click on a video never reaches the video host, so they then show the default thumbnail. After the first time a Lazy Embed is interacted with, subsequent videos from that provider will not require a second load.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20updated%20the%20thumbnail%20for%20my%20video%20in%20youtube%2Fvimeo%2Fdailymotion.%20why%20am%20i%20not%20seeing%20the%20updated%20thumbnail%3F'>\nI have updated the thumbnail for my video in Youtube/Vimeo/Dailymotion. Why am I not seeing the updated thumbnail?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The thumbnails are cached to improve the performance (uncached frontend pages) and reduce the emissions (less requests to the video platform) of the Lazy Embed plugin.</p>\n<p>The cache is known as transients. You can clear the transient cache using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP-Sweep</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20it%20not%20work%20for%20my%20videos%3F'>\nWhy does it not work for my videos?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It could be for one of a few reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A thumbnail for the embed could not be retrieved. If this is the case, send us a message with the video and we will take a look</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
