        "changelog": "<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<p>September 11, 2023<br />\n* Completely new and improved plugin settings pages that use Gutenberg components and React instead of Vue.js.  This provides some necessary groundwork for adding future features.<br />\n    * NOTE: The &#8220;Groups for Authorization&#8221; setting is now on the OIDC tab (it used to be on the General tab).<br />\n* Completely new page/post access restriction metabox.  The new metabox uses Gutenberg components but still works in the Classic Editor.<br />\n* Now works for websites hosted on WP Engine.  In addition to WP Engine, the plugin has been tested on Pantheon, Amazon Lightsail, and University of Michigan web hosting services.  The plugin should work with websites hosted on most WordPress hosting providers; please <a href=\"https://github.com/its-webhosting/umich-oidc-login/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">report</a> any web hosting provider where the plugin does not work correctly.<br />\n* Bug fixes:<br />\n    * Fix a problem with the Revisions section being missing in the Gutenberg editor sidebar&#8217;s Post tab.<br />\n    * Fix a problem with the plugin breaking WordPress&#8217; <code>/login</code> page.<br />\n    * Documentation said the shortcode for displaying data from OIDC user claims was <code>umich_oidc_userinfo</code>, but this didn&#8217;t work since the shortcode was actually named <code>umich_oidc_user_info</code> in the plugin code.  The plugin now supports both of these names for the shortcode.<br />\n    * The README file now says that group membership for Shibboleth IdPs is specified by the <code>edumember_ismemberof</code> OIDC claim (correct) rather than <code>eduperson_ismemberof</code> (wrong).<br />\n* Internals:<br />\n    * Added <a href=\"https://github.com/its-webhosting/umich-oidc-login/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation for how to develop, build, and package the plugin</a>.<br />\n    * Added support for developing the plugin using Docker containers.<br />\n    * Improved compatibility with PHP 8.<br />\n    * Added testing with NGINX, and improved testing in general.  The plugin is now tested with both Apache and NGINX.<br />\n    * Updated to the latest version of all plugin dependencies.</p>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<p>May 18, 2023<br />\n* Fixed a bug that prevented groups that have apostrophes / single quotes in their names from working.</p>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<p>January 31, 2023<br />\n* Fixed a bug with login/logout URLs being incorrect when WordPress is installed in a subdirectory.</p>\n<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<p>January 8, 2023<br />\n* Completely reimplemented the feature for using OIDC to log into the WordPress dashboard.<br />\n    * Changed the setting values from no/yes to no/optional/yes. The new setting (&#8220;optional&#8221;) allows users a choice of whether to log in using OIDC or their WordPress password. Choosing which way to log in looked like it was supported before when it was not, which was confusing.<br />\n    * The &#8220;no&#8221; setting previously displayed a &#8220;Login in with Single Sign On&#8221; button that would only log users into the website but not the WordPress dashboard.  This was confusing, and so the button has been removed when OIDC login for WordPress is set to &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />\n    * If a user attempts to log in to the WordPress dashboard via OIDC but does not have a WordPress user account, they will now get an &#8220;Access Denied&#8221; error instead of silently being logged into the website but not logged in to WordPress.<br />\n* Fixed a bug where unauthenticated users who tried to access a restricted page/post would sometimes get a &#8220;Page Not Found&#8221; error instead of being prompted to log in.<br />\n* Fixed a bug where users were sometimes not sent to the correct page after authenticating.<br />\n* Miscellaneous cleanup and improvements.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<p>November 2, 2022<br />\n* Initial release.</p>\n"
