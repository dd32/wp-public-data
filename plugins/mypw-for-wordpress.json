You have three options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Standard password and one-time password in different fields. With this configuration, you will be prompted for both your password and your one-time password value.</li>\n<li>Single password field with standard password and one-time password appended. With this configuration, your password becomes a combination of your password and your one-time password. For example if your password is &#8220;gate7way&#8221; and your one-time password value is &#8220;3918724&#8221;, the password you would use is &#8220;gate7way3918724&#8221;</li>\n<li>One-time password only. Your password will consist of only your one-time password value.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To associate a token with a user, click on &#8220;Users&#8221;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click &#8220;Edit&#8221; next to a user</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter the user&#8217;s token ID in the MyPW Token ID field</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any users who do not have a token specified will just use their standard username and password to log into WordPress.</p>\n",
