There can be several JS buttons. Each JS button can have its own name (v.3.3.6).<br />\n2) The open button, clicking on it will click on the link (the keyword &#8216;nojsb&#8217;).<br />\n3) Buttons above the content &#8216;Activity&#8217; Buddypress (by default).<br />\n4) Buttons below the content &#8216;Activity&#8217; Buddypress (keyword &#8216;afteractivity&#8217;).<br />\n5) Buttons in any place of the blog article (&#8216;intxt&#8217;).<br />\n6) Any button can have its own individual image (icon) by reference (&#8216;imgsrc=&#8217;).<br />\n7) Any button can have its own link to the program button handler. The link is indicated in the URL field.<br />\n8) SIMULTANEOUSLY there can be ALL kinds of buttons 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7). That is, for example, there may be one large common JS Share button above the content in the Baddipress Activity and below the content of the activity, and several open small buttons next to them. Each button is individually described.</p>\n<p>In the row of the table in the field &#8216;Name&#8217; instead of setting the button you can write a command to the plugin. The plugin command begins with the $ sign. In such a row of the table, the remaining fields are ignored, they can be left blank.</p>\n<p>Instructions for filling in the fields and rows of the table:</p>\n<p>Field &#8216;Name&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Share on(name)&#8217;:<br />\n1) It can be empty or no name &#8211; then the table row is not processed.<br />\n2) The table row can be of two types:<br />\na) The string that contains the command to the plugin &#8211; if the $ character is found in the Share on: (name) field. Then the plugin ignores the remaining fields of the string. The command line does not generate a button.<br />\nb) The string that generates the button, its fields describe the parameters of the button. The Share on: (name) field in this case is the name of the button (for example, Faceb4) and there can be one or several KEYWORDS to describe how to place the button, where to take its icon, etc.<br />\n3) What should I write in the Share on(name) field to generate a button? The first word is any of your button names, for example: Faceb1, Twit2, etc, &#8230; The second, third and fourth letters of the first word will be offered pictures for the buttons, the file names of which contain these 2,3,4 letters. A set of standard image files is supplied with the plugin in the img subdirectory. The user can add any additional files of any pictures to the plugin subdirectories independently.<br />\n4) The second and further words in the Share on(name) field &#8211; there may be &#8216;plugin keywords&#8217;. The plugin keywords can be:<br />\na) nojsb &#8211; do not hide this button behind the common JS Share button. By default, the JS Share option common button is enabled, that is, without the &#8216;nojsb&#8217; keyword, such a button will be hidden behind the common JS button, and such a button will &#8216;fall out&#8217; from a single JS Share button when it is pressed.<br />\nb) intxt &#8211; such a button will appear in those articles of the BLOG in the text of which the shortcode [yr-bpshare-button] is inserted, and exactly in the place where this code is inserted into the text of the article.<br />\nc) afteractivity &#8211; this button will appear after (below) the content of the Activity. By default, if there is no such keyword, the button will appear in front of (above) the content of the activity (Activity).<br />\nd) imgsrc= &#8211; this button will take its image (icon) at the specified link, for example: imgsrc=http://yoursite.com/images/facebround32.png<br />\ne) buttonfblike &#8211; a description of the Facebook Like button. It should be in the line that is below the lines with the Like configuration commands (below the parameter lines of the Like button). In this line of the table only the sections of the site (pages of the site) where the button should be generated are marked.<br />\nf) ifintitle=&lt;xxx&gt; &#8211; then such a button will appear on the site only if the xxx text is in the title of the article or in the name of the Buddypress group, or in the $title variable in the button link. Thus, for example, you can set different Join Viber Community buttons for different Buddypress groups.<br />\ng) <em>insertline</em> &#8211; then an empty row will be inserted before such a row in the parameter table. But at the same time, the last bottom row of the parameter table will disappear.<br />\nh) <em>deleteline</em>, then this row of the parameter table will be deleted. In this case, all the lines that are lower will rise one line up.<br />\n5) In the &#8216;Share on(name)&#8217; field, you can specify commands to the plugin. Then in such a line the remaining fields are ignored. The plugin can specify the following commands:<br />\na) $jsbname=&lt;Text and text&gt; is a plugin command, &#8216;Text and text&#8217; will replace the standard JS Share name of a single button. Very useful option. For example: $jsbname=&lt;There are even more different buttons&gt; &#8211; try. You can choose different names for several JS buttons. Table rows are scanned from top to bottom. Therefore, the name below will be active, and all the lines below will fall under the active JS button.<br />\nb) $buttonstyle=&lt;border: 2px solid red;&gt; &#8211; For example, Here you can specify different style elements for the any button. You can specify many elements of style. The command $buttonstyle= applies to all buttons that are located below in the settings table. To annul a style for a button, above the button, you can specify a command with a space instead of a style. Or a different style. Remember that commands are written in separate lines of the settings table, and are not combined with the button description.<br />\nc) Commands to customize the Like Facebook button:<br />\ni. The Like button is configured only by the plugin commands in the &#8216;Share on (name)&#8217; field, while the remaining fields of the table row are not analyzed. In the Share on (name) field, you can specify several commands at once to configure the Like button parameters. All parameters of the Like button here have the same meaning as in the Facebook description of the Like button. The commands for the Like plugin extend to those rows in the table with the &#8216;buttonfblike&#8217; keywords that are located below.<br />\nii. $fblikeappid=&lt;222222222222222&gt; &#8211; the command indicates the Facebook application code for the site where you install the Like button. In this command, write down the Facebook code of the application for your site. If you do not specify this command or do not specify an application code, then the button will be called without an application code (this works using the Facebook algorithm). This parameter is inserted into &#8216;&amp;appId=&#8217; when the SDK is loaded for the Like button.<br />\niii. $fblikeloc=&lt;en_US&gt; &#8211; or for example fr_FR, and so on &#8211; this is the localized language of your site, by default &#8211; en_US. This parameter is inserted into the link to download the SDK with a different language for the Like button.<br />\niv. $fblikesize=&lt;large&gt; &#8211; small/large &#8211; size for Like button, default = small, &#8211; is the size of the button. This parameter is inserted into the &#8216;data-size=&#8217; for the Like button.<br />\nv. $fblikelayout=&lt;standard&gt; &#8211; standard/box_count/button_count/button &#8211; the form of the Like button, default = button_count. This parameter is inserted into the &#8216;data-layout=&#8217; for the Like button SDK.<br />\nvi. $fblikestyle=&lt;&#8230; ..&gt; &#8211; Here you can specify different style elements for the div block that frames the Like button. For example, for a button that has $fblikesize=&lt;small&gt; $fblikelayout=&lt;button&gt; parameters, the recommended combination of style elements is: $fblikestyle=&lt;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;position:relative;bottom:4px;&gt; &#8211; try it.<br />\nvii. buttonfblike &#8211; (this is a keyword, it is not a command, it is without the $ sign !!) &#8211; indicates that this is the line for generating the Facebook Like button. It should be below the lines with the Like button parameters (below the Like commands). In this row of the settings table, you also need to specify only the sections of the site (pages of the site) where the Like button should be generated. You can generate several different Like buttons, with different parameters.</p>\n<p>Button field:<br />\n1) Button field shows already selected image (icon) for button generation. Not used for plugin commands, not used for Like Facebook button.</p>\n<p>Field &#8216;Select button image&#8217;:<br />\n1) The Select button image field invites you to select an image (icon) for the button, if in the img subdirectory of the plugin there are names of image files that have 2,3,4 letters the same as the 2,3,4 letter of the first word in the Share on (name ). The first word is the name of the button. For example, a button name could be Faceb1, Faceb2, Twit3, etc. Try to choose the name of the button by the name of the network for which the button is generated. Or upload additional icons to a subdirectory. Or specify the link to the icon with the keyword &#8216;imgsrc=&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Fields &#8216;Content to share&#8217;:<br />\n1) In the Content to share field, select the sections of the site where the button should appear. On which pages of the site you need to put a button. For plugin commands, this field is ignored.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Sharer URL (Php template)&#8217; field:<br />\n1) In the Sharer URL field (Php template) the destination link should be described, which will be followed by a click on the button. The plugin offers here standard links for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. You can change the link that the plugin suggested (but will it be processed later?), Or you can write your own link to another handler program. An example of a standard link in this field: http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?t=$title&amp;u=$link -Variable &#8216;$title&#8217; &#8211; the plugin replaces it with the name of the article, variable &#8216;$link&#8217; &#8211; the plugin replaces it with the link to the article. You can create any link for your button, for example: http://yoursite.com/blog1.php?s=$link then your blog1.php handler will handle the &#8216;$link&#8217; link to your site. Try it. You can generate different buttons, including advertising.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20can%20the%20bpshare-yr%20plugin%20do%3F'>\nWhat can the BPShare-YR plugin do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin can insert various buttons or links into the text (above, below the content) of the article, or activity post, in the forum.  The plugin works with both WordPress and WordPress + Buddypress. There are also social network buttons on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Digg, etc. for sharing articles of the WordPress blog or Buddypress activity. There is also a Facebook button Like, with different parameters. There can also be any other buttons or images with links that the admin site indicates. Buttons can have any images or icons, or loaded along with the plugin, or images that the site administrator will assign. The image / icon can be specified outside the site by a link to the Internet. The button link format can be standard for social networking buttons like Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc, or the site administrator can create a link for their new invented button. The handler of the new button can be given a link to the blog article or activity, and the text of the title of this article. Buttons (images with links) can be inserted in any place of the text of the article of the blog WordPress.<br />\nThe plugin provides many options for setting buttons on the site. The plugin is complicated in the settings, but it is a very powerful plugin in the hands of an experienced admin site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='example%20of%20settings%20for%20share%20button%20yr'>\nExample of settings for share button YR\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For example, set up a social network button Vkontakte.<br />\nIn column Share on:(name) write &#8216;Vkontakte&#8217; . Select image vk32.png or vk16.png. Or add the icon file of your button in the plugin directory /img, size 16&#215;16 or 32&#215;32. The file name of the icon should include numbers 16 or 32. It will be better if 1-3 letters of this image name = 1-3 letters of value &#8216;Share on name&#8217;.<br />\nIn column Sharer URL (Php template): &#8211; write http://vk.com/share.php?url=$link&amp;title=$title . Variable $title &#8211; plugin replaced by Article title, variable $link &#8211; plugin replaced by Article link, all another text in http: link &#8211; may be yours.<br />\nSelect Blog or/and Activity or/and &#8230; etc. &#8211; where the button Vkontakte will appear. If we have only blog on WordPress &#8211; without Buddypress &#8211; then you can select only Blog, another selections must be ignored. Press Save Changes. Button set.<br />\nIf in Share on:(name) write &#8220;Vkontakte nojsb&#8221; then the button will not be hidden behind the general JS-button.<br />\nIf Shareon:(name) column includes the keyword &#8220;intxt&#8221;, then such Button appears in those blog articles, in the text of which the Shortcode [yr-bpshare-button] is inserted. Only one Shortcode [yr-bpshare-button] can be inserted anywhere in the article. The Shortcode [yr-bpshare-button] will be replaced with &#8220;intxt&#8221; buttons.<br />\nIf Shareon:(name) includes the keyword &#8220;imgsrc=&#8221; and then a link is written, for example &#8220;imgsrc=http://yoursite.com/images/facebround32.png&#8221;, then the image for such a button will be taken from this link. You can give a link to any image of any size and see how they are displayed on the site. This keyword is convenient for debugging. The keyword &#8220;imgsrc=&#8221; is more priority than setting the icons from the plugin sub-directory. The image settings from the plugin sub-directory on the admin page remain unchanged.<br />\nNow (v.322) you can specify in the settings that the share buttons should be located at the bottom of the Activity content (after content). Now some buttons can be placed upper of the Activity content (by default) and some buttons &#8211; after the content by the keyword &#8220;afteractivity&#8221; in Shareon:(name) .</p>\n<p>Examples of the values of the column Share on (name):  Facebook nojsb  / Linked2 intxt / Faceb3 intxt nojsb / Facebook nojsb imgsrc=http://yoursite.com/images/facebround32.png / Twitter   afteractivity /</p>\n<p>Examples of the values of the column URL:  http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?t=$title&amp;u=$link / http://twitter.com/share?text=$title&amp;url=$link / http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=$link&amp;title=$title / https://plus.google.com/share?url=$link / http://digg.com/submit?url=$link / mailto:?subject=$title&amp;body=$link / http://vk.com/share.php?url=$link&amp;title=$title /</p>\n<p>Examples of settings for the &#8220;Like Facebook&#8221; button:<br />\n$fblikesize=&lt;small&gt; $fblikelayout=&lt;button_count&gt; $fblikeappid=&lt;222222222222222&gt;<br />\n$fblikestyle=&lt;display:inline;vertical-align:middle;position:relative;bottom:4px;&gt;<br />\nAnd the &#8220;Like&#8221; button generation line (and you need to mark sections of the site):<br />\nbuttonFBlike nojsb</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='an%20example%20of%20a%20creative%20button%3A%20search%20google'>\nAn example of a creative button: Search Google\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can create a button by clicking on which Google search results by the title of the article will be displayed (example):<br />\nIn the row of the settings table, in the row with the conditional number N, in the Share on: (name) field, write down the style command:<br />\n$buttonstyle=&lt;height: 32px; width: 80px; &gt;<br />\nIn the next (from the top) row of the settings table, in the row with conditional number N + 1, in the Share on: (name) field, write down the button name and keywords:<br />\nGoogle search for: nojsb imgsrc=https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png<br />\nHere Google search for: &#8211; is the name of the button and it will be in alt =, nojsb &#8211; do not hide this button in the common JS button, imgsrc = &#8211; indicates the Google image that will be used as an icon.<br />\nIn the same N + 1 row of the settings table, check the sections of the site content where the button should appear, for example, blog, activity.<br />\nIn the same N + 1 row of the settings table in the column (field) Sharer URL write down:<br />\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=$title<br />\nThis link will appeal to Google with the transfer of the search parameter &#8211; the title of the blog article.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20other%20features%20of%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat other features of the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin works with both Buddypress + WordPress, and works only with the WordPress blog &#8211; without Buddypress installed.
