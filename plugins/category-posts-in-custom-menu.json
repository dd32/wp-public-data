Next, you can choose if you would like to replace the category by the posts or pages themselves.</p>\n<p>For each Category in your menu, you now have the following extra configuration options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace by posts in the category y/n; </li>\n<li>specify the (maximum) number of posts you want to show for this item (max 10);</li>\n<li>their ordering ascending or descending by Title, Date or Menu Order;</li>\n<li>specify the title for the menu items.

This is a bug in WordPress that I have reported here: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32918 This is not something I am able to fix in the plugin, it has to be fixed in WordPress. I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='performance%20issues'>\nPerformance issues\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is potentially very expensive, especially when you decide to build your entire menu out of nothing but category posts.</p>\n<p>The solution would be to cache the menu using transients, as reported here https://wordpress.org/support/topic/performance-problem-many-database-queries?replies=11#post-7829450</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>$my_cached_menu = get_transient( &#8216;my_cached_menu&#8217;);</p>\n<p>if( $my_cached_menu === false )</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>$my_cached_menu = wp_nav_menu( &#8230; );</p>\n<p>set_transient( &#8220;my_cached_menu_&#8221;, $my_cached_menu, YEAR_IN_SECONDS );</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>echo $my_cached_menu;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%27t%20see%20it%20working%20in%20any%20way'>\nCan&#8217;t see it working in any way\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Problem: &#8220;I can&#8217;t see what effect it has had. Nothing has changed (not that I can see) in the Appearance &gt; Menu/Customize/Editor pages. It&#8217;s just like before.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you are using a recent version of category Posts in Custom Menu and an updated version of WordPress, the problem can only occur due to your theme or other plugins conflicting with Category Posts in Custom Menu. Please disable all themes and plugins except CPCM; verify that the CPCM fields show; enable other plugins and themes one by one to determine which plugin/theme conflicts with CPCM.</p>\n<p>Note: A theme must either call wp_nav_menu() or apply_filters( &#8216;wp_nav_menu_objects&#8217;, &#8230; ) for CPCM to be triggered.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Note that the plugin name has unfortunately <em>not</em> been changed to reflect this extension. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Added checkboxes, dropdowns and text fields to Appearance &gt; Menu.
