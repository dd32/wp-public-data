Sensfrx identifies users from risky locations or those hiding behind proxies, preventing them from registering or making purchases. It also cross-checks disposable email and shipping addresses to flag mismatched or suspicious details before they become a problem.<br />\nOne of the key features is credit card and transaction velocity monitoring. This ensures that patterns like rapid or repetitive transactions are flagged, stopping fraudsters early.</p>\n<p>With Sensfrx, you&#8217;re not just reacting to fraud after checkout. It actively blocks suspicious customers during registration, login and checkout. You can also manage your blacklist easily, blocking users by IP, state, zip code, or email, with options to customize messages for blacklisted users.</p>\n<p>The real power lies in Sensfrx&#8217;s AI intelligence. It learns from user behavior over time, improving its accuracy and reducing false positives, keeping your store secure without blocking genuine customers.</p>\n<p>By covering everything from registration to transaction completion, Sensfrx offers a proactive approach to fraud, ensuring your WooCommerce store is protected at every stage.</p>\n<h3>How to get Property ID and Property Secret?</h3>\n<p>SensFRX WordPress Plugin is a SDK to install and configure SensFRX.
