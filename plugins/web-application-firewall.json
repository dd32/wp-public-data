A firewall security, is a barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.</p>\n<h4>FEATURE-RICH, EASY TO USE, STABLE, SECURE AND WELL SUPPORTED WORDPRESS FIREWALL SECURITY PLUGIN</h4>\n<p>Firewall reduces security risk by checking for vulnerabilities, and by implementing and enforcing the latest recommended WordPress security practices and techniques.<br />\nOur security and firewall rules are categorized into &#8220;essential(basic)&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221;. This way you can apply the firewall rules progressively without breaking your site&#8217;s functionality.<br />\nEasy way to block country and to block IP. Using firewall security plugin admin can protect the website from unwanted traffic, and bad bots. The firewall protects your website from different kinds of attacks. And provides a security layer on your website.<br />\n<em>GDPR Compliant</em></p>\n<p>What does a Web Application Firewall (WAF) exactly do?</p>\n<p>A WAF/firewall keeps a track of the HTTP traffic that comes to your website/web application. Basically, it monitors all the requests that are coming to your web application/website. If the WAF feels that the incoming requests are suspicious i.e. if the incoming request can harm your website (eg. the request may contain some code that can make some changes to your database or an unauthorized person/hacker would be able to gain access to your web application) WAF blocks those requests and prevents your website from unwanted attacks. Basically WAF filters and blocks suspicious or unwanted HTTP traffic to and from a web application.</p>\n<p>The following is a list of the security and firewall features provided by miniorange firewall security plugin:</p>\n<h4>User Login Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The login locked out  protects against &#8220;Brute Force Login Attacks.&#8221; Users with a specific IP address or range will be locked out of the system for a predetermined period of time-based on the configuration settings, and you can also opt to be notified via email whenever someone is locked out due to too many login attempts.</li>\n<li>As the administrator, you can view a list of all locked out users in an easily readable and navigable table, as well as unblock individual or bulk IP addresses with the click of a button.</li>\n<li>Monitor/view failed login attempts, which include the user&#8217;s IP address, User ID/Username, and the date and time of the failed login attempt.</li>\n<li>Keep track of the username, IP address, login date/time, and logout date/time for all user accounts on your system to monitor/view their account activity.</li>\n<li>Allows you to add one or more IP addresses to a whitelist.</li>\n<li>Add Google reCaptcha to your WP Login form and forget password form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>File System Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify files or folders with insecure permission settings and, change the permissions to the recommended secure values.</li>\n<li>Protect your PHP code by disabling file editing and prevent people from accessing the readme.html, license.txt, and wp-config.php files of your WordPress site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>htaccess and wp-config.php File Backup and Restore</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easily backup your original .htaccess and wp-config.php files in case you need to use them to restore broken functionality and also you can modify the contents of the current htaccess or wp-config.php file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Blacklist Functionality</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can be blocked by specifying their user agents or IP addresses  by using a wildcard to specify IP ranges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Firewall Functionality</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin makes it simple to add a lot of firewall protection to your site via the htaccess file. Your web server processes a htaccess file before loading any other code on your site.</li>\n<li>Access control facility.</li>\n<li>Instantly activate a selection of firewall settings ranging from basic, intermediate, and advanced.</li>\n<li>Deny bad or malicious query strings.</li>\n<li>Protect against Cross-Site Scripting and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Brute force login attack prevention</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This firewall feature will prevent all login attempts from humans and bots.  It is possible to hide the admin login page. Change the URL of your WordPress login page so that bots and hackers cannot access your actual WordPress login URL. You can use this feature to change the default login page (wp-login.php) to something you specify.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Security Scanner</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If any files in your WordPress system have changed, the file change detection scanner will notify you. You can then investigate to see if the change was legitimate or if malicious code was injected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Comment SPAM Security</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor the most active IP addresses which persistently produce the most SPAM comments using google reCaptcha and instantly block them with the click of a button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Regular updates and additions of new security features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress security is a living thing that changes over time. Our Firewall Security will regularly update with new security features, so you can be confident that your site will be up to the mark of security protection techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>FREE Plugin Feature</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Plugin Level Waf:</strong> IPs blocked by admin will be blocked on WordPress site load.
