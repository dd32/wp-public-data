        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Add shortcode to your post or page where map should appear.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>Shortcodes what??</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The shortcode you need to use is this:</p>\n<pre><code>[vsgmap address=\"street address to display\"]\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the options for use with the shortcode?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following options are available:<br />\naddress=&#8221;street address to display&#8221; (Enter the street address for the location to be shown. NOT a Google Map URL)</p>\n<p>align=&#8221;left&#8221; (default is left. Valid are left, right, center)</p>\n<p>width=&#8221;400&#8243; (default is 400. Any pixel dimension is valid)</p>\n<p>height=&#8221;380&#8243; (default is 380. Any pixel dimension is valid)</p>\n<p>info_window=&#8221;A&#8221; (default is A which displays marker popup. Other option is near and the marker popup will not appear until marker is clicked on)</p>\n<p>zoom=&#8221;14&#8243; (set the default map zoom level. Valid options are 1 through 16)</p>\n<p>companycode=&#8221;&#8221; (Enter Google string cid from company maps listing URL)</p>\n<p>maptype=&#8221;&#8221; (default is m, m = normal map, k = satellite, h = hybrid, p = terrain)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How do I find the Google cid code???</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Find your company listing on a Google Maps result page and click the link to email the link. It will open an email and the full link will be visible. The cid # is usually easy to see. you only need the part after cid= you do not need the whole thing. You can also try this web page CID Finder: http://ryanbradley.com/tools/google-cid-finder</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How can I put a border around the map?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The plugin wraps the embed within a div so this can be achieved with with css.<br />\nSimply add the following to your themes style.css<br />\n    .vsg-map iframe { border: 1px solid; }</p>\n<p>Of course you can change the css any way you like.</p>\n",
