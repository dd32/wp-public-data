        "description": "<p>Appointment Hour Booking is a WordPress plugin for creating booking forms for <strong>appointments with a start time and a defined duration</strong> over a schedule. The start time is visually selected by the end user from a set of start times calculated based in the <strong>&#8220;open&#8221; hours and service duration</strong>. The duration/schedule is defined in the &#8220;service&#8221; selected by the customer. Each calendar can have multiple services with different duration and prices.</p>\n<p>This plugin is useful for different cases like <strong>booking of medical services</strong> where services with different duration and prices may be available, for <strong>personal training sessions</strong>, for <strong>booking rooms for events</strong>, for <strong>reserving language classes</strong> or other type of classes and other type of <strong>services/resources booking</strong> where start times are selected and the availability is automatically managed using the defined service duration to avoid double-booking (the booked time is blocked once the booking is completed).</p>\n<p>Main Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy <strong>visual configuration</strong> of calendar data and schedules</li>\n<li><strong>Working dates</strong>, invalid/holiday dates and special dates can be defined</li>\n<li>Supports restriction of <strong>default, maximum and minimimum dates</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Open hours</strong> can be defined for each date</li>\n<li>Each calendar can have <strong>multiple services</strong> defined</li>\n<li>Each service can have its own <strong>price and duration</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Start-times</strong> are calculated automatically based in the open hours and service duration</li>\n<li>Available times are managed automatically to <strong>avoid double-booking</strong></li>\n<li>Multiple services can be selected on each booking</li>\n<li>Services can have multiple capacity</li>\n<li>Automatic price calculation</li>\n<li>Customizable <strong>email notifications</strong> for administrators and users</li>\n<li>Form <strong>validation</strong> and built it anti-spam <strong>captcha</strong> protection</li>\n<li>Manual and automatic <strong>CSV reports</strong></li>\n<li>iCal addon with iCal export link and iCal file attached into emails</li>\n<li>Calendar available in 53+ languages</li>\n<li>Multiple date formats supported</li>\n<li>Blocks for Elementor and Gutenberg</li>\n<li>Multi-page calendars</li>\n<li>Printable <strong>appointments list</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features in commercial versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visual form builder</strong> for creating the booking form fields</li>\n<li>Booking form can be connected to <strong>payment process</strong> (Ex: PayPal Standard, PayPal Pro, Stripe, Skrill, Authorize.net, TargetPay/iDEAL, Mollie/iDEAL, SagePay, Redsys)</li>\n<li>Payments are SCA ready (Strong Customer Authentication), compatible with the new Payment services (PSD 2) &#8211; Directive (EU) </li>\n<li><strong>Addons</strong> for integration with external services: reCaptcha, MailChimp, SalesForce, WooCommerce and others</li>\n<li><strong>Addons</strong> with additional features: appointment cancellation addon, appointment reminders addon, clickatell and twilio SMS add-ons, signature fields, iCal synchronization, Google Calendar API, Zoom Meetings &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Appointment Hour Booking can be used for:</h4>\n<p><strong>Booking services or resources:</strong> Define schedule, open hours, services, prices and durations and let the calendar plugin manage the schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample cases:</strong> Medical services, personal training, resource allocation, booking rooms, classes, etc&#8230;</p>\n<p>The services can have a maximum capacity (example: number of persons that can book/attend the service at the same time). The default capacity is 1. If the service capacity has been set to 1 the time-slot will be blocked for new bookings after getting one booking. If the service capacity has been set to a greater number (example: service with capacity 10) the time-slot will be blocked after filling the capacity (example: after getting bookings for a total of 10 persons). This feature is described in detail at https://apphourbooking.dwbooster.com/blog/2019/01/24/bookings-for-multiple-persons/</p>\n<h4>The Troubleshoot Area</h4>\n<p>Use the troubleshot if you are having problems with special or non-latin characters. In most cases changing the charset to UTF-8 through the option available for that in the troubleshot area will solve the problem.</p>\n<p>You can also use this area to change the script load method if the booking calendar isn&#8217;t appearing in the public website.</p>\n<h4>The Notification Emails</h4>\n<p>The notification emails with the appointment data entered in the booking form can sent in &#8220;Plain Text&#8221; format (default) or in &#8220;HTML&#8221; format. If you select &#8220;HTML&#8221; format, be sure to use the BR or P tags for the line breaks into the text and to use the proper formatting.</p>\n<h4>Exporting Appointments to CSV / Excel Files</h4>\n<p>The appointment data can be exported to a CSV file (Excel compatible) to manage the data from other applications. That option is available from the &#8220;bookings list&#8221;, the appointments can be filtered by date and by the text into them, so you can export just the needed appointments to the CSV file.</p>\n<h4>Other Versions and Features</h4>\n<p>The free version published in this WordPress directory is a fully-functional version for accepting appointments as indicated in the plugin description. There are also commercial versions with additional features, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to process forms/appointments linked to payment process (PayPal, Stripe, Skrill, &#8230;)</li>\n<li>Form builder for a visual customization of the booking form</li>\n<li>Addons with multiple additional features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payments processed through the plugin are SCA ready (Strong Customer Authentication), compatible with the new Payment services (PSD 2) &#8211; Directive (EU) that comes into full effect on 14 September, 2019.</p>\n<p>Please note that the pro features aren&#8217;t advised as part of the free plugin in the description shown in this WordPress directory. If you are interested in more information about the commercial features go to the plugin&#8217;s page: https://apphourbooking.dwbooster.com/download</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Appointment Hour Booking is a WordPress plugin for creating booking forms for <strong>appointments with a start time and a defined duration</strong> over a schedule. The start time is visually selected by the end user from a set of start times calculated based in the <strong>&#8220;open&#8221; hours and service duration</strong>. The duration/schedule is defined in the &#8220;service&#8221; selected by the customer. Each calendar can have multiple services with different duration and prices.</p>\n<p>This plugin is useful for different cases like <strong>booking of medical services</strong> where services with different duration and prices may be available, for <strong>personal training sessions</strong>, for <strong>booking rooms for events</strong>, for <strong>reserving language classes</strong> or other type of classes and other type of <strong>services/resources booking</strong> where start times are selected and the availability is automatically managed using the defined service duration to avoid double-booking (the booked time is blocked once the booking is completed).</p>\n<p>Main Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy <strong>visual configuration</strong> of calendar data and schedules</li>\n<li><strong>Working dates</strong>, invalid/holiday dates and special dates can be defined</li>\n<li>Supports restriction of <strong>default, maximum and minimimum dates</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Open hours</strong> can be defined for each date</li>\n<li>Each calendar can have <strong>multiple services</strong> defined</li>\n<li>Each service can have its own <strong>price and duration</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Start-times</strong> are calculated automatically based in the open hours and service duration</li>\n<li>Available times are managed automatically to <strong>avoid double-booking</strong></li>\n<li>Multiple services can be selected on each booking</li>\n<li>Services can have multiple capacity</li>\n<li>Automatic price calculation</li>\n<li>Customizable <strong>email notifications</strong> for administrators and users</li>\n<li>Form <strong>validation</strong> and built it anti-spam <strong>captcha</strong> protection</li>\n<li>Manual and automatic <strong>CSV reports</strong></li>\n<li>iCal addon with iCal export link and iCal file attached into emails</li>\n<li>Calendar available in 53+ languages</li>\n<li>Multiple date formats supported</li>\n<li>Blocks for Elementor and Gutenberg</li>\n<li>Multi-page calendars</li>\n<li>Printable <strong>appointments list</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features in commercial versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visual form builder</strong> for creating the booking form fields</li>\n<li>Booking form can be connected to <strong>payment process</strong> (Ex: PayPal Standard, PayPal Pro, Stripe, Skrill, Authorize.net, TargetPay/iDEAL, Mollie/iDEAL, SagePay, Redsys)</li>\n<li>Payments are SCA ready (Strong Customer Authentication), compatible with the new Payment services (PSD 2) &#8211; Directive (EU) </li>\n<li><strong>Addons</strong> for integration with external services: reCaptcha, MailChimp, SalesForce, WooCommerce and others</li>\n<li><strong>Addons</strong> with additional features: appointment cancellation addon, appointment reminders addon, clickatell and twilio SMS add-ons, signature fields, iCal synchronization, Google Calendar API, Zoom Meetings &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Appointment Hour Booking can be used for:</h4>\n<p><strong>Booking services or resources:</strong> Define schedule, open hours, services, prices and durations and let the calendar plugin manage the schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample cases:</strong> Medical services, personal training, resource allocation, booking rooms, classes, etc&#8230;</p>\n<p>The services can have a maximum capacity (example: number of persons that can book/attend the service at the same time). The default capacity is 1. If the service capacity has been set to 1 the time-slot will be blocked for new bookings after getting one booking. If the service capacity has been set to a greater number (example: service with capacity 10) the time-slot will be blocked after filling the capacity (example: after getting bookings for a total of 10 persons). This feature is described in detail at https://apphourbooking.dwbooster.com/blog/2019/01/24/bookings-for-multiple-persons/</p>\n<h4>The Troubleshoot Area</h4>\n<p>Use the troubleshot if you are having problems with special or non-latin characters. In most cases changing the charset to UTF-8 through the option available for that in the troubleshot area will solve the problem.</p>\n<p>You can also use this area to change the script load method if the booking calendar isn&#8217;t appearing in the public website.</p>\n<h4>The Notification Emails</h4>\n<p>The notification emails with the appointment data entered in the booking form can sent in &#8220;Plain Text&#8221; format (default) or in &#8220;HTML&#8221; format. If you select &#8220;HTML&#8221; format, be sure to use the BR or P tags for the line breaks into the text and to use the proper formatting.</p>\n<h4>Exporting Appointments to CSV / Excel Files</h4>\n<p>The appointment data can be exported to a CSV file (Excel compatible) to manage the data from other applications. That option is available from the &#8220;bookings list&#8221;, the appointments can be filtered by date and by the text into them, so you can export just the needed appointments to the CSV file.</p>\n<h4>Other Versions and Features</h4>\n<p>The free version published in this WordPress directory is a fully-functional version for accepting appointments as indicated in the plugin description. There are also commercial versions with additional features, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to process forms/appointments linked to payment process (PayPal, Stripe, Skrill, &#8230;)</li>\n<li>Form builder for a visual customization of the booking form</li>\n<li>Addons with multiple additional features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payments processed through the plugin are SCA ready (Strong Customer Authentication), compatible with the new Payment services (PSD 2) &#8211; Directive (EU) that comes into full effect on 14 September, 2019.</p>\n<p>Please note that the pro features aren&#8217;t advised as part of the free plugin in the description shown in this WordPress directory. If you are interested in more information about the commercial features go to the plugin&#8217;s page: https://apphourbooking.dwbooster.com/download</p>\n",
