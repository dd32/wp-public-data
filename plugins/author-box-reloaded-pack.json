See image in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-box-reloaded-pack/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">Screenshots</a>.</li>\n<li>Go to your Personal Profile and insert the user id for the social networks you want to have the link in Author Box Reloaded. For instance, if in Twitter your url is http://twitter.com/niceguy just use the &#8220;niceguy&#8221; part of it. It is the same procedure with the other social networks or external websites.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should have at least your &#8220;Contact Info&#8221; Website and/or one of the Social Networks defined or, at least, a not so short &#8220;Biographical Info&#8221;, or the Author Box Reloaded CSS may be real messy.</p>\n<p>If you use WordPress Mu and want to add this plugins to all blogs just install them in the mu-plugins directory instead or, in more modern versions, activate them globally.</p>\n",
