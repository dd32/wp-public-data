        "faq": "\n<h4>Does this plugin translate my blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It provides a convenient environment to store translated content and switch languages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I switch languages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a widget and shortcode for displaying the language selection links. Alternatively you can add ?lang=<em>LANG_SHORT</em> to the URL of any page of your site. Please note that you&#8217;ll have to have at least one language added from the settings page before you can switch languages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I tried to switch languages and all my content and menu dissapreared.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That may be because you haven&#8217;t translated any content yet. The plugin does not display untranslated content by default. However, if you wish it do display content in the default language even when switched to another one, there is a setting for that.<br />\nIf you have translated the content and it still doesn&#8217;t show up, it may mean that the plugin does not work with your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I translate categories / tags / widgets / custom post types / etc ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a simple plugin for simple sites. It only supports translating titles and content of posts and pages. If you&#8217;re running a more complicated site, you&#8217;ll need a more sophisticated plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin doesn&#8217;t work with my theme.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry to hear that. The plugin is tested with most of the themes from the WP team as well as some others and it should work with most. It uses pretty basic WP functions to work, but there are themes that display content differently and I can&#8217;t account for them all.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
