To display the player, put a valid URL pointing to an MP3 or M4A recording between the shortcodes [choon] and [/choon] on your page or post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can display the musical notation derived from ABC notation combined with a player. Put valid ABC notation between the shortcodes [choon-abcjs-player] and [/choon-abcjs-player] on your page or post.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As an alternative to option 2 you can use a combination of the following two shortcodes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A player for ABC notation. To display the player put ABC notation between the shortcodes [choon-abc] and [/choon-abc]. This option is based on an older now unsupported library called &#8216;musical.js&#8217; which may have issues in future.

Use the new codes!</p>\n<h3>Where can this be used?</h3>\n<p>Anywhere that shortcodes are accepted. Tested on pages and posts but<br />\nnot on widgets (using the Twenty Twenty-Three theme).
