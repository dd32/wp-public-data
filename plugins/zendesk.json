        "description": "<p>Zendesk Support for WordPress allows you to bring your helpdesk, powered by Zendesk, into your blog or site. Here&#8217;s an overview of all the features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single sign on with Zendesk&#8217;s Remote Authentication</strong><br />\nHave a healthy user base already? With Single Sign On, your users won&#8217;t have to login to Zendesk Support to submit tickets, check their progress or comment in community forums.</p>\n<p>When users try to login to Zendesk, we&#8217;ll ping your WordPress site to see if they&#8217;re already logged in, and then sign them straight into Zendesk without them needing to register or set a new password. It&#8217;s 100% secure, too!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Turn your blog comments straight into Zendesk Support tickets, with one click</strong><br />\nNeed to take that conversation offline, or escalate someones question or problem to someone else in the company. From the comments administration screen, you can take any comment made and turn it into a Ticket. The process is completely seamless for your users, and they&#8217;ll appreciate the extra mile you&#8217;re going to provide amazing customer service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Zendesk Support Web Widget</strong><br />\nAdd the Zendesk Support Web Widget to any webpage so users can search your knowledge base, chat with an agent or submit a ticket. You can have it on every page on your WordPress blog, or choose where you want it with the use of a template tag.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Zendesk Support Feedback Tab</strong><br />\nAdd a tab to any webpage so users can search your knowledge base, chat with an agent or submit a ticket. You can completely customize the look and feel. You can have it on every page on your WordPress blog, or choose where you want it with the use of a template tag.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Zendesk Support Dropbox users &#8211; the dropbox (also known as Zendesk Support Feedback Tab) is soon to be deprecated and has been replaced with the Web Widget. You can continue to use your dropbox for now but we encourage you to try the Web Widget (available in your plug-in) which allows you to easily embed ticketing, self-service and chat on your website as well as providing a much improved experience on mobile web browsers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access your tickets from your dashboard</strong><br />\nFull access to your views, tickets (including custom fields) and comments. Never lose sight on your support requests, no matter where you are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A simple contact form, on the dashboard</strong><br />\nGive your visitors the ability to quickly submit a question or issue with a two field contact form. You can place this on the dashboard, restricting it to only those with Zendesk accounts, or you can allow anyone to open a request regardless of a Zendesk account.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like the sound of this plugin but don&#8217;t have a Zendesk account yet?

To do this, you&#8217;ll need to login via the Zendesk for WordPress widget. This can either be the tickets widget, or the contact form widget (where anonymous submission are turned off).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t understand how Single Sign On with Zendesk&#8217;s Remote Authentication works, where can I find out more?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/entries/20110872-setting-up-remote-authentication-for-wordpress\" title=\"Setting up remote authentication for wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">We&#8217;ve made this super handy guide</a> on what it is and how to get started.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Do I have to display any dashboard widgets, the Zendesk Web Widget, the Zendesk Support Feedback Tab or the contact form?</strong></p>\n<p>Nope! It&#8217;s completely up to you. If you want, you can just use the plugin for single sign on with Zendesk.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
