If version 2.7 is working great for you, there is no need to update unless you really want to try one of the new items.</strong></p>\n",

        "changelog": "<h4>2.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor upgrade to single game page for overtime games.</li>\n<li>Allowed league managers to update records for their leagues (applies on to MSTW Add-ons)</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated PHP functions from some of the code.</li>\n<li>Corrected several minor bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Restricted access to dashboard features that are not provided to users in Team, School, and League Admin Roles.</li>\n<li>Added access control for Team, School, and League Admin roles in Manage, Add, and Update Games screen.</li>\n<li>Controls in Game Manager to designate a game as an overtime game.</li>\n<li>Filter button now displayed on the Edit Venues (list of venues) admin screen.</li>\n<li>Upgraded the page template so single team schedules are properly displayed in all cases.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug when a team not in a league is linked from a league schedule</li>\n<li>Modified [mstw_team_schedule] shortcode, so the &#8216;league&#8217; argument is deprecated. It&#8217;s no longer necessary. All the teams games for a given season are displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed minor (unlikely) start-up issues and MSTW League Manager Add-ons.</li>\n<li>Cleaned-up a collection of (minor?) issues/bugs throughout the plugin, primarily related to &#8216;meets&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Added a team scoreboard shortcode [mstw_lm_team_scoreboard].</li>\n<li>Added Game Conference and Game Division to the Update Games admin screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in the multi-team schedule. One that you might only see if you are using Schools the LM Add-ons plugin to populate team data.</li>\n<li>Added code to support an &#8216;all-sports&#8217; sport. This turns out to be important for sites with a large number of teams that show up in game schedules but are not tracked (schedules, standings, rosters, etc) on the site. This gets a bit complicated. If interested, <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more information can be found here.</a></li>\n<li>Added <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/lmao-meets-admin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">admin support for a new &#8220;meets&#8221;</a> custom post type and <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/lmao-meets-front-end/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">two shortcodes that include meets</a> in league and team schedules. (Full meet support requires MSTW League Manager Add-ons Plugin.)</li>\n<li>The layout of the schedule in the mstw_league_schedule_table shortcode output has been modified somewhat to better support &#8220;meets&#8221;. All the content and functionality remain in place. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new multi-team schedule shortcode [mstw_multi_team_schedule], which behaves much like the multi-league standings and schedules shortcodes.<a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/lm-shortcodes/#multi-team-schedules\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more here.</a></li>\n<li>Added support for BYEs. BYE games can now be created in Add Games and Manage Games screens, and then displayed in the shortcodes. <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/lm-byes-open-dates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more here.</a></li>\n<li>Added the option to link game time/result to a media URL in the Settings screen, schedules tab. If there is a media link for a game, the link will be added and a media icon will be displayed in the time/result field. <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/lm-media-links/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more here.</a></li>\n<li>The team dropdown list for non-league games only displays teams that play the same sport as the game being modified. <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/lm-faq/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more here.</a></li>\n<li>Corrected javascript; teams now display corrected when league in dropdown is changed (Add Games and Manage Games screens).</li>\n<li>Corrected javascript; teams now display corrected when non-league game checkbox is changed (Add Games and Manage Games screens).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrected displays for &#8220;low score wins&#8221; setting across almost all front end displays. School sliders are still only show high score wins.</li>\n<li>Changed the league ticker shortcode [mstw_league_schedule_ticker] functionality. (See the man page for details.)</li>\n<li>Several minor bug fixes. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the capability to select all games on a specified date for a specified sport in the Update Games admin screen (in addition to league and season).</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug with the date selector control on the Update Games screen (and others).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New multi schedule shortcode [mstw_multi_schedule_table]</li>\n<li>New sport schedule table [mstw_lm_sport_schedule]</li>\n<li>Added new fields for games: &#8220;Game Name&#8221;, &#8220;Status Replace&#8221;,and &#8220;Status Append&#8221;. These fields modify the game time/status/result blocks in all front end displays: schedule tables, tickers, sliders, and galleries, and the single game page.</li>\n<li>Modified the way mstw_multi_standings_table &#8216;remembers&#8217; the value of the selected league. It no longer uses cookies.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug with the Google Maps link images in the Venue Table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that prevented more than 300 games from displaying properly in sliders and tickers.</li>\n<li>A media icon (with link) can be displayed on schedule sliders, tickers, galleries, and scoreboards.</li>\n<li>The display in the Media column when no media link is found, now defaults to a blank (rather than &#8220;No media found.&#8221;). </li>\n<li>Added filters provide control over the message displayed when no media is found and when no location is found.</li>\n<li>Added support for schools (organizations), from which team data may be imported. </li>\n<li>Added support for sports, which may be assigned to schools.</li>\n<li>Added filters to provide control over the display for gender, level, and season of Sports.</li>\n<li>Added ability to link a team to a roster (from MSTW Team Rosters).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonleague games are now shown by default in all displays. So there is no need to use the show_nonleague=1 parameter. If you DO NOT want to show nonleague games, then set show_nonleague=0.</li>\n<li>Games can now be marked as postponed in the DB and in the front end displays (shortcodes).</li>\n<li>Fixed bug that prevented display of the media column&#8217;s data in schedule tables.</li>\n<li>Minor clean-up of CSS stylesheets in a number of areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the framework to automatically update league standings from the league games that are marked final. (It is not necessary to update records with the Add-ons.)</li>\n<li>Upgraded sorting of standings with two levels of tie-breakers (that actually work).</li>\n<li>Paginated the Update Games screen to workaround WordPress limits on the size of (http) posts. (This also reduces the risk of web server timeouts.)</li>\n<li>Added the ability to import a league&#8217;s games from a CSV file.</li>\n<li>New data fields and display options for front end displays (shortcodes).</li>\n<li>League sliders and tickers now display media icons with links when media is available for a game.</li>\n<li>Added a /lang directory with a .POT file for translators</li>\n<li>Fixed several bugs including sorting venues by venue group on the Venues screen.</li>\n<li>Changed URLs to Protocol Relative URLs to prevent some problems with https based sites. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Two different League Schedule schedule/scoreboard scrolling views have been added. &#8220;Tickers&#8221; are a very concise view, for a banner on the main page say. &#8220;Sliders&#8221; present the same information in a larger format. <a href=\"http://dev.shoalsummitsolutions.com/lm-sliders-tickers/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See the examples on the MSTW dev site.</a></li>\n<li>League standings table now supports columns for  &#8220;Last Game&#8221; and &#8220;Next Game&#8221;</li>\n<li>Home games are no longer automatically indicated with a &#8216;<em>&#8216; in mstw_team_schedule shortcode table. A &#8216;star_home&#8217; shortcode argument was added (which must be placed in the shortcode call). If star_home is not empty, the value is added after the opponent name for home games. For example, if star_home=&#8217;</em>&#8216;, an asterisk is added to home games. The home game format may also be changed via the tr.home-game css tag.</li>\n<li>Added a &#8216;star_league&#8217; shortcode argument for mstw_team_schedule shorcode (which must be placed in the shortcode call). If star_league is not empty, the value is added after the opponent name for league games. For example, if star_league=&#8217;*&#8217;, an asterisk is added to league games.</li>\n<li>Team schedule tables now honor the settings in the Settings -&gt; Schedule Table screen. Please read the man page for more information on how Team Schedules and League Schedules share this set of settings.</li>\n<li>Team Schedule tables now display the results of final games as &#8220;W 24-14&#8221; or &#8220;L 14-24&#8221; instead of the &#8220;CAL 24, USC 14&#8221; displayed in the League Schedule tables.</li>\n<li>New arguments have been provided to display a number of days on each side of &#8220;today&#8221; in the schedule/scoreboard tickers.</li>\n<li>Changed the link to the team URL from the team name in league schedule tables to NOT open a new tab. I believe this is six of one, half dozen of the other, but if there is enough pushback, I&#8217;ll add a setting or shortcode argument to control this behavior.</li>\n<li>Games now have &#8220;post content&#8221;, which is displayed on the single game template (/templates/single_game.php). This can be used to show pre-game info, and/or a post game summary and statistics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the standings tables from updating when teams were moved between leagues. <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/league-manager-versions-1-2-1-3\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more here.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that prevented game times from being displayed correctly (no minutes displayed)</li>\n<li>Minor clean-ups</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added [mstw_location_table] shortcode</li>\n<li>Added venue groups to the venues(locations) admin screen and the above shortcode</li>\n<li>Added a Next Game field to the Standings Tables</li>\n<li>Added links from standings table fields: Team Name to Team URL or Team Schedule, and Next Game to Single Game Page.</li>\n<li>Added links from schedules table, team schedule table, and schedule gallery fields: Team Name to Team URL or Team Schedule, Location(Venue) to Venue URL or Google Map, and Game Time/Result to Single Game page.</li>\n<li>Added a show_home_away argument to the mstw_team_schedule shortcode.</li>\n<li>Added home-game and away-game class tags to the team schedule tables.</li>\n<li>Corrected some minor bugs.</li>\n<li>Removed some left over debug messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
