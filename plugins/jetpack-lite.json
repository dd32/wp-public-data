Jepack Lite <strong>IS NOT an official</strong> plugin by Automattic or WordPress.com</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why Jetpack Lite 3.x needs Jetpack to be installed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When I created Jetpack Lite years ago, I did it as fork of Jetpack <strong>only because no other method to do it was available at that moment</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, since some time Jetpack can be trimmed down without the need of making a fork. That&#8217;s why I changed the way Jetpack Lite does the work. In fact, now, Jetpack Lite doesn&#8217;t use any resource, it simply says to Jetpack to only load the Stats and Shorlinks modules, so the other modules won&#8217;t load or consume any resource in your WordPress.</p>\n<p>This way is much better, because now you don&#8217;t need to wait for me to update a whole new plugin when a new Jetpack gets published.</p>\n<p>So now when Jetpack core or Stats and Shortlink modules are improved by Automattic, you&#8217;ll get that just by upgrading Jetpack while keeping the reduction of Jetpack resources usage.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
