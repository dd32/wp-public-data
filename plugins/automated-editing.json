For several reasons that can be annoying. So, every time a post is saved, the plugin just checks, whether there is an excerpt or not. If there is no excerpt, it will check, whether you have defined some length or type of excerpt. If you haven&#8217;t, the plugin just creates a post excerpt by cutting off all short codes of the content and taking the first 3 sentences as the excerpt. The same happens with the &#8216;more&#8217; tag. It will be automatically set, if you want it. If you don&#8217;t define a number of sentences after which the tag has to be inserted, the plugin will insert it after 5 sentences.</p>\n<p>Since version 1.4 you have the possibility to check elder posts for missing excerpts, &#8216;more&#8217; tags and thumbnails. The plugin will try to fix those posts automatically and deliver a list of posts that could not be fixed. You can access these posts from the admin panel of the automated editing plugin and try to fix them manually.</p>\n<p>It is also completely multisite enabled since version 1.4.
