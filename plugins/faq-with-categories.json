        "description": "<p>FAQs are great for your visitors and when implemented correctly also for SEO.</p>\n<p>This simple FAQ plugin creates a new post-type. This is straightforward and flexible: you can now create and manage FAQs like any other post type in WordPress.</p>\n<p>The FAQs can be summoned using shortcodes, the default for the central FAQ page is [faq-with-categories]. More options are explained below and on the settings page.</p>\n<p>FAQs are always sorted by published-date descending, so newest entries are first (you can manipulate the published date of each post).</p>\n<p>You can choose a taxonomy, the default is ‘category’, to attach your FAQ posts to. You can now summon FAQs for a specific category (including sub categories) on a page. The plugin also uses it to filter the FAQs if you place the filter on your central FAQ page.</p>\n<p>If you want some FAQs in other locations that do not appear on the central page you can use an ‘exclusive’ tag.</p>\n<p>When there are many entries, a ‘Show more’ button appears automatically (configurable in the settings)</p>\n<h4>Pros</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Easy to manage the FAQs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tidy accordion display and smooth filtering / searching</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ‘exclusive’ short_code and the central FAQ page output FAQ snippet schema data as ld+json in the head</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports direct linking to pre-select the filters (faq-page?category=name%20of%20category)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automatically follows (chosen) taxonomy hierarchy (infinite depth) with added option to order the categories</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cons</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Only 1 central FAQ list is supported (though you can display subsets of the FAQs anywhere you want)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Currently only with shortcodes, no widgets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Filtering and searching the FAQs only work with javascript enabled (but then again, so does most of WordPress)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Short codes</h4>\n<p>You may use the following shortcodes, of course certain combinations do not make sense and may produce erratic behaviour.</p>\n<p><strong>[faq-with-categories]</strong> produces the default list with all the faqs and outputs FAQ snippets schema in the head. Use only ONCE for central FAQ page, and on pages that are linked to a taxonomy (category) in the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>[faq-with-categories-filter]</strong> produces a filter menu according to the chosen taxonomy using the specified order (only works when default shortcode is also on that page).</p>\n<p><strong>[faq-with-categories-search]</strong> produces a search box that will perform client-side lookup through the faqs (only works when default shortcode is also on that page).</p>\n<p>[faq-with-categories <strong>quantity=&#8221;5&#8243;</strong>] <em>(1)</em> limits the quantity of the faqs to 5, or use another number.
