        "changelog": "<h4>3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhauled the code so most of the data is in javascript</li>\n<li>Created handlers for touch and keyboard</li>\n<li>Created logic to check for allowed moves</li>\n<li>The maze is now solvable and should work with mouse, touch or arrow keys, on phone, tablet and PC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIxed the shortcode so it returns, not echos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweaked the display. Not 100% satisfied but it works well enough for now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>We have attained version 2, a fully printable, solveable, random maze!</li>\n<li>I rethought the display code to make sure it fits your display as least somewhat.</li>\n<li>I added a green and red tile as a start and end point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I replaced the current display code with one that creates a canvas image.</li>\n<li>I originally had it draw walls, except for the exit walls. This caused a problem with edges midding chunks.</li>\n<li>I finally had it draw a black background, then cut our the floor.</li>\n<li>It then cut out the walls it needed to making things look better.</li>\n<li>The ground toggles between 2 grays.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>After many changes and optimizations to how I was doing things, I made so that it</li>\n<li>Marks itself used. Increments the total counter.</li>\n<li>Looks for walls that are not bedrock or in use already.</li>\n<li>Randomly picks a wall, marks that bit, then in the new room, marks the opposite wall bit</li>\n<li>It then moves to the new room.</li>\n<li>If it can&#8217;t find an exit, it moves back one in the history and repeats until it finds a new room</li>\n<li>What REALLY REALLY helps is when you map height to h and width to w in the history instead of the other way around.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how I enqueueued the css framework. Hopefully this doesn&#8217;t mess up any themes. If so I&#8217;ll have to compile a css file with w3 under #maniacal_maze_mazer</li>\n<li>Moved the maze creating code over to a function.</li>\n<li>Renamed the variable $doors to $walls since it does the exact opposite of what I named it.</li>\n<li>Started working on the function for starting the process with the first two steps in the loop, manually in a for().</li>\n<li>Took out my test code for error checking and resubmitting to WP Repository!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release to submit to WordPress for inclusion into the repository.</li>\n<li>Maze width and height page with error checking finished.</li>\n<li>Link is created and page refreshed to the new link.</li>\n<li>Links can be entered by hand and easy to change.</li>\n<li>Links are error checked.</li>\n<li>Array of cells created with empty value for doors.</li>\n<li>Array of bitwise &#8220;bedrock&#8221; created to make it easier when finding valid walls.</li>\n<li>CSS done using W3.CSS.</li>\n<li>Created jQuery and javascript to handle buttons turning red as well as sizing cell to fit your display and to update this if your viewport size changes.</li>\n</ul>\n",
