        "faq": "\n<h4>How to uninstall?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either deactivate the plugin or delete the plugin&#8217;s directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why another such plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many WP plugins don&#8217;t correctly include JS and CSS files most of the current CDN plugins cannot<br />\nrewrite links correctly. They rely on the high-level WP API.</p>\n<p>This plugin does its rewriting on the lowest level possible &#8211; PHP itself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After your blog pages have been rendered but before sending them to the visitor,<br />\nit will rewrite links pointing to <code>wp-content</code> and <code>wp-includes</code>. That rewriting will simply<br />\nreplace your blog URL with that you have entered in settings screen.</p>\n<p>Thus files are pulled from the other site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it compatible to plugin XY?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, by design it is compatible to all plugins. It hooks into a PHP function (<a href=\"http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php\" title=\"function documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ob_start</a>)<br />\nand there does the string replacement. Therefore, no WordPress function is altered, overwritten or modified in any way.</p>\n<p>Indeed, you could even copy this plugin&#8217;s rewriter into any arbitrary PHP software.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I see it in action?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On my own blog, <a href=\"http://mark.ossdl.de/\" title=\"Mark's blog\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mark&#8217;s blog</a>. See the source code of any page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it work with my CDN?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if it supports origin pull (aka mirror bucket, some sort of caching). Or if you upload your files manually.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about Amazon&#8217;s S3?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right, S3 doesn&#8217;t support origin pull. You will have to upload your files by hand.<br />\nI&#8217;ve written a script for this, too, so it is just a matter of running it. It is linked on the bottom of my blog post about <a href=\"http://mark.ossdl.de/2009/09/how-to-copy-your-wordpress-files-to-cloudfront-efficiently/\" title=\"how to copy your WordPress files to S3 efficiently\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">copying files to S3</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What other plugins do you recommend?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Now that you can offload all the files such as images, music or CSS, you should serve your blog posts as static files to decrease load on your server.<br />\nI recommend <a href=\"http://murmatrons.armadillo.homeip.net/features/experimental-eaccelerator-wp-super-cache\" title=\"Wordpress SuperCache-Plus\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SuperCache-Plus</a><br />\nas it will maintain, update and create that static files from dynamic content for you.<br />\nThe off-linker is compatible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Alternatives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The experts at <code>Arcostream</code> currently develop (or have it ready by now) a plugin which enables you to set up a CDN at their&#8217;s<br />\nwith one click or two. Without any configuration, everything is automatic. Please google their licensed flavour of this plugin. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I discovered a bug!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using the <code>lite</code> version, please upgrade.<br />\nThe following applies only to the <code>regular</code> version which you can find at <a href=\"https://github.com/wmark/CDN-Linker\" title=\"CDN Linker at Github\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</p>\n<p>Share it with me! The rarer a species, the more interesting. But I will need its habitat, too.<br />\nTherefore, please send me at least one page with the plugin turned off and on, as attachment.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
