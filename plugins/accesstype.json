        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20accesstype%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does AccessType Plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AccessType plugin renders paywall or content based on the post being read and the plan purchased by the reader.<br />\nIt lets you mark posts as behind paywall, behind login or public and provides shortcodes which can be added to Subscribe page or My Subscriptions page.<br />\nAccessType plugin communicates with AccessType platform. Most of the heavy lifting is done by the AccessType platform, hence adds negligible load on your wordpress server, and a whole lot of possibilities for content monetisation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20makes%20accesstype%20different%20as%20compared%20to%20other%20subscriptions%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat makes AccessType different as compared to other subscriptions plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AccessType ensures a very low drop off rate during the subscription purchase journey by its frictionless purchase flow and multilevel integrations with the payment gateways. For the users who drop off during the purchase journey, due to some uncontrollable reason, AccessType provides a report so that you can target those potential subscribers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20accesstype%20support%20metering%3F'>\nDoes AccessType Support Metering?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes metering is supported in AccessType. Metering can be configured for both logged in and anonymous users. When metering is enabled, a cookie tracks and and decrements the count. Upon exhausting the count AccessType shows the hard paywall for the user to buy a subscription.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20the%20subscribers%20data%20for%20detailed%20analysis%3F'>\nCan I export the subscribers data for detailed analysis?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can export a detailed CSV report any time from AccessType dashboard. You can also configure outgoing webhooks for desired events.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20already%20using%20another%20subscriptions%20plugin%2C%20why%20should%20i%20move%20to%20accesstype%3F'>\nI am already using another subscriptions plugin, why should I move to AccessType?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AccessType does all the heavy-lifting on your behalf, adding negligible load on your wordpress server.
