The standard emails still go out, they just don&#8217;t contain the email address or IP of the commenter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which Pluggable functions does this plugin override?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The following functions are overriden by this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wp_notify_postauthor</code></li>\n<li><code>wp_notify_moderator</code></li>\n<li><code>wp_new_user_notification</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to the way pluggable functions works, you can NOT have any other plugins trying to override these functions or they will clash. Some of these functions have actions/filters that you can use to further modify how they operate and in time I plan to add more of these hooks to my versions of these functions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to help with development of this Plugin!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The project is now hosted on <a href=\"http://github.com/xentek/private-email-notifications\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>.
