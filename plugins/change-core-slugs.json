Same goes if you again change any slug. If you want redirection, you must set it through server rules or with other plugins.</p>\n<p>If you disable this plugin, old, default slugs will be restored and URLs with new slugs will stop working. The only way to keep new slugs is by manually setting them in the code.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: because of two bugs in WordPress core, in some cases setting custom slugs will not work properly.
