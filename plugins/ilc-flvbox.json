        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>ilc-flvbox</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>You can access the options page via the Admin navigation or in the plugins list, using the Settings link.</li>\n<li>Edit a post/page, upload a video using the Add Video button and insert the link to the file into the post.</li>\n<li>If you wish to include a preview of the video upload a jpg image with the same name than the video. For example, if your video is &#8220;piano.flv&#8221; the jpg would be &#8220;piano.jpg&#8221;.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I have changed ThickBox&#8217;s css and nothing happens</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t have other ThickBox loading. The wp_enqueue_script is the safe method for including script files into WordPress but some plugin developers are not using it. Ask who develops your plugin to modify it by using wp&#095;enqueue&#095;script and wp&#095;enqueue&#095;style.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which is the version of jQuery that this plugin uses?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin enqueues the jQuery version included in WordPress. As of version 2.7 WP includes jQuery version 1.2.6. But WP 2.3.2 includes version 1.1.4 so it will probably be ok. I haven&#8217;t tested ThickBox with jQuery 1.3 yet. The version included with WordPress is safe to be used along with scriptaculous, mootools and other libraries.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
