It works best on theme pages with large<br />\nareas of little content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I use this as a normal slideshow?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, create a div element or other suitable container on your page and configure<br />\nyour slideshow to use the element&#8217;s id or class. Make sure you&#8217;ve styled the<br />\nelement to give it a suitable size.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I have a default slideshow that shows on every page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, slideshows must be defined on an individual post or page basis.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
