        "description": "<p>More than 9 out of 10 users are using a browser that is able to display webp images. Yet, on most websites, they are served jpeg images, which are typically double the size of webp images for a given quality. What a waste of bandwidth! This plugin was created to help remedy that situation. With little effort, WordPress admins can have their site serving autogenerated webp images to browsers that supports it, while still serving jpeg and png files to browsers that does not support webp.</p>\n<h3>The image converter</h3>\n<p>The plugin uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert</a> library to convert images to webp. <em>WebP Convert</em> is able to convert images using multiple methods. There are the &#8220;local&#8221; conversion methods: <code>imagick</code>, <code>cwebp</code>, <code>vips</code>, <code>gd</code>. If none of these works on your host, there are the cloud alternatives: <code>ewww</code> (paid) or connecting to a WordPress site where you got WebP Express installed and you enabled the &#8220;web service&#8221; functionality.</p>\n<h3>The &#8220;Serving webp to browsers that supports it&#8221; part.</h3>\n<p>The plugin supports different ways of delivering webps to browsers that supports it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By routing jpeg/png images to the corresponding webp &#8211; or to the image converter if the image hasn&#8217;t been converted yet.</li>\n<li>By altering the HTML, replacing image tags with <em>picture</em> tags. Missing webps are auto generated upon visit.</li>\n<li>By altering the HTML, replacing image URLs so all points to webp. The replacements only being made for browsers that supports webp. Again, missing webps are auto generated upon visit.</li>\n<li>In combination with <em>Cache Enabler</em>, the same as above can be achieved, but with page caching.</li>\n<li>You can also deliver webp to <em>all</em> browsers and add the <a href=\"http://webpjs.appspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">webpjs</a> javascript, which provides webp support for browsers that doesn&#8217;t support webp natively. However, beware that the javascript doesn&#8217;t support srcset attributes, which is why I haven&#8217;t added that method to the plugin (yet).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The plugin implements the &#8220;WebP On Demand&#8221; solution described <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert/blob/master/docs/v2.0/webp-on-demand/webp-on-demand.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and builds on a bunch of open source libraries (all maintained by me):<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert</a>: For converting images to webp<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert-cloud-service\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert Cloud Service</a>: For the Web Service functionality<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/dom-util-for-webp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DOM Util for WebP</a>: For the Alter HTML functionality<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/image-mime-type-guesser\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image MimeType Guesser</a>: For detecting mime types of images.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/htaccess-capability-tester\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HTAccess Capability Tester</a>: For testing .htaccess capabilities in a given directory, using live tests<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert-filemanager\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert File Manager</a>: For browsing conversions and triggering conversions.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/exec-with-fallback\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Exec With Fallback</a>: For emulating exec() on systems where it is disabled (using proc_open(), passthru() or similar alternatives).</p>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Much faster load time for images in browsers that supports webp. The converted images are typically <em>less than half the size</em> (for jpeg), while maintaining the same quality. Bear in mind that for most web sites, images are responsible for the largest part of the waiting time.</li>\n<li>Better user experience (whether performance goes from terrible to bad, or from good to impressive, it is a benefit).</li>\n<li>Better ranking in Google searches (performance is taken into account by Google).</li>\n<li>Less bandwidth consumption &#8211; makes a huge difference in the parts of the world where the internet is slow and costly (you know, ~80% of the world population lives under these circumstances).</li>\n<li>Currently ~97% of all traffic are done with browsers supporting webp.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s great for the environment too! Reducing network traffic reduces electricity consumption which reduces CO2 emissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-express/pull/213\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">should now work on Microsoft IIS server</a>, but it has not been tested thoroughly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Supporting WebP Express</h3>\n<p>Bread on the table don&#8217;t come for free, even though this plugin does, and always will.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/webp-express</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Configure it (the plugin doesn&#8217;t do anything until configured)</li>\n<li>Verify that it works</li>\n<li>(Optional) Bulk convert all images, either in the admin ui or using WP CLI (command: &#8220;webp-express&#8221;)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Configuring</h3>\n<p>You configure the plugin in <em>Settings &gt; WebP Express</em>.</p>\n<h4>Operation modes</h4>\n<p>As sort of a main switch, you can choose between the following modes of operation:</p>\n<p><em>Varied image responses</em>:<br />\nWebP Express creates redirection rules for images, such that a request for a jpeg will result in a webp – but only if the request comes from a webp-enabled browser. If a webp already exists, it is served immediately. Otherwise it is converted and then served. Note that not all CDN&#8217;s handles varied responses well.</p>\n<p><em>CDN friendly</em>:<br />\nIn &#8220;CDN friendly&#8221; mode, a jpeg is always served as a jpeg. Instead of varying the image response, WebP Express alters the HTML for webp usage.</p>\n<p><em>Just redirect</em>:<br />\nIn &#8220;just redirect&#8221; mode, WebP Express is used just for redirecting jpeg and pngs to existing webp images in the same folder. So in this mode, WebP express will not do any converting. It may be that you use another plugin for that, or that you converted the images off-line and uploaded them manually.</p>\n<p><em>Tweaked</em>:<br />\nHere you have all options available.</p>\n<h4>Conversion methods</h4>\n<p>WebP Express has a bunch of methods available for converting images: Executing cwebp binary, Gd extension, Imagick extension, ewww cloud converter and remote WebP express. Each requires <em>something</em>. In many cases, one of the conversion methods will be available. You can quickly identify which converters are working &#8211; there is a green icon next to them. Hovering conversion methods that are not working will show you what is wrong.</p>\n<p>In case no conversion methods are working out of the box, you have several options:<br />\n&#8211; You can install this plugin on another website, which supports a local conversion method and connect to that using the &#8220;Remote WebP Express&#8221; conversion method<br />\n&#8211; You can <a href=\"https://ewww.io/plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">purchase a key</a> for the ewww cloud converter. They do not charge credits for webp conversions, so all you ever have to pay is the one dollar start-up fee 🙂<br />\n&#8211; You can set up <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert-cloud-service\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">webp-convert-cloud-service</a> on another server and connect to that. Its open source.<br />\n&#8211; You can try to meet the server requirements of cwebp, gd, imagick or gmagick. Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert/wiki/Meeting-the-requirements-of-the-converters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this wiki page</a> on how to do that</p>\n<h3>Quality detection of jpegs</h3>\n<p>If your server has Imagick extension or is able to execute imagemagick binary, the plugin will be able to detect the quality of a jpeg, and use that quality for the converted webp. You can tell if the quality detection is available by hovering the help icon in Conversion &gt; Jpeg options &gt; Quality for lossy. The last line in that help text tells you.</p>\n<p>This auto quality has benefits over fixed quality as it ensures that each conversion are converted with an appropriate quality. Encoding low quality jpegs to high quality webps does not magically increase the visual quality so that your webp looks better than the original. But it does result in a much larger filesize than if the jpeg where converting to a webp with the same quality setting as the original.</p>\n<p>If you do not have quality detection working, you can try one of the following:<br />\n&#8211; Install Imagick on the server (for this purpose, it is not required that it is compiled with WebP support)<br />\n&#8211; Install imagemagick on the server and grant permission for PHP to use the &#8220;exec&#8221; function.<br />\n&#8211; Use &#8220;Remote WebP Express&#8221; converter to connect to a site, that <em>does</em> have quality detection working<br />\n&#8211; If you have cwebp converter available, you can configure it to aim for a certain reduction, rather than using the quality parameter. Set this to for example 50%, or even 45%.</p>\n<h3>Verifying that it works (in &#8220;Varied image responses&#8221; mode)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure at least one of the conversion methods are working. It should have a green checkmark next to it.</li>\n<li>If you haven&#8217;t saved yet, click &#8220;Save settings&#8221;. This will put redirection rules into .htaccess files in the relevant directories (typically in uploads, themes and wp-content/webp-express/webp-images, depending on the &#8220;Scope&#8221; setting)</li>\n<li>I assume that you checked at least one of the two first checkboxes in the .htaccess rules section. Otherwise you aren&#8217;t using &#8220;varied responses&#8221;, and then the &#8220;CDN friendly&#8221; mode will be more appropriate.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Live test&#8221; buttons to see that the enabled rules actually are working. If they are not, it <em>could</em> be that the server needs a little time to recognize the changed rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The live tests are quite thorough and I recommend them over a manual test. However, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to do a manual inspection too.</p>\n<p><em>Doing a manual inspection</em></p>\n<p>Note that when WebP Express is serving varied image responses, the image URLs <em>still points to the jpg/png</em>. If the URL is visited using a browser that supports webp, however, the response will be a webp image. So there is a mismatch between the file extension (the filename ends with &#8220;jpg&#8221; or &#8220;png&#8221;) and the file type. But luckily, the browser does not rely on the extension to determine the file type, it only looks at the Content-Type response header.</p>\n<p>To verify that the plugin is working (without clicking the test button), do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the page in a browser that supports webp, ie Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Right-click the page and choose &#8220;Inspect&#8221;</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Network&#8221; tab</li>\n<li>Reload the page</li>\n<li>Find a jpeg or png image in the list. In the &#8220;type&#8221; column, it should say &#8220;webp&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also look at the headers. When WebP Express has redirected to an existing webp, there will be a &#8220;X-WebP-Express&#8221; header with the following value: &#8220;Redirected directly to existing webp&#8221;. If there isn&#8217;t (and you have checked &#8220;Enable redirection to converter&#8221;), you should see a &#8220;WebP-Convert-Log&#8221; header (WebP-Express uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert</a> for conversions).</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<p><em>Note:</em><br />\nThe redirect rules created in <em>.htaccess</em> are pointing to a PHP script. If you happen to change the url path of your plugins, the rules will have to be updated. The <em>.htaccess</em> also passes the path to wp-content (relative to document root) to the script, so the script knows where to find its configuration and where to store converted images. So again, if you move the wp-content folder, or perhaps moves WordPress to a subfolder, the rules will have to be updated. As moving these things around is a rare situation, WebP Express are not using any resources monitoring this. However, it will do the check when you visit the settings page.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em><br />\nDo not simply remove the plugin without deactivating it first. Deactivation takes care of removing the rules in the <em>.htaccess</em> file. With the rules there, but converter gone, your Google Chrome visitors will not see any jpeg images.</p>\n<h3>Bulk convert</h3>\n<p>You can start a bulk conversion two ways:<br />\n1. In the admin UI. On the settings screen, there is a &#8220;Bulk Convert&#8221; button<br />\n2. By using WP CLI (command: &#8220;webp-express&#8221;).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m currently working on a file manager interface, which will become a third way.</p>\n<h3>Making sure new images becomes converted</h3>\n<p>There are several ways:<br />\n1. Enable redirection to converter in the <em>.htaccess rules</em> section.<br />\n2. Enable &#8220;Convert on upload&#8221;. Note that this may impact upload experience in themes which defines many formats.<br />\n3. Set up a cron job, which executes <code>wp webp-express convert</code> regularily</p>\n<h3>WP CLI command</h3>\n<p>WebP Express currently supports commands for converting and flushing webp images throug the CLI. You can use the &#8211;help option to learn about the options:<br />\n<em>wp webp-express &#8211;help</em>. Displays the available commands<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert &#8211;help</em>. Displays the available options for the &#8220;convert&#8221; command.</p>\n<p>A few examples:<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert</em>: Creates webp images for all unconverted images<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert &#8211;reconvert</em>: Also convert images that are already converted<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert themes</em>: Only images in the themes folder<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert uploads/2021</em>: Only images in the &#8220;2021&#8221; folder inside the uploads folder<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert &#8211;only-png</em>: Only the PNG images<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert &#8211;quality=50</em>: Use quality 50 (instead of what was entered in settings screen)<br />\n<em>wp webp-express convert &#8211;converter=cwebp</em>: Specifically use cwebp converter.</p>\n<p><em>wp webp-express flushwebp</em>: Remove all webp images<br />\n<em>wp webp-express flushwebp &#8211;only-png</em>: Remove all webp images that are conversions of PNG images</p>\n<p>Synopsises:</p>\n<pre><code>wp webp-express convert [&lt;location&gt;] [--reconvert] [--only-png] [--only-jpeg] [--quality=&lt;number&gt;] [--near-lossless=&lt;number&gt;] [--alpha-quality=&lt;number&gt;] [--encoding=&lt;auto|lossy|lossless&gt;] [--converter=&lt;converter&gt;]\nwp webp-express flushwebp [--only-png]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I&#8217;m considering adding commands for viewing status, viewing conversion stats, generating the .htaccess files and modifying the settings. Please let me know if you need any of these or perhaps something else.</p>\n",

The plugin serves webp images on same URL as the original (unconverted) images, so do not let appearances fool you! Confused? See next FAQ item.</p>\n<p>Assuming that you have inspected the <em>content type</em> header, and it doesn&#8217;t show &#8220;image/webp&#8221;, please make sure that:<br />\n1) You tested with a browser that supports webp (such as Chrome)<br />\n2) The image URL you are looking at are not pointing to another server (such as gravatar.com)</p>\n<p>Assuming that all above is in place, please look at the response headers to see if there is a <em>X-WebP-Convert-Status</em> header. If there isn&#8217;t, well, then it seems that the problem is that the image request isn&#8217;t handed over to WebP Express. Reasons for that can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are on NGINX (or an Apache/Nginx combination). NGINX requires special attention, please look at that FAQ item</li>\n<li>You are on WAMP. Please look at that FAQ item</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I shall write more on this FAQ item&#8230; Stay tuned.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20a%20webp%20image%20be%20served%20on%20an%20url%20ending%20with%20%22jpg%22%3F'>\nHow can a webp image be served on an URL ending with &#8220;jpg&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy enough. Browsers looks at the <em>content type</em> header rather than the URL to determine what it is that it gets. So, although it can be confusing that the resource at <em>example.com/image.jpg</em> is a webp image, rest assured that the browsers are not confused. To determine if the plugin is working, you must therefore examine the <em>content type</em> response header rather than the URL. See the &#8220;How do I verify that the plugin is working?&#8221; Faq item.</p>\n<p>I am btw considering making an option to have the plugin redirect to the webp instead of serving immediately. That would remove the apparent mismatch between file extension and content type header. However, the cost of doing that will be an extra request for each image, which means extra time and worse performance.

While method 1 can be combined with any of the other methods, you would usually just pick method 1 or one of the others if method 1 cannot be used for you.</p>\n<p>Can some of these go wrong?<br />\nYes. All!</p>\n<p><strong>Method 1: Varied image responses</strong><br />\nThe &#8220;Varied image responses&#8221; method adds rules to the <code>.htaccess</code> which redirects jpegs and pngs to the corresponding webps (if they exist). The rules have a condition that makes sure they only trigger for browsers supports webp images (this is established by examining the &#8220;accept&#8221; header).</p>\n<p>I the method &#8220;varied image responses&#8221; because the response on a given image URL <em>varies</em> (the webp is served on the same URL as the jpeg/png).</p>\n<p>In the cases where method 1 fails, it is due to systems that cache images by the URL alone. To prevent this from happening, the <code>.htaccess</code> rules adds a <code>Vary:Accept</code> response header. However, most CDNs does not respect that header unless they are configured to do so. Fortunately proxy servers respects it nicely (however often by throwing out the cached image if the accept header doesn&#8217;t match)</p>\n<p>Method 1 can go wrong if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are using a CDN and it hasn&#8217;t been set up to handle varied image responses. If this has happened, it is critical that you purge the CDN cache! For information regarding CDN setups, check out the CDN section in this FAQ</li>\n<li>Your server doesn&#8217;t support adding response headers in <code>.htaccess</code>. On Apache, the &#8220;mod_headers&#8221; module needs to be enabled. Otherwise the all important <code>Vary:Accept</code> response header will not be set on the response.</li>\n<li>Your server doesn&#8217;t support SetEnv. However, that module is fortunately very common. I have posted a possible solution to make the rules work without SetEnv <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/setenv/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>You are on Nginx and you haven&#8217;t created rules that adds the <code>Vary:Accept</code> header.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I do not believe it can go wrong in other ways. To be certain, please check out <a href=\"http://toste.dk/rh.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this test page</a>. When visiting the test-page with Safari, you should see two images with the “JPG” label over them. When visiting the test-page with a browser that supports webp, you should see two images with the “WEBP” label over them. If you do not see one of these things, please report! (no-one has yet experienced that)</p>\n<p>Since WebP Express 0.15.0 you can use the &#8220;Live test&#8221; button to check that browsers not supporting webp gets the original files and that the Vary:Accept header is returned. Note however that it may not detect CDN caching problems if the CDN doesn&#8217;t cache a new image immediately &#8211; and across all its nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Method 2: Altering HTML to use picture tags</strong><br />\nIMG tags are replaced with PICTURE tags which has two sources. One of them points to the webp and has the &#8220;content-type&#8221; set to &#8220;image/webp&#8221;. The other points to the original. The browser will select the webp source if it supports webp and the other source if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Method 2 can go wrong on old browser that doesn&#8217;t support the picture tag syntax. However, simply enable the &#8220;Dynamically load picturefill.js on older browsers&#8221; option, and it will take care of that issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Method 3: Altering HTML to point directly to webps in webp enabled browsers</strong><br />\nIn this solution, the URLs in the HTML are modified for browsers that supports webp. Again, this is determined by examining the &#8220;accept&#8221; header. So, actually the complete page HTML varies with this method.</p>\n<p>Method 3 can go wrong if you are using a page caching plugin if that plugin does not create a separate webp cache for webp-enabled browsers. The <em>Cache Enabler</em> plugin handles this. I don&#8217;t believe there are other page caching plugins that does. There is a FAQ section in this FAQ describing how to set <em>Cache Enabler</em> up to work in tandem with WebP Express.</p>\n<p>Note that Firefox 66+ unfortunately stopped including &#8220;image/webp&#8221; in the &#8220;accept&#8221; header it sends when requesting <em>the page</em>. While Firefox 66+ fortunately still includes &#8220;image/webp&#8221; in its accept header <em>for images</em>. That will however not get it webp images when using method 3.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20on%20nginx%20or%20openresty'>\nI am on NGINX or OpenResty\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WebP Express works well on NGINX, however the UI is not streamlined NGINX yet. And of course, NGINX does not process the .htaccess files that WebP Express generates. WebP Express can be used without redirection, as it can alter HTML to use picture tags which links to the webp alternative. See &#8220;The simple way&#8221; below. Or, you can get your hands dirty and set up redirection in NGINX guided by the &#8220;The advanced way&#8221; section below.</p>\n<p><strong>The simple way (no redirecting rules)</strong><br />\nThe easy solution is simply to use the plugin in &#8220;CDN friendly&#8221; mode, do a bulk conversion (takes care of converting existing images), activate the &#8220;Convert on upload&#8221; option (takes care of converting new images in the media library) and enable Alter HTML (takes care of delivering webp to webp enabled browsers while still delivering the original jpeg/png to browsers not supporting webp).</p>\n<p><em>PRO</em>: Very easy to set up.<br />\n<em>CON</em>: Images in external CSS and images being dynamically added with javascript will not be served as webp.<br />\n<em>CON</em>: New new theme images will not be converted until you run a new Bulk conversion</p>\n<p><strong>The advanced way (creating NGINX redirecting rules)</strong><br />\nCreating NGINX rules requires manually inserting redirection rules in the NGINX configuration file (nginx.conf or the configuration file for the site, found in <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available</code>). If you do not have access to do that, you will have to settle with the &#8220;simple way&#8221; described above.</p>\n<p>There are two different approaches to achieve the redirections. The one that I recommend is based on a <em>try_files</em> directive. If that doesn&#8217;t work for you, you can try the alternative rules that are based on the <em>rewrite</em> directive. The rules are described in the next couple of sections.</p>\n<p>For multisite on NGINX, read <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-express/issues/8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Recommended rules (using &#8220;try_files&#8221;)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Preparational step:</strong><br />\nThe rules looks for existing webp files by appending &#8220;.webp&#8221; to the URL.

I don&#8217;t think that is a big issue, but for those who do, WebP Express might still be for you, even though you have Jetpack. And that is because WebP Express can be set up just to generate webp&#8217;s, without doing the internal redirection to webp (will be possible from version 0.10.0). You can then for example use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler/\" rel=\"ugc\">Cache Enabler</a> plugin, which is able to generate and cache two versions of each page.

(&#8220;CDN friendly&#8221; mode)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In <em>CDN friendly</em> mode, there is no trickery with varied image responses, so no special attention is required <em>on the CDN</em>.</p>\n<p>However, there are other pitfalls.</p>\n<p>The thing is that, unless you have the whole site on a CDN, you are probably using a plugin that <em>alters the HTML</em> in order to point your static assets to the CDN. If you have enabled the &#8220;Alter HTML&#8221; in WebP Express, it means that you now have <em>two alterations</em> on the image URLs!</p>\n<p>How will that play out?</p>\n<p>Well, if <em>WebP Express</em> gets to alter the HTML <em>after</em> the image URLs have been altered to point to a CDN, we have trouble. WebP Express does not alter external images but the URLs are now external.</p>\n<p>However, if <em>WebP Express</em> gets to alter the HTML <em>before</em> the other plugin, things will work fine.</p>\n<p>So it is important that <em>WebP Express</em> gets there first.</p>\n<p><em>The good news is that WebP Express does get there first on all the plugins I have tested.</em></p>\n<p>But what can you do if it doesn&#8217;t?</p>\n<p>Firstly, you have an option in WebP Express to select between:<br />\n1. Use content filtering hooks (the_content, the_excerpt, etc)<br />\n2. The complete page (using output buffering)</p>\n<p>The content filtering hooks gets to process the content before output buffering does. So in case output buffering isn&#8217;t early enough for you, choose the content filtering hooks.</p>\n<p>There is a risk that you CDN plugin also uses content filtering hooks. I haven&#8217;t encountered any though. But if there is any out there that does, chances are that they get to process the content before WebP Express, because I have set the priority of these hooks quite high (10000). The reasoning behind this is to that we want to replace images that might be inserted using the same hook (for example, a theme might use <em>the_content</em> filter to insert the featured image). If you do encounter a plugin for changing URLs for CDN which uses the content filtering hooks, you are currently out of luck. Let me know, so I can fix that (ie. by making the priority configurable)</p>\n<p>Here are a list of some plugins for CDN and when they process the HTML:</p>\n<p>  Plugin<br />\n  Method<br />\n  Hook(s)<br />\n  Priority</p>\n<p>  BunnyCDN<br />\n  Output buffering<br />\n  template_redirect<br />\n  default (10)</p>\n<p>  CDN enabler<br />\n  Output buffering<br />\n  template_redirect<br />\n  default (10)</p>\n<p>  Jetpack<br />\n  content filtering<br />\n  the_content, etc<br />\n  the_content: 10</p>\n<p>  W3 Total Cache<br />\n  Output buffering<br />\n  no hooks. Buffering is started before hooks</p>\n<p>  WP Fastest Cache<br />\n  Output buffering<br />\n  no hooks. Buffering is started before hooks</p>\n<p>  WP Super Cache<br />\n  Output buffering<br />\n  init<br />\n  default (10)</p>\n<p>With output buffering the plugin that starts the output buffering first gets to process the output last. So WebP Express starts as late as possible, which is on the <code>template_redirect</code> hook, with priority 10000 (higher means later). This is later than the <code>init</code> hook, which is again later than the <code>no hooks</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20on%20cloudflare'>\nI am on Cloudflare\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Without configuration, Cloudflare will not maintain separate caches for jpegs and webp; all browsers will get jpeg. To make Cloudflare cache not only by URL, but also by header, you need to use the <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004290387\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Cache Key</a> page rule, and add <em>Header content</em>  to make separate caches depending on the <em>Accept</em> request header.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>Custom Cache Key</em> rule currently requires an <em>Enterprise</em> account. And if you already have that, you may as well go with the <em>Polish</em> feature, which starts at the “Pro” level plan.  &hellip;</p>\n</p>\n\n",

    "short_description": "Serve autogenerated WebP images instead of jpeg/png to browsers that supports WebP.",
    "description": "<p>More than 9 out of 10 users are using a browser that is able to display webp images. Yet, on most websites, they are served jpeg images, which are typically double the size of webp images for a given quality. What a waste of bandwidth! This plugin was created to help remedy that situation. With little effort, WordPress admins can have their site serving autogenerated webp images to browsers that supports it, while still serving jpeg and png files to browsers that does not support webp.</p>\n<h3>The image converter</h3>\n<p>The plugin uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert</a> library to convert images to webp. <em>WebP Convert</em> is able to convert images using multiple methods. There are the &#8220;local&#8221; conversion methods: <code>imagick</code>, <code>cwebp</code>, <code>vips</code>, <code>gd</code>. If none of these works on your host, there are the cloud alternatives: <code>ewww</code> (paid) or connecting to a WordPress site where you got WebP Express installed and you enabled the &#8220;web service&#8221; functionality.</p>\n<h3>The &#8220;Serving webp to browsers that supports it&#8221; part.</h3>\n<p>The plugin supports different ways of delivering webps to browsers that supports it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By routing jpeg/png images to the corresponding webp &#8211; or to the image converter if the image hasn&#8217;t been converted yet.</li>\n<li>By altering the HTML, replacing image tags with <em>picture</em> tags. Missing webps are auto generated upon visit.</li>\n<li>By altering the HTML, replacing image URLs so all points to webp. The replacements only being made for browsers that supports webp. Again, missing webps are auto generated upon visit.</li>\n<li>In combination with <em>Cache Enabler</em>, the same as above can be achieved, but with page caching.</li>\n<li>You can also deliver webp to <em>all</em> browsers and add the <a href=\"http://webpjs.appspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">webpjs</a> javascript, which provides webp support for browsers that doesn&#8217;t support webp natively. However, beware that the javascript doesn&#8217;t support srcset attributes, which is why I haven&#8217;t added that method to the plugin (yet).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The plugin implements the &#8220;WebP On Demand&#8221; solution described <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert/blob/master/docs/v2.0/webp-on-demand/webp-on-demand.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and builds on a bunch of open source libraries (all maintained by me):<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert</a>: For converting images to webp<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert-cloud-service\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert Cloud Service</a>: For the Web Service functionality<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/dom-util-for-webp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DOM Util for WebP</a>: For the Alter HTML functionality<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/image-mime-type-guesser\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image MimeType Guesser</a>: For detecting mime types of images.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/htaccess-capability-tester\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HTAccess Capability Tester</a>: For testing .htaccess capabilities in a given directory, using live tests<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-convert-filemanager\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WebP Convert File Manager</a>: For browsing conversions and triggering conversions.<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/exec-with-fallback\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Exec With Fallback</a>: For emulating exec() on systems where it is disabled (using proc_open(), passthru() or similar alternatives).</p>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Much faster load time for images in browsers that supports webp. The converted images are typically <em>less than half the size</em> (for jpeg), while maintaining the same quality. Bear in mind that for most web sites, images are responsible for the largest part of the waiting time.</li>\n<li>Better user experience (whether performance goes from terrible to bad, or from good to impressive, it is a benefit).</li>\n<li>Better ranking in Google searches (performance is taken into account by Google).</li>\n<li>Less bandwidth consumption &#8211; makes a huge difference in the parts of the world where the internet is slow and costly (you know, ~80% of the world population lives under these circumstances).</li>\n<li>Currently ~97% of all traffic are done with browsers supporting webp.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s great for the environment too! Reducing network traffic reduces electricity consumption which reduces CO2 emissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/rosell-dk/webp-express/pull/213\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">should now work on Microsoft IIS server</a>, but it has not been tested thoroughly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Supporting WebP Express</h3>\n<p>Bread on the table don&#8217;t come for free, even though this plugin does, and always will.
