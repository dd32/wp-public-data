        "faq": "\n<h4>Tips</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As a general rule, it is always best to keep your WordPress installation and all<br />\nThemes and Plugins fully updated in order to avoid problems with this or any other<br />\nThemees or Plugins. I regularly update my site and test my Plugins and Themes with<br />\nthe latest version of WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the style of the plugin to match my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While there is currently no built-in Color Chooser to allow for full customization<br />\nof the plugin styles (though that is being considered for future releases), each<br />\nelement within the <code>jkl_review_box</code> contains its own unique CSS identifier, allowing<br />\nyou to hook into those in your own Custom CSS stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are now (since version 1.2) 8 different header color choices<br />\nand 2 box style choices (Light and Dark) that you can choose from in the WP Options<br />\nPage. These are not currently available to mix and match on individual Post pages.<br />\nWhichever style you choose in WP Options will be the style for the entire site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the Cover Image show up when I select it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to <em>immediately</em> display the Cover Image after you select it, this plugin<br />\nwould need to run AJAX (something it currently does not do). So, in order to see<br />\nthe preview of your Cover Image in the Custom Meta Box, you need to first<br />\neither <code>Save Draft</code> or <code>Publish</code> or <code>Update</code> your Post so that it <strong>saves</strong> the<br />\nmeta data first.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t know the some of the links for the product?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple: just leave those spaces blank. The plugin tests for the presence of data in<br />\neach input location and ONLY displays the data which it has saved. If you don&#8217;t<br />\ngive it data in a particular field, it won&#8217;t display that field at all on the Post page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the Affiliate Link disclaimer show up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to enable the Material Disclosures option in the WordPress Options page<br />\nfor this plugin. After doing so, you&#8217;ll be shown a preview of the Disclosures in<br />\nyour preferred box style (Light or Dark). You will then be able to choose whether<br />\nor not to include the Disclosures on a Post-by-Post basis in the last of the<br />\nCustom meta boxes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I specify the `Other` Review Type?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is currently no functionality to input or modify the <code>Other</code> Review Type<br />\nalthough this may be a feature to be considered for future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the Reviews plugin show up on my WordPress Pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s current functionality only places it on WordPress Posts. Later, there<br />\nwill be a Custom Post Type released for this plugin as well as additional display<br />\noptions, but for now, the plugin will only work on WordPress Posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I add multiple {authors, series, categories, images, links, etc}?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently there is no way to add (linking) multiples of anything. If you want to<br />\nadd multiple authors, series, or categories, just type in the two (or more) names<br />\nin the appropriate fields. If you want to add multiple images, use the Post Editor<br />\nto do so. If you want to add additional links, specifiy those in the Post Editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to add Tags to the Review for easier searching?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to add Tags, please use the Post Tags in the default WordPress Post<br />\neditor. Tags specifically for Reviews will not be implemented until the Custom<br />\nPost Type for Reviews is released.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>FontAwesome is not displaying properly on my site or taking too long to load.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please send me a detailed description of your error and a link to the site with the<br />\nissue so that I can have a look.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The display box style is broken/messed up on my site.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please send me a detailed description of your error as well as a screenshot so that<br />\nI can take a look at it. Things to include in your message include: (1) Your WordPress<br />\ninstallation version number, and (2) The Theme you are using (and its version<br />\nnumber &#8211; if relevant).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
