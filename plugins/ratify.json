Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>verifying that the home page has a valid Title tag</li>\n<li>verifying that the site is not blocking robots (Google)</li>\n<li>verifying that the site and all assets are being delivered over HTTPS</li>\n<li>verifying that the home page is delivered gzipped (compressed)</li>\n<li>verifying that images on the home page have ALT attributes\n<ul>\n<li>that the home page has H1, H2, H3, etc. tags</li>\n<li>that the HTML on the home page is valid</li>\n<li>that the HTML on the home page has Open Graph tags</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>much, much more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most cases the plugin can improve your Google Lighthouse score simply by installing it.</p>\n<p>The story of Ratify</p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>When you create more than 1 site per week (as we have at Secret Source Technology) using a different premium theme on each site, there are dozens or even hundreds of issues that can arise.</p>\n<p>The Ratify plugin is our latest attempt at formalizing our quality control. It is our guarantee that a site meets a certain minimum of quality.
