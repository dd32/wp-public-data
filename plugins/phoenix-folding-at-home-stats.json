You can display stats for your donor account or for a Folding team. You can show the stats in your sidebar as a widget or in your content area as a shortcode. The following stats are shown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Work units.</li>\n<li>Total credit in points.</li>\n<li>Ranking.</li>\n<li>Date you completed the last work unit.</li>\n<li>Teams you are a member of/Donors who contribute to your team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It takes less than a minute to setup. All you need is your donor/team ID or name. The stats are displayed as an HTML table.</p>\n<h4>What is Folding@Home?</h4>\n<p>Folding@home is a project run by Stanford University which allows anyone to assist with disease research by donating their unused computer processing power. Your processing power is used to simulate protein folding, a process whereby proteins assemble themselves into tools which your body can use. Joining in is a doddle; simply <a href=\"https://foldingathome.stanford.edu/download/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">download the F@H software</a> to get started. Find out more at the <a href=\"https://foldingathome.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Folding@Home website</a>.</p>\n<p>You can see an example at https://phoenixweb.com.au/display-folding-at-home-stats-wordpress-plugin/ which is also our announcement post.</p>\n<h3>Shortcode</h3>\n<p>Display the shortcode in your content by writing [phoenix_folding_stats] in the post/page editing area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>type</code>             &#8211; The type of table to display.

This can help with custom styling or getting the style in line with other theme tables. Defaults to empty.</li>\n<li><code>show_donor_teams</code> &#8211; On a donor table, show or hide the teams the donor is a member of. Set as &#8216;false&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; to hide. Defaults to &#8216;yes&#8217;.</li>\n<li><code>show_donor_teams</code> &#8211; On a team table, show or hide the donors that contribute to the team.

Defaults to &#8216;yes&#8217;.</li>\n<li><code>show_rank</code>        &#8211; Show team/donor rank.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of a shortcode with all these parameters in use:</p>\n<pre><code>[phoenix_folding_stats type=\"donor\" class=\"table table-striped\" show_id=\"yes\" show_donor_teams=\"yes\" id=\"James_Jones\" show_logo=\"no\" show_tagline=\"yes\"]&lt;h3&gt;Making Changes&lt;/h3&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#8211; If you just want to change how something looks, the table elements are full of classes you can target with CSS. The plugin itself includes a small amount of CSS which you can easily overwrite.<br />\n &#8211; I&#8217;ve sprinkled in a few WordPress filters so you can change things.<br />\n &#8211; You can overwrite the templates in the plugin by adding your own templates in your theme. Create a folder in your theme called <code>phoenix-folding-at-home-stats</code> and add templates in there. So for example if you want to overwrite the donor table, you would create a PHP file &#8211; <code>wp-content/themes/yourtheme/phoenix-folding-at-home-stats/donor.php</code> and make your own table in there.<br />\n &#8211; Contact me at the support forums or <a href=\"http://phoenixweb.com.au/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website</a> with your desired change. If it&#8217;s good I will probably add it in.</p>\n",
