        "description": "<p>PitchPrint is a plugin solution that runs on WordPress + WooCommerce as a Software service providing your clients the ability to create their designs on the fly. It basically provides printing clients an easy to use WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) “Do it yourself” interface for creating artworks for print.</p>\n<p>It is an HTML5 based solution that allows you to create templates for products like Business Card, TShirt, Banners, Phone Templates etc.</p>\n<p>This solution is fully based on pre-designed templates. Design templates are created in the editor which are then loaded by individual clients based on taste and choice, then modified to fit their needs and requirements. Based on our studies, it is far easier for majority of clients to edit an existing design template than create a whole design artwork from scratch especially for people with little background in graphics. In addition, it significantly reduces the overall time frame a client spends from landing on your site to placing an order.</p>\n<p>The plugin allows your site to connect to our servers, loading the app tool for your users to create with.
