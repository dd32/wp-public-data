        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20my%20shopping%20cart%20contains%20products%20that%20ship%20ltl%20and%20products%20that%20would%20normally%20ship%20fedex%20or%20usps%3F'>\nWhat happens when my shopping cart contains products that ship LTL and products that would normally ship FedEx or USPS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the shopping cart contains one or more products tagged to ship LTL freight, all of the products in the shopping cart<br />\nare assumed to ship LTL freight. To ensure the most accurate quote possible, make sure that every product has a weight, dimensions and a freight classification recorded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20forget%20to%20identify%20a%20freight%20classification%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I forget to identify a freight classification for a product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the absence of a freight class, the plugin will determine the freight classification using the density calculation method. To do so the products weight and dimensions must be recorded. This is accurate in most cases, however identifying the proper freight class will be the most reliable method for ensuring accurate rate estimates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20was%20the%20invoice%20i%20received%20from%20saia%20freight%20more%20than%20what%20was%20quoted%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy was the invoice I received from SAIA Freight more than what was quoted by the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions, freight class) is different, or additional services (such as residential<br />\ndelivery, lift gate, delivery by appointment and others) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping<br />\nsettings on the products included in the shipment. Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packaging<br />\nmaterials, such as a pallet, is included by the carrier in the billable weight for the shipment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20out%20what%20freight%20classification%20to%20use%20for%20my%20products%3F'>\nHow do I find out what freight classification to use for my products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact your local SAIA Freight office for assistance. You might also consider getting a subscription to ClassIT offered<br />\nby the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA). Visit them online at classit.nmfta.org.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20a%20saia%20freight%20account%3F'>\nHow do I get a SAIA Freight account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SAIA Freight is a logistics company.

At the conclusion of the registration process an email will be sent to you that will include the<br />\nlicense key. You can also login to eniture.com using the username and password you created during the registration process<br />\nand retrieve the license key from the My Licenses tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20my%20plugin%20license%20from%20the%20trail%20version%20to%20one%20of%20the%20paid%20subscriptions%3F'>\nHow do I change my plugin license from the trail version to one of the paid subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to eniture.com and navigate to the My Licenses tab. There you will be able to manage the licensing of all of your<br />\nEniture Technology plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%20the%20plugin%20on%20another%20website%3F'>\nHow do I install the plugin on another website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has a single site license. To use it on another website you will need to purchase an additional license.<br />\nIf you want to change the website with which the plugin is registered, login to eniture.com and navigate to the My Licenses tab.<br />\nThere you will be able to change the domain name that is associated with the license key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20purchase%20a%20second%20license%20for%20my%20staging%20or%20development%20site%3F'>\nDo I have to purchase a second license for my staging or development site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Each license allows you to identify one domain for your production environment and one domain for your staging or<br />\ndevelopment environment. The rate estimates returned in the staging environment will have the word “Sandbox” appended to them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20plugin%20working%20on%20my%20other%20website%3F'>\nWhy isn’t the plugin working on my other website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you can successfully test your credentials from the Connection page (WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; SAIA Freight &gt; Connections)<br />\nthen you have one or more of the following licensing issues:</p>\n<p>1) You are using the license key on more than one domain. The licenses are for single sites. You will need to purchase an additional license.<br />\n2) Your trial period has expired.<br />\n3) Your current license has expired and we have been unable to process your form of payment to renew it.
