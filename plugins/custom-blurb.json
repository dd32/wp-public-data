        "installation": "<p>Plugin Installation</p>\n<ol>\n<li>in the wp admin, hit Plugins on the left nav</li>\n<li>find custom-blurb in the list of plugins and hit ‘activate’ if its not activated</li>\n<li>now, in the wp admin hit Appearance on the left nav</li>\n<li>under the Appearance menu theres a submenu item called ‘widgets’ and hit that</li>\n<li>you should see Custom Blurb Widget in the list of available widgets</li>\n<li>drag over the widget into one of your widget areas on the right side of the page (eg, “Sidebar 1″)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Getting started</p>\n<p>Ok now its installed into your sidebar.   Heres how to configure it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>on the blurb widget thats installed, if the widget window is closed, click on the little down triangle on the right of the title bar.<br />\nThis should pop open the blurb widget window</li>\n<li>\n<p>fill out all the data in the fields.  As an example, the blurb widget is hard at work right now in this page’s sidebar<br />\nand here’s how we set it up:<br />\nDisplay Title = “Another Blurb Example”<br />\nSee more stories url: “/donate”<br />\nDefault image url: (blank)<br />\nNumber of posts to show: “2″<br />\nNumber of thumbnails to show: “0″</p>\n<p>Go ahead and hit “Save”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now here’s where it gets fun.  Hit the “Add” button.  You should now have a popup that says “Find posts”</p>\n</li>\n<li>You can find on all different aspects.  If you want to choose from posts that have the word “lucky” in the title<br />\nthen type “lucky” into the “Titles Contains” field.<br />\nIf you want to see all the pages in your site click on the “Pages” checkbox in the Post Types area.<br />\nYou can also opt to see all posts and pages by checking them both, etc.<br />\nIf you want to see all pages and posts that have “lucky” in the title, then type “lucky” into the “Titles Contains” field<br />\nand check the “Posts” and “Pages” checkboxes in the the Post Types area.</li>\n<li>Once you have narrowed your search filters, hit the “Search” button and voila!<br />\nA list of posts/pages will show up that match your criteria.</li>\n<li>Check on any of the posts that you want to show up in your blurb widget</li>\n<li>Hit the “Use this Post” button.</li>\n<li>You will now see the posts you selected in the widget area.</li>\n<li>If you dont like the order they are showing up in, you can drag them around to your hearts content.<br />\n10.Dont forget to hit “Save”!!</li>\n<li>Now check your blog  and blurb</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Blurb Template</p>\n<p>Ok well we’ve included a bunch of templates you can copy and paste from.<br />\n You can certainly make your own but you will probably need some PHP experience or someone with PHP knowledge to make it go smoothly.<br />\n These are all found in the plugins widget/template folder.</p>\n<p>The “default” template is whats in use – just copy and paste whatever template you want into that default template.<br />\nAnd then you can adjust all the CSS with the css style sheets found in plugin CSS folder.</p>\n<p>And for all you scripties – if you wanna add jQuery stuff –  just pop edit the scripts found in the JS folder.</p>\n<p>Advanced concepts</p>\n<p>If you know how to create widget areas within your template then actually you can put these blurbs all over the place<br />\nnot just the sidebar.<br />\nThere are plenty of client sites we made where they the entire page was covered in widget areas<br />\nand the blurbs just filled in the rest.<br />\nEven more convenient is the use of blurbs to control which posts you want to<br />\nhilite in your slider.   Think about it…</p>\n",
