The media uploader screen freezes and stays blank after clicking insert into post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The problem is usually due to the conflicts with other plugin or theme functions. You can use general debugging technique to find out the problem.</p>\n<p>i. Switch to the default wordpress theme to rule out any theme-specific problems.<br />\nii. Try the plugin in a fresh new WordPress installation.<br />\niii. If it works, deactivate all plugins from your current wordpress installation to see if this resolves the problem.
