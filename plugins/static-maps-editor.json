(It is shown on the settings page however, in case we ever need it for debugging.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20all%20features%20free%20or%20is%20there%20a%20pro%20version%3F'>\nAre all features free or is there a Pro version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All features are free, there is no &#8220;Pro&#8221;. We earn our money with printable cartography on Printmaps.net, not with online static maps. They are free and will stay free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20difference%20to%20all%20the%20other%20maps%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the difference to all the other maps plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All maps plugins that we know of serve interactive maps. (Maps where you can zoom, pan and click.) This plugin serves static, non-interactive maps, pure PNG pictures. That&#8217;s good for the speed of your site, for your site layouts and also for SEO, as these maps will show up in Google Images as search results.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20map%20data%20from%3F'>\nWhere is the map data from?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The map data is from OpenStreetMap.org, processed by us into a cartographic scheme. OSM licences map data under an open licence, therefor you are free to use our maps in any way you wish, given that you don&#8217;t remove the copyright credits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20legal%20to%20use%20your%20maps%20commercially%3F'>\nIs it legal to use your maps commercially?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you may use these maps also for commercialÂ purposes, as long as you don&#8217;t remove the copyright credits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20privacy%20or%20gdpr%3F'>\nWhat about privacy or GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All maps you create and include in your pages will be hosted by your WordPress installation, not by us. Your users will not be served any files from our servers. Therefor this pligin has no privacy implications whatsoever. The plugin is fully compliant with European GDPR and other local privacy laws.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20catch%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the catch?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We made this plugin to make our commercial service Printmaps.net more visible. The plugin is and will stay free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20memory%20or%20resources%20limits%20i%20have%20to%20increase%20in%20order%20for%20the%20plugin%20to%20function%20correctly%3F'>\nAre there any memory or resources limits I have to increase in order for the plugin to function correctly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The generated images could range in size from a couple of kilobytes up to 10MB. Please make sure that your PHP and WordPress limit settings and configuration variables are set high enough to accommodate for such requests. In particular the setting for POST requests size and file upload size. (You can find your current limits unter Tools&gt; Site Health.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP post max size</li>\n<li>Upload max filesize</li>\n<li>WP_MEMORY_LIMIT</li>\n<li>WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also if you use an additional web application firewall (e.g mod_security) make sure that the custom settings for the firewall are set high enough as well for requests of up to 10MB.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
