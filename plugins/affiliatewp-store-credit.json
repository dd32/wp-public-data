If for some reason you go back and mark it unpaid, this plugin will also remove the referral amount from the balance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the WooCommerce checkout page, if the user has credit available, it will show a notice and ask them if they want to use it. Based on the credit available and order total, it will create a 1 time use coupon code for the lower amount and automatically apply it to the order. i.e. for a $100 order and $50 credit, it would generate a $50 coupon since the order is more. If the order is $25 and they have $50 in credit, it will generate a coupon for the $25 order total, and leave them with a $25 credit balance after checkout.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upon successful checkout, the one time use coupon code is grabbed and the coupon total is deducted from their available balance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
