This may occur retrieving values from the database, when the plugin does calculations after retrieving values from the database, such as when a report field consists of two database fields added together, or when calculating the totals row. When this occurs, a tiny fractional error may be introduced each time a calculation is performed, typically less than 0.000000000000001 per calculation or retrieval. This is not likely to affect the accuracy of the output in normal usage where only a few decimal places are used, even if a value has been derived from many calculations such as the totals row in a very long report. However, if output rounding is not in effect, you may see unexpected additional decimal places in some fields in your output. In this case we recommend rounding the output values as needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%E2%80%99s%20the%20difference%20between%20product%20sales%20report%20and%20export%20order%20items%3F'>\nWhat’s the difference between Product Sales Report and Export Order Items?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Product Sales Report is for creating a report about all your products or a group of products for comparison and sales performance. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-order-items-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">Export Order Items</a> generates a report with the items from an individual order, specific purchase, or specific customer for order fulfillment or accounting.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%E2%80%99s%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20free%20and%20pro%20version%3F'>\nWhat’s the difference between the free and pro version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The free version is powerful and works well for 90% of store owners.
