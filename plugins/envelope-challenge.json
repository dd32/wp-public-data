In the traditionsl physical version, envelopes are pre-printed with a unique cash value shown on the front. Usually each value is unique. For example, 100 envelopes could be printed with $1 to $100 incrementally on the front. If all envelopes are used, which is often the case, $5050 is raised in the fundraising event. In some cases, prizes are placed in the envelope including discounts for dining or other vendor contributed offerings.</p>\n<p>The Envelope Challenge plugin provides a powerful <em>virtual</em> envelope challenge fundraising system which can be seamlessly integrated into your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: This plugin is a placeholder with limited functionality to test the release and installation process.
