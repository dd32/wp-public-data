        "faq": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is the trial really free?<br />\nYes.  In fact, we never ask for your credit card or bank account info. We send you an invoice each month and you pay via our payment portal. Partnership with Bluefield Identity has no contracts so you&#8217;re never roped into a commitment. When you receive our monthly invoice and performance report, YOU choose whether to pay the invoice or not. If Bluefield Identity isn&#8217;t right for your business, don&#8217;t pay the invoice and, within a few days, we will suspend your Bluefield Identity account with no questions asked and no collection efforts. If you choose to come back later (we encourage you to see how we stack up against our competitors), simply pay the previous unpaid invoice amount and your account is reactivated automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Will your plugin slow down my site?<br />\nNo. The Bluefield Identity service was designed to provide the fastest response possible (average response time = 12 milliseconds) and is hosted on the most robust cloud network available guaranteeing the quickest and shortest web trace routing possible.  While we can&#8217;t guarantee transmission speeds, we do guarantee the speed of our service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
