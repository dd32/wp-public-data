        "description": "<p>A ribbon creation/corner decorator plugin that will allow you to generate your own ribbons for each of the 4 corners or you can upload your own graphics.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All of the features of the static corner ribbons</li>\n<li>Set the Message</li>\n<li>Set the Link</li>\n<li>Set the Title (hover message)</li>\n<li>Set the toolbar offset</li>\n<li>Set no toolbar offset</li>\n<li>Set horizontal offset for each corner</li>\n<li>Set the background and foreground color</li>\n<li>Control the visibility of the of ribbon via (de)activation</li>\n<li>Use custom images.</li>\n<li>Z positioning</li>\n<li>Our graphics can fade out via a timer control!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Now with added JSColor color picker!</strong><br />\n<strong><em>Our plugin now loads with JQuery No-Conflict mode!</em></strong></p>\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\n<p>= Requirements =<br />\nPHP 5.x<br />\nGD image library</p>\n<h4>Issues</h4>\n<p>Godaddy 4GH has a strange cacheing problem, no matter what you set for cacheing over-ride, they cache things for upto a minute and typically longer so if you notice that your images don&#8217;t immediately display then wait at least 2 minutes and refresh and they&#8217;ll be there. However, if you know of a solution to this mess please let me know and I&#8217;ll add you to contributors line. Turns that after you mash &#8220;regenerate images&#8221; if the graphics still have not updated, if you do a ctrl+f5 (forced refresh of your browser) then new graphics appear. That makes it sound like a browser issue. But it isn&#8217;t. If anyone has some ideas. Please let me know so I can fix this or stop worry about fixing it in case it is a browser issue.</p>\n<p>Site5 webhosting has a really old version of PHP and I believe the GD library. So if you aren&#8217;t getting generated banners and you are somehow based off of Site5.com that is most likely the problem. However, I am told that they are switching to the latest version of PHP in the next few weeks, so we will soon see.</p>\n<p>Implementing the planned CSS rendering engine will alleviate both issues.</p>\n<h3>TODO</h3>\n<p>= REWRITE!!! =<br />\nCompletely rewrite the plugin as it is hugely unmaintainable now. This must be done before anything else on the TODO list can be accomplished. I am currently looking for people to help with getting this done and for future development of the plugin. Benefits are new friends, additional promotion of your site and a warm fuzzy feeling!<br />\n* I am thinking of going with classes as well as segmenting the file into multiple parts.</p>\n<h4>Cookies</h4>\n<p>By using cookies I&#8217;ll be able to add a banner/graphic skipping mechanism. Example of this would be that you would tell the banner to not show for 5 pageviews, or skip for 5 then show up. By using cookies, we can control this on the user and when the cookie count matches, we will display the graphic in question.</p>\n<h4>Store for Future</h4>\n<p>Add database routines to store everything you create or upload for future retrieval at any time. Also, needed for scheduling.</p>\n<h4>CSS Functionality</h4>\n<p>Switch to a completely CSS driven routine. Which will solve resolution issues and transparency issues. Because the GD library sucks. For some reason GD is forcing me to use the &#8220;black&#8221; color for the transparency. It is not agreeing with the code at PHP.net. Going CSS will solve this issue. I just have to wrap my mind around CSS now. ðŸ˜€</p>\n<h4>Transparency</h4>\n<p>Fix transparency issue. I checked with browsershots.org and it seems the images are drawing great. So if I can solve the issue where GD insists on black being the only transparent color for the background, things will be better. This will be a non-issue when the css rendering engine is implemented.</p>\n<h4>Scheduling</h4>\n<p>Allow the decorations to be scheduled to appear on any given time and day. This is great for the holidays, special events and more!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin zip archive.</li>\n<li>Extract it in your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder or upload via admin panel.</li>\n<li>Browse to your plugins section and activate the plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>OR &#8211;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Install it via the plugin manager.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why are you doing this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are so many notable reasons for wanting a ribbon. Why wait for someone to make one for you when you can make it yourself whenever you want.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see anything on my blog pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you have set all of your options and that your FGCOLOR &amp; BGCOLOR settings are sufficiently different.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>All I see is a bar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your FGCOLOR needs to be different enough from your BGCOLOR so as to allow the message to be descerned from the shape.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I still don&#8217;t see my message?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you have actually set the message. Also make sure you have set the ribbon to be active.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Clicking the ribbon doesn&#8217;t lead me anywhere &#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the LINK specifies a fully qualified URL.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t get that hover message you were blathering on about.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to make sure the LINK TITLE is set to something in order to enjoy the feature. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is 0x000000 transparent or clear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because I needed a transparent/alpha color and that is what php is forcing me to use. Grrrrr. So don&#8217;t set your colors to that value else things will vanish on you. Use some other near black color like 010101 if you need black.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my color choices being ignored?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to set the colors using hex values, but leave off the preceding # (hash). Example: you want black, that&#8217;s normally #000000, so you enter 000000 in the color box of your choice.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My custom image blocks out a pieces of my site! Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is because the parts of your image that are supposed to be transparent &#8230; are not transparent. You will need to reedit your image and ensure that it is transparent in the areas that needs to be.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<p>Added a donate link to further encourage me to develop for the community, you can actually purchase swag with my link! Yeah.<br />\nTweaked our use of jscolor to not conflict with other plugins that use jscolor to fix compatibility issues with &#8220;colored vote polls&#8221;.<br />\nAdded banner link toggle.</p>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<p>removed check for image type.</p>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<p>Added JQuery No-Conflict mode wrappers to prevent collision with the wrong versions of JQuery both internally and externally.</p>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<p>Added the ability to fade out banners and graphics for any amount of time. Corrected last versioning snafu!</p>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<p>Discovered some typos in the language on the settings screen. Added Z positioning so you can ensure what Z layer your graphics will appear on.</p>\n<h4>1.31.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed a css problem with new horizontal offset in 1.31</p>\n<h4>1.31</h4>\n<p>Added horizontal offset to corners, great for custom graphics.</p>\n<h4>1.30</h4>\n<p>Added JSColor picker code to color selection boxes from the LGPL JSColor at JSColor.com.</p>\n<h4>1.22</h4>\n<p>Added ability to upload custom images.<br />\nFixed refresh issue. Now when you make a change to the images, they update!<br />\nAdded more of a visual cue to help realize which image you are editing.</p>\n<h4>1.21</h4>\n<p>Fixed z-index issue with ribbons overlaying fly down menus on the admin bar and possibly fly up menus on installed bottom bars.</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Added the other 3 corners.</p>\n<h4>1.11</h4>\n<p>Ok, I&#8217;m going to make a checklist of stuff that must be double checked before I commit. This is like the 3rd time I&#8217;ve done this on accident. Get all committed and discover that something minor but crucial got left out. Grrrr.</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Fix issue where Ribbon was not completely drawing out as I intended.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Cropping has been achieved. Also added a radio button to control the visibility of the ribbon. Ribbon generates only during the configuration and not constantly as in v0.1. Added a preview of the ribbon, so you can view it before you make it active.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>Inspired by All of the static Ribbons in the Repository</p>\n"
