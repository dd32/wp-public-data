This is where we come in. TradeSafe bridges the trust gap and eliminates the fear when customers want to make payment upfront in full, online. We give your customers the peace of mind that they will receive what they paid for, leading to a boost in purchase confidence, and ultimately improving conversion rates.</p>\n<p>The TradeSafe plugin includes payment gateways namely Ozow (Instant EFT), Visa/Mastercard, PayJustNow (Buy Now Pay Later), SnapScan and normal EFT, with many more to come.</p>\n<p>The plugin also includes support for paying multiple vendors when using the Dokan plugin.</p>\n<h3>How it Works</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>At checkout, the customer chooses to pay using TradeSafe.</li>\n<li>The customer will be directed to a payment page, where they choose their payment option namely EFT, Instant EFT (Ozow), Card, SnapScan, and Buy Now Pay Later (PayJustNow).</li>\n<li>Once payment is successful, the order is marked as PROCESSING and delivery is kicked off.</li>\n<li>When delivery has been completed, a new state called DELIVERED is reached. This triggers an email and sms which TradeSafe will send to the customer, asking them if they received what they ordered.</li>\n<li>If yes, TradeSafe releases the funds to you, and/or your vendors if trading in a multi-vendor setup.</li>\n<li>The customer has 24 hours in which to make their decision. If we do not hear from the customer within that time, TradeSafe will deem this as acceptance on the buyer&#8217;s part and automatically release the funds to you.</li>\n<li>If the customer is unhappy with the order, then the customer can submit a comment. The transaction will then be placed on hold in WooCommerce. This will give you the opportunity to enact your own return policies until a successful resolution has been achieved.</li>\n<li>No refund will be processed without your consent. TradeSafe performs all refunds on your behalf. We take away this admin burden.</li>\n<li>The buyer must have a material complaint and provide evidence. We will release the funds to you in the event the complaint/issue is non-material or frivolous.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<h4>2.18.6 2024-08-20</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added check for missing transaction id meta data</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.6 2024-08-16</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed option to set fee allocation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.5 2024-08-15</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how user id is loaded when checking if a withdraw method is valid</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.4 2024-08-14</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how user id is loaded for withdraw request</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.3 2024-08-02</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change how user id is loaded when verifing withdrawals</li>\n<li>Mark orders status as on-hold when a dispute is raised</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.2 2024-07-24</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added additional infomation to dokan error message</li>\n<li>Updated label for payment frequency</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.1 2024-06-12</h4>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added check for required fields for withdrawals in Dokan</li>\n<li>Allow suborders to be marked as complete</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.18.0 2024-06-07</h4>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added custom inspection period</li>\n</ul>\n",
