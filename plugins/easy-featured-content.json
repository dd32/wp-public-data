However, if you have a custom post type, you can easily add featured content support by modifying the following snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>function register_featured_content_support() {\n    // Adds featured content support to the custom post type 'my-post-type-slug'\n    add_post_type_support('my-post-type-slug', 'featured-content');\n\n    // Removes featured content support from pages\n    remove_post_type_support('page', 'featured-content');\n}\nadd_filter('after_setup_theme', 'register_featured_content_support');\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I want to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have content on your site that you want to feature (maybe on the home page or in a sidebar) then you can use this plugin<br />\nto enable marking that content as featured. It works for any post type that provides an editing UI.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the query variable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In your custom queries (<code>new WP_Query</code>, <code>get_posts</code> or <code>query_posts</code>) simply pass in the query variable <code>is_featured</code> as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>$featured_posts = new WP_Query(array('is_featured' =&gt; 'yes', 'post_type' =&gt; 'post'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you need to get only non featured content, you would do something like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>$non_featured_posts = new WP_Query(array('is_featured' =&gt; 'no', 'post_type' =&gt; 'post'));\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
