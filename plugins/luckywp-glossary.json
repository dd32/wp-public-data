We recommend to do this automatically by clicking the appropriate button. If you want to configure the archive page manually, you need to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new page.</li>\n<li>Specify in the settings of LuckyWP Glossary plugin the created page as the archive page.</li>\n<li>Add shortcode <strong>[lwpglsTermsArchive]</strong> to the page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the plugin is successfully installed and configured the menu item &#8220;Glossary&#8221; will appear in the menu of the WordPress control panel. Here you can manage the terms (add/edit/delete), and also you can change the plugin settings.</p>\n",
