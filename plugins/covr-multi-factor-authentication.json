Covr is designed so that anyone can install it and feel secure knowing their site is protected.</p>\n<h4>How it Works</h4>\n<p>Covr uses your phone as a verification tool. When a request to log into your site is made, a push notification is sent to the Covr app on your phone to notify you of the login request. If you did not request to log in, you can deny the request &#8211; thereby denying access to imposters.
