        "description": "<p>When you are using a site with WooCommerce Subscriptions you can change the first payment date using trial periods. But a trial period is a period, not a date. So you can set &#8220;1 month free&#8221; but you cannot set &#8220;this subscriptions will start being paid this date&#8221;, whenever you make the bought of the subscription. This plugin solves this problem.</p>\n<h3><strong>Basics</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Set in every product or product variaition, which is the date of the first payment to be done. You can set a fixed date or a calculated one (first day of next month or first day of next year)</li>\n<li>When a user buys your subscription, based in a product subscription or a product variable subscription, it will get the first payment in the specified date</li>\n<li>User will see in cart and checkout how many days he can get the subscription for free until the first payment will be done</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Premium features</strong></h3>\n<p>Additional features available only in PRO plugin version.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For each product or product variation, you can also <strong>set the date of the last payment</strong> to be made. You can use <strong>a fixed date or a calculated one</strong>:  first day of next month, first day of next year, last day next month, last day this year, last day next year.</li>\n<li>You will <strong>have full control of the payment schedule</strong> regardless of when the subscription purchase was made.</li>\n<li><strong>Show and check the payment schedule</strong>, check how many payments will be made, when and how much. Show it to your customers as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom the messages</strong>, customise WooCommerce Subscriptions strings to inform your customers in a natural and correct way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Usage</strong></h3>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed you can use it. Go to Product data, search &#8220;First payment date&#8221; and fill it. If you are using a variable product, you will find it in each variation.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h3><strong>Installation</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Install <strong>First payment date for WooCommerce Subscriptions</strong> automatically through the WordPress Dashboard or by uploading the ZIP file in the <em>plugins</em> directory.</li>\n<li>Then, after the package is uploaded and extracted, click&nbsp;<em>Activate Plugin</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now going through the points above, you should now see the new option in the &#8220;Product data&#8221; part of each variable product.</p>\n<p>If you get any error after following through the steps above please contact us through item support comments so we can get back to you with possible helps in installing the plugin and more.</p>\n",
