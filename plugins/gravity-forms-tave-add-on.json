The hidden field value must either be a Brand ID (seen in the brand editor URL) or the exact name of a brand.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work on a multisite installation of WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has <em>not</em> been tested on a multi-site installation, so I can&#8217;t tell you. Let me know if you find out!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t find the settings page so I can enter my API Key and Brand Abbreviation. Where is it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have mostly likely either not installed Gravity Forms, have installed Gravity Forms after the Tave add-on instead of before, or &#8211; which has happened, trust me &#8211; you have installed Contact Form 7 instead of Gravity Forms. If you&#8217;ve done it correctly, it will be an item in the Gravity Forms admin menu (Forms -&gt; Settings in the WordPress admin menu, then click the Tave link under the heading), or you can find it on the Plugins page in front of the Deactivate and Edit links for the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get more help on getting this thing started?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit my <a href=\"http://www.rowellphoto.com/gravity-forms-tave/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Usage &amp; Installation Instructions</a> page for plenty of assistance on getting everything configured to start collecting leads for Táve.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This way it will keep a log of the last connection and you can tell if it went through, or there was an error and why. also good when you come looking for help that you can provide this info.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2014.12.04</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Added the ability to create extra form fields for mapping. You just have to add them to the settings screen and they will be available on the form map to send to Táve. The names of these fields will become the names of the custom fields in Táve if they don&#8217;t already exist.</li>\n<li>updated some spelling, and some explanations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2014.11.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DO NO UPDATE UNTIL TAVE 4 IS LIVE AND YOU ARE RUNNING IT.</li>\n<li>Changed endpoint for Tave 4</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2014.04.18</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release of the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n"
