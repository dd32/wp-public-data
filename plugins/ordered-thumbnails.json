        "description": "<p>Ordered Thumbnails is a WordPress plugin that allows you to display thumbnails based on images that have been attached to a post. This plugin also allows you to specify which thumbnail appears next to a post with multiple images by ordering the thumbnails in the Gallery tab of the WordPress &#8220;Add Images&#8221; lightbox and placing the thumbnail desired in the first position.</p>\n<p>To style how the thumbnail appears on your page, you may pass optional CSS class names to the plugin, which will then be applied to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag returned. Alternately, by setting the display parameter to &#8220;false&#8221;, Ordered Thumbnails will return the thumbnail URL, height, and width as a PHP array to be used however you see fit. If no images have been attached to a post, the plugin fails gracefully and returns &#8220;false&#8221;. This plugin will work anywhere the WordPress posts loop is used and works particularly nice in combination with <code>the_excerpt</code> for archive pages.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>ordered-thumbnails.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate Ordered Thumbnails through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Place <code>&lt;?php ordered_thumbnails(); ?&gt;</code> in your templates within the WordPress post loop.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The plugin takes two optional parameters:</strong></p>\n<p>By default, <code>&lt;?php ordered_thumbnails(); ?&gt;</code> behaves exactly like <code>&lt;?php ordered_thumbnails( 'true', '' ); ?&gt;</code>. Change the 1st parameter to &#8220;false&#8221; if you want the plugin to return the thumbnail data as an array, rather than display an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> for the thumbnail. The 2nd parameter accepts CSS class names you would like to assign to the thumbnail <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> (only used if param. 1 is &#8220;true&#8221;). All options will return &#8220;false&#8221; if no image is attached to the post.</p>\n<p>For posts with more than one image attached, you can pick which thumbnail you want to use by ordering the image in the post&#8217;s gallery. While editing a post, click the &#8220;Add an image&#8221; button and then click the &#8220;Gallery&#8221; tab in the lightbox. Re-order your images by dragging the image thumbnail you want to appear for the post to the top of the order. You may also change the order number to &#8220;1&#8221;. Click &#8220;Save all changes&#8221;. See the Screenshots for a visual guide on how to do this. Note that this will NOT reorder images in the actual post.</p>\n<p>Using the plugin with <code>the_excerpt</code> in your <code>archive.php</code> template works nicely to show thumbnails next to your archived posts.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I change which thumbnail is used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While the plugin will show thumbnails and will not break in WordPress 2.5, the ability to order the Gallery images was not added until 2.6.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work for images not uploaded through WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Short answer: no. This plugin relies on the way images are attached to a particular post when they are uploaded through WordPress. Images hotlinked from other sites (or even linked to a place on your own server not controlled by WordPress) are not tied to the post as attachments in the WordPress database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some of my images are just image links, some are uploaded through WordPress. Will this plugin break on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but the plugin will only show thumbnails for images uploaded through WordPress. For posts with no WordPress uploaded images, no thumbnail will appear.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does Ordered Thumbnails work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin works by first looking for any attachments in the <code>wp_posts</code> database table that have a <code>post_parent</code> ID that matches the current post and as a second step for posts with multiple image attachments, returning the attachment with its <code>menu_order</code> field set to &#8220;1&#8221;. If no image attachments match the current post ID, the plugin returns &#8220;false&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
