The resulting calendar includes two filter drop-down lists for the end-user to select individual calendars for any of the semester, classroom, or teacher.<br />\nIn case that a fixed calendar is required (without drop down filters), parameters can be added to precisely define the content to be displayed. Three parameters are supported: classroom, teacher and semester. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar classroom=1]</code> will display the schedule of classroom with ID=1.</li>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar classroom=1,2,3]</code> will display the schedule of classrooms with IDs 1, 2 and 3.</li>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar teacher = 12]</code> will display the lecturing program of teacher with ID 12.</li>\n<li><code>[utt_calendar semester = 2]</code> will display the lecturing program of the semester with ID 2.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>You can locate the IDs required in the corresponding forms in the UnitimeTable admin page. Comma separated IDs are supported in all cases.</em></p>\n",
