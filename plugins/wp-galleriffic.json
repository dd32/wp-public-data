        "description": "<p>WP-Galleriffic is an image gallery plugin to extend WordPress. The JavaScript code is based on <a href=\"http://www.twospy.com/galleriffic/\" title=\"Galleriffic\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Galleriffic</a>, but modified at some small points for bugfix.</p>\n<p>It started as a fork of <a href=\"http://thriveweb.com.au/blog/photospace-wordpress-gallery-plugin/\" title=\"Photospace\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Photospace</a> plugin (v1), but it became very different approach.</p>\n<p>There are two ways to use the plugin:</p>\n<h4>1. Attachment image gallery</h4>\n<p>The plugin adds two additional image sizes using the built-in functions of WordPress. The sizes can be modified at the plugin&#8217;s settings panel. The missing images be generated on-demand (for example: images uploaded before the plugin was installed or the sizes have been modified), but for large quantities I&#8217;d recommend the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" title=\"Regenerate Thumbnails\" rel=\"ugc\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin.<br />\nVersions before 1.0 used an own cache and image resizing module, but this has been eliminated due to better potentials in the core WordPress code, better Multisite compatibility, faster processing and cleaner filesystem.</p>\n<h4>2. Flickr Set gallery</h4>\n<p>Flick Set can be added as source to a galleriffic shortcode. An API key is bundled with the plugin, registered for this purpose, but you can change it. It is vital, Flick requires it for the API to work. The display order is the same in Flickr. There is a chance to select the source Flickr image for both the thumbnail and the preview image. Also, if required, the Flickr images can be resized as well with a local copy of the image. The plugin grabs the images from Flickr, resizes them and serves locally.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note: if you change the size settings, the previously generated images ones will not be deleted. You have to make a cleanup manually. *</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Place <code>[wp-galleriffic]</code> shortcode into anywhere in the post for attachment gallery.</p>\n<p>For a specified post, add <code>[wp-galleriffic postid=POST#]</code>, where POST# is the number of the post with the attachment images to create a gallery from.<br />\nFor Flickr gallery, add the set ID as: <code>[wp-galleriffic set=SET#]</code>, where SET# is the ID of the set. You can get it by navigating to the Set&#8217;s page at Flickr and take a look at the end of the URL.</p>\n",
