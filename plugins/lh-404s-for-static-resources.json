        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20help%3F'>\nHow does this plugin help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By detault when wordpress encounters a missing page it will not only send a 404 error but also fully boot up and serve an entire page (without caching).</p>\n<p>This causes an unnecessary strain on your server. This especially unneccessary when serving requests for mssing static files. This plugin prevents a full boot. Saving your server and speeding up the visitor experience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Sortable Tables, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-404s-for-static-resources/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-404s-for-static-resources/</a> . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
