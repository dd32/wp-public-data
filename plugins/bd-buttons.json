        "description": "<p>BD Buttons was developed to empower the every day person to be able to buttonize any link with an attention grabbing design.</p>\n<p>For my day job, I had a location&#8217;s site that needed to have a way to create their own eye-catching call to action link design. Other work sites also utilize these types of catchy link styles, so I came up with a plugin that provides an easy to use interface for creating your own link &#8220;button&#8221; styles, and an even easier way to get them deployed on any page or post (including custom post types).</p>\n<p>Comes with 7 default link buttons, and allows you to customize your own color combinations, via a color palette or HTML color codes (if you already know what color combinations you want).</p>\n<p><strong>Current Version 1.0.5</strong></p>\n<h4>Features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Built into the Visual Editor, just type a few things, click a few things and your link is stylized.</li>\n<li>Easy to use admin interface for creating your own unique link button color combinations.</li>\n<li>CSS and &#8220;BD Button&#8221; configuration reside inside wp-content/uploads, to avoid permission issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This plugin is not compatible with WordPress versions less than 5.0. Requires PHP 5.6+.</p>\n<h4>TROUBLESHOOTING:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon activation, the &#8220;bdbuttons&#8221; folder inside the main plugin folder gets moved to wp-content/uploads. If this fails, you can manually move that folder over. It&#8217;ll need to be either owned by the Apache user, or the entire folder needs to be CHMOD&#8217;d to 777, so that the two files (one .css and one .txt) can be web-writeable. No PHP code and no JS code can be executed directly from either file, FYI.</li>\n<li>On some systems, the CSS file is cached. You will need to clear your server&#8217;s cache to reflect any changes you make via custom link button additions.</li>\n</ul>\n",
