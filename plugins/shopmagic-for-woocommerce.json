In just a couple of days, our subscription renewal rate went up 23%. And that was just the beginning!</p>\n<p>Monika Swoboda<br />\n  Head of Marketing @ WP Desk</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What types of emails can ShopMagic send?</h3>\n<p>There are a bunch of formats in which you can send your follow-ups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce template emails</strong> – Uses the default WooCommerce template for sending emails.</li>\n<li><strong>Blank template emails</strong> – Gives you the opportunity to create your own styles.</li>\n<li><strong>Plain text email</strong> – Perfect for simple, more personalized emails that do not overwhelm.</li>\n<li><strong>Raw HTML email</strong> – Do you already have an HTML email template? Great. Just paste the HTML code, and you are good to go.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How does ShopMagic work?</h3>\n<p>Through email automations. Every automation is built with three parts: Event, Filter and Action.</p>\n<h4>Choose an event</h4>\n<p>In the event, you decide when the automation should run. It can be an order status change, for example order completed, refunded or even when an order note is added.</p>\n<h4>Add segmentation</h4>\n<p>Then optionally select a filter and your automation will run only for certain conditions. For example, you can create a follow-up email for selected products. Not assigning a filter, will make your marketing automation global.</p>\n<h4>Create your message (or perform an action)</h4>\n<p>Time for action. The final step of every automation. In other words, what will happen for the selected Event and Filter. It can be a follow-up email to a customer or adding the customer to Mailchimp list.</p>\n<h4>Customize with WooCommerce email shortcodes (placeholders)</h4>\n<p>ShopMagic supports a variety of WooCommerce email placeholders. This can help you personalize your emails with customers&#8217; data or increase conversions with direct links (e.g. pointing to an unfinished order).</p>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<h3>ShopMagic use cases</h3>\n<p>Looking for inspiration?

WooCommerce gives you a way to adjust its email templates in <em>WooCommerce</em> &rarr; <em>Settings</em> &rarr; <em>Emails</em>. You need to know HTML, CSS, and PHP to change the email templates in WooCommerce. However, this option is limited to the statuses and email triggers in WooCommerce. If you need more use the events, filters, and actions in ShopMagic 🚀!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20create%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20automations%20and%20send%20unlimited%20emails%20with%20your%20plugin%3F'>\nIs it possible to create an unlimited number of automations and send unlimited emails with your plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Unlike many SaaS-based platforms, we are not limiting you in any way. You are welcome to send as many follow-up emails as you need, to as many orders/customers as you like.</p>\n<p>What’s even better, ShopMagic has built-in logs, so you will have full control over your emails and know what&#8217;s going on with them.</p>\n<p>ShopMagic can be a great and free alternative to AutomateWoo. Also, you can run automatic actions to lower your abandonment cart rate and increase sales in WooCommerce.

All emails and actions are queued and sent or performed in batches, so even if you have a big store with lots of customers and orders, it will run smoothly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20coding%20skills%20needed%20to%20use%20shopmagic%3F'>\nAre coding skills needed to use ShopMagic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all!

Great. Just paste the HTML code, and you are good to go.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How does ShopMagic work?</h3>\n<p>Through email automations. Every automation is built with three parts: Event, Filter and Action.</p>\n<h4>Choose an event</h4>\n<p>In the event, you decide when the automation should run. It can be an order status change, for example order completed, refunded or even when an order note is added.</p>\n<h4>Add segmentation</h4>\n<p>Then optionally select a filter and your automation will run only for certain conditions. For example, you can create a follow-up email for selected products. Not assigning a filter, will make your marketing automation global.</p>\n<h4>Create your message (or perform an action)</h4>\n<p>Time for action. The final step of every automation. In other words, what will happen for the selected Event and Filter. It can be a follow-up email to a customer or adding the customer to Mailchimp list.</p>\n<h4>Customize with WooCommerce email shortcodes (placeholders)</h4>\n<p>ShopMagic supports a variety of WooCommerce email placeholders. This can help you personalize your emails with customers&#8217; data or increase conversions with direct links (e.g. pointing to an unfinished order).</p>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<h3>ShopMagic use cases</h3>\n<p>Looking for inspiration?
