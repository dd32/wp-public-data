When active, this plugin will automatically display your posts in chronological order on all views, including the main blog index day/month/year archives, category/tag archives, author archives, searches, etc. The admin UI is not changed, only the frontend display.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='displaying%20only%20specific%20post%20types%20in%20chronological%20order'>\nDisplaying only specific post types in chronological order\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin changes all post types to be chronological, globally. To apply it only to a specific post type, I suggest forking the plugin and adding a simple check for the post type of the query before it sets the query order to <code>ASC</code>. This is not a complicated process &#8211; the plugin has only 6 lines of code.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
