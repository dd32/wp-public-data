A shortcode takes the form of:</p>\n<p>[blippr id=&#8221;12345&#8243;]</p>\n<p>The ID can be found by using the blippr WordPress plugin panel on the New/Edit Post screen, or from any blippr title&#8217;s URL. You can also specify multiple IDs together with commas to generate a block of multiple items, like so:</p>\n<p>[blippr id=&#8221;12345,54321,9999&#8243;]</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can specify display options for each shortcode tag. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blips &#8211; may be a number between 0 and 10. Specifies the maximum number of blips to show on this item.</li>\n<li>note &#8211; A label inserted by the AJAX search tool. Does not affect display &#8211; just helps post authors keep track of which blippr tag is which.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>[blippr id=&#8221;12345&#8243; blips=&#8221;9&#8243;]</p>\n"
