It can be enabled on the CiviCRM Admin Utilities settings page. Feedback is welcome &#8211; please open an issue on the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/christianwach/civicrm-admin-utilities\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a> if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>This plugin requires a minimum of <em>WordPress 4.9</em> and <em>CiviCRM 5.39</em> but recommends you keep up to date with both.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<p>If you have installed the Shoreditch extension for CiviCRM, then this plugin does its best to make it compatible with WordPress. Unfortunately, Shoreditch version 0.1-alpha25 now makes it very difficult to override the margin applied to the body tag on the front end of your site, so you will have to do this yourself.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Development</h3>\n<p>This plugin is in active development. For feature requests and bug reports (or if you&#8217;re a plugin author and want to contribute) please visit the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/christianwach/civicrm-admin-utilities\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Extract the plugin archive</li>\n<li>Upload plugin files to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Make sure CiviCRM is activated and properly configured</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In single-site installs, you can adjust this plugin&#8217;s settings by visiting &#8220;Settings&#8221; &#8211;&gt; &#8220;CiviCRM Admin Utilities&#8221;. In WordPress Multisite, you will find the network settings page at &#8220;Network Admin&#8221; &#8211;&gt; &#8220;Settings&#8221; &#8211;&gt; &#8220;CiviCRM Admin Utilities&#8221;. If you install this plugin in WordPress Multisite and have CiviCRM network-activated, then you should also network-activate this plugin.</p>\n<h4>Upgrading from 0.3.3 or earlier</h4>\n<p>If you have this plugin installed on WordPress Multisite and this plugin is <em>not</em> network activated, then read on.</p>\n<p>Prior to version 0.3.4, this plugin stored its settings in the <em>network options</em> rather than in the <em>site&#8217;s options</em>. This meant that separate sites <em>shared</em> their settings rather than being individually configurable. Version 0.3.4 changed the location where the plugin&#8217;s settings are stored to be appropriate to the install location and, as a result, each site can be configured differently.</p>\n<p>If you are upgrading from 0.3.3, therefore, you may need to review the settings for each site where CiviCRM Admin Utilities is activated.</p>\n<p>Version 0.6 introduces further changes to configuration in WordPress Multisite which you should be aware of. When the plugin is activated on any site on the network, Network Administrators will then have access to a Settings Page in WordPress Network Admin at &#8220;Network Admin&#8221; &#8211;&gt; &#8220;Settings&#8221; &#8211;&gt; &#8220;CiviCRM Admin Utilities&#8221;. This means that there are settings at both the site level and the network level.</p>\n<p>Network Administrators can now set site defaults for any further activations of this plugin across the network. There are also network-specific settings that can be set. Of particular note are new permissions settings which allow you to remove &#8220;administer CiviCRM&#8221; capabilities from individual site administrators if that&#8217;s how you want to configure your network.</p>\n",
