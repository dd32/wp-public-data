If you are a developer, please look at the code where ample comments are provided.</p>\n<h4>Make your CF7 Form more portable</h4>\n<p>this plugin introduces form keys (which you can modify in the CF7 admin table).  Keys are unique for each form, allowing you identify a form my its key rather than an ID.  Why is this priceless?  IDs changes from one server to the next because they are the custom post ID attributed by the WordPress installation, and therefore you develop your form in a local machine only to find out that the IDs are different when you move your form to your production server.  To overcome this problem, we suggest you use a form key along with this plugin&#8217;s contact form shortcode, <code>[cf7form key=\"contact-us\"]</code>.  Don&#8217;t worry your old contact form 7 shortcodes will still work too, behind the scenes we simply map the key to the ID and call the regular contact form 7 shortcode.</p>\n<h4>Powerful form designs</h4>\n<p>This plugin is now fully compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-grid-layout/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Grid-Layout Designs for Contact Form 7</a>.  The Smart Grid for CF7 allows responsive grid-layout designed forms, as well as powerful features such as repetitive field inputs (using table structures with multiple row inputs), repetitive form sections using multiple tabbed inputs, as well as optional input sections using toggled collapsible sections.  Furthermore the plugin offers a modular approach to form design, where existing forms can be inserted as sub-sections.</p>\n<p>Post my CF7 Form now saves these complex forms designs seamlessly into your dashboard posts.</p>\n<h4>Other compatible plugins</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7 Conditional Fields By Jules Colle.</li>\n<li>Contact Form 7 Multi-Step Addon By ThemeREX.</li>\n<li>Contact Form Submissions by Jason Green.</li>\n<li>Live Preview for Contact Form 7 by Addons for Contact Form 7.</li>\n<li>Void Contact Form 7 widget for elementor page builder by voidCoders.</li>\n<li>Country &amp; Phone Field Contact Form 7 by Narinder Singh Bisht.</li>\n<li>Date Time Picker Field by Carlos Moreira.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Filters for fields</h4>\n<p>In addition to mapping your form fields to post fields you are also given a custom filter for that specific form field.  The filter option allows you to custom fill the post created for the submitted form, for example if a form requests the date of birth, you may want to create an additional post field for the age, so you can filter the date field in your <code>functions.php</code> file and calculate the age and save it to a custom post meta field.  The custom filters are created using the following nomenclature, <code>cf7_2_post_filter-&lt;post_type&gt;-&lt;post-field&gt;</code>.  For example if you have created a custom post type <code>quick-contact</code>, which as a meta field <code>age</code>, you could filter it with,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter-quick-contact-age','filter_date_to_age',10,3);\nfunction filter_date_to_age($value, $post_id, $form_data){\n  //$value is the post field value to return, by default it is empty\n  //$post_id is the ID of the post to which the form values are being mapped to\n  // $form_data is the submitted form data as an array of field-name=&gt;value pairs\n  if(isset($form_data['date-of-birth']){\n    //calculate the age\n    $value = ....\n  }\n  return $value;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Special Fields</h4>\n<p><strong>Author</strong> &#8211; unless the user sets the field, the default set in this order: current logged in user else, the recipient of the CF7 form email if such a user exists in the database, else it reverts to the user_id=1 which is the administrator.  A filter is also available to set the author.</p>\n<p><strong>Featured image/Thumbnail</strong> &#8211; these will only accept form fields of type <em>file</em>.  However, non image files uploaded will not show up as thumbnails in the post edit page.</p>\n<p><strong>Title/Content/Excerpt</strong> &#8211; there are enabled by default, and can be used to map any form fields to them.  However, if you wish disable these fields (using the post registration <em>supports</em> array of values), then please use the filter that allows these to be set for your custom post type.  (see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">filters section</a> for more info)</p>\n<h4>Pre-fill form fields</h4>\n<p>Contact Form 7 does not allow you to pre-fill fields before your form is displayed.  With this plugin you can do this, you will need to map your form first, and use the filter &#8216;cf7_2_post_filter_cf7_field_value&#8217; to pre-fill your fields, see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Filter &amp; Actions</a> section for more details.</p>\n<h4>Contact Form 7 list table</h4>\n<p>This plugin re-organises the CF7 dashboard list table, using the cf7 custom post list table to permit other developers to easily add custom columns to the list table.  You can therefore use <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/06/27/custom-columns-for-custom-post-types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP functionality</a> to customise your table.  For example you could view how many submits a form has received.</p>\n<h4>Other hooks</h4>\n<p>The plugin has been coded with additional actions and filters to allow you to hook your functionality such as when a form to post mapping is completed.  For a list of such hooks, please refer to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Filter &amp; Actions</a> section.</p>\n<h4>Checkout our other CF7 plugin extensions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-polylang/\" rel=\"ugc\">CF7 Polylang Module</a> &#8211; this plugin allows you to create forms in different languages for a multi-language website.

Should any of these mapped forms collect data considered to be private to the user, it will be saved to the database so you should take due diligence to inform your form user and comply with Privacy Data laws.</p>\n<h3>30. Allow non-admin users to manage mapping options.</h3>\n<p>Some of the mapping options (eg quick edit of mapped posts) are by default only accessible to admin users.  You can modify this using the following hook and returning a WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\" rel=\"ugc\">capability</a>  for your user&#8217;s role:</p>\n<pre><code>add-filter('cf7_2_post_mapping_capability', 'c2p_options_allow_editors', 10,1);\nfunction c2p_options_allow_editors($capability){\n    return 'edit_others_posts'; //any editor role capability\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Filters &amp; Actions for Developers</h3>\n<p>The following are hooks primarily aimed at developers.  More general hooks and filters are now documented inline in a helper metabox in the mapping edit page.</p>\n<h4>&#8216;cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_registration-{$taxonomy_slug}&#8217;</h4>\n<p>This filter allows you to customise <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy#Arguments\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">taxonomies arguments</a> before they are registered.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_registration-my_categories','modify_my_categories');\nfunction modify_my_categories($taxonomy_arg){\n  //$taxonomy_arg is an array containing arguments used to register the custom taxonomy\n  //modify the values in the array and pass it back\n  //for example, by default all taxonomies are registered as hierarchical, use this filter to change this.\n  $taxonomy_arg['hierarchical'] = false;\n  return $taxonomy_arg;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is possible to pass optional arguments for Metabox callback functions, taxonomy count update, and the taxonomy capabilities.

Fired at the end of the submission mapping process, once a new post has been created for a new submission.  The current mapping of the form fields is exposed, along with the data values submitted in the form and the files uploaded.  For developers interested in using this hook, please lookup in the inline documentation in the code itself.  The action is located in the includes/class-cf7-2-post-factory.php file.</p>\n<h4>`cf72post_register_mapped_post`</h4>\n<p>This action is fired each time the a mapped post is registered with the WP framework. This is mainly added for plugin developers to extend this plugin and target custom post types that are created by this plugin.<br />\n    add_action(&#8216;cf72post_register_mapped_post&#8217;, &#8216;custom_mapped_post&#8217;);<br />\n    function custom_mapped_post($post_type){<br />\n      //$post_type the post type being registered in the backend.<br />\n    }</p>\n<h4>Contributions</h4>\n<p>The following have contributed to bug fixes, documentation, and/or translations for this plugin,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/allenchiirogakutetsu/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@allenchiirogakutetsu</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/moikano/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@moikano</a></p>\n",

Currently you cannot undo a mapped form, you will have to create a new form and re-map it while deleting the old one to change the mapping.  So be careful when you save finally create your form.  In a later version of this plugin I will introduce functionality to un-publish a mapped form.</li>\n<li>As of v1.5 of this plugin a functionality has been introduced to quickly create meta-field mappings. This is useful when you have complex forms with multiple fields. Simply add a new meta-field and select a field to map (leave the meta field name to the default value), the meta-field name will automatically update itself to reflect the form field name with hyphens replaced by underscores. Subsequent additions of new meta-fields will further increase the magic by auto-selecting the next form field in the dropdown and filling in the meta-field name too.  If you wish to switch-off this functionality, simply manually edit the meta-field name and it will switch-off the autofill.</li>\n<li>Each time a visitor submits the form on your website, a new post will be created.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Unless you have a fair understanding of WordPress posts and meta-fields structures and how these are saved in the database, I highly recommend that you delete any existing posts that may have been saved from form submissions that used the previous mappings.  Failing to do this without a proper understanding of the changes you are making to an existing mapping with previously saved post submissions could lead to difficult errors to debug and fix once you start creating post submissions that have a different mapping.

Once mapped and published you will see your taxonomy appear in your custom post menu.  You can add terms to your taxonomy and these will be made pre-filled into your mapped field.  Users can select a term and when the form is submitted, the post will be created with those terms assigned to it.

Why filter the taxonomy mapping ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may have noticed that in addition to mapping a post field or taxonomy to one of your form fields, you can also use a filter to hook your own custom values.  In the case of taxonomies, you can actually map a form submission to a specific set of terms depending on the submission of other fields.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='8.%20how%20do%20i%20allow%20my%20form%20users%20to%20create%20a%20new%20term%20for%20a%20taxonomy%3F'>\n8. How do I allow my form users to create a new term for a taxonomy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a little more complex.  You will need to create an input field in your form in which users can submit a new term.  You will then need to hook the action <code>cf7_2_post_form_mapped_to_{$post_type}</code> which is fired right at the end of the saving process.  The hook parses the newly created <code>$post_ID</code> as well as the submitted <code>$cf7_form_data</code> form data array.  You can then check if your user has submitted a new value and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_insert_term\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">include it in taxonomy</a> and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_set_object_terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">assign the new term to the post</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='9.%20how%20can%20i%20pre-fill%20a%20form%27s%20field%20values%20%3F'>\n9. How can I pre-fill a form&#8217;s field values ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are are 2 filters provided to achieve this.  In both cases, these filters are fired if the form is mapped to a post type only.  The default behaviour is for the plugin to seek any draft saved form values for teh current user.  A form is saved (draft) if the <code>save</code> button tag is used which allows a user to save a partially filled form and to submit it at a later stage.  If a draft form is found for the current user, then the first filter will not be fired,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>the <code>cf7_2_post_filter_cf7_field_value</code> is fired for each field, and a helper code is available in the mapping edit admin page (see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/#screenshots\" rel=\"ugc\">Screenshot</a> #8), filter #7.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>cf7_2_post_form_values</code> is fired at the end of values pre-fill process, and allows all the values to be filtered, including those that may have been loaded if the current user as a draft form saved.</p>\n<p>add_filter(&#8216;cf7_2_post_form_values&#8217;, &#8216;simple_cf7_form_values&#8217; ,10,4);<br />\nfunction simple_cf7_form_values($field_values, $cf7_id, $post_type, $ck7_key){<br />\n  if( &#8216;my-form&#8217;!=$ck7_key ) return $field_values; //check this is the correct form.<br />\n   $field_values[&#8216;your-name&#8217;] = &#8216;prefilled name&#8217;;<br />\n   return $field_values;<br />\n}</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a WordPress page template that contains a CF7 form and want to change the field values from one page request to another, this can be done using the <code>cf7_2_post_form_values</code> filter (see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Filter &amp; Actions</a> for more details).  You will need to create an <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">anonymous function</a> on this filter and pass the CF7 id form your shortcode which you can automatically scan for form your page content.  In the example below I assume that the page contains the default &#8216;Contact Me&#8217; CF7 form which I want to pre-fill if a user is logged in,</p>\n<pre><code>$content = get_the_content();\n//let's find our shortcode\npreg_match_all( '/' . get_shortcode_regex() .

How to use custom JavaScript script on the form front-end ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin fires a number of jQuery scripts in order to map saved submissions back to draft forms.  So if you need to customise some additional functionality on your form on <code>$(document).ready()</code>, then you need to make sure it fires after the plugin&#8217;s scripts have finished.  In order to achieve this, the script fires a custom event on the form, the form id built using a nonce to ensure the event is unique to the form (in case you have multiple forms on the same page), which you can use to ensure you script fires in the right order, here is how you would enable this,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_form_append_output', 'append_my_script', 10, 4);\nfunction append_my_script($output, $attr, $nonce, $cf7form_key){\n  if(!isset($attr['id'])){\n    return $output;\n  }\n  $cf7_id = $attr['id'];\n  if(19 == $cf7_id){ //check this is your form\n    $output .= '&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;';\n    $output .= '(function( $ ) {';\n    $output .= '  //fire your script once the form nonce event is triggered';\n    $output .= '  $(document).on(\"'.$nonce.'\", $(\"div#'.$nonce.' form.wpcf7-form\"), function() {';\n    $output .= '  var cf7Form = $(\"div#'.$nonce.' form.wpcf7-form\");';\n    $output .= '  ... //your custom scripting';\n    $output .= '});';\n    $output .= '})( jQuery );';\n    $output .= '&lt;/script&gt;';\n  }\n  return $output;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>NOTE: the plugin wraps your form with a <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> element whose id is the event nonce iteself.  So if you prefer to enqueue your js file on the page instead of appending it, simply query the element <code>$('div.cf7_2_post')</code>  and extract its <code>id</code> attribute to bind the event.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='11.%20is%20it%20possible%20to%20save%20my%20form%20to%20an%20existing%20post%20type%3F'>\n11.

To get it to work you need to track which forms are mapped to which post yourself.  Introduce a hidden variable in your form to store your mapped post ids.  For example you have a custom post which maps/stores submitted faults  reported by your users.  On  page load, you need to pass the mapped post id to this plugin via your cf7 shortcode by dynamically calling the shortcode using <code>do_shortcode</code> and the attribute <code>cf7_2_post_id</code>,</p>\n<pre><code>$args = array(\n  'post_type'  =&gt; 'fault-post',\n  'post_status'=&gt; 'any',\n  'author' =&gt; get_current_user_id()\n);\n$faults = get_posts($args);\nforeach($faults as $post){\n  $cf7_attr = ' cf7_2_post_id=\"'.$post-&gt;ID.'\"';\n  //display your form, you might want to add some more html to structure to display them as tabs or something else.\n  echo do_shortcode('[cf7form key=\"user-fault\" title=\"Faults\" '.$cf7_attr.']');\n  wp_reset_postdata();\n}\n//if you need to add an extra empty form, then ensure you pass the cf7_2_post_id attribute as -1\n//$cf7_attr = ' cf7_2_post_id=\"-1\"';\n//echo do_shortcode('[cf7form key=\"user-fault\" title=\"Faults\" '.$cf7_attr.']');\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='15.%20i%20have%20enabled%20a%20save%20button%20on%20my%20form%2C%20but%20draft%20submissions%20are%20not%20being%20validated%21'>\n15.

This is done to ensure that forms with pre-loaded field values (saved draft forms or forms with pre-filled values) are not being cached by the browser and as a result load spurious values.</p>\n<p>If your form is not being saved by users and not being pre-filled, then you may decide to disable the no-cache metas with the following filter,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_print_page_nocache_metas', '__return_false'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is not possible to target pages with specific forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='20.%20how%20can%20i%20reload%20forms%20already%20submitted%3F'>\n20.

An example of such a js plugin is the Select2 extension, <a href=\"https://github.com/clivezhg/select2-to-tree\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Select2-to-tree</a>.

If you are a developer, please look at the code where ample comments are provided.</p>\n<h4>Make your CF7 Form more portable</h4>\n<p>this plugin introduces form keys (which you can modify in the CF7 admin table).  Keys are unique for each form, allowing you identify a form my its key rather than an ID.  Why is this priceless?  IDs changes from one server to the next because they are the custom post ID attributed by the WordPress installation, and therefore you develop your form in a local machine only to find out that the IDs are different when you move your form to your production server.  To overcome this problem, we suggest you use a form key along with this plugin&#8217;s contact form shortcode, <code>[cf7form key=\"contact-us\"]</code>.  Don&#8217;t worry your old contact form 7 shortcodes will still work too, behind the scenes we simply map the key to the ID and call the regular contact form 7 shortcode.</p>\n<h4>Powerful form designs</h4>\n<p>This plugin is now fully compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-grid-layout/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Grid-Layout Designs for Contact Form 7</a>.  The Smart Grid for CF7 allows responsive grid-layout designed forms, as well as powerful features such as repetitive field inputs (using table structures with multiple row inputs), repetitive form sections using multiple tabbed inputs, as well as optional input sections using toggled collapsible sections.  Furthermore the plugin offers a modular approach to form design, where existing forms can be inserted as sub-sections.</p>\n<p>Post my CF7 Form now saves these complex forms designs seamlessly into your dashboard posts.</p>\n<h4>Other compatible plugins</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7 Conditional Fields By Jules Colle.</li>\n<li>Contact Form 7 Multi-Step Addon By ThemeREX.</li>\n<li>Contact Form Submissions by Jason Green.</li>\n<li>Live Preview for Contact Form 7 by Addons for Contact Form 7.</li>\n<li>Void Contact Form 7 widget for elementor page builder by voidCoders.</li>\n<li>Country &amp; Phone Field Contact Form 7 by Narinder Singh Bisht.</li>\n<li>Date Time Picker Field by Carlos Moreira.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Filters for fields</h4>\n<p>In addition to mapping your form fields to post fields you are also given a custom filter for that specific form field.  The filter option allows you to custom fill the post created for the submitted form, for example if a form requests the date of birth, you may want to create an additional post field for the age, so you can filter the date field in your <code>functions.php</code> file and calculate the age and save it to a custom post meta field.  The custom filters are created using the following nomenclature, <code>cf7_2_post_filter-&lt;post_type&gt;-&lt;post-field&gt;</code>.  For example if you have created a custom post type <code>quick-contact</code>, which as a meta field <code>age</code>, you could filter it with,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter-quick-contact-age','filter_date_to_age',10,3);\nfunction filter_date_to_age($value, $post_id, $form_data){\n  //$value is the post field value to return, by default it is empty\n  //$post_id is the ID of the post to which the form values are being mapped to\n  // $form_data is the submitted form data as an array of field-name=&gt;value pairs\n  if(isset($form_data['date-of-birth']){\n    //calculate the age\n    $value = ....\n  }\n  return $value;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Special Fields</h4>\n<p><strong>Author</strong> &#8211; unless the user sets the field, the default set in this order: current logged in user else, the recipient of the CF7 form email if such a user exists in the database, else it reverts to the user_id=1 which is the administrator.  A filter is also available to set the author.</p>\n<p><strong>Featured image/Thumbnail</strong> &#8211; these will only accept form fields of type <em>file</em>.  However, non image files uploaded will not show up as thumbnails in the post edit page.</p>\n<p><strong>Title/Content/Excerpt</strong> &#8211; there are enabled by default, and can be used to map any form fields to them.  However, if you wish disable these fields (using the post registration <em>supports</em> array of values), then please use the filter that allows these to be set for your custom post type.  (see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">filters section</a> for more info)</p>\n<h4>Pre-fill form fields</h4>\n<p>Contact Form 7 does not allow you to pre-fill fields before your form is displayed.  With this plugin you can do this, you will need to map your form first, and use the filter &#8216;cf7_2_post_filter_cf7_field_value&#8217; to pre-fill your fields, see the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Filter &amp; Actions</a> section for more details.</p>\n<h4>Contact Form 7 list table</h4>\n<p>This plugin re-organises the CF7 dashboard list table, using the cf7 custom post list table to permit other developers to easily add custom columns to the list table.  You can therefore use <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/06/27/custom-columns-for-custom-post-types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP functionality</a> to customise your table.  For example you could view how many submits a form has received.</p>\n<h4>Other hooks</h4>\n<p>The plugin has been coded with additional actions and filters to allow you to hook your functionality such as when a form to post mapping is completed.  For a list of such hooks, please refer to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-my-contact-form-7/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Filter &amp; Actions</a> section.</p>\n<h4>Checkout our other CF7 plugin extensions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-polylang/\" rel=\"ugc\">CF7 Polylang Module</a> &#8211; this plugin allows you to create forms in different languages for a multi-language website.  The plugin requires the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/\" rel=\"ugc\">Polylang</a> plugin to be installed in order to manage translations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-multislide/\" rel=\"ugc\">CF7 Multi-slide Module</a> &#8211; this plugin allows you to build a multi-step form using a slider.

It also allows you to pre-fill fields before your form  is displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-google-map/\" rel=\"ugc\">CF7 Google Map</a> &#8211; allows google maps to be inserted into a Contact Form 7.  Unlike other plugins, this one allows map settings to be done at the form level, enabling diverse maps to be configured for each forms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-grid-layout/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Grid Layout Design for CF7</a> &#8211; allows responsive grid layout Contact Form 7 form designs, enabling modular designs of complex forms, and rich inter-linking of your CMS data with taxonomy/posts populated dynamic dropdown fields.</p>\n<h4>Privacy Notices</h4>\n<p>This plugin, in itself, does not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>track users by stealth;</li>\n<li>write any user personal data to the database;</li>\n<li>send any data to external servers;</li>\n<li>use cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, be aware that this plugin allows you to map your forms so as to save the data of any submissions made through these forms to the WordPress database. Should any of these mapped forms collect data considered to be private to the user, it will be saved to the database so you should take due diligence to inform your form user and comply with Privacy Data laws.</p>\n<h3>30. Allow non-admin users to manage mapping options.</h3>\n<p>Some of the mapping options (eg quick edit of mapped posts) are by default only accessible to admin users.  You can modify this using the following hook and returning a WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\" rel=\"ugc\">capability</a>  for your user&#8217;s role:</p>\n<pre><code>add-filter('cf7_2_post_mapping_capability', 'c2p_options_allow_editors', 10,1);\nfunction c2p_options_allow_editors($capability){\n    return 'edit_others_posts'; //any editor role capability\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Filters &amp; Actions for Developers</h3>\n<p>The following are hooks primarily aimed at developers.  More general hooks and filters are now documented inline in a helper metabox in the mapping edit page.</p>\n<h4>&#8216;cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_registration-{$taxonomy_slug}&#8217;</h4>\n<p>This filter allows you to customise <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy#Arguments\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">taxonomies arguments</a> before they are registered.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_registration-my_categories','modify_my_categories');\nfunction modify_my_categories($taxonomy_arg){\n  //$taxonomy_arg is an array containing arguments used to register the custom taxonomy\n  //modify the values in the array and pass it back\n  //for example, by default all taxonomies are registered as hierarchical, use this filter to change this.\n  $taxonomy_arg['hierarchical'] = false;\n  return $taxonomy_arg;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is possible to pass optional arguments for Metabox callback functions, taxonomy count update, and the taxonomy capabilities.  See the WordPress <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register_taxonomy</a> documentation for more information.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_registration-my_categories','modify_my_categories');\nfunction modify_my_categories($taxonomy_arg){\n  $args = array(\n          'meta_box_cb' =&gt; 'my_custom_taxonomy_metabox',\n          'update_count_callback' =&gt; 'my_taxonomy_selected',\n          'capabilities' =&gt; array(\n                              'manage_terms' =&gt; 'manage_categories'\n                              'edit_terms' =&gt; 'manage_categories'\n                              'delete_terms' =&gt; 'manage_categories'\n                              'assign_terms' =&gt; 'edit_posts'\n                            )\n        );\n  return args;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>&#8216;cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_query&#8217;</h4>\n<p>This filter allows you to modify the taxonomy terms query arguments for a form&#8217;s dropdown/checkbox/radio list.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter_taxonomy_query','custom_dropdown_order',10,3);\nfunction custom_dropdown_order($args, $cf7_post_id, $taxonomy){\n  if(20 == $cf7_post_id &amp;&amp; 'location_categories' == $taxonomy){\n    //modify the order in which the terms are listed,\n    $args['order_by'] = 'count';\n  }\n  return $args;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This function changes the list order, putting the most commonly used terms at the top of the list.<br />\nFor more information on taxonomy query arguments, please refer to the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_terms/#parameters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP codex documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>&#8216;cf7_2_post_filter_cf7_taxonomy_select2&#8217;</h4>\n<p>This filter expects a boolean, by default it is <code>true</code> and enables <a href=\"https://select2.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery select2 plugin</a> on select dropdown fields.<br />\nTo disable it, do the following</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_filter_cf7_taxonomy_select2','disable_select2_plugin',10,3);\nfunction disable_select2_plugin($enable, $cf7_post_id, $form_field){\n  if(20 == $cf7_post_id &amp;&amp; 'your-option' == $form_field){\n    //we assume here that cf7 form 20 has a dropdown field called 'your-option' which was mapped to a taxonomy\n    $enable=false;\n  }\n  //you could just return false if you want to disable for all dropdown\n  return $enable;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>&#8216;cf7_2_post_register_post_{post_type}&#8217;</h4>\n<p>this filter allows you to tweak the arguments used to register the custom_post type, for example, if you want to modify the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type#rewrite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">rewrite front-end slug</a> for the post type,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cf7_2_post_register_post_my-custom-post', 'set_rewrite_slug');\nfunction set_rewrite_slug($args){\n  $args['rewrite'] = array(\n    'slug' =&gt; 'posted-replies',\n    'with_front' =&gt; true\n  );\n  return $args;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>`cf7_2_post_form_posted`</h4>\n<p>action introduced for plugin developers specifically.  Fired at the end of the submission mapping process, once a new post has been created for a new submission.  The current mapping of the form fields is exposed, along with the data values submitted in the form and the files uploaded.  For developers interested in using this hook, please lookup in the inline documentation in the code itself.  The action is located in the includes/class-cf7-2-post-factory.php file.</p>\n<h4>`cf72post_register_mapped_post`</h4>\n<p>This action is fired each time the a mapped post is registered with the WP framework. This is mainly added for plugin developers to extend this plugin and target custom post types that are created by this plugin.<br />\n    add_action(&#8216;cf72post_register_mapped_post&#8217;, &#8216;custom_mapped_post&#8217;);<br />\n    function custom_mapped_post($post_type){<br />\n      //$post_type the post type being registered in the backend.<br />\n    }</p>\n<h4>Contributions</h4>\n<p>The following have contributed to bug fixes, documentation, and/or translations for this plugin,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/allenchiirogakutetsu/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@allenchiirogakutetsu</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/moikano/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@moikano</a></p>\n",
