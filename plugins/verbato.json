Whether you want a fun and quirky chat bot, or a professional and formal one, we&#8217;ve got you covered. Not only that, but any knowledge you teach the chat bot can then be used to answer user&#8217;s questions. This will significantly improve the chances the user will decide they want your product or service.</p>\n<p>Our plugin offers several agents to choose from, so you can pick the one that best fits your needs. Plus, our agents are constantly learning and improving, so your users can get even better answers over time.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for choosing our intelligent chat agent plugin. We hope you and your users find it to be a helpful and enjoyable addition to your site.</p>\n<p>Feel free to email us at support@verbato.ai with any questions or requests for improvements.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20bot%20know%20my%20product%3F'>\nHow does the bot know my product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You teach the bot about your product by supplying a single text prompt. You can also tell the bot how to behave, and what personality it should have. You can even instruct it not to discuss certain products or subjects. The more descriptive you are with your prompt, the more accurate the answers!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20what%20my%20users%20discussed%20with%20the%20bot%3F'>\nCan I see what my users discussed with the bot?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! And we believe this is the key to improving the bot&#8217;s answers. As you review those conversations, you may spot some answers that you may want to improve. Simply edit the prompt and teach the bot the correct answer to that question, and hit Save! Voila! From now on whenever someone asks this question they will get an improved answer!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20did%20you%20make%20the%20bots%20so%20pretty%3F'>\nHow did you make the bots so pretty?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use a 3D rendering library called Three.js and that uses something called WebGL to render 3D objects in the browser. This technology is improving constantly and WebGPU is around the corner which will allow us to make even prettier and more interesting 3D avatars!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20bot%20understand%20other%20languages%3F'>\nCan the bot understand other languages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are limited to the languages understood by the speech recognition service we use in our system.</p>\n<p>For now we only support English but are definitely planning to support additional languages in our next release. Email us with the languages you think we should support and we might prioritize those!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20like%20the%20voices%20available%2C%20are%20there%20more%3F'>\nI don&#8217;t like the voices available, are there more?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We simply included the ones we thought most people would like, but if you want a new voice included, or even your own voice, we can do that! Please record yourself in a very quiet room, and speak naturally for 2 minutes. Send us the recording and we&#8217;ll make a voice just for you!</p>\n</p>\n\n"
