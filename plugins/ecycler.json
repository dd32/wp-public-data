There are two different badges available, one for the collector and one for the discarder.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why so simple?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Over the next versions, we fully expect to add functionality to enable you to show your recycling efforts. This will include the ability to display your carbon offset achieved through your recycling efforts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I get my ecycler badge in one of my posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add this shortcode anywhere you&#8217;d like to see the badge: <code>[ecycler-badge]</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is ecycler.com?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At ecycler.com we bring together those who have recyclables to give away with those who want to collect those recyclables. Many US households, businesses and institutions are not offered curb-side recycling; we&#8217;re giving them that option.</p>\n<p>The collectors-or entrepreneurs-will make either 100% or 60% of the value of the recyclables, depending on if the discarder wants a payment in exchange for those recyclables.</p>\n<p>The discarder has the ability to track his recycling in terms of the number of units and their combined carbon offsets.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
