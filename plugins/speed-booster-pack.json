This will help Google and other search engines to rank your site higher in search results thus sending more traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed Booster Pack</strong> is maintained &amp; operated by <strong><a href=\"https://optimocha.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Optimocha</a></strong>, a company that offers special speed optimization services filled with people who <em>obsess</em> about speed!</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Speed Booster Pack</h3>\n<p>Each second of delay can cause up to 20% loss in conversion rates (<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/why-speed-matters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source: Google</a>). &#8220;Conversion&#8221; means <em>converting</em> visitors to something more than a &#8220;visitor&#8221;: leads, customers, subscribers, followers&#8230; you name it.</p>\n<p>You might lose more than half of your visitors if your website loads <strong>slower than three seconds</strong>! (<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/the-need-for-mobile-speed/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source: Google again</a>) More than half of your potential customers might get back to the search results page and navigate to your competitor. This is a huge problem, and it&#8217;s hugely overlooked among other SEO-related concerns. People don&#8217;t realize how important speed is, in the eyes of search engines.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Speed Booster Pack comes in: With its ever-evolving codebase, Speed Booster Pack aims to increase your site performance, page load times and PageSpeed (Lighthouse) scores! Optimocha, the company behind Speed Booster Pack, has a team with a pathological obsession for speed; so you can be sure that your site will be in good hands.</p>\n<h3>How to optimize PageSpeed Core Web Vitals metrics with Speed Booster Pack</h3>\n<p>With our huge set of features, of course!</p>\n<p>⭐ <strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>: Speed Booster Pack is made to improve your <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lcp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Interaction to Next Paint (INP)</a> and <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/cls\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a> metrics, which are also known together as <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/vitals\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Core Web Vitals</a>. (The <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/fid\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">First Input Delay (FID)</a> metric is being replaced by INP, but Speed Booster Pack also improves FID and its lab counterpart, <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/tbt/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Total Blocking Time (TBT)</a>.) With the right configuration, you can get your PageSpeed scores higher than ever!<br />\n⭐ <strong>Caching</strong>: Cache your pages into static HTML files, reduce database queries, get a faster website almost immediately. What&#8217;s not to love about caching?<br />\n⭐ <strong>Optimize Google Fonts</strong>: Did you know that there are better ways to load Google fonts? We like to brag about finding one of the best ways.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Lazy Load</strong>: It&#8217;s a disheartening issue that page speed tools encourage laziness&#8230; Just kidding, we love being lazy. And search engines will love your pages when you enable lazy loading for images, videos and iframes (except for the above-the-fold stuff, trust us).<br />\n⭐ <strong>Optimize JavaScript</strong>: You know that totally-not-cryptic &#8220;Remove Render-Blocking JavaScript&#8221; recommendation? Speed Booster Pack can help defer them all until after the whole HTML is rendered, or at least move all scripts to footer. Works like a charm.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Optimize CSS</strong>: Who needs all those different CSS files when you can inline them all into your page source? Especially when your CSS footprint is so small? Moreover, you can use the &#8220;<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/extract-critical-css\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Critical CSS</a>&#8221; feature to essentially lazy-load all your CSS except for the CSS for above-the-fold.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Preload Assets</strong>: Have some fonts that load in all your pages, or a script, or some CSS files? Preloading them will help modern browsers serve your pages way faster!<br />\n⭐ <strong>WooCommerce Optimizations</strong>: Disable cart fragments, change Action Scheduler&#8217;s retention period, disable things like WooCommerce Marketing and WooCommerce Analytics&#8230; and more to come!<br />\n⭐ <strong>Dequeue Core Scripts/Styles</strong>: Dashicons, jQuery Migrate, emoji script, post embed script&#8230; If you don&#8217;t need them, you can now choose to prevent them from loading in the first place&#8230; which can get you to the first place on your Google SERPs.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Localize Google Analytics &amp; Tag Manager</strong>: Tracker scripts aren&#8217;t the worst things that&#8217;ll slow your pages down, but they cause the most &#8220;recommendations&#8221;. Localizing Google Analytics and/or Google Tag Manager is a good idea to speed up your website then, right? Right?<br />\n⭐ <strong>Enable CDN</strong>: Integrate your content delivery network to your website by rewriting all static asset URLs with your CDN domain.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Cloudflare &amp; Sucuri Integration</strong>: Connect to your Cloudflare or Sucuri account so you can clear your cache every time your page cache is cleared.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Declutter HEAD</strong>: Do you think all that useless junk in your  should be gone? Us too! You know what they say: A clear  works faster.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Other Features</strong>: Minify HTML, enable instant.page, trim query strings, disable self pingbacks, optimize the Heartbeat API, set a limit for post revisions, change autosave interval&#8230; Did we forget anything?</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on new features so stay tuned for more and more on every major release!</p>\n<p>For complete usage instructions, you can visit the <a href=\"https://speedboosterpack.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Speed Booster Pack documentation</a> page.</p>\n<h3>Translators are always welcome &amp; always rewarded!</h3>\n<p>More than half of WordPress users don&#8217;t speak English, and missing out so much!

This will help Google and other search engines to rank your site higher in search results thus sending more traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed Booster Pack</strong> is maintained &amp; operated by <strong><a href=\"https://optimocha.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Optimocha</a></strong>, a company that offers special speed optimization services filled with people who <em>obsess</em> about speed!</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Speed Booster Pack</h3>\n<p>Each second of delay can cause up to 20% loss in conversion rates (<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/why-speed-matters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source: Google</a>). &#8220;Conversion&#8221; means <em>converting</em> visitors to something more than a &#8220;visitor&#8221;: leads, customers, subscribers, followers&#8230; you name it.</p>\n<p>You might lose more than half of your visitors if your website loads <strong>slower than three seconds</strong>! (<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/the-need-for-mobile-speed/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source: Google again</a>) More than half of your potential customers might get back to the search results page and navigate to your competitor. This is a huge problem, and it&#8217;s hugely overlooked among other SEO-related concerns. People don&#8217;t realize how important speed is, in the eyes of search engines.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Speed Booster Pack comes in: With its ever-evolving codebase, Speed Booster Pack aims to increase your site performance, page load times and PageSpeed (Lighthouse) scores! Optimocha, the company behind Speed Booster Pack, has a team with a pathological obsession for speed; so you can be sure that your site will be in good hands.</p>\n<h3>How to optimize PageSpeed Core Web Vitals metrics with Speed Booster Pack</h3>\n<p>With our huge set of features, of course!</p>\n<p>⭐ <strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>: Speed Booster Pack is made to improve your <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lcp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Interaction to Next Paint (INP)</a> and <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/cls\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a> metrics, which are also known together as <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/vitals\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Core Web Vitals</a>. (The <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/fid\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">First Input Delay (FID)</a> metric is being replaced by INP, but Speed Booster Pack also improves FID and its lab counterpart, <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/tbt/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Total Blocking Time (TBT)</a>.) With the right configuration, you can get your PageSpeed scores higher than ever!<br />\n⭐ <strong>Caching</strong>: Cache your pages into static HTML files, reduce database queries, get a faster website almost immediately. What&#8217;s not to love about caching?<br />\n⭐ <strong>Optimize Google Fonts</strong>: Did you know that there are better ways to load Google fonts? We like to brag about finding one of the best ways.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Lazy Load</strong>: It&#8217;s a disheartening issue that page speed tools encourage laziness&#8230; Just kidding, we love being lazy. And search engines will love your pages when you enable lazy loading for images, videos and iframes (except for the above-the-fold stuff, trust us).<br />\n⭐ <strong>Optimize JavaScript</strong>: You know that totally-not-cryptic &#8220;Remove Render-Blocking JavaScript&#8221; recommendation? Speed Booster Pack can help defer them all until after the whole HTML is rendered, or at least move all scripts to footer. Works like a charm.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Optimize CSS</strong>: Who needs all those different CSS files when you can inline them all into your page source? Especially when your CSS footprint is so small? Moreover, you can use the &#8220;<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/extract-critical-css\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Critical CSS</a>&#8221; feature to essentially lazy-load all your CSS except for the CSS for above-the-fold.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Preload Assets</strong>: Have some fonts that load in all your pages, or a script, or some CSS files? Preloading them will help modern browsers serve your pages way faster!<br />\n⭐ <strong>WooCommerce Optimizations</strong>: Disable cart fragments, change Action Scheduler&#8217;s retention period, disable things like WooCommerce Marketing and WooCommerce Analytics&#8230; and more to come!<br />\n⭐ <strong>Dequeue Core Scripts/Styles</strong>: Dashicons, jQuery Migrate, emoji script, post embed script&#8230; If you don&#8217;t need them, you can now choose to prevent them from loading in the first place&#8230; which can get you to the first place on your Google SERPs.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Localize Google Analytics &amp; Tag Manager</strong>: Tracker scripts aren&#8217;t the worst things that&#8217;ll slow your pages down, but they cause the most &#8220;recommendations&#8221;. Localizing Google Analytics and/or Google Tag Manager is a good idea to speed up your website then, right? Right?<br />\n⭐ <strong>Enable CDN</strong>: Integrate your content delivery network to your website by rewriting all static asset URLs with your CDN domain.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Cloudflare &amp; Sucuri Integration</strong>: Connect to your Cloudflare or Sucuri account so you can clear your cache every time your page cache is cleared.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Declutter HEAD</strong>: Do you think all that useless junk in your  should be gone? Us too! You know what they say: A clear  works faster.<br />\n⭐ <strong>Other Features</strong>: Minify HTML, enable instant.page, trim query strings, disable self pingbacks, optimize the Heartbeat API, set a limit for post revisions, change autosave interval&#8230; Did we forget anything?</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on new features so stay tuned for more and more on every major release!</p>\n<p>For complete usage instructions, you can visit the <a href=\"https://speedboosterpack.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Speed Booster Pack documentation</a> page.</p>\n<h3>Translators are always welcome &amp; always rewarded!</h3>\n<p>More than half of WordPress users don&#8217;t speak English, and missing out so much!

There are lots of factors to think about when it comes to web performance optimization. That&#8217;s where we, as Optimocha, come in: We log in to your website; create a specialized optimization report considering all your plugins, your theme settings, your hosting environment and your whole content; then we get our hands dirty to get your website as fast as possible.

We just need to make sure that we&#8217;re on the same page: This plugin, no matter how hard we work on it, might have bugs in it and your site has an off chance to have issues with the plugin. It doesn&#8217;t do anything permanent to your pages&#8217; source codes, so deactivating the plugin and clearing your browser &amp; server caches will solve any kind of issue it might cause. Other than that, we won&#8217;t be able to take responsibility if something else clashes with Speed Booster Pack.</p>\n",
