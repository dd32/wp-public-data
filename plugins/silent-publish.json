        "description": "<p>This plugin gives you the ability to publish a post without triggering pingbacks, trackbacks, or notifying update services.</p>\n<p>A &#8220;Publish silently?&#8221; checkbox is added to the &#8220;Add New Post&#8221; and &#8220;Edit Post&#8221; admin pages (the latter only for unpublished posts). If checked when the post is published, that post will not trigger the pingbacks, trackbacks, and update service notifications that would typically occur.</p>\n<p>In every other manner, the post is published as usual: it&#8217;ll appear on the front page, archives, and feeds as expected, and no other aspect of the post is affected.</p>\n<p>While trackbacks and pingsbacks can already be disabled from the Add New Post/Page page, this plugin makes things easier by allowing a single checkbox to disable those things, in addition to disabling notification of update services which otherwise could only be disabled by clearing the value of the global setting, which would then affect all authors and any subsequently published posts.</p>\n<p>If a post is silently published, a custom field &#8216;_silent-publish&#8217; for the post is set to a value of 1 as a means of recording the action. However, this value is not used after publish for any purpose as of yet. Nor is the custom field unset or changed if the post is later re-published.</p>\n<p>Also see my <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stealth-publish/\" rel=\"ugc\">Stealth Publish</a> plugin if you want to make a new post but prevent it from appearing on the front page of your blog and in feeds.

Code using these filters should ideally be put into a mu-plugin or site-specific plugin (which is beyond the scope of this readme to explain). Less ideally, you could put them in your active theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<p><strong>c2c_silent_publish_meta_key (filter)</strong></p>\n<p>The &#8216;c2c_silent_publish_meta_key&#8217; filter allows you to override the name of the custom field key used by the plugin to store a post&#8217;s silent publish status. This isn&#8217;t a common need.</p>\n<p>Arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$custom_field_key (string): The custom field key to be used by the plugin. By default this is &#8216;_silent-publish&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Defines a custom meta key to be used by Silent Publish.\n *\n * @param string $custom_field_key The default custom field key name.\n * @return string\n */\nfunction override_silent_publish_key( $custom_field_key ) {\n    return '_my_custom_silent-publish';\n}\nadd_filter( 'c2c_silent_publish_meta_key', 'override_silent_publish_key' );\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>c2c_silent_publish_default (filter)</strong></p>\n<p>The &#8216;c2c_silent_publish_default&#8217; filter allows you to override the default state of the &#8216;Silent Publish?&#8217; checkbox.</p>\n<p>Arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$state (boolean): The default state of the checkbox. By default this is false.</li>\n<li>$post (WP_Post): The post currently being created/edited.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>// Have the Silent Publish? checkbox checked by default.\nadd_filter( 'c2c_silent_publish_default', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>c2c_silent_publish_post_types (filter)</strong></p>\n<p>The &#8216;c2c_silent_publish_post_types&#8217; filter allows you to override the post types that can be silently published.</p>\n<p>Arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$post_types (array): Array of post type names.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Disable Silent Publish for a custom public post type 'book'.\n *\n * @param array $post_types Array of post type names.\n * @return array\n */\nfunction my_c2c_silent_publish_post_types( $post_types ) {\n    $post_types = array_flip( $post_types );\n    unset( $post_types[ 'book' ] );\n    return array_keys( $post_types ).\n}\nadd_filter( 'c2c_silent_publish_post_types', 'my_c2c_silent_publish_post_types' );\n</code></pre>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Whether installing or updating, whether this plugin or any other, it is always advisable to back-up your data before starting</li>\n<li>Install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or download and unzip <code>silent-publish.zip</code> inside the plugins directory for your site (typically <code>wp-content/plugins/</code>)</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; admin menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Click the &#8216;Publish silently?&#8217; checkbox when publishing a post to prevent triggering of pingbacks, trackbacks, or notifications to update services.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want to silent publish a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Perhaps for a particular post you don&#8217;t want any external notifications sent out. If checked when the post is published, that post will not trigger the pingbacks, trackbacks, and update service notifications that might typically occur.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have the checkbox checked by default?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. See the Filters section (under Other Notes) and look for the example using the &#8216;c2c_silent_publish_default&#8217; filter. You&#8217;ll have to put that code into your active theme&#8217;s functions.php file or a mu-plugin file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is the &#8220;Silent publish?&#8221; checkbox disabled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the &#8220;Silent publish?&#8221; checkbox had been checked at the time a post is published, the field will be shown but will disabled for that published post. Once a post is published, changing the value of the checkbox has no meaning, so there is no need to make it checkable. If you unpublish the post, the checkbox will again be clickable.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why did the &#8220;Silent publish?&#8221; checkbox disappear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the &#8220;Silent publish?&#8221; checkbox had not been checked at the time a post is published, the field will no longer be shown for that published post. Once a post is published, changing the value of the checkbox has no meaning, so there is no need to show it. If you unpublish the post, the checkbox will reappear.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change my mind after I silently publish a post to post it again without it being silent?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You must first unpublish the post (by making it a draft or pending). Then uncheck the &#8220;Publish silently?&#8221; checkbox and republish the post. However, it&#8217;s a bit moot at that point; once a post has been published without having silent publish enabled for it then pingbacks, trackbacks, and other notifications about the post being published have already been sent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this prevent email notifications from going out to people subscribed to receive a notice about new posts to the site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this prevent the post being automatically shared to, or announced on, social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. your posts will continue to be shared to social media sites upon publication (assuming it is configured to do so by whatever plugins you have in place to share your posts).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin include unit tests?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
