        "description": "<p>Teddy ID is a secure authentication service that allows your users to log in to your site by tapping just one button on user&#8217;s phone, without entering a password, yet as secure as modern internet banking sites. Every time a user logs in to your site, TeddyID recognizes the user automatically and sends a picture to his phone and to his computer. The user makes sure the pictures match and approves login by tapping &#8220;Yes&#8221; button in TeddyID app on his phone. Passwords are no longer needed, and security is ensured by use of two devices associated with the user: a computer and a phone. This is two factor authentication made simple.</p>\n<p>Try it for yourself on our site https://www.TeddyID.com.</p>\n<p>TeddyID will be displayed as a widget above your page content. In most cases, the entire login flow takes place within this widget and the user never has to leave your site.</p>\n<p>New users will be automatically added to your wordpress database. There is an option to auto-generate email addresses to further ease the registration process in case your site doesn&#8217;t require emails.</p>\n<p>Existing users can link their accounts at your site to their TeddyID accounts in their /wp-admin/ if they want to move from password based authentication to phone based authentication.</p>\n",
