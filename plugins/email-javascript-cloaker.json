If that was to appear on one of your posts/pages, it could easily be &#8216;scraped&#8217; or &#8216;harvested&#8217; automatically to add that email address to a spam list of some sort. Cloaking is all about making that harder to do.</p>\n<p><em>How does this plugin do its cloaking?</em><br />\nFor any email address you include in your content, using the custom shortcode of [email barack@whitehouse.gov], that email address will appear as &#8220;barack -at- whitehouse -dot- gov&#8221; in your content initially. JavaScript running in the browser will then convert that email address to a regular, clickable, email link. Whilst it may seem pointless to convert a regular email address to a strange format only to convert it back again, the idea is that most automated &#8216;scrapers&#8217;, or &#8216;harvesters&#8217;, do not run JavaScript and hence won&#8217;t be able to pick up on the non-standard email address. The vast majority of users visiting your site will have JavaScript, and will see regular email addresses (not the strange format).</p>\n<p><em>What about users who have no JavaScript, or have it disabled?</em><br />\nThey will see the strange format (&#8220;barack -at- whitehouse -dot- gov&#8221;). You can include a footnote using a custom short code [emailnojs] which will explain the strange format, if you wish to cater for that tiny minority of visitors.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses the GPLv3 license.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>There are 2 ways of installation. If your setup supports it, you can search for the plugin, by name, within your WordPress control panel, and install it from there.<br />\nAlternatively, you download the .zip file, unzip it, and copy the resultant <code>email-js-cloak</code> folder to the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> folder of your WordPress instaltion folder.</p>\n",
