This efficiency boost allows website owners to allocate resources to other aspects of their business while ensuring visitors can quickly find the information they need, without waiting for support responses.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='in%20the%20context%20of%20the%20letmehelp%20plugin%2C%20what%20are%20links%20and%20how%20do%20users%20add%20them%20through%20the%20plugin%20settings%3F'>\nIn the context of the LetMeHelp plugin, what are links and how do users add them through the plugin settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Links in the LetMeHelp plugin connect users to helpful resources like documentation or blog articles. To add a link, navigate to the &#8216;Links&#8217; tab in the plugin settings and click the &#8216;Add&#8217; button. These links serve as possible solutions to common support inquiries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20url%2C%20label%2C%20and%20keywords%20input%20fields%20used%20for%20when%20adding%20a%20link%20in%20the%20letmehelp%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat are the URL, label, and keywords input fields used for when adding a link in the LetMeHelp plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The URL field requires the web address of the resource you want to link to, while the label field is for the text displayed as the link. In the keywords field, add terms related to the target resource to connect the link to user queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='explain%20the%20importance%20of%20keywords%20in%20the%20letmehelp%20plugin%2C%20and%20how%20the%20text%20input%20field%20for%20keywords%20works.'>\nExplain the importance of keywords in the LetMeHelp plugin, and how the text input field for keywords works.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Keywords are essential for matching user queries to relevant links. When users enter their reason for contact, the plugin searches for links with matching keywords to suggest potential solutions. If no matching keywords are found, a &#8220;not found&#8221; message is displayed, along with a link to the next page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20a%20keyword%20connected%20to%20a%20link%20in%20the%20letmehelp%20plugin%2C%20and%20what%20happens%20when%20an%20input%20keyword%20matches%20or%20does%20not%20match%20a%20database%20keyword%3F'>\nHow is a keyword connected to a link in the LetMeHelp plugin, and what happens when an input keyword matches or does not match a database keyword?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Keywords are added to links when creating them in the plugin settings. If a user&#8217;s input keywords match a keyword in the database, the link(s) are displayed as potential solutions. If no match is found, a &#8220;not found&#8221; message appears. In both cases, a link to the destination page is also provided.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20wordpress%20block%2C%20and%20how%20does%20the%20letmehelp%20block%20function%20within%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat is a WordPress block, and how does the LetMeHelp block function within the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress blocks are components used to build website content. The LetMeHelp block enables the creation of a multi-step page with two steps: &#8220;Reason for contact&#8221; and &#8220;destination page&#8221;. The first step prompts users to enter their reason for contact, while the second step displays the contact form or any other added WordPress blocks, currently available on the website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20users%20set%20custom%20settings%20for%20the%20letmehelp%20block%2C%20preview%20it%20in%20the%20editor%2C%20and%20test%20its%20functionality%3F'>\nHow can users set custom settings for the LetMeHelp block, preview it in the editor, and test its functionality?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The LetMeHelp block allows customization of the Subject (&#8220;Reason for contact&#8221;) form and any additional text. The destination page can be customized by adding child blocks with desired content. The block also offers &#8216;Settings&#8217; and &#8216;Preview&#8217; modes for configuration and testing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20destination%20page%20in%20the%20letmehelp%20plugin%2C%20and%20how%20can%20users%20customize%20it%20by%20adding%20blocks%20and%20changing%20its%20appearance%3F'>\nWhat is the destination page in the LetMeHelp plugin, and how can users customize it by adding blocks and changing its appearance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The destination page appears after the user submits keywords and reviews potential solutions. It is possible to customize this section by adding child blocks (such as a &#8216;Group&#8217; block containing a &#8216;Contact Form&#8217; block) to the LetMeHelp block. Using WordPress&#8217; default settings, it is also possible to adjust the layout and appearance of the destination page to fit the needs.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
