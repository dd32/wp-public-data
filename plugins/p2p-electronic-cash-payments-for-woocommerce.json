So if you do ever get hacked there are no keys to steal, your cryptocurrency is safe. The plugin makes use of HD Master Public Key.</p>\n<p>Does this use any payment processor? No! This uses your electrum/electron Master Public Keys, the crytocurrency goes straight from your customer&#8217;s wallet to your wallet.</p>\n<p>Are there any fees? No! This is P2P Electron Cash Payments, from your customer to you, with no middle man, no fees are ever taken at any point, nor will they ever be.</p>\n<p>Can I contribute? Sure! Go ahead and make a pull request. Clearly explain what the change does, what&#8217;s the intended result and why it&#8217;s required and if it changes any existing behaviour.</p>\n",
