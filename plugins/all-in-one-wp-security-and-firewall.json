AIOS automatically and permanently blocks spammers’ IP addresses. Site owners can use Cloudflare Turnstile or Google reCAPTCHA to reduce comment spam and block malicious users with just one click.</li>\n<li><strong>iFrame protection:</strong> Preventing other websites from reproducing your content via an ‘iFrame’ is a useful security feature that protects your intellectual property and your website visitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Copywriting protection:</strong> Stop users from stealing your content by disabling the right-click, select and copy text function.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable RSS and Atom Feeds:</strong> RSS and Atom Feeds can be used by bots to ‘scrape’ your website content and present it as their own.

Select ‘Support’ from the tabs above and post a topic. We aim to respond to all support requests within 24 hours during the working week.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20all-in-one%20security%20compatible%20with%20other%20plugins%3F'>\nIs All-In-One Security compatible with other plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. AIOS works smoothly with most popular WordPress plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20all-in-one-security%20regularly%20updated%3F'>\nIs All-in-One-Security regularly updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WordPress Security is something that evolves over time. We update AIOS with new security features (and fixes if required) on a regular basis so you can be assured that your site will keep benefitting from new security protection techniques for as long as you need them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20all-in-one%20security%20slow%20down%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill All-In-One Security slow down my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='should%20i%20install%20all-in-one%20security%20for%20free%20or%20should%20i%20purchase%20aios%20premium%3F'>\nShould I install All-In-One Security for free or should I purchase AIOS Premium?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The decision is yours to make. ‘Free’ AIOS incorporates a web application firewall, comprehensive login security tools including two-factor authentication and all the latest recommended WordPress security practices and techniques.<br />\nBut if your WordPress site is a business website, if it showcases what you do, or who you are, we generally recommend AIOS Premium. Prices start from as little as $70 for the year.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20additional%20features%20of%20all-in-one%20security%20premium%3F'>\nWhat are the additional features of All-In-One Security Premium?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AIOS Premium scans your WordPress website for malware whilst also monitoring your site&#8217;s response time and uptime, notifying you of any issues within 24 hours, AIOS Premium customers also benefit from hands-on ticketed support via email (rather than via WP Support forums).<br />\nAdditional security tools include Country Blocking, Smart 404 Error Blocking and Advanced Two Factor Authentication.<br />\nMore information is available from our <a href=\"https://aiosplugin.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All-In-One Security website</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20started%20with%20all-in-one%20security%20premium%3F'>\nHow do I get started with All-In-One Security Premium?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the web shop, purchase your preferred subscription. After completing the purchase, you will be emailed a link to download the plugin. You can also access the link through your &#8220;My Account&#8221; page.<br />\nAfter downloading the zip file, install and activate the plugin through WP Admin-&gt;Plugins-&gt;Add New-&gt;Upload Plugin.<br />\nThe premium extends the free version. Therefore you should keep the free version installed and active. You will also be prompted to enter your AIOS username and password to connect your site to licenses. This will allow the plugin to receive updates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20the%20free%20version%20before%20downloading%20premium%3F'>\nDo I need to have the free version before downloading Premium?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you need to have the free version of the plugin installed and activated before installing Premium. Premium plugin is an add-on that requires the free version to be present.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20all-in-one%20security%20work%20with%20multi-site%20network%20installations%3F'>\nDoes All-In-One Security work with multi-site network installations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, AIOS Premium is compatible with WordPress multisites. For multisite networks, the protection will apply to the network as a whole, and the dashboard and options will be available on the main site of the WordPress multisite.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20a%20wordpress%20security%20plugin%20stop%20all%20attacks%20on%20my%20site%3F'>\nCan a WordPress security plugin stop all attacks on my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no 100% guarantee that a security plugin will be able to protect against all attacks, as there is always the possibility of unknown WordPress vulnerabilities or other unexpected factors, and attackers are always seeking to develop new ways around protections. However, All-In-One Security gives good protection against known attack methods, and is under continuous development to monitor and improve protections.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20all-in-one%20security%20work%20on%20all%20servers%20and%20hosts%3F'>\nDoes All-In-One Security work on all servers and hosts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AIOS should be compatible with most hosts, unless the host has specifically restricted the use of security plugins. Similarly, certain features may not work on some servers, especially Windows/IIS platforms. Features that use the ‘.htaccess’ file will not apply on a Windows IIS server or NGINX server (but development is ongoing to port those protections to all servers).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20cover%20my%20subdomains%20and%20test%20sites%20with%20a%20licence%20for%20aios%20premium%3F'>\nCan I cover my subdomains and test sites with a licence for AIOS Premium?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Development and test sites require their own licence if updates to the plugin are needed.<br />\nHowever, these sites can be disconnected from the licence when they have served their purpose. You can disconnect the licence via the site&#8217;s WP Admin-&gt;Plugins page, and it will be available to be reassigned to a different site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20all%20in%20one%20security%20%26%20firewall%20plugin%20gdpr%20and%20other%20privacy%20law%20compliant%3F'>\nIs the All In One Security &amp; Firewall Plugin GDPR and other privacy law compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please read more about GDPR compliance here: https://aiosplugin.com/privacy-policy/ .</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This defect meant that a site administrator had the potential, between releases 5.1.9 to 5.2.0 (which purges the existing data), to know what site users&#8217; passwords are. This information has limited value (an admin can already reset anyone&#8217;s password) except insofar as the passwords may be re-used by users on other sites. In that &#8220;hostile admin&#8221; scenario, your site has other problems (since the hostile admin has a whole raft of equivalent ways of causing mischief to users, especially if not on multisite where a site admin is potentially not a super admin and may not be able to install or configure plugins). This changelog has been expanded in response to incorrect reports which suggested a wider problem (for example, they did not mention that the attacker needs to already be logged in as an admin to read the log, or that upgrading to 5.2.0 deletes the affected data).</li>\n<li>SECURITY: Set tighter restrictions on what subsite admins can do in a multisite.</li>\n<li>FIX: After editing a file reset permissions back to the original permissions</li>\n<li>FIX: Corrected some broken links in the plugin</li>\n<li>FIX: Fatal error: cannot declare class</li>\n<li>FIX: Normalise all arguments in the stacktrace</li>\n<li>FIX: Wrong login entries added to login activity table on multisite when user logs into subsite they don&#8217;t belong to.</li>\n<li>FIX: Too many redirects error for forced logout users solved</li>\n<li>TWEAK: For Cronjob, WP CLI and AIOS_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDR defined constant do not use external services for user IP addresses.
