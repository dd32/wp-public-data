By default, it is granted to any user that has the <code>manage_options</code> capability.</p>\n<p>To disable this default behavior, you can unhook the relevant function:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nremove_filter( 'user_has_cap', 'flush_transients_grant_cap' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note however that in this case you will have to grant the capability in another way outside of this plugin.</p>\n<p>When using WordPress Multisite, network transients can only be flushed by network administrators by default, relying on a distinct <code>flush_network_transients</code> capability.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20configure%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhere can I configure the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t come with a settings screen or options of any kind.
