        "installation": "<p>Standard WordPress quick and easy installation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download.</li>\n<li>Unzip.</li>\n<li>Upload the shutter-reloaded-plus folder to the plugins directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin.</li>\n<li>Go to &#8220;Appearance &#8211; Shutter Reloaded Plus&#8221; and set your preferences.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Upgrade</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate and delete the old version.</li>\n<li>Upload and activate the new one.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I have &#8230; plugin installed that uses javascript, will there be any conflicts/incompatibilities?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since Shutter Reloaded Plus does not use any js libraries, it does not interfere with them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will happen if my site visitors have JavaScript disabled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Then none of your links will be changed and will work as usual.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a thumbnail link but it points to a webpage, not to image. Will that affect Shutter Reloaded Plus?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Shutter Reloaded Plus looks only for links pointing to an image (with thumbnails or not), and will not change any other link, even if the link has the same CSS class used for activation.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
