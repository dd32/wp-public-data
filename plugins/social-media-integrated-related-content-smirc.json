        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the SMIRC plugin to your blog (YOURBLOG/wp-content/plugins) and activate it using the WordPress plugin admin screen.</li>\n<li>Modify settings if necessary.  You can modify the following settings:\n<ul>\n<li>Keyword.  SMIRC uses a page&#8217;s (or post&#8217;s) title as a search term when querying for related content.  You can add a word to this search term.</li>\n<li>Data sources.  SMIRC has the ability to search one or more sources of content.  This version includes Twitter and Google Blog Search.  You can<br />\nindicate which sources you&#8217;d like to search, number of results from each source, and what to exclude from each source.</li>\n<li>Header text.  To better fit within your existing theme, you can set the text that is displayed above SMIRC&#8217;s list of links.</li>\n<li>Animation.  You have two choices:  SMIRC will either display the header and list, or display the header with an arrow &#8212; clicking the arrow<br />\nwill trigger a sliding animation reveal of the list.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add <code>&lt;?=smirc($post-&gt;post_title)?&gt;</code> in your template where you&#8217;d like SMIRC to display content.  If you don&#8217;t want to use your page title (or<br />\npost title) as keywords, pass any string you&#8217;d like to the smirc() function.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Isn&#8217;t this just trackback?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  Trackbacks are specifically meant to show relationships between posts, they do not care about the CONTENT of posts.  SMIRC shows your users<br />\nwhat the blogosphere is saying about the content in your post/page, not just the URL.  Suppose you&#8217;re an artist, and you created a painting and posted<br />\na page about it.  Links to that page are not as important as people discussing your painting.  SMIRC will allow you and your readers to follow those<br />\nexternal discussions as simply as if they took place on your own blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I need a specific keyword attached to searches?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Edit SMIRC&#8217;s settings and use the &#8220;Keyword&#8221; to add whatever you like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t use jQuery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SMIRC is functional without any JavaScript magic &#8212; searching and parsing occurs server-side, not via AJAX.  jQuery is used to animate a reveal of the<br />\nresults, but you can disable the animation in the settings admin panel.  If you want the animation but are using scriptaculous or another animation<br />\nframework, feel free to modify SMIRC source to allow for your framework&#8217;s slide / reveal method.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why did you write this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We (my company, EVB, where I am Director of Technology) needed to add external-but-related-content to a WordPress-powered site, and decided to build<br />\nthis plugin and release to the community.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
