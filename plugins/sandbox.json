With two simple clicks an entire testing site is created using your existing hosting provider. No more copying down to a complex local test setup or living dangerously on a live site.

If you no longer need your sandboxes, delete them before removing the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I disable the sandbox and return to the live site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to the admin interface, there should be a banner at the top which says &#8220;Currently in  sandbox. To deactivate sandbox, click here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you cannot get into the admin interface, there is a cookie in the browser called &#8220;sandbox&#8221;. Delete this and you will be returned to the live site. This cookie is used to tell the plugin if you want to use a sandbox and which one. So for example if you activate the sandbox in one browser, you can start up a different browser and view the live site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the export capability?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The export capability provides a way to download a sandbox and install it somewhere. To download an export, go to Sandbox option on the sidebar of the Admin interface. Place your mouse over the row of the sandbox you would like to export and the select the export option. Once prompted, click the download link. Depending on the size of the sandbox and speed of your web server, it may take some time for the link to appear.</p>\n<p>The download file is a zip of all the files for the sandbox. Within the zip there is a SQL dump (dump.sql) of all the database tables related to the sandbox. The files need to be copied into the desired directory of the new server and the SQL file needs to be imported into the database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my backups are now huge?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Backup plugins will backup not only your existing site but also the directory containing your sandboxes. Most backup plugins will have an exclusion setting which you can add the ./sandbox directory to.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plug-in helped me a lot. How can I ever repay you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A small Paypal donation at <a href=\"http://think-bowl.com/\" title=\"It's less of a tank and more of a bowl.\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Think Bowl</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
