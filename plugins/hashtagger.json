Each #hashtag is added as a &#8220;normal&#8221; tag (without leading hash) to the post, so it is fully compatible with existing tags!</p>\n<h3>Retired Plugin</h3>\n<p>Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you.</p>\n<p>There will be no more updates and I won&#8217;t answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.</p>\n<p>Feel free to fork this plugin.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Just type anywhere in a post</p>\n<p><strong>#hashtag</strong><br />\nThis adds &#8220;hashtag&#8221; as tag to the current post and on links to tag archive page for &#8220;hashtag&#8221; when showing the post.</p>\n<p><strong>+#hashtag</strong><br />\nUse +#hashtag to only link to a tag archive page without adding &#8220;hashtag&#8221; as tag to the post. When showing the post the link is showed as &#8220;#hashtag&#8221; (without &#8220;+&#8221;). If the tag does not exist the text remains unchanged and no link is created.</p>\n<p><strong>##hashtag</strong><br />\nUse duplicate ##hashes to tell the plugin that this word should not be converted into a tag. Duplicate hashes are replaced by a single hash when showing the post.</p>\n<p><strong>@username</strong><br />\nThis creates a link either to the Profile Page or the Website of User &#8220;username&#8221;. The usage of @usernames can be activated optionally. If the username does not exist the text remains unchanged and no link is created. It is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to use @nicknames instead of @usernames to enhance security.</p>\n<p><strong>@@username</strong><br />\nUse @@username to avoid link creation. When showing the post this is displayed as &#8220;@username&#8221; without link (@username feature has to be activated).</p>\n<p><strong>$cashtag</strong><br />\nThis creates a link to the concerning stock symbol at MarketWatch, Google Finance, Yahoo Finance or StockTwits. The usage of $cashtags can be activated optionally. $cashtags link to the concerning stock symbol at MarketWatch, Google Finance or Yahoo Finance. <strong>Notice</strong>: stock symbols can not be validated, using a invalid stock symbol will cause an not found error on the target site.</p>\n<p><strong>$$chashtag</strong><br />\nUse $$cashtag to avoid link creation. When showing the post this is displayed as &#8220;$cashtag&#8221; without link ($cashtag feature has to be activated).</p>\n<h3>WordPress Security</h3>\n<p>If you activate the @username feature <strong>it is highly recommended to use @nickname instead of @username</strong>!</p>\n<h3>Post Types and Section Types</h3>\n<p>It is possible to use #hashtags, @usernames and $cashtags on Posts, on Pages and on Custom Post Types within Content, Title and Excerpt. Activate only the Post Types and Section Types you want to be processed to avoid unnecessary processing for best performance.</p>\n<h3>Formatting links</h3>\n<p>Additional CSS Class(es) to add to the #hashtag and @username links can be configured on the plugins setting page.</p>\n<h3>Display of links in front end</h3>\n<p>Optionally all symbols (#, @, $) can be removed from the links generated in front end.</p>\n<h3>Display of Tags in front end</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s an option to automatically add a hash symbol in front of tags (e.g. when using the Tag Cloud Widget).</p>\n<h3>Plugin Privacy Information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin does not set cookies</li>\n<li>This plugin does not collect or store any data</li>\n<li>This plugin does not send any data to external servers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>For developers</h3>\n<p>Use <code>do_hashtagger( $content )</code> in your theme files to process #hashtags and @usernames in $content.</p>\n",
