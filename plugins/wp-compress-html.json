Drop in a &lt;!&#8211;wp-compress-html no compression&#8211;&gt; tag within each area marked in this way to tell the plugin that area is not to be compressed. Don&#8217;t worry &#8211; these configuration tags will be stripped out by the plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you are coding your HTML template, you will almost certainly want to add spaces, tabs and carriage returns to the document. This helps you to read it, but this information is ignored by the browser and transmitting it to the browser is a waste of bandwidth. It bloats your files and slows your site down. This plugin will remove all this unnecessary &#8220;white space&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I mark areas that should not be compressed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Look at the screenshot at http://www.mandar-marathe.com/img/wp-compress-html-screenshot2.gif to see how to mark areas in your template that should not be compressed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work for WordPress version x.x.x?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has been tested upto WordPress version 3.3.1.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
