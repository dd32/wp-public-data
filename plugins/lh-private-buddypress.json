Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins (except Buddypress and this on) and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifeen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-private-buddypress/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-private-buddypress/</a>.
