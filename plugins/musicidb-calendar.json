How can I add my MusicIDB Events from within a template?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To add MusicIDB Events from a theme template, you can use code like this wrapped in PHP tags:</p>\n<pre><code>musicidb_events(array(\n    'theme' =&gt; 'light',\n    'view' =&gt; 'list',\n    'descrip' =&gt; 'true',\n    'display' =&gt; 'img'\n));   \n</code></pre>\n<p>The passed array parameter names and values are exactly the same as the shortcode attributes, and can be copied from the shortcode generator.</p>\n<p>Here are the available parameters, all of which can be configured in the shortcode generator.</p>\n<p>id: venue:123,artist:123,venue:456<br />\nUsed to specify the entities you wish to list events for.

Use light if you have a white or light background color.</p>\n<p>style: full or compact<br />\nThis controls the list style.<br />\nfull = &#8220;Event List with Pictures&#8221; (popular for venues)<br />\ncompact = &#8220;Simple List&#8221; (popular for artists)</p>\n<p>descrip: visible or hidden<br />\nWhen list view is shown, declares whether the Event Description area is visible prior to expanding the event</p>\n<p>buttons: left, center, or right<br />\nControl the button position on the &#8220;Event List with Pictures&#8221; style event list</p>\n<p>showvenue: show or hide<br />\nIf you want to show or hide the venue name in your event list you can use this option to do so. By default venue is hidden on the &#8220;Event List with Pictures&#8221; list style, and shown on the &#8220;Simple List&#8221; list style.</p>\n<p>showartist: show or hide<br />\nIf you want to show or hide the artist names in your event list you can use this option to do so.

How can I add the MusicIDB Featured Events slider from within a template?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To add MusicIDB Featured Events from a theme template, you can use code like this wrapped in PHP tags:</p>\n<pre><code>musicidb_featured_events(array(\n    'ticketdefault' =&gt; 'https://website.com/tickets',\n    'leftflag' =&gt; 'Featured Events',\n    'titlesize' =&gt; '22',\n    'numevents' =&gt; '8',\n    'background' =&gt; '#000000',\n    'fallbackimage' =&gt; 'https://website.com/image.jpg',\n));  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Shortcode version example: [musicidb-featured-slider titleSize=&#8221;22&#8243; numevents=&#8221;8&#8243; background=&#8221;#000000&#8243; fallbackImage=&#8221;https://website.com/image.jpg&#8221; leftFlag=&#8221;Featured Events&#8221; ticketDefault=&#8221;https://website.com/tickets&#8221;]</p>\n<p>ticketdefault: URL<br />\nIf you want users to automatically visit a master tickets site or webpage, you can fill this one to automatically create a ticket link for all events.</p>\n<p>leftflag: Text flag over left side<br />\nFlag over all featured events at top left corner, for example &#8220;Coming to The Music Shack&#8221;.</p>\n<p>titlesize: Integer<br />\nFont size for title of event (Which includes automatically printed names of tagged artists)</p>\n<p>numevents: Integer<br />\nMaximum number of events to load in the slider (absolute limit is 12).</p>\n<p>background: Hex Code<br />\nBackground color behind text, over image.  Will automatically become partially translucent.</p>\n<p>fallbackimage: URL<br />\nAn image to be used for this featured event slide when the featured event image, event poster, and artist photos attached to tagged artists are not found.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20the%20artist%20videos%20and%20music%20to%20appear%3F'>\nHow do I get the artist videos and music to appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are over 10,000 artists currently listed on MusicIDB, many of which already have media attached to their artist listing. If you are entering a new artist, you can add their media by searching for them after tagging them on an event, then edit their Artist Library on MusicIDB.com and include the embed code from their media channels such as YouTube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, etc.</p>\n<p>Our team spends time each week improving the database, so in some cases you might find we have helped fill in missing information or media for certain artists.</p>\n<p>Artists can also choose to update their own listings at their leisure, so they can contribute their latest release to their page, giving your website visitors the best possible experience to intice visitors to attend events.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20list%20templates%3F'>\nCan I customize the list templates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The plugin first checks a child theme, followed by a parent theme, and finally falls back to the templates provided in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Inside of your theme, create a directory called &#8216;musicidb-calendar&#8217;. Then copy the template that you want to override into that directory. The list templates are in the plugin directory, under wp-content/plugins/musicidb-calendar, and the files you can override are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>musicidb-compact-events-list.php</li>\n<li>musicidb-full-events-list.php</li>\n<li>musicidb-event-detail.php</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
