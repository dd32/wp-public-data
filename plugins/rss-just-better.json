So if you write &#8220;foo bar&#8221; you will INCLUDE ONLY those titles where ANY of the two word(s) is present and if you write &#8220;-foo -bar&#8221; you will EXCLUDE ALL those titles where any of the two words is present instead.</li>\n<li>You can also mix inclusive and exclusive terms as in &#8220;foo -bar&#8221; of course (it will include only titles with &#8220;foo&#8221; and without &#8220;bar&#8221;.)</li>\n<li>Search is case insensitive and searches for keywords in the titles only.</li>\n<li>Wildshars, quotes and boolean are not enabled for this search.<br />\n(2) Note on &#8216;num&#8217; attribute/parameter:<br />\nThe maximum number of displayable articles/items depends on the number of articles stored into the XML page (RSS/Atom feed page) of the website you want to syndicate (i.e. if you wish to display the latest 15 items and the original feed contains 10 items only, then only 10 items will be displayed).<br />\n(3) Note on &#8216;topic&#8217; attribute/parameter:<br />\nNot all topics are set for all countries/languages.

The two &#8220;filters&#8221; do not work together: if topic AND search-keys are both entered by the user, then the search-keys will be ignored and no error message will be displayed.<br />\n(5) Note on &#8216;Local&#8217; attribute/parameter:<br />\nThis option is available for Google News in English limited to Usa and Canada.

If you enter 0 all the items in the feed will be displayed;<br />\n** Enter the max age (in hours from publishing) an item needs to have to be displayed. Useful for less frequently updated feeds;<br />\n** Enter a certain amount of chars, if you want to truncate the titles;<br />\n** Choose whether you want a publication date/time (and what formats), excerpt (and how many chars of it) or not;<br />\n** Select whether you want a dotted list (default) or a numbered/ordered list;<br />\n** Select whether you want the linked items to open up in a new page (default) or in the same page;<br />\n** Choose whether you allow this plugin homepage to be displayed or not (please, say yes);<br />\n** Click on &#8216;Save&#8217; (and &#8216;Close&#8217; the widget form, if you want).<br />\n(1) Notes on &#8216;filter&#8217; attribute/parameter:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>You can enter one of more words to be able to select your feed&#8217;s items by keyword. So if you write &#8220;foo bar&#8221; you will INCLUDE ONLY those titles where ANY of the two word(s) is present and if you write &#8220;-foo -bar&#8221; you will EXCLUDE ALL those titles where any of the two words is present instead.</li>\n<li>You can also mix inclusive and exclusive terms as in &#8220;foo -bar&#8221; of course (it will include only titles with &#8220;foo&#8221; and without &#8220;bar&#8221;.)</li>\n<li>Search is case insensitive and searches for keywords in the titles only.</li>\n<li>Wildshars, quotes and boolean are not enabled for this search.<br />\n(2) Note on &#8216;num&#8217; attribute/parameter:<br />\nThe maximum number of displayable articles/items depends on the number of articles stored into the XML page (RSS/Atom feed page) of the website you want to syndicate (i.e. if you wish to display the latest 15 items and the original feed contains 10 items only, then only 10 items will be displayed).<br />\n(3) Note on &#8216;topic&#8217; attribute/parameter:<br />\nNot all topics are set for all countries/languages.  If you select a topic for a country where this is not provided (as yet?) then the &#8220;Top stories&#8221; (the default) will be displayed instead.<br />\n(4) Note on &#8216;topic&#8217; &amp; &#8216;gsearch&#8217; attributes/parameters:<br />\nGoogle (not me!) allows to search by topic OR by search-word(s). The two &#8220;filters&#8221; do not work together: if topic AND search-keys are both entered by the user, then the search-keys will be ignored and no error message will be displayed.<br />\n(5) Note on &#8216;Local&#8217; attribute/parameter:<br />\nThis option is available for Google News in English limited to Usa and Canada. It allows to enter city, region or postcode for local news results only.<br />\nExample of shortcode with all attributes and their default values for a generic feed URL:<br />\n[RSSjb feed=&#8221;http://feeds.feedburner.com/StefaniasBlog&#8221; filter=&#8221;&#8221; num=&#8221;5&#8243; ltime=&#8221;&#8221; list=&#8221;ul&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; pubdate=&#8221;false&#8221; pubtime=&#8221;false&#8221; dformat=&#8221;&#8221; tformat=&#8221;&#8221; pubauthor=&#8221;true&#8221; excerpt=&#8221;false&#8221; charex=&#8221;150&#8243; title=&#8221;&#8221; link=&#8221;false&#8221; sort=&#8221;false&#8221; cachefeed=&#8221;3600&#8243;]<br />\nExample of shortcode with all attributes and their default values for a Google News feed URL:<br />\n[RSSjb location=&#8221;us&#8221; local=&#8221;&#8221; topic=&#8221;&#8221; gsearch=&#8221;&#8221; filter=&#8221;&#8221; num=&#8221;5&#8243; ltime=&#8221;&#8221; list=&#8221;ul&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; pubdate=&#8221;false&#8221; pubtime=&#8221;false&#8221; dformat=&#8221;&#8221; tformat=&#8221;&#8221; pubauthor=&#8221;true&#8221; excerpt=&#8221;false&#8221; charex=&#8221;150&#8243; title=&#8221;&#8221; link=&#8221;false&#8221; sort=&#8221;false&#8221; cachefeed=&#8221;3600&#8243;]</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Future</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>being able to view images (and media files) too</li>\n<li>more feeds for more websites</li>\n<li>filter by keywords in description too (new attribute)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Interaction</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Would you like to see a new feature in this plugin?
