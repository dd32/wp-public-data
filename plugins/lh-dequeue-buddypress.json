Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifeen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-dequeue-buddypress/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-dequeue-buddypress/</a>.

But the most useful is lh_dequeue_buddypress_should_we_deqeue , it can be used to change the logic around when this plugin dequeues assets</p>\n</p>\n\n",
