Don&#8217;t worry about that; the plugin will search and destr&#8230; oops, and generate the correct links for you. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The links is not being generated in my excerpts. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well&#8230; Actually because it don&#8217;t. Maybe in the future, but by now, the plugins are only generated in the full post/page content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I activated the plugin, but I guess the links is not being generated.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t have any cache plugin (like WP Supercache) running on your installation. If this is your case, just delete your cache and everything should be fine. If not, drop me a message at hilder[at]hildersantos.com and I&#8217;ll look further on you problem &#8211; if I have time. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n\n",
