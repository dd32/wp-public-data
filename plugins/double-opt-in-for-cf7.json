Used with contact forms or online questionnaires or with user registration, it helps to reduce spam submissions. With GDPR laws, double opt-in is a strongly recommended way of getting user data. Because submitters have to confirm their identity from their email address, you can reduce risk of processing personal data without permission. Double – means here that user submitting the data has to give consent by checking checkbox option and additionally confirm their email-address.<br />\nDo not forget to set acceptance field in your CF7 form if GDPR is in concern!</p>\n<p><strong>How Double opt-in form works:</strong></p>\n<p>When someone fills and submits a form with double opt-in functionality, the first CF7 email goes back to THEM. There is a confirmation link in that email, which the submitter has to click on or paste in their web browser. The link has two encrypted parameters: submission serial number and submitter email address. The page with &#8220;opt-in&#8221; slug validates the parameters with submission stored in WordPress database and initiates sending of final emails to recipient set in &#8220;All Opt-In Forms&#8221; settings. If validation fails or when submission has expired, no emails are sent. If there are no specified parameters in the URL, visitors of the &#8220;opt-in&#8221; page are redirected to &#8220;404&#8221; page.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugin translation</strong></p>\n<p>Double Opt-In can be easily translated. It is released with the translation to Polish language.</p>\n",

Submissions must be stored somehow by the time of confirmation. I&#8217;m working on a built-in solution with automatic submission data removing when form expires, but it&#8217;ll take some time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20be%20now%20certain%20that%20the%20person%20submitting%20my%20form%20is%20who%20he%2Fshe%20claims%20to%20be%3F'>\nCan I be now certain that the person submitting my form is who he/she claims to be?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can be only certain that this person has access to emails in submitted email address account. This usually means being an account owner and is considered as secure contact confirmation. Just remember that it doesn&#8217;t really mean that the rest of information submitted with your form has to be true/legal or whatever.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20double%20opt-in%20plugin%20accessible%3F'>\nIs Double Opt-In plugin accessible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It&#8217;s as accessible as the core WordPress admin area. The optional custom file upload input is also built with accessibility in mind. All the options and settings can be easily used with screen readers, and the color contrast meets Web Accessibility Initiative standards. If you find some elements of plugin UI that need improvement, please report them on support forum.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20set%20csv%20delimiter%20working%20with%20cfdb7%20plugin%20exports%3F'>\nIs set CSV delimiter working with CFDB7 plugin exports?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. At least now, CFDB7 doesn&#8217;t offer a hook to modify CSV output. There is a solution in their support page, but it requires direct plugin file modification.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
