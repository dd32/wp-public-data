Then, additionally, either the injector and the author are the same person or the injector can <code>use_others_custom_fields</code> and the author can <code>share_dynamic_custom_fields</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>OK, where&#8217;s the manual?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://github.com/aercolino/nzymes/blob/master/nzymes-manual.md</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Nzymes replace Enzymes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! However, if you currently use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enzymes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Enzymes</a>, then both can coexist in your blog. Nzymes is much easier to use and it&#8217;s also much more powerful than Enzymes. Unfortunately, sometimes they are incompatible on the same post. Therefore, Nzymes will only process enzymes injected in posts created after its installation. See the manual to know how you can bend this rule.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
