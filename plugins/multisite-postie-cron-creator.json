        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20this%20do%3F'>\nWhat does this do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Postie uses WP&#8217;s CRON functions to &#8216;get&#8217; the mail. But on low-volume sites, there might be a delay when that happens.</p>\n<p>So the Postie developers recommend that you create a CRON job with the commands to &#8216;force&#8217; a Postie CRON.</p>\n<p>But if you have multiple sites (a multisite), it&#8217;s a pain to manually create a CRON for each site.</p>\n<p>This plugin creates the CRON command line, and an input file containing a list of all of your site URLS. All you have to do is copy the CRON command line to your server, usually via your hosting&#8217;s Control Panel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20on%20single%20sites%3F'>\nWill this work on single sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20add%20a%20new%20site%20to%20my%20multisite%3F'>\nWhat if I add a new site to my multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just run the plugin info/settings again, and a new input file will be created.</p>\n<p>No need to change your CRON job.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%2Factivate%2F'>\nHow do I install/activate/\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install the plugin in the usual way. If you are on a multisite, then you must add the plugin via the &#8216;master&#8217; dashboard. Then go to any site (usually the first/main site and &#8216;Network Activate&#8217;. )</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20the%20cron%20command%3F'>\nHow do I get the CRON command?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once installed and activated, use the Settings page. The CRON command, along with other information, will be displayed.</p>\n<p>Add that CRON job to your site, using the normal procedure. Most hosting places have instructions on how to add CRON jobs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='any%20requirements%3F'>\nAny requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You should have the Postie plugin installed and activated. This plugin does not check for that, but there is no reason to have this plugin without Postie, so no harm done.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20make%20any%20changes%20in%20postie%20settings%3F'>\nDo I need to make any changes in Postie settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20have%20a%20problem%20-%20or%20a%20suggestion%3F'>\nWhat if I have a problem &#8211; or a suggestion?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just use the Support area here.

See the Info/Settings screen when you activate the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20other%20offerings%3F'>\nDo you have other offerings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
