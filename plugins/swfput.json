        "description": "<p>SWFPut provides &#8216;responsive&#8217; video for posts and pages.<br />\nSWFPut makes the presentation of video reliable for your<br />\nvisitors: several conditions are handled well, such as<br />\nthe uneven support for HTML5 video formats in the major<br />\nbrowsers, the possible lack of support for either HTML5<br />\nvideo or flash video in the visitor&#8217;s browser, and even<br />\nthe possiblilty that JavaScript might be disabled in your<br />\nvisitor&#8217;s browser.</p>\n<p>In addition to video for posts and pages, SWFPut provides<br />\na video widget for use in widget areas, such as a sidebar.</p>\n<p>SWFPut video is &#8216;responsive&#8217;: it should display at a<br />\nsuitable size on your visitor&#8217;s device, whether large<br />\nor small (a responsive WordPress theme is necessary).</p>\n<p>SWFPut makes video setup easy and flexible by providing<br />\nan easy dialog based setup similar to (and based on)<br />\nthat used by WordPress core media, and also an<br />\nadvanced form with additional settings, which<br />\nappears in a new &#8220;metabox&#8221;<br />\non the editor page. For widgets, the form appears with<br />\nthe usual drag and drop widget interface. After adding<br />\nvideo objects, the form will continue to be useful for<br />\nmaking changes (or, if you wish, to delete the video).</p>\n<p>In WordPress versions 3.3 and greater, video added by<br />\nSWFPut will be visible in the post/page visual editor.</p>\n<p>As many video objects as you wish can be placed in posts<br />\npages, and of course the widget supports as many instances<br />\nas you wish.<br />\nYou may specify HTML5 or flash video, or both with one<br />\nbeing primary content and the other as fallback.</p>\n<p>Here are some features of SWFPut to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SWFPut works directly with media file<br />\nURL&#8217;s; that is, SWFPut does <em>not</em> embed<br />\nthe video players of providers such as YouTube or Vimeo.<br />\nSWFPut is for video files which are accessible by URL,<br />\nwhether hosted at your site or off-site.<br />\nThe setup form provides two media selection lists.<br />\nThe first is a selection of files found (recursively)<br />\nunder your wp-content/uploads directory. This list<br />\nhas the advantage that it does <em>not</em> use the<br />\nWordPress media library &#8212; it will find files that<br />\nyou upload &#8216;by hand&#8217; (with ftp, ssh, etc.). This feature<br />\nwill work around upload size limits that might prevent<br />\nyou from uploading large video files to the media library.<br />\nThe second is a selection of files found in the<br />\nWordPress media library and is presented with the<br />\nfile name and the &#8216;attachment id&#8217;. This refers to files<br />\nby ID, so it might be helpful if you manipulate media<br />\nand expect ID associations to be valid. Files selections<br />\nare filtered by name extension: FLV and MP4 for flash,<br />\nand MP4, OGG and OGV, and WEBM for HTML5 video.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Video resources do not need to be on your site:<br />\nany URL can be specified, so you may present players<br />\nfor off-site of 3rd party resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SWFPut does not interfere with the appearance of<br />\na site: a video is presented jsut as an image<br />\n(such as .png or .jpg) is, with the same sort of<br />\nstyle, and optional caption. The appearance of the<br />\nvideo control interface, or control bar, is simple<br />\nand quiet so it should not clash with site design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SWFPut allows you to set the display aspect ratio<br />\nfor the video. Some video is &#8216;anamorphic&#8217; in that<br />\nthe pixel width and height do not match the intended<br />\nproportion of display width and height. You might<br />\nfilm your child&#8217;s school play as 16:9 &#8216;widescreen&#8217;<br />\nbut use a space saving feature of your recorder that<br />\nsaves the video at 480&#215;360 (which is not 16:9). You can<br />\nset SWFPut to display the video at the intended 16:9<br />\naspect ratio. You may set any aspect ratio (make it<br />\ndistorted if you wish).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The core features of the flash video player program<br />\nincluded with SWFPut have been verified to work with<br />\nthe Gnash free-software browser plugin, which is good<br />\nif you care about free/libre software users. (At the<br />\ntime of this writing, Gnash does not handle the MP4<br />\nvideo container format, so it is preferable that you<br />\nprepare flash video in the FLV container, even using the<br />\nh.264 and AAC codecs. Of course, you may use MP4 if<br />\nyou must.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The flash video player program included with SWFPut<br />\nis written and compiled with the <em>Ming</em> PHP extension,<br />\nand the code is included, so you may modify the player.<br />\nThe HTML5 player is written JavaScript, and the original,<br />\nun-minified version is included, so you may modify it.<br />\nIn fact, the zip archive available at the WordPress<br />\nrepository includes all sources, although a POSIX/Unix<br />\nenvironment with certain tools is required to build.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Localization sources are included; hopefully, polyglot<br />\nusers will help with translations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>There are no special installation requirements.</p>\n<p>Preferably, install SWFPut from the WordPress Plugin<br />\nRepository through the WordPress administrative interface.</p>\n<p>To install from a zip archive:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Log in at your WordPress site</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select &#8216;Plugins -&gt; Add New&#8217;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select &#8216;Upload&#8217;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select &#8216;Browse&#8217;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In your system&#8217;s file selector, select the SWFPut zip file;<br />\nselect &#8216;OK&#8217; or equivalent</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select &#8216;Install Now&#8217;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Select &#8216;Activate Plugin&#8217;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point &#8220;SWFPut&#8221; should be an entry on the plugins page.<br />\nThe Settings menu should have an item &#8220;SWFPut Plugin&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If the above is not so, there is probably a problem at your site&#8217;s<br />\nhost; for example if the host is Unix system there is very likely<br />\na problem with incorrect permissions metadata (mode) on a directory<br />\nsuch as wp-content/uploads, or an unsuitable user or group ownership<br />\nof (probably several) files and directories. This can be a frequent<br />\nproblem if the host has PHP configured in &#8220;safe mode&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If the host is not a Unix system, I&#8217;m sorry to say I cannot help;<br />\nmaybe your hosting provider can.</p>\n<p>If the installation was successful, you should see a &#8220;SWFPut Video Player&#8221;<br />\nwidget under &#8216;Appearance -&gt; Widgets&#8217; and a meta-box entitled<br />\n&#8220;SWFPut Video&#8221; on the posts and pages editing pages.</p>\n<p>For additional help, you will find README* files (differing in format,<br />\nand excluding &#8216;readme.txt&#8217;, which is this file) that discuss the<br />\nflash video player in more detail.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat are the privacy implications of using SWFPut\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>None. SWFPut does no tracking at all. No information<br />\nof any sort is gathered or stored or forwarded to another<br />\nsite, or any such thing.  There is no contact made with<br />\nany other site(1).  These statements apply both to the<br />\nWordPress user, and to site visitors.</p>\n<p>(1) The user can provide a media URL from a 3rd party site<br />\nwhich a visitor&#8217;s browser will load; this &#8216;contact&#8217; of<br />\nanother site is entirely up to the WordPress user or administrator.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI installed SWFPut, now what?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, note that in the editor page for posts/pages,<br />\nthere is a new &#8216;metabox&#8217; named &#8220;SWFPut Video.&#8221; It<br />\nmight be near the bottom of the page, but metaboxes<br />\ncan be moved by dragging with the mouse. (When using<br />\nSWFPut it might be useful to drag its metabox to<br />\njust below the editor.) If necessary click the metabox<br />\ntitle to show the form.</p>\n<p>The SWFPut form might look complicated, but don&#8217;t<br />\nworry! There is help. At the top right of the WordPress<br />\neditor pages there is a tab named (in english)<br />\n&#8220;Help.&#8221; Click that, and editor help material will drop<br />\ndown. SWFPut adds a new tab here called &#8220;SWFPut Video&#8221;<br />\n(what else?). Click that tab and . . .</p>\n<p>. . . another drop-down, this time specifically<br />\nfor this plugin. Near the top there are two hyperlinks<br />\nwhich open in a new tab/page, one for PDF documentation<br />\nand one for (old-time style) HTML documentation. These<br />\nare versions of the same detailed document. The remainder<br />\nof the in-place help text addresses just a few items<br />\nthat the author (I) thought would need more explanation<br />\nfor a quick start. Please peruse these for use.</p>\n<p>Quickest of all, see the FAQ below entitled<br />\n&#8220;Do I really need video in 3 or 4 formats?&#8221; which<br />\nin spite of the name addresses quick and easy use<br />\nas well as video formats.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I really need to understand &#8220;aspect ratio&#8221; and things?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. In most case the width and height of the<br />\nvideo will match the intended display proportion.<br />\n&#8220;Anamorphic&#8221; video is not rare, but probably not too common<br />\neither. The author has seen videos on e.g., YouTube,<br />\nthat are distorted by wrong display aspect ratio<br />\n(which is not YouTube&#8217;s fault), but only a few.<br />\nIf you find that your video looks squeezed or stretched,<br />\nyou can always use a little trial &amp; error with the display<br />\naspect setting until it looks good.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I really need video in 3 or 4 formats?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly not. The help documention included with SWFPut<br />\ndiscusses file formats for HTML5 and flash with a level<br />\nof detail that &#8212; it is hoped &#8212; will help you make your video<br />\navailable to the broadest range of browsers used by your<br />\nvisitors. The cost of this detail is the loss of simplicity.</p>\n<p>The simplest use with not-too-bad availability would be like this:<br />\nprepare your video in MP4 format; place the URL in <em>either</em><br />\nthe &#8220;Flash video URL&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;HTML5 video URLs&#8230;&#8221; fields[*]<br />\nin the setup form, and set display size in the &#8220;Pixel Width:&#8221;<br />\nand &#8220;x Height:&#8221; fields; make sure that the cursor in the<br />\neditor is at the spot you want, and click the<br />\n&#8220;Place new in post&#8221; button. Publish the post/page with<br />\nthe &#8220;Update&#8221; button. Not too difficult!</p>\n<p>Currently many browsers support MP4 for HTML5 video,<br />\nbut not all! The flash browser plugin has supported MP4<br />\nfor a long time, but alternatives such as Gnash<br />\n(a free-software flash plugin) might not. Availability<br />\nwill be increased significantly by adding FLV (flash)<br />\nand OGG (or &#8216;ogv&#8217;, a patent-free, free-licensed type) formats.<br />\nIf you need video conversion software,<br />\na quick web search should yield several options.<br />\nChange the procedure in the above paragraph like this:<br />\nplace the URL for the FLV type in the &#8220;Flash video URL&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nfield, place the URL for the MP4 type <em>and</em><br />\nthe URL for the OGG type separated by a &#8216;|&#8217;<br />\nin the &#8220;HTML5 video URLs&#8230;&#8221; field (and don&#8217;t worry about<br />\n&#8216;codec&#8217; types discussed in the help docs). Easy, and fun!</p>\n<p>Finally, to cover all the bases, amend the the above paragraph<br />\nlike this: place the URL for the FLV type in the &#8220;Flash video URL&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nfield, place the URL for the MP4 type <em>and</em><br />\nthe URL for the OGG type <em>and</em><br />\nthe URL for the WEBM type separated by a &#8216;|&#8217;<br />\nbetween each in the &#8220;HTML5 video URLs&#8230;&#8221; field . . . .</p>\n<p>[*] MP4 can be placed in either the flash or HTML5<br />\nURL fields and it will be effective for both, as long<br />\nas the visitor&#8217;s browser has JavaScript enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if a visitor has JavaScript disabled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SWFPut is designed with that in mind. If scripting<br />\nis disabled, but either flash or HTML5 video is<br />\navailable, then your video should be viewable.<br />\nHTML5 video will have the browser&#8217;s native interface<br />\nand basic features.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do contact to the developer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Post a comment at<br />\n//agalena.nfshost.com/b1/software/swfput-html5-flash-wordpress-plugin/<br />\nor email edhynan at the email provider &#8216;gmail&#8217; with the<br />\ntop level domain &#8216;com&#8217;, or of course go the the SWFPut<br />\nWordPress page at https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/swfput<br />\nand select the &#8220;Support&#8221; tab.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes the developer want to know I use SWFPut?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the developer would consider it kind of you<br />\nto leave a comment with the URLs of your using pages.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This release of SWFPut<br />\nadjusts a version check so that the changes of SWFPut 3.0.1<br />\ntake effect for WordPress 4.2.3.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug in new visual editor dialog code that caused changes<br />\nin the caption field to be lost on switching to another tab.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix new mce-view visual editor presentation with WP 4.3beta1.</li>\n<li>Fix URL preparation bug in plugin_page_addlink().</li>\n<li>Misc. code cleanups.</li>\n<li>New .htaccess file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This release includes an improvement to the responsive<br />\nsizing of video: the height of a video is now limited<br />\nto fit within the visible vertical area. Previously, sizing<br />\nwas applied to width alone. This change should be<br />\nmost noticeable on small devices, particularly<br />\nhandheld devices in landscape orientation. This change<br />\napplies to desktop browsers too, although it will<br />\nprobably not be evident unless the browser window<br />\nis at a small size.</p>\n<p>This version has small documentation updates regarding<br />\nthe new visual editor interface of release 2.9, and<br />\none bugfix needed because of using a new WP function<br />\nsignature changed at some point before 4.x &#8212; this<br />\nwould not have affected users of current WordPress,<br />\nbut SFWPut is still supporting (i.e., working with)<br />\nWP as old as 3.0.2 (hopefully for no reason, since<br />\nold versions are probably insecure and should not be<br />\nused).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new interface for adding and configuring videos in the<br />\nvisual editor. The interface now shares many properties<br />\nwith the WordPress media interface, and uses much of the<br />\nnew and maturing core code.  Users will find video setup<br />\neasier, and familiar.  The origonal setup form in a<br />\nmetabox remains available and may be considered an<br />\nadvanced form, as it retains configuration items that<br />\nwill not be added to the new simplified interface.<br />\nThe new interface is only available for WordPress 4.x,<br />\nand support for 4.0 and 4.1 might be removed in the future<br />\n(users are advised to keep WordPress up to date).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sigh. Just added a forgotten file (from 2.2.2). The default<br />\nvideo (mentioned in the 2.2.2 entry, below) would be<br />\nmissing, because I neglected to &#8216;svn add&#8217; it.  Simple<br />\nmistake updating the repository.</p>\n<p>This should not affect any but those who might try<br />\nusing a URL that SWFPut rejects. Upgrade at your<br />\nconvenience.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bug fix release in response to a kind user query.<br />\nURLs provided for video files are checked before they<br />\nare used (good), but elsewhere in code an array key<br />\nwould be missing if the URL was rejected (bad), possibly<br />\nleading to PHP error messages appearing on page.</p>\n<p>Now, if a faulty URL is rejected, a default video URL<br />\nis used, linking to a small video that says &#8220;OOPS [&#8230;]&#8221;<br />\nand which should get the site owners attention (site<br />\nvisitors should find the default video inoffensive, even<br />\nif unexpected).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirmed working with WP 4.1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added long overdue alignment options.</li>\n<li>Added video preload option. Before now, the video element was always<br />\ngiven preload=&#8221;none&#8221;. Now, the specification values &#8220;none&#8221;,<br />\n&#8220;metadata&#8221;, and &#8220;auto&#8221; may be selected, or one special option<br />\nnamed (in english) &#8220;per initial image&#8221;, which will use &#8220;none&#8221;<br />\nif if an initial image (poster) is set, or else &#8220;metadata&#8221; so<br />\nthat the browser may display a frame of video as a poster.<br />\nNOTE: the new default is &#8220;per initial image&#8221; which will<br />\nchange the behavior of existing videos that do not have<br />\nan initial image (or &#8216;poster&#8217;): they will now have the<br />\npreload=&#8221;metadata&#8221; attribute, so the browser will make a<br />\nsmall unsolicited fetch from the server, and might display<br />\na frame. If that is unwanted, the preload option should<br />\nbe set to &#8220;none.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Some code cleanups and reorganization.</li>\n<li>Check with WordPress 4.0: OK. (Actually, WordPress 4.0-beta3,<br />\nand in the unlikely event that a problem arises with the<br />\nreal WP 4.0 release, it will be addressed in a minor revision.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This release is called &#8220;Sigh&#8221; and its only change is a<br />\nworkaround for a chromium 3.4 bug &#8212; not on the front end, but<br />\nin the Visual editor plugin. You want details, you say? OK:<br />\nthis plugin&#8217;s video in the tinymce visual editor is housed<br />\nin an iframe element. The iframe was given, <em>for principle only</em>,<br />\na sandbox attribute (with the &#8220;allow-scripts&#8221; argument), even<br />\nthought the content is generated by a plugin script and is a<br />\nknown quantity. This worked in the major browsers including the<br />\nChromium 22 and 3.[123] tested with, but Chromium 3.4 would<br />\nno longer run scripts in the iframe. Persons-of-curiosity may<br />\nweb search &#8216;chromium iframe scripts&#8217; and see at a glance that<br />\nChromium has dithered on this subject. Bottom line: the sandbox<br />\nattribute is removed. Apologies for this release so soon after<br />\n2.1 a few days ago.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Several small bug fixes and improvements.</li>\n<li>Now, by default HTML5 video will be placed as primary<br />\ncontent with flash as fallback (see settings page).</li>\n<li>Now, if the stop button is clicked the initial poster<br />\nimage, if provided, should reappear.</li>\n<li>Better handling of unsupported HTML5 video types: if<br />\nan MP4 was given it will passed to the flash player<br />\nwhen necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Video will now display in the TinyMCE &#8220;Visual&#8221; editor. This<br />\nrequires HTML5 compatible video files, and a recent and<br />\nnot-too-buggy browser (Chromium is fine on GNU/Linux, but<br />\nas on MS it might not run the script in the iframe,<br />\nbut the display is still useful; MSIE has some oddities but<br />\noverall works). The settings page has a new option to control<br />\nSWFPut video in the editor: always, only non-mobile, or<br />\nnever. If the video display feature is disabled, the<br />\nshortcode will simply appear in the editor.</li>\n<li>Overdue improvement to the video control bar: if the display<br />\nis too narrow for all buttons, then the non-essential<br />\nfullscreen and natural-scale buttons are hidden.</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous small fixes.</li>\n<li>Checked with new WordPress 3.9.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Vacated in quantum leap to ring 2 resulting from increased<br />\nenergy state induced by scale of recent changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5 video support now equals the original flash video support, and<br />\na new HTML5 video player provides an interface with the same<br />\ndesign as the flash player, and as much of the same behavior<br />\nas can be implemented with the HTML5 video specification.</li>\n<li>A new option (on the settings page) to make HTML5 video be primary<br />\ncontent, with flash video as fallback. The default is to place<br />\nflash video as primary content with HTML5 video as fallback due<br />\nto the burden HTML5 video puts on users to provide several<br />\nvideo file formats, but users who are confident in the use<br />\nof HTML5 video will find this new option preferable.</li>\n<li>It is not necessary to specify both flash and and html video<br />\nresources; either can be left out (i.e., SWFPut is no longer<br />\na flash video player first with html video as an afterthought).</li>\n<li>Incompatible change: a checkbox on the setup form to specify that<br />\nthe medium is audio, not video, has been removed. That feature<br />\nreally had no place in this plugin, and audio-only support in<br />\nthe flash player was bare-bones minimal.</li>\n<li>Interface: when a mobile browser is detected, the control bar<br />\nremoves the natural-scale and full-scale buttons, which do<br />\nnot make sense on mobile. The simpler control bar is more<br />\nappropriate and usable.</li>\n<li>Improved help under the &#8220;Help&#8221; button the editor and widgets pages.</li>\n<li>Interface: volume control slider now presents vertically on<br />\nnon-mobile, and horizontally on mobile. It now scales down<br />\nat small display sizes (previously it was clipped).</li>\n<li>The original design goal that JavaScript will not be necessary so<br />\nthat your site remains useful to visitors with scripting<br />\ndisabled has been retained, albeit with necessary qualification:<br />\nthe html video player requires JavaScript, but where scripting<br />\nis not available, the default interface and behavior for the<br />\nHTML5 video element provided by the browser will be present,<br />\nso all is not lost.</li>\n<li>The several .swf binaries for control bar sizes are gone, now<br />\na single binary simply scales the control bar (which of course<br />\nwas the original intent and meant to be among the first<br />\nupdates, but time flies like a banana).</li>\n<li>Directory and file file name changes.</li>\n<li>Bug fixes, of course.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Presentation improvements. Display should be well scaled now,<br />\nat least for themes that handle scaling; e.g., &#8216;viewport&#8217;<br />\nmeta element. This improvement should be particularly<br />\nappreciable with regard to mobile platforms (on which the<br />\ndisplay was very poor in previous versions), but desktop/notebook<br />\nmachines benefit too when the window is made small. Video<br />\nwidgets place on sidebar should now be resized to sidebar<br />\nwidth regardless of user-set dimensions, but on mobile if<br />\nsecondary content is placed below primary content (i.e.<br />\nsidebar appears below main area) video object will use<br />\navailable space up up to the dimensions set.</li>\n<li>The original description through version 1.0.6 stated that<br />\n&#8220;SWFPut does not add any JavaScript.&#8221; That is no longer<br />\nthe case. Video object size adjustments depend on JavaScript,<br />\nbut on non-mobile platforms the display does not depend on<br />\nscript, and if scripts are disabled the video objects will<br />\nbehave as they have through version 1.0.6. On mobile platforms<br />\nJavaScript is necessary because on those platforms the plugin now<br />\nbuilds the elements by script rather than putting out HTML<br />\ndirectly. (It is probably uncommon and impractical for<br />\nscripting to be disabled in mobile browsers.)</li>\n<li>There is a new input field on the setup forms, just below the<br />\ndimensions fields. This is to provide a width to use only<br />\nif a mobile browser is detected; the height is automatically<br />\nproportional, according to the regular dimensions. This might<br />\nbe useful for widgets placed on the sidebar, because the<br />\nsidebar might be placed below, rather than beside, the main<br />\ncontent. In this case more space might be available, and<br />\nlarger display might be suitable. This feature is disabled<br />\nwith a value of &#8216;0&#8217; which is the default. Experiment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added do-nothing index.php to prevent directory listing, as WP does.</li>\n<li>Made the &#8220;Screen Options&#8221; tab -&gt; &#8220;Section Introductions&#8221; checkbox<br />\nvalue persistent, if the &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; button is clicked.</li>\n<li>Style tweaks and size tweaks (admin) in response to WP 3.8 changes.</li>\n<li>Checked with WP 3.8: OK.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BUG[unimportant]: tested a defined(FOO) (rather than &#8216;FOO&#8217;),<br />\nbut PHP handles that common mistake anyway, and<br />\nit could only matter in the very exceedingly extremely unlikely<br />\ncase that a .mo translation binary for this plugin&#8217;s<br />\ntext domain has been installed under the WP&#8217;s WP_LANG_DIR.</li>\n<li>Added check for naughty direct invocation.</li>\n<li>Checked (Oct 25 2013) with just-released WP 3.7: OK.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed duplicated message on settings page update resulting from<br />\nunneeded settings_errors() call: this call did not cause a dup<br />\nfrom 3.0.1 to 3.3.1 (but was not needed either), but between<br />\nWP 3.3.1 and 3.5.? some core guard against the duplicate was<br />\nremoved (or broken?).</li>\n<li>Updated swf object element and added optional alternative<br />\nimg and video (html5) nested elements. Removed classid from<br />\nobject, except when MSIE is in user agent string. (inspired<br />\nby suggestion from aileenf).</li>\n<li>Added help tabs.</li>\n<li>Some code cleanups.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance.</li>\n<li>Put i18n final code (__() was already present), added make rules to<br />\nbuild *.mo using (added) script in new locale dir, added FPO/test<br />\nen_US.mo, confirmed working with dummy string replacement.</li>\n<li>Changed Opt* support classes to use display strings borrowed<br />\nexactly from WP (3.6) core; these classes are not tied to this<br />\nplugin and should not use its text-domain. Using core strings,<br />\nthey might still get translated (might get translated when the<br />\nplugin does not &#8212; that is deemed OK).</li>\n<li>Added is_admin() check in init code to avoid setting admin-only<br />\nhooks when not needed (and executing associated code); plus a<br />\nfew more specific current_user_can() checks.</li>\n<li>Increased maximum &#8220;attachment&#8221; queried when finding suitable<br />\nmedia files to present in posts/pages shortcode form.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrections in (vaguely distinguished)<br />\nadd_(action|filter) calls, according to tag used, checked against<br />\nWP source (whether do_action() or apply_filters() is invoked<br />\nfor the tag in question).</li>\n<li>Changed JS unescape() to decodeURIComponent().</li>\n<li>Removed compiled README.{tty,tt8} from distribution.</li>\n<li>Changed &#8216;wptexturize&#8217; to &#8216;htmlentities&#8217; for paths and things that<br />\nshould not be pretty-pretty&#8217;d.</li>\n<li>Changed &#8216;Tags:&#8217; in readme.txt (and stable, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance.</li>\n<li>Editing and corrections in readme.txt.</li>\n<li>Behavior change: without initial image (&#8216;poster&#8217;), medium is no<br />\nlonger fetched automatically (without visitor play); was a<br />\nmisfeature that would simulate an initial image by pausing<br />\nat a random point within first few seconds of the video, but<br />\nthe unsolicited download is a bad idea.

    "description": "<p>SWFPut provides &#8216;responsive&#8217; video for posts and pages.<br />\nSWFPut makes the presentation of video reliable for your<br />\nvisitors: several conditions are handled well, such as<br />\nthe uneven support for HTML5 video formats in the major<br />\nbrowsers, the possible lack of support for either HTML5<br />\nvideo or flash video in the visitor&#8217;s browser, and even<br />\nthe possiblilty that JavaScript might be disabled in your<br />\nvisitor&#8217;s browser.</p>\n<p>In addition to video for posts and pages, SWFPut provides<br />\na video widget for use in widget areas, such as a sidebar.</p>\n<p>SWFPut video is &#8216;responsive&#8217;: it should display at a<br />\nsuitable size on your visitor&#8217;s device, whether large<br />\nor small (a responsive WordPress theme is necessary).</p>\n<p>SWFPut makes video setup easy and flexible by providing<br />\nan easy dialog based setup similar to (and based on)<br />\nthat used by WordPress core media, and also an<br />\nadvanced form with additional settings, which<br />\nappears in a new &#8220;metabox&#8221;<br />\non the editor page. For widgets, the form appears with<br />\nthe usual drag and drop widget interface. After adding<br />\nvideo objects, the form will continue to be useful for<br />\nmaking changes (or, if you wish, to delete the video).</p>\n<p>In WordPress versions 3.3 and greater, video added by<br />\nSWFPut will be visible in the post/page visual editor.</p>\n<p>As many video objects as you wish can be placed in posts<br />\npages, and of course the widget supports as many instances<br />\nas you wish.<br />\nYou may specify HTML5 or flash video, or both with one<br />\nbeing primary content and the other as fallback.</p>\n<p>Here are some features of SWFPut to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>SWFPut works directly with media file<br />\nURL&#8217;s; that is, SWFPut does <em>not</em> embed<br />\nthe video players of providers such as YouTube or Vimeo.<br />\nSWFPut is for video files which are accessible by URL,<br />\nwhether hosted at your site or off-site.<br />\nThe setup form provides two media selection lists.<br />\nThe first is a selection of files found (recursively)<br />\nunder your wp-content/uploads directory. This list<br />\nhas the advantage that it does <em>not</em> use the<br />\nWordPress media library &#8212; it will find files that<br />\nyou upload &#8216;by hand&#8217; (with ftp, ssh, etc.). This feature<br />\nwill work around upload size limits that might prevent<br />\nyou from uploading large video files to the media library.<br />\nThe second is a selection of files found in the<br />\nWordPress media library and is presented with the<br />\nfile name and the &#8216;attachment id&#8217;. This refers to files<br />\nby ID, so it might be helpful if you manipulate media<br />\nand expect ID associations to be valid. Files selections<br />\nare filtered by name extension: FLV and MP4 for flash,<br />\nand MP4, OGG and OGV, and WEBM for HTML5 video.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Video resources do not need to be on your site:<br />\nany URL can be specified, so you may present players<br />\nfor off-site of 3rd party resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SWFPut does not interfere with the appearance of<br />\na site: a video is presented jsut as an image<br />\n(such as .png or .jpg) is, with the same sort of<br />\nstyle, and optional caption. The appearance of the<br />\nvideo control interface, or control bar, is simple<br />\nand quiet so it should not clash with site design.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SWFPut allows you to set the display aspect ratio<br />\nfor the video. Some video is &#8216;anamorphic&#8217; in that<br />\nthe pixel width and height do not match the intended<br />\nproportion of display width and height. You might<br />\nfilm your child&#8217;s school play as 16:9 &#8216;widescreen&#8217;<br />\nbut use a space saving feature of your recorder that<br />\nsaves the video at 480&#215;360 (which is not 16:9). You can<br />\nset SWFPut to display the video at the intended 16:9<br />\naspect ratio. You may set any aspect ratio (make it<br />\ndistorted if you wish).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The core features of the flash video player program<br />\nincluded with SWFPut have been verified to work with<br />\nthe Gnash free-software browser plugin, which is good<br />\nif you care about free/libre software users. (At the<br />\ntime of this writing, Gnash does not handle the MP4<br />\nvideo container format, so it is preferable that you<br />\nprepare flash video in the FLV container, even using the<br />\nh.264 and AAC codecs. Of course, you may use MP4 if<br />\nyou must.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The flash video player program included with SWFPut<br />\nis written and compiled with the <em>Ming</em> PHP extension,<br />\nand the code is included, so you may modify the player.<br />\nThe HTML5 player is written JavaScript, and the original,<br />\nun-minified version is included, so you may modify it.<br />\nIn fact, the zip archive available at the WordPress<br />\nrepository includes all sources, although a POSIX/Unix<br />\nenvironment with certain tools is required to build.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Localization sources are included; hopefully, polyglot<br />\nusers will help with translations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
