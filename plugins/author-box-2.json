        "installation": "<p>How to install the WordPress Author Box Reloaded plugin and get it working in an handful of steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>BE SURE THAT <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-plugin-framework-reloaded/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress Plugin Framework Reloaded</a> IS INSTALLED and active or this plugin won&#8217;t work.</li>\n<li>Upload <code>/author-box-2/</code> folder and its files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory or just use the WordPress admin interface to install it.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress (after WPFR is installed or you will get an error message).\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t forget to also activate at least one <code>Author Box &lt;something&gt; Contact</code>. See image 8 in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-box-2/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">Screenshots</a>. Should also install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/author-box-reloaded-pack/\" rel=\"ugc\">Author Box Reloaded Pack</a> with several ones already included. Those where previously included with ABR but now are a separated package. You can create your own <em>ABR Contacts</em> without too much work. Instructions are included.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Go to your Personal Profile and insert the user id for the social networks you want to have the link in Author Box Reloaded. For instance, if in Twitter your url is http://twitter.com/niceguy just use the &#8220;niceguy&#8221; part of it. It is the same procedure with the other social networks or external websites.</li>\n<li>You have also a few display options available. At least one must be set to see something on your front end. So, from the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Set the first option in the &#8220;Options Page&#8221; (Author Box R3 in <code>Users</code>) and Author Box Reloaded will appear automagically after author&#8217;s articles in single view. This is not set by default so nothing will show in your front end if you don&#8217;t do at least this.</li>\n<li>Besides this you could go to &#8220;Options Page&#8221; and set <code>Auto Display Off</code> and use one of the following options:\n<ul>\n<li>Template tag: <code>&lt;?php if (function_exists('wp_authorbox')) echo wp_authorbox(); ?&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Shortcode: [author-box-2]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You could also change the CSS to a <code>Personal</code> one</li>\n<li>You could even have the Author Box automatically in <code>Posts single view</code> and also use the other options in specific <code>Pages</code> or inserted in other <code>theme templates</code>, like an <code>author</code> theme page.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should have at least your &#8220;Contact Info&#8221; Website and/or one of the Social Networks defined or, at least, a not so short &#8220;Biographical Info&#8221;, or the CSS may be real messy.</p>\n<p>If you have <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-photo/\" rel=\"ugc\">User Photo</a>, 0.9.4 or greater, installed, a photo loaded and <code>Override Avatar with User Photo:</code> selected, it will automatically use that image instead of the Gravatar one.</p>\n<p>You can also use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-local-avatars/\" rel=\"ugc\">Simple Local Avatars</a>, 1.3.1 or greater.</p>\n<p>If you use WordPress Mu and want to add this plugin to all blogs just install it in the mu-plugins directory instead or, in more modern versions, activate it globally.</p>\n",
