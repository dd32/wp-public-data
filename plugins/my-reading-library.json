        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I change the sidebar widget and library formatting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have supplied custom templates that can be modified in order to suit your theme. Your theme&#8217;s header, sidebar, footer code may need to integrated into <code>library.php</code> and <code>single.php</code> in order for formatting to appear properly. In addition, you may need to tweak the inline css in both files and <code>sidebar.php</code> in order to get the desired results. Basic integration instructions are provided in the administrative options panel. I am available for basic theme integration for a modest fee.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How similar is this plugin to Now Reading Redux?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I used the code for Now Reading Redux as the base for my plugin; however, I&#8217;ve made so many fixes, modifications, and additions, that it has morphed into its own plugin. I plan to monitor the development of Now Reading Redux in order to evaluate whether or not to integrate additional features.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin conflict with Now Reading Redux?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve taken pains to modify this plugin in such a manner that there should be no conflicts with Now Reading Redux.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I make suggestions or request support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>http://www.affordable-techsupport.com/support/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I make a donation to the developer of this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At least 10% of donations will be given to the poor: http://www.affordable-techsupport.com/support/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
