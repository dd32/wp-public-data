You have no issue there.</p>\n<p>However, if you have an existing website where you have a lot of static files that are embedded in your posts and pages using NON-HTTPS URL then you will need to change those. Otherwise, the browser will show an SSL warning to your visitors.</p>\n<p>This plugin has an option that will allow you to force load those static files using HTTPS URL dynamically.</p>\n<p>This will help you make the webpage fully compatible with SSL.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: Do an auto redirect for the whole domain. So every URL will be redirected to the HTTPS version automatically.</li>\n<li>Actions: Do an auto redirect for a few pages. The user can enter the URLs that will be auto redirected to the HTTPS version.</li>\n<li>Force load static files (images, js, css etc) using a HTTPS URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>View more details on the <a href=\"https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/wordpress-easy-https-redirection-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HTTPS Redirection plugin</a> page.</p>\n",

If everything is done properly the admin panel will be in German.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure that there are files <code>de_DE.po</code> and <code>de_DE.mo</code> in the plugin (the folder languages in the root of the plugin).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If there are no such files it will be necessary to copy other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should write <code>de_DE</code> instead of <code>ru_RU</code> in the both files).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The files are edited with the help of the program Poedit &#8211; http://www.poedit.net/download.php &#8211; please load this program, install it, open the file with the help of this program (the required language file) and for each line in English you should write translation in German.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If everything has been done properly all the lines will be in German in the admin panel and on frontend.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
