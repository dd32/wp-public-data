I am using a third party service to render the IP address or location within the plugin. The four components I have for my plugin that allows it to dynamically change in the front end of a WordPress theme are widgets, pages and comments. These will give the reader different content based on the locations set in the administrative menu of the plugin. One limitation of this plugin is the accuracy of the smaller areas such as cities and zip codes. The third party service I am using is not able to render these locations accurately based on the information available from the visitor&#8217;s IP address. I am constantly working to improve and make additions to this plugin.</p>\n",
