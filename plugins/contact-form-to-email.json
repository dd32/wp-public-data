The first section of the reports is a filter section similar to the one that appears in the messages list page. Below the filters section there are three graphical reports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Submissions per day:</strong> The report will display in point-lines graphic how many contact form submissions have been received each day in the selected date range. This report can be used to evaluate the contact form peaks and measure the impact of marketing actions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Submissions per hour:</strong> The report will display in a point-lines graphic how many contact form messages are received on each hour of the date; this is for the total messages in the selected date range.

There is a button labeled &#8220;Export to CSV&#8221;. CSV files can be opened in Excel, just double-click the downloaded CSV file, it will contain the selected contact form submissions, one per line.</p>\n<p><strong>Deleting a contact form message:</strong> Go to the &#8220;Messages&#8221; section and use the button labeled &#8220;Delete&#8221; for the contact form message you want to delete. Each row in that list is a contact form submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Get the contact form email from the user:</strong> The email used as from is a fixed email specified on the contact form settings, this helps to prevent be classified as spam, however when you hit &#8220;reply&#8221; over the received email, the user&#8217;s email address will appear allow you to easily reply the contact form messages. The header &#8220;Reply-to&#8221; is used for this purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Customizing the captcha image:</strong> The captcha image used in the contact form is 100% implemented into the plugin, this way you don&#8217;t need to rely on third party services/servers. In addition to the settings for customizing the captcha design you can also replace the font files located into the folder &#8220;contact-form-to-email/captcha/&#8221;. The fonts are used as base for rendering the captcha on the contact form.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact form email format:</strong> The notifications emails sent from the contact form can be either plain-text emails or HTML emails. Plain text emails are preferred in most cases since are easier to edit and pass the anti-spam filters with more probability.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact form Clone button:</strong> The clone button duplicates a complete contact form with its settings.

This time is based on the server time. Some activity is needed on the website for sending the reports. You can setup a cron for a more exact delivery time.</li>\n<li><strong>Send email from:</strong> The &#8220;from&#8221; email used for the reports. Avoid @aol.com and @hotmail.com &#8220;from&#8221; addresses to skip the anti-spam filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Send to email(s):</strong> The list of emails (comma separated) that will receive the reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Email subject:</strong> Subject of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Email format?:</strong> Format of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports.

The reports will be attached in CSV format into the email.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The contact form database</h4>\n<p>The messages received via the contact form are stored into the WordPress contact form database table &#8220;wp_cftemail_messages&#8221;. You can export that data in form of automatic email reports or in CSV/Excel format from the messages list area. If needed you can also query that table directly for further processing of the contact form data.</p>\n<h4>Importing messages</h4>\n<p>There is an option to import messages into the Contact Form to Email plugin. That option is located below the messages list and is labeled &#8220;Import CSV&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The messages can be imported in a comma separated CSV file. One record per line, one field per column. Don&#8217;t use a header row with the field names.</p>\n<p>The first 3 columns into the CSV file are the time, IP address and email address, if you don&#8217;t have this information then leave the first three columns empty. After those initial columns the fields (columns) must appear in the same order than in the form.</p>\n<p>Sample format for the CSV file:</p>\n<pre><code>2013-04-21 18:50:00, 192.168.1.12, john@sample.com, \"john@sample.com\", \"sample subject\", \"sample message\"\n2013-05-16 20:49:00, 192.168.1.24, jane.smith@sample.com, \"jane.smith@sample.com\", \"other subject\", \"other message\"\n</code></pre>\n<h4>From address used for the emails</h4>\n<p>Into the &#8220;Form Processing / Email Settings&#8221; section the first settings field is named &#8220;Send email &#8220;From&#8221; and has the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From fixed email address indicated below &#8211; Recommended option:</strong>  If you select &#8220;from fixed&#8230;&#8221; the customer email address will appear in the &#8220;to&#8221; address when you hit &#8220;reply&#8221;, this is the recommended setting to avoid mail server restrictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From the email address indicated by the customer:</strong> If you select &#8220;from customer email&#8221; then the customer email will appear also visually when you receive the email, but this isn&#8217;t supported by all hosting services, so this option isn&#8217;t recommended in most cases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The drag and drop contact form builder</h4>\n<p>The Form Builder lets you to add/edit/remove fields into the contact form and also to specify the validation rules for your contact form (required fields, email fields, etc&#8230;).</p>\n<p>The following field types are currently available in the version published at this WordPress directory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single Line Text:</strong> Classic one-line text input.</li>\n<li><strong>Email:</strong> This field validates that the email address has a valid format.</li>\n<li><strong>Paragraph Text:</strong> Classic multi-line (textarea) text input.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other versions of the plugin the following field are also available: Numeric field with specific validations, Date-picker, Checkboxes, Multiple Choice Radio buttons, Dropdown / Select, Upload file fields, Password, Phone with specific validations, static texts, section breaks and page breaks for multi-page contact forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Other features in the contact form builder:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equal fields validation:</strong> Use it for example to confirm if the email or text typed in two different fields are the same. This is valid for &#8220;Single Line Text&#8221; and &#8220;Email&#8221; fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dependent fields:</strong> Use this feature for show/hide fields (any field type) based in the selection made on other fields (checkboxes, radiobuttons or select/drop-down fields). This feature isn&#8217;t fully available in this version since the related fields aren&#8217;t included.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

What is the solution?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The cause is in most cases a conflict with a third party plugin or with the theme. To fix that, go to the &#8220;troubleshoot area&#8221; (located below the list of forms in the settings area) change the &#8220;Script load method&#8221; from &#8220;Classic&#8221; to &#8220;Direct&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists after that modification please contact our support service and we will give you a solution.

Solution?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The free version must be deleted before installing the pro version.</p>\n<p>If you are uploading a new version via Plugins &#8211; New &#8211; Upload and a previous version is still installed, then delete the previous version first. This is a safe step, the plugin&#8217;s data and settings won&#8217;t be lost during the process.</p>\n<p>Another alternative is to overwrite the plugin files through a FTP connection. This is also a safe step.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20how%20to%20edit%20or%20remove%20the%20form%20title%20%2F%20header%3F'>\nQ: How to edit or remove the form title / header?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Into the form builder in the administration area, click the &#8220;Form Settings&#8221; tab.

The CSS classes are named:</p>\n<pre><code>column2\ncolumn3\ncolumn4\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example if you want to put two fields into the same horizontal line then specify for both fields the class name &#8220;column2&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20what%20means%20each%20field%20in%20the%20contact%20form%20settings%20area%3F'>\nQ: What means each field in the contact form settings area?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: For each contact form you will be able to edit the following settings:</p>\n<p><strong>Form Processing / Email Settings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Send email &#8220;From&#8221;:</strong> Indicate if the email will be sent from a fixed email address or from the email address entered by the customer.

A print button below the list provides the messages list in a printable format.</p>\n<h4>The Contact Form Reports</h4>\n<p>The reports section lets you <strong>analyze the use of the contact forms</strong> and the data entered into them. The first section of the reports is a filter section similar to the one that appears in the messages list page. Below the filters section there are three graphical reports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Submissions per day:</strong> The report will display in point-lines graphic how many contact form submissions have been received each day in the selected date range. This report can be used to evaluate the contact form peaks and measure the impact of marketing actions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Submissions per hour:</strong> The report will display in a point-lines graphic how many contact form messages are received on each hour of the date; this is for the total messages in the selected date range. This report can be used for checking peak hours and focus the support service on those hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Report of values for a selected field:</strong> Select any of the contact form fields and other information fields (like date, IP address, hours) to get a report of how many times each value have been entered or selected. This is very useful if you form is used as a poll to get feedback from users, it makes easy to generate a report on selectable contact form fields. This report can be used also to study the most common data entered in the contact form and get a better idea of your customer&#8217;s profile and needs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A print button at the end of the page can be used to print the report of the values for the selected contact form field in a printer-friendly format.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Email Reports</h4>\n<p>The Contact Form to Email plugin allows the setup of two types of automatic (periodical) Email reports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Global Email Reports:</strong> Can be setup below the list of forms. This report sends a report with the new submissions of all forms every the specified number of days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Form Email Reports:</strong> Can be setup on the settings page of each form. This report sends a report with the new submissions of the related form every the specified number of days.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reports are attached in a CSV / Excel file into the emails.

The troubleshoot area contains options to change the encoding of the plugin database tables if needed.</p>\n<p>Translations are supported through PO/MO files located in the Contact Form to Email plugin folder &#8220;languages&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Multiple translations are already included in the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Contact Form to Email Updates</h4>\n<p>New features has been published in the current Contact Form to Email version 1.2.7 based on the feedback received and we would like to thank you all the people that have supported the development, provided feedback and feature requests.

There is a button labeled &#8220;Export to CSV&#8221;. CSV files can be opened in Excel, just double-click the downloaded CSV file, it will contain the selected contact form submissions, one per line.</p>\n<p><strong>Deleting a contact form message:</strong> Go to the &#8220;Messages&#8221; section and use the button labeled &#8220;Delete&#8221; for the contact form message you want to delete. Each row in that list is a contact form submission.</p>\n<p><strong>Get the contact form email from the user:</strong> The email used as from is a fixed email specified on the contact form settings, this helps to prevent be classified as spam, however when you hit &#8220;reply&#8221; over the received email, the user&#8217;s email address will appear allow you to easily reply the contact form messages. The header &#8220;Reply-to&#8221; is used for this purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Customizing the captcha image:</strong> The captcha image used in the contact form is 100% implemented into the plugin, this way you don&#8217;t need to rely on third party services/servers. In addition to the settings for customizing the captcha design you can also replace the font files located into the folder &#8220;contact-form-to-email/captcha/&#8221;. The fonts are used as base for rendering the captcha on the contact form.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact form email format:</strong> The notifications emails sent from the contact form can be either plain-text emails or HTML emails. Plain text emails are preferred in most cases since are easier to edit and pass the anti-spam filters with more probability.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact form Clone button:</strong> The clone button duplicates a complete contact form with its settings. The contact form messages / emails and statistics aren&#8217;t duplicated.</p>\n<h4>Custom contact form submit button</h4>\n<p>There is a settings section info each form that allows to specify the label of the submit button.</p>\n<p>The class=&#8221;pbSubmit&#8221; can be used to modify the button styles.</p>\n<p>The styles can be applied into any of the CSS files of your theme or add the needed styles into the &#8220;Contact Form to Email plugin &gt;&gt; Customization area &gt;&gt; Add Custom Styles&#8221; (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of forms)</p>\n<p>For further modifications the submit button is located at the end of the file &#8220;cp-public-int.inc.php&#8221;.</p>\n<p>For general CSS styles modifications to the form and samples check this FAQ entry: https://form2email.dwbooster.com/faq#q82</p>\n<h4>Customizing the automatic email reports</h4>\n<p>The settings for the email reports (both the global and per form reports) include the following configuration fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enable Reports?:</strong> Option for enabling / disabling the reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Send report every:</strong> Indicate every how many days the reports will be sent.</li>\n<li><strong>Send after this hour (server time):</strong> Approximate time at which the reports will be sent. This time is based on the server time. Some activity is needed on the website for sending the reports. You can setup a cron for a more exact delivery time.</li>\n<li><strong>Send email from:</strong> The &#8220;from&#8221; email used for the reports. Avoid @aol.com and @hotmail.com &#8220;from&#8221; addresses to skip the anti-spam filters.</li>\n<li><strong>Send to email(s):</strong> The list of emails (comma separated) that will receive the reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Email subject:</strong> Subject of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Email format?:</strong> Format of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports. Can be HTML or Plain Text. In most cases plain text is easier to setup and has less problems with anti-spam services.</li>\n<li><strong>Email Text (CSV file will be attached):</strong> Content of the email that will contain the Contact Form to Email reports. The reports will be attached in CSV format into the email.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The contact form database</h4>\n<p>The messages received via the contact form are stored into the WordPress contact form database table &#8220;wp_cftemail_messages&#8221;. You can export that data in form of automatic email reports or in CSV/Excel format from the messages list area. If needed you can also query that table directly for further processing of the contact form data.</p>\n<h4>Importing messages</h4>\n<p>There is an option to import messages into the Contact Form to Email plugin. That option is located below the messages list and is labeled &#8220;Import CSV&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The messages can be imported in a comma separated CSV file. One record per line, one field per column. Don&#8217;t use a header row with the field names.</p>\n<p>The first 3 columns into the CSV file are the time, IP address and email address, if you don&#8217;t have this information then leave the first three columns empty. After those initial columns the fields (columns) must appear in the same order than in the form.</p>\n<p>Sample format for the CSV file:</p>\n<pre><code>2013-04-21 18:50:00, 192.168.1.12, john@sample.com, \"john@sample.com\", \"sample subject\", \"sample message\"\n2013-05-16 20:49:00, 192.168.1.24, jane.smith@sample.com, \"jane.smith@sample.com\", \"other subject\", \"other message\"\n</code></pre>\n<h4>From address used for the emails</h4>\n<p>Into the &#8220;Form Processing / Email Settings&#8221; section the first settings field is named &#8220;Send email &#8220;From&#8221; and has the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From fixed email address indicated below &#8211; Recommended option:</strong>  If you select &#8220;from fixed&#8230;&#8221; the customer email address will appear in the &#8220;to&#8221; address when you hit &#8220;reply&#8221;, this is the recommended setting to avoid mail server restrictions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>From the email address indicated by the customer:</strong> If you select &#8220;from customer email&#8221; then the customer email will appear also visually when you receive the email, but this isn&#8217;t supported by all hosting services, so this option isn&#8217;t recommended in most cases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The drag and drop contact form builder</h4>\n<p>The Form Builder lets you to add/edit/remove fields into the contact form and also to specify the validation rules for your contact form (required fields, email fields, etc&#8230;).</p>\n<p>The following field types are currently available in the version published at this WordPress directory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single Line Text:</strong> Classic one-line text input.</li>\n<li><strong>Email:</strong> This field validates that the email address has a valid format.</li>\n<li><strong>Paragraph Text:</strong> Classic multi-line (textarea) text input.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other versions of the plugin the following field are also available: Numeric field with specific validations, Date-picker, Checkboxes, Multiple Choice Radio buttons, Dropdown / Select, Upload file fields, Password, Phone with specific validations, static texts, section breaks and page breaks for multi-page contact forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Other features in the contact form builder:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equal fields validation:</strong> Use it for example to confirm if the email or text typed in two different fields are the same. This is valid for &#8220;Single Line Text&#8221; and &#8220;Email&#8221; fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dependent fields:</strong> Use this feature for show/hide fields (any field type) based in the selection made on other fields (checkboxes, radiobuttons or select/drop-down fields). This feature isn&#8217;t fully available in this version since the related fields aren&#8217;t included.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
