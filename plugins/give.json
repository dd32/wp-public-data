We suggest starting with the <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/give-101\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GiveWP 101 article</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20support%20for%20givewp%3F'>\nHow can I get support for GiveWP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We work hard to the best support possible for GiveWP. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org Support Forum</a> is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Priority support</a> is given to users who have an active license for one of GiveWP&#8217;s <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/addons\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Add-ons</a> or <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing Plans</a>. We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average 1st response time of 2 to 4 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20any%20demos%3F'>\nDo you have any demos?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We have several live examples of GiveWP and the wide variety of form options you can use with GiveWP. Check out our <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/demosite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">live demo</a>, where you can see what your donors would see.</p>\n<p>GiveWP Plus, Pro, and Agency Plan customers will also get a free 30-minute website audit with our Customer Success Team after they purchase. In this meeting, we‚Äôll cover everything you need to know about GiveWP to fit your needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20case%20studies%20of%20nonprofits%20using%20givewp%3F'>\nDo you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using GiveWP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.<br />\n&#8220;GiveWP Stories&#8221; are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented GiveWP with success. <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/stories\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">You can read them all here</a>.<br />\n&#8220;Case Studies&#8221; are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented GiveWP for a specific purpose for an organization. <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/case-studies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">You can read those here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20givewp%20better%20than%20a%20simple%20paypal%20donate%20button%3F'>\nHow is GiveWP better than a simple PayPal donate button?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PayPal donate buttons take your users off-site, which can cause you to lose some in the process. With GiveWP, your donors can stay on-site and you get the benefit of gathering donor data, viewing free fundraising reports, and creating unlimited donation forms. On the other hand, you can always use GiveWP as a simple customized PayPal donate button if you prefer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20givewp%20better%20than%20a%20form%20plugin%20for%20accepting%20donations%20through%20wordpress%3F'>\nHow is GiveWP better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like GiveWP has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a &#8220;Donate Now!&#8221; button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you&#8217;ll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins &#8212; but not with GiveWP.</p>\n<p>GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They&#8217;ll work great alongside each other.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20givewp%20better%20than%20an%20ecommerce%20plugin%20for%20accepting%20donations%20on%20wordpress%3F'>\nHow is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type in their information. You, as the site admin, don‚Äôt want to have to change the word ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù to ‚ÄúDonations‚Äù everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping, either.</p>\n<p>On top of that, customizing the plugin‚Äôs terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an ‚Äúinvoice‚Äù for the donation ‚Äúproduct‚Äù they ‚Äúpurchased.‚Äù Rather, you‚Äôd like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.</p>\n<p>Use GiveWP for donations, and let your WooCommerce or WP eCommerce plugin or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can use our <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/addon-upsells/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Donation Upsells for WooCommerce</a> GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20eliminated%20the%202%25%20fee%20on%20stripe%20donations%3F'>\nHow do I eliminated the 2% fee on Stripe donations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The 2% fee on Stripe donations only applies to donations taken via our free Stripe integration in GiveWP Core. If you purchase the premium Stripe add-on you will not have any additional fees at all. Additionally, even with the free Stripe plugin, the fees only apply to one-time donations, never to recurring donations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/version2-5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read our release announcement</a> for all the details, and if you have further questions feel free to reach out via <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our contact page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

You can also purchase add-ons to use Authorize,net, Bitpay, Square, and more.</p>\n<h3>üå± First Time Users</h3>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNRa8Dc6Ayc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>For new users, we suggest reviewing our <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/rmgettingstarted\" title=\"Visit the GiveWP Getting Started Guide\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Getting Started Guide</a> to get an understanding of how the plugin works.
