How does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After activating the plugin you don&#8217;t have to do anything else. Just head towards the Appearance -&gt; Widgets section in your admin area, and for every Widget assigned to a sidebar, you will see an extra field near the bottom on the widget options. This field will be labeled &#8220;Widget title&#8221;. If you include a title there it will show on the title bar of that specific widget upon save.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='3.%20where%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\n3.

If I fill the custom widget title field, what would happen with the regular title?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This custom title is only for the admin area, to keep everything organized and tidy. This custom title won&#8217;t show in the frontend. However, if you want to have a title in the frontend, you would do it by filling the regular &#8220;title&#8221; field of your Widget. Also, if there are cases of Widgets you don&#8217;t want them to have a custom title in the admin area, just leave the &#8220;Widget title&#8221; field blank. On these cases the title will be the default WordPress title.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
