With this behavioral report, a merchant can check the number of times a particular offer was viewed, accepted, or removed from the cart.</p>\n<p><strong>15)  WooCommerce Upsell Order Bump and Cross-sell Sales Report</strong>: With the WooCommerce Order Bump Sales Report, a merchant can track the sale of the products that were sold as a bump offer. It lets you track the sale of those products for a specific time and also enables you to track the sales as per individual products and product categories.</p>\n<p><strong>16) Major Product Types Support</strong>: The WooCommerce Order Bumps plugin comes with full compatibility with simple, variable, and subscription product types. This increases the range of product offerings that you can provide to your customers.</p>\n<p><strong>17) Enable Permalink On WooCommerce Upsell Product Title And Image</strong>: By enabling the permalink option from the Global Settings your customers can view the bump offer product in detail.
