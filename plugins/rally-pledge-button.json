        "faq": "\n<h4>What is Rally.org?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Rally.org makes it easy for individuals, groups, social causes, schools, and non-profit organizations to fundraise online. There are no time limits to your crowdfunding campaign, allowing you to raise funds indefinitely. On Rally.org, anyone can raise money for something they care about.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who can create a Rally?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anyone who wants to raise money for a cause or project and has a US or Euro bank account can create a Rally. It can be for any kind of reason â€” a personal project, a political campaign, or for a school or charity. Your organization does not need to be registered as a 501(c)3 to use Rally.org. Sign up with just your email address or through Facebook at https://rally.org/.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when a visitor on my WordPress site pledges through the Rally Pledge button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When visitors to your WordPress site decide to pledge, they are simply asked for their email addresses. Rally.org then sends them an email with a link to the Rally page you designated where they can fulfill their pledge.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do online donations work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As soon as an online fundraiser is started on Rally.org, it can immediately accept donations by all major credit cards or eCheck. All donations are built within a safe, secure, and trusted payment-processing system. The donor will receive a receipt within 24 hours of each donation, and the Rally Leader will receive an email notification each time someone donates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I accept donations from outside the United States?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Rally.org accepts international donations as long as the donation is made by MasterCard, Visa, AmEx, or Discover. At this time donations are collected in USD, so the donor will receive a receipt from Rally.org in USD and see a charge on their credit card statement converted to their country&#8217;s currency.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the minimum online donation amount that I can accept?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On Rally.org, you can accept a minimum donation of $1.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do donors see on their credit card statement?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Donors see &#8220;RALLY&#8221; listed on their credit card or bank statements.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does Rally.org make sure all financial information stays safe?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We take security seriously. Rally.org offers bank-level security, following industry-standard best practices to ensure your data and your money are safe.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
