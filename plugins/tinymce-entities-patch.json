I may release a new plugin that prevents spaces from being stripped from the beginning of lines sometime in the near future.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After a few weeks of writing posts on WordPress, I was getting very irritated when all the HTML entities I added to my examples kept being converted into characters &#8212; e.g. HTML entities like &amp;gt; &amp;lt; &amp;quot; would convert to &gt; &lt; &quot; &#8212; when I saved the post I was working on.</p>\n<p>To make matters worse, all the spaces I was using to align my coding examples would disappear when switching between &#8220;HTML&#8221; mode and &#8220;Visual&#8221; mode, even if I used the &amp;nbsp; entity.</p>\n<p>So, I finally bit the bullet and wrote this little plugin to fix these problems.  It does just two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allows you to enter HTML entities like &amp;gt; &amp;lt; &amp;amp; etc. while in &#8220;Visual&#8221; mode and they will stay put, even after you save your post.</li>\n<li>Allows you to type extra spaces while in &#8220;Visual&#8221; mode (or &amp;nbsp; in &#8220;HTML&#8221; mode) and they will stay put too, allowing you to correctly indent code samples, etc. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are writing blog posts with source code or HTML examples, you may find this little plugin helps you avoid a ton of aggravation.</p>\n<p>Works with TinyMCE and the TinyMCE Advanced plugin.</p>\n<p>Please note, this plugin is a patch for issues with WordPress&#8217;s uses of TinyMCE, and not the editor itself.</p>\n<p>If you try this plugin and like what you see, or you have questions or problems, feel free to email me at mike@englishmike.net or visit the <a href=\"http://englishmike.net/tinymceentities-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TinyMCE Entities Patch Plugin Home Page</a> with your feedback.</p>\n<p><em>(Not tested on any version of WordPress older than 2.5.1.
