        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20to%20get%20started%20with%20the%20currency%20switcher%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to get started with the Currency Switcher plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install the Currency Switcher plugin like any other WordPress plugin. Open Settings -&gt; Currency Switcher.<br />\nSelect the conversion method through Global settings and add the respective shortcodes on the desired page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20add%20a%20currency%20switcher%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nWhere can I add a currency switcher on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Currency Switcher plugin gives you a shortcode to be added. Therefore, you can add a currency switcher any place that accepts shortcodes on your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20switcher%20types%20available%3F'>\nWhat are the switcher types available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of now, the Currency Switcher plugin gives you two switcher types to choose from &#8211; A drop down or a button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20update%20the%20currency%20according%20to%20the%20latest%20exchange%20rate%3F'>\nHow to update the currency according to the latest exchange rate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Currency Switcher plugin allows you to select a feasible method to update currency. You can do it manually or opt to use the Open Exchange Rate API.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20the%20paid%20version%20of%20the%20open%20exchange%20rate%20api%3F'>\nDo I need to have the paid version of the Open Exchange Rate API?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Currency Switcher plugin works with both &#8211; the free and paid versions of Open Exchange Rate API. However, we&#8217;d recommend you to opt for the paid version since the free one has a limited number of requests that can be passed and you get conversion rates based on USD only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20round%20up%20the%20value%20in%20the%20changed%20currency%3F'>\nHow can I round up the value in the changed currency?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need not do this manually! The Currency Switcher plugin gives you an option to select the number type, where you can select whether you wish to display the value in decimals or a rounded up figure.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20affect%20the%20transactions%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill this affect the transactions on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Currency Switcher plugin is just an addon to help users get an idea of how much they&#8217;ll be spending in their currency. This has nothing to do with the transaction.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
