It has helped us to build a larger fanclub, increase engagement among visitors and allowed us to get more visits from newsletters to the website.<br />\n    &#8211; Erica Terranova, Growth Marketing Lead @ All things Commerce</p></blockquote>\n<p>Get to know your visitors and segment them on behavior- and customer data</p>\n<p>Track and identify individual customers and their visit behavior on your website. Build customer profiles progressively to identify your visitors and sync data with your CRM. Triggerbee will let you know where your visitors are coming from, what they are doing, what they are interested in &#8211; and who they are. </p>\n<p>Combine the data you have in your CRM with first-party data from Triggerbee to create audiences you have never before been able to reach on your website. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All new and unidentified visitors</strong> &#8211; Greet your new visitors with a welcome offer to nudge them into that first purchase</li>\n<li><strong>Returning Customers</strong> &#8211; Welcome returning customers back and ask them if they liked their last purchase, or if they wish to add information to their profile </li>\n<li><strong>Visitors that left their cart</strong> &#8211; Convert leaving visitors into customers with an Exit Intent offer</li>\n<li><strong>Logged-out Members</strong> &#8211; Remind logged-out members to log in to access their personal offers</li>\n<li><strong>Visitors interested in women&#8217;s clothing</strong> &#8211; Promote your current offers in women&#8217;s clothing to the visitors that are most likely to buy something in that category</li>\n<li><strong>Members with unused discount codes</strong> &#8211; Remind members with unused discounts or offers to use them when visiting your website</li>\n<li><strong>Members with upcoming birthdays</strong> &#8211; Congratulate your members with upcoming birthdays with a special offer or a simple &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; message</li>\n<li><strong>Influencer Greeting</strong> &#8211; For visitors coming to your website through an Influencer UTM-link, greet them with a personal hello from that influencer to create an omnichannel feeling</li>\n<li>.. and many more!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Triggerbee collects behaviour- and zero-party data about your customers, which is a game-changer in terms of who we can target on our website.&#8221; &#8211; Flowliferiggerbee is not just about popups, it&#8217;s much more than that. From personalizing based on behaviour to data enrichment in our other systems, which other competitors didn&#8217;t have.&#8221;<br />\n    &#8211; Flowlife</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Easily create relevant and eye-catching campaigns</h3>\n<p>Create and publish personalized offers, surveys, and forms directly to your website with our no-code editor. Browse from hundreds of templates, or build your own to fit your needs. All campaigns come in a variety of styles, layouts, and features. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acquisition Campaigns for new visitors</strong> &#8211; Acquiring new subscribers or members is the most profitable we can do as an eCommerce. Triggerbee allows you to create signup forms or promote membership through overlays and/or embedded campaigns, making it possible to capture as many new leads as possible while still being discreet when needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-launches &amp; Raffles</strong> &#8211; An effective alternative to offering discount codes upon signup is offering pre-access to an upcoming release or conducting competitions or raffles.¬†</li>\n<li><strong>Increase Login Rates</strong> &#8211; By combining data from the CRM and the Triggerbee website data, it is possible to display messages on-site to push or guide visitors to achieve desired outcomes. For instance, it is possible to promote members (CRM data) that are logged out (Triggerbee data) to log in to utilize their promotions and offers</li>\n<li><strong>Remind about unused offers and discounts</strong> &#8211; All of your customers might not see that newsletter or text message you sent about their discount. Instead, remind them when they are on your website and closer to that purchase</li>\n<li><strong>Promote current campaigns and offers</strong> &#8211; Promote ongoing campaigns onsite through embedded top panels or in bigger popups to maximize sales during the campaign period. Also, perfect timing to add a deadline component for that extra FOMO feeling. </li>\n<li><strong>Data enrichment for returning members</strong> &#8211; For returning visitors, Triggerbee can display a different message to enrich the member profile, by asking for their phone number, birthday, or favorite brand for instance. This approach will allow you to collect zero-party data, which is extremely powerful in further communication and segmentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Omni channel campaigns with UTM-targeting</strong> &#8211; For returning visitors, Triggerbee can display a different message to enrich the member profile, by asking for their phone number, birthday, or favorite brand for instance. This approach will allow you to collect zero-party data, which is extremely powerful in further communication and segmentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Gamification</strong> &#8211; prolong your marketing efforts in social media on your website by targeting visitors coming from specific UTM tags. </li>\n<li><strong>Guides</strong> &#8211; If higher engagement is important to your brand, gamification might be something to look into! Allow visitors to search for hidden eggs for easter, or spin the wheel to surprise them with a discount. Perfect for raising engagement while being creative and fun. </li>\n<li><strong>Rescue abandoned carts</strong> &#8211; An exit intent is triggered when a visitor tries to leave a website, usually when they have something in their cart already. Exit Intent campaigns can be used to offer discounts, coupons, or free shipping in order to entice the visitor to stay on the site and make a purchase. They can also be used to capture email addresses for future marketing efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Birthday Campaigns</strong> &#8211; Congratulate your members with upcoming birthdays, with a discount code or just a simple Happy Birthday! Who doesn&#8217;t love that?¬†</li>\n<li><strong>Questionnaires</strong> &#8211; With Triggerbee Surveys and multi-step Forms, it is possible to create feedback forms, questionnaires, and contact forms within minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Back in Stock</strong> &#8211; If you have a smaller collection of products and sometimes run out of¬†stock, you can allow visitors to be reminded when that product is back Triggerbee will collect a list of emails for that particular product for you to email when it&#8217;s back in stock</li>\n<li><strong>Take care of returning non-purchasers</strong> &#8211; To get new visitors to complete that first purchase is an obstacle we all need to get past. A great way of targeting that obstacle is by offering returning visitors something a little extra, like a discount or free delivery. This is especially powerful in combination with targeting interest profiles or UTM sources.¬†</li>\n<li><strong>Referral Marketing</strong> &#8211; Allow visitors to recommend your brand or specific products to their friends. </li>\n<li>And much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Triggerbee has allowed us to capture new club members and email subscribers, but also to increase the use of bonuschecks and personal offers. I like the simplicity of creating and designing campaigns in Triggerbee, and have recieved helpful advice and support from my contact person.&#8221;<br />\n    -Tiina Tauru, Online visual merchandiser @ Kicks</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Survey loyalty and customer satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Conducting <a href=\"https://help.triggerbee.com/article/526-surveys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Surveys</a> directly on the website based on behavior or audience is an easy and effective way of getting to know your customers. This allows you to improve the purchase experience and decrease any thresholds. Triggerbee allows you to build and design your surveys freely with both survey- and form elements and will present the results in a dashboard. All data that is collected via Triggerbee Forms or Surveys can easily be sent to your CRM or email tool.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NPS</strong> &#8211; The Net Promoter Score is a score that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company&#8217;s products or services to others. It is an indicator of users&#8217; overall satisfaction with your product or service and the users&#8217; loyalty to your brand. Triggerbee has a specific NPS Dashboard which will display your NPS score in real-time and historically.</li>\n<li><strong>CSAT</strong> &#8211; CSAT is used to measure how satisfied the customer is with a product, service, meeting, or your company&#8217;s service. It is a metric that is perfect for finding out what your customer thinks about a specific part of your offer. The CSAT is usually measured on a five-point scale with smileys, stars, or numbers. For the CSAT, Triggerbee has a specific dashboard that displays your CSAT score in real-time and historically.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre- and post-purchase Surveys</strong> &#8211; Other types of surveys that are common for eCommerce are about evaluating why a purchase wasn&#8217;t completed, how the visitor found the website, feedback on new designs, etc. Here are a few examples!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not a big fan of popups? Try embedded content!</h3>\n<p>When thinking about onsite messaging, most of us tend to think about popups. While the old classic popup is a great conversion tool, it is not always the best approach for your brand. Introducing &#8211; <a href=\"https://help.triggerbee.com/article/505-embedded-campaigns\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Embedded Content</a>. With Triggerbee, you can inject your campaigns into your website, instead of having them laying on top of it. Either add content or replace current content depending on who is visiting your website. Cool, huh? </p>\n<p>Simply design your campaign as you wish, and select where in your HTML to render the campaign, and we will fix the rest! This is perfect for Newsletter Forms in the footer, signup- or survey forms on specific landing pages, promotions on the PDP, and discrete top panels with your current site-wide offers. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Recruiting new members has become easier, and helped with the increase of redeeming personal offers. We are able to remind customers about their bonus checks, thus driving conversion rates within purchases as well.&#8221;<br />\n    &#8211; KICKS Marketing team </p></blockquote>\n<h3>Detailed targeting to help you reach exactly the right people at the right time</h3>\n<p>Not only does Triggerbee allow targeting based on who your visitors are, but we also target our campaigns based on where they are coming from, what they are doing, and in what order they are doing it. For instance, you can display a campaign on a specific URL for all visitors that have visited your site 3+ times in a specific geolocation, when they have something in their cart. All of this is done directly in our UI. Amazing to say the least!</p>\n<p>All Triggerbee campaigns come with this advanced website targeting and behavior-based personalization, making them highly effective for improving your subscription- and member signups as well as your sales.</p>\n<h4>Audience and website Targeting </h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CRM Targeting</strong> &#8211; reuse your already existing segments from your CRM on the website.

Triggerbee will let you know where your visitors are coming from, what they are doing, what they are interested in &#8211; and who they are. </p>\n<p>Combine the data you have in your CRM with first-party data from Triggerbee to create audiences you have never before been able to reach on your website. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All new and unidentified visitors</strong> &#8211; Greet your new visitors with a welcome offer to nudge them into that first purchase</li>\n<li><strong>Returning Customers</strong> &#8211; Welcome returning customers back and ask them if they liked their last purchase, or if they wish to add information to their profile </li>\n<li><strong>Visitors that left their cart</strong> &#8211; Convert leaving visitors into customers with an Exit Intent offer</li>\n<li><strong>Logged-out Members</strong> &#8211; Remind logged-out members to log in to access their personal offers</li>\n<li><strong>Visitors interested in women&#8217;s clothing</strong> &#8211; Promote your current offers in women&#8217;s clothing to the visitors that are most likely to buy something in that category</li>\n<li><strong>Members with unused discount codes</strong> &#8211; Remind members with unused discounts or offers to use them when visiting your website</li>\n<li><strong>Members with upcoming birthdays</strong> &#8211; Congratulate your members with upcoming birthdays with a special offer or a simple &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; message</li>\n<li><strong>Influencer Greeting</strong> &#8211; For visitors coming to your website through an Influencer UTM-link, greet them with a personal hello from that influencer to create an omnichannel feeling</li>\n<li>.. and many more!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Triggerbee collects behaviour- and zero-party data about your customers, which is a game-changer in terms of who we can target on our website.&#8221; &#8211; Flowliferiggerbee is not just about popups, it&#8217;s much more than that. From personalizing based on behaviour to data enrichment in our other systems, which other competitors didn&#8217;t have.&#8221;<br />\n    &#8211; Flowlife</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Easily create relevant and eye-catching campaigns</h3>\n<p>Create and publish personalized offers, surveys, and forms directly to your website with our no-code editor. Browse from hundreds of templates, or build your own to fit your needs. All campaigns come in a variety of styles, layouts, and features. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acquisition Campaigns for new visitors</strong> &#8211; Acquiring new subscribers or members is the most profitable we can do as an eCommerce. Triggerbee allows you to create signup forms or promote membership through overlays and/or embedded campaigns, making it possible to capture as many new leads as possible while still being discreet when needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-launches &amp; Raffles</strong> &#8211; An effective alternative to offering discount codes upon signup is offering pre-access to an upcoming release or conducting competitions or raffles.¬†</li>\n<li><strong>Increase Login Rates</strong> &#8211; By combining data from the CRM and the Triggerbee website data, it is possible to display messages on-site to push or guide visitors to achieve desired outcomes. For instance, it is possible to promote members (CRM data) that are logged out (Triggerbee data) to log in to utilize their promotions and offers</li>\n<li><strong>Remind about unused offers and discounts</strong> &#8211; All of your customers might not see that newsletter or text message you sent about their discount. Instead, remind them when they are on your website and closer to that purchase</li>\n<li><strong>Promote current campaigns and offers</strong> &#8211; Promote ongoing campaigns onsite through embedded top panels or in bigger popups to maximize sales during the campaign period. Also, perfect timing to add a deadline component for that extra FOMO feeling. </li>\n<li><strong>Data enrichment for returning members</strong> &#8211; For returning visitors, Triggerbee can display a different message to enrich the member profile, by asking for their phone number, birthday, or favorite brand for instance. This approach will allow you to collect zero-party data, which is extremely powerful in further communication and segmentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Omni channel campaigns with UTM-targeting</strong> &#8211; For returning visitors, Triggerbee can display a different message to enrich the member profile, by asking for their phone number, birthday, or favorite brand for instance. This approach will allow you to collect zero-party data, which is extremely powerful in further communication and segmentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Gamification</strong> &#8211; prolong your marketing efforts in social media on your website by targeting visitors coming from specific UTM tags. </li>\n<li><strong>Guides</strong> &#8211; If higher engagement is important to your brand, gamification might be something to look into! Allow visitors to search for hidden eggs for easter, or spin the wheel to surprise them with a discount. Perfect for raising engagement while being creative and fun. </li>\n<li><strong>Rescue abandoned carts</strong> &#8211; An exit intent is triggered when a visitor tries to leave a website, usually when they have something in their cart already. Exit Intent campaigns can be used to offer discounts, coupons, or free shipping in order to entice the visitor to stay on the site and make a purchase. They can also be used to capture email addresses for future marketing efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Birthday Campaigns</strong> &#8211; Congratulate your members with upcoming birthdays, with a discount code or just a simple Happy Birthday! Who doesn&#8217;t love that?¬†</li>\n<li><strong>Questionnaires</strong> &#8211; With Triggerbee Surveys and multi-step Forms, it is possible to create feedback forms, questionnaires, and contact forms within minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Back in Stock</strong> &#8211; If you have a smaller collection of products and sometimes run out of¬†stock, you can allow visitors to be reminded when that product is back Triggerbee will collect a list of emails for that particular product for you to email when it&#8217;s back in stock</li>\n<li><strong>Take care of returning non-purchasers</strong> &#8211; To get new visitors to complete that first purchase is an obstacle we all need to get past. A great way of targeting that obstacle is by offering returning visitors something a little extra, like a discount or free delivery. This is especially powerful in combination with targeting interest profiles or UTM sources.¬†</li>\n<li><strong>Referral Marketing</strong> &#8211; Allow visitors to recommend your brand or specific products to their friends. </li>\n<li>And much more!</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Triggerbee has allowed us to capture new club members and email subscribers, but also to increase the use of bonuschecks and personal offers. I like the simplicity of creating and designing campaigns in Triggerbee, and have recieved helpful advice and support from my contact person.&#8221;<br />\n    -Tiina Tauru, Online visual merchandiser @ Kicks</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Survey loyalty and customer satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Conducting <a href=\"https://help.triggerbee.com/article/526-surveys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Surveys</a> directly on the website based on behavior or audience is an easy and effective way of getting to know your customers. This allows you to improve the purchase experience and decrease any thresholds. Triggerbee allows you to build and design your surveys freely with both survey- and form elements and will present the results in a dashboard. All data that is collected via Triggerbee Forms or Surveys can easily be sent to your CRM or email tool.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NPS</strong> &#8211; The Net Promoter Score is a score that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company&#8217;s products or services to others. It is an indicator of users&#8217; overall satisfaction with your product or service and the users&#8217; loyalty to your brand. Triggerbee has a specific NPS Dashboard which will display your NPS score in real-time and historically.</li>\n<li><strong>CSAT</strong> &#8211; CSAT is used to measure how satisfied the customer is with a product, service, meeting, or your company&#8217;s service. It is a metric that is perfect for finding out what your customer thinks about a specific part of your offer. The CSAT is usually measured on a five-point scale with smileys, stars, or numbers. For the CSAT, Triggerbee has a specific dashboard that displays your CSAT score in real-time and historically.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre- and post-purchase Surveys</strong> &#8211; Other types of surveys that are common for eCommerce are about evaluating why a purchase wasn&#8217;t completed, how the visitor found the website, feedback on new designs, etc. Here are a few examples!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not a big fan of popups? Try embedded content!</h3>\n<p>When thinking about onsite messaging, most of us tend to think about popups. While the old classic popup is a great conversion tool, it is not always the best approach for your brand. Introducing &#8211; <a href=\"https://help.triggerbee.com/article/505-embedded-campaigns\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Embedded Content</a>. With Triggerbee, you can inject your campaigns into your website, instead of having them laying on top of it. Either add content or replace current content depending on who is visiting your website. Cool, huh? </p>\n<p>Simply design your campaign as you wish, and select where in your HTML to render the campaign, and we will fix the rest! This is perfect for Newsletter Forms in the footer, signup- or survey forms on specific landing pages, promotions on the PDP, and discrete top panels with your current site-wide offers. </p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Recruiting new members has become easier, and helped with the increase of redeeming personal offers. We are able to remind customers about their bonus checks, thus driving conversion rates within purchases as well.&#8221;<br />\n    &#8211; KICKS Marketing team </p></blockquote>\n<h3>Detailed targeting to help you reach exactly the right people at the right time</h3>\n<p>Not only does Triggerbee allow targeting based on who your visitors are, but we also target our campaigns based on where they are coming from, what they are doing, and in what order they are doing it. For instance, you can display a campaign on a specific URL for all visitors that have visited your site 3+ times in a specific geolocation, when they have something in their cart. All of this is done directly in our UI. Amazing to say the least!</p>\n<p>All Triggerbee campaigns come with this advanced website targeting and behavior-based personalization, making them highly effective for improving your subscription- and member signups as well as your sales.</p>\n<h4>Audience and website Targeting </h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CRM Targeting</strong> &#8211; reuse your already existing segments from your CRM on the website.
