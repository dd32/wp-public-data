        "faq": "\n<h4>\nThis plugin doesn&#8217;t appear to do anything?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As the name implies, your BuddyPress website must have some code that registers one or more <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/developer/member-types/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">member types</a>. Moreover, you must <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-allow-user-registration-on-your-wordpress-site/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">allow user registrations on your WordPress website</a>. If either of these conditions are not met, the plugin doesn&#8217;t have anything to do!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI have enabled &#8220;Allow multiple member types&#8221; but newly registered users still only appear to have one member type?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, BuddyPress&#8217;s default user interface only displays the very first member type assigned to a user, even though plugin and theme code can detect multiple member types assigned to a single user. This is a known issue and is currently being worked on, but it&#8217;s being done on a volunteer basis.
