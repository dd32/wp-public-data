This plugin works like a charm.<br />\nHighly Recommended!&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-5590/\" rel=\"ugc\">daniyalahmedk</a></p>\n<p>Over 70% of the visitors find the site, stay for a while, leave and never return back. Generate an email list or collect phone numbers so you can get those users back by sending emails whenever you write an informative post, share ideas, promote products, deals offering and you know the rest ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<h3>Benefits of using WPOptin plugin</h3>\n<h3>Collect emails</h3>\n<p>Display optin form to collect emails to grow your subscribers list by 10x using non-intrusive top bar on your site.</p>\n<h3>Get Phone Calls</h3>\n<p>Display call now button to get collect phone numbers and get leads at the top of your site using top bar.</p>\n<h3>Sales, promotions and discount offers</h3>\n<p>Promote the special offers on sales occasions like HalloWeen or New Year by giving discounts and perks. Plus add a countdown timer to increase the conversion.</p>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p>Display important announcements and latest news on your site to keep your users aware and engage.</p>\n<h3>Social Traffic</h3>\n<p>Get 10x more likes for site page, current page or Facebook fan page by displaying the Facebook like button or like box (page plugin).</p>\n<h3>What makes this different?</h3>\n<p>This has the simplest UI, goals based flow to keep you on track, and achieve the goal faster than every. A customizer compatible to allow you customize the layout and look and feel without guessing in real time. Something I take pride to introduce in the plugin by first introducing in our Floating Links plugin. Yes, you might have seen it in themes but not in plugin.</p>\n<h3>Want to share an important announcement with your visitors?</h3>\n<p>You can use this plugin to share an update about latest corona virus pandemic. For example let them know that due to COVI-19 you are operating your business from home.</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<p>The days long passed when having a site was enough. Now, you need the right tool to attract, engage and convert your visitors into loyal subscribers and profitable customrers.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I developed WPOptin, the simplest, most beginner-friendly yet powerful plugin for WordPress to capture leads, subscribers, phone calls, sell more and increase social traffic with like button. By the same author of the most popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-facebook-likebox\" rel=\"ugc\">Easy Social Feed</a> plugin with over 100,000+ active install and overall 5 star rating to add like box and display custom feed from Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>I have worked on this plugin for two years to make it beginner friendly and divided modules into goals so you can set goals and achieve those. Yes, I know it is yet not perfect but itâ€™s an open source and any feedback, suggestions and contribution is more than welcome.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>Sajid Javed</p>\n",

This plugin works like a charm.<br />\nHighly Recommended!&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-5590/\" rel=\"ugc\">daniyalahmedk</a></p>\n<p>Over 70% of the visitors find the site, stay for a while, leave and never return back. Generate an email list or collect phone numbers so you can get those users back by sending emails whenever you write an informative post, share ideas, promote products, deals offering and you know the rest ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<h3>Benefits of using WPOptin plugin</h3>\n<h3>Collect emails</h3>\n<p>Display optin form to collect emails to grow your subscribers list by 10x using non-intrusive top bar on your site.</p>\n<h3>Get Phone Calls</h3>\n<p>Display call now button to get collect phone numbers and get leads at the top of your site using top bar.</p>\n<h3>Sales, promotions and discount offers</h3>\n<p>Promote the special offers on sales occasions like HalloWeen or New Year by giving discounts and perks. Plus add a countdown timer to increase the conversion.</p>\n<h3>Announcement</h3>\n<p>Display important announcements and latest news on your site to keep your users aware and engage.</p>\n<h3>Social Traffic</h3>\n<p>Get 10x more likes for site page, current page or Facebook fan page by displaying the Facebook like button or like box (page plugin).</p>\n<h3>What makes this different?</h3>\n<p>This has the simplest UI, goals based flow to keep you on track, and achieve the goal faster than every. A customizer compatible to allow you customize the layout and look and feel without guessing in real time. Something I take pride to introduce in the plugin by first introducing in our Floating Links plugin. Yes, you might have seen it in themes but not in plugin.</p>\n<h3>Want to share an important announcement with your visitors?</h3>\n<p>You can use this plugin to share an update about latest corona virus pandemic. For example let them know that due to COVI-19 you are operating your business from home.</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<p>The days long passed when having a site was enough. Now, you need the right tool to attract, engage and convert your visitors into loyal subscribers and profitable customrers.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I developed WPOptin, the simplest, most beginner-friendly yet powerful plugin for WordPress to capture leads, subscribers, phone calls, sell more and increase social traffic with like button. By the same author of the most popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-facebook-likebox\" rel=\"ugc\">Easy Social Feed</a> plugin with over 100,000+ active install and overall 5 star rating to add like box and display custom feed from Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>I have worked on this plugin for two years to make it beginner friendly and divided modules into goals so you can set goals and achieve those. Yes, I know it is yet not perfect but itâ€™s an open source and any feedback, suggestions and contribution is more than welcome.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>Sajid Javed</p>\n",
