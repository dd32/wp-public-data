        "description": "<p>Get more and only top reviews from your customers WHEREVER YOU WANT. Google Reviews, Yelp Reviews, Facebook.. Sent them wherever you want while filtering critical voices.</p>\n<p>You read that right. This plugin allows you to generate a maximum of 5 star reviews without risking negative ones. And yes, DIRECTLY on Google, Yelp &amp; Co. Pure marketing gold.</p>\n<h4>Company or agency? Then watch video to get more 5 stars ratings</h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbbFJZGJLBA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>How does review building usually work?</h3>\n<p>When you collect reviews, you link to your business page and hope for 5 stars. If a customer doesn&#8217;t look 100% happy, you won&#8217;t risk asking for a review. This uncertainty leads to few evaluations. Negative reviews still come and drag down the average.</p>\n<h3>What does this plugin do to build Google Reviews easy?</h3>\n<p>It works like a bouncer and only shows satisfied customers the link to Google, Yelp, etc. To do this, it creates a subpage on your website where a review is requested in advance. People who give 5 stars will see links to Google, Yelp, etc. Anyone who gives a bad rating will instead be shown a comment box asking for feedback.</p>\n<p>So instead of directly linking to your business page, you can sent customers to the subpage and stop worrying. Now you can give the link to ANY customer and therefore get 5 star reviews much more often.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7Wq4QR1RQg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Since 2021, RRatingg is the only WordPress plugin that implements a rating funnel with a large number of interfaces to other programs. It generates more and better 5-star reviews and supports the Google Customer Survey. Connections to Google My Business, ProvenExpert, TrustedShops and much more is available in the rating system.</p>\n<h3>More &amp; Better Google Reviews, Ratings and 5 Stars for your business</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You have the fully automated options to ask your satisfied customers to rate and your dissatisfied customers to provide feedback.</li>\n<li>Your customers are automatically prompted for feedback, which means you get significantly more reviews. All that without you having to invest any time.</li>\n<li>Import your contacts from different platforms (Zapier, CRM, CSV, &#8230;) into the rating plugin and send them on different platforms (Google My Business, Facebook, TrustedShops, flexible plattforms, &#8230;).</li>\n<li>You will receive a clear strategy with which you will gain new ratings every day. This is how you will become a customer magnet and the top provider in your industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WHY TO USE OUR RATING PLUGIN</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Better Conversion-Rate</li>\n<li>Better CTR</li>\n<li>Less trouble</li>\n<li>You don&#8217;t have to beg for reviews</li>\n<li>Higher stars rating rates</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>HOW REVIEW GENERATION WORKS</h3>\n<h4>1a Invitation</h4>\n<p>After the service has been provided, your customers are requested by e-mail to submit an internal evaluation. If a customer does not comply with this request, he can be reminded again after a period of time of your choice.</p>\n<h4>1b public feedback</h4>\n<p>Anytime your customers can click on the public funnel link to submit an internal evaluation. If a customer does not comply with this request, he is NOT reminded again after a period of time of your choice.</p>\n<h4>2a Negative feedback</h4>\n<p>After leaving negative feedback, dissatisfied customers are navigated to a form to describe their problem. This feedback remains internal and does not influence your public rating score. A reminder function is also possible here if the customer does not provide a more detailed description of the problem.</p>\n<h4>2b Positive feedback</h4>\n<p>In the next step, satisfied customers are invited to submit a public rating. There are several ways to do this, which are pointed out to the customer. There is also a reminder function here if the customer does not provide feedback.</p>\n<h4>Google Ads Stars Rating</h4>\n<p>In both cases, the Google customer survey can be conducted for Google Ads stars.</p>\n<h4>3 Result</h4>\n<p>With our system you generate an above-average evaluation score, which increases your sales and your customer proximity and sets you apart from your competitors. You can even turn negative feedback from your customers positive by systematically improving the points mentioned. In the long run, this will make it even easier for you to gain additional positive reviews that represent your company.</p>\n<h3>Free-Plan-Features: Many options for building Google Reviews</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 stars rating funnel</li>\n<li>1 custom rating link for Facebook Reviews, Google Reviews etc.</li>\n<li>Form for adding contacts</li>\n<li>Invitation email to the rating funnel</li>\n<li>Control the contacts for rating invitation and feedback generation.</li>\n<li>Choose between 1 to 5 stars or icons, such as thumbs up/down</li>\n<li>50 invitations in the first month, 10 per month thereafter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Trial &amp; Premium-Features: Advanced options for building Google Reviews</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited number of rating funnels: Use different funnels for different products or services</li>\n<li>2 custom rating links: for Facebook, ProvenExpert, etc.</li>\n<li>Bulk CSV import: import all your contacts with just a few clicks</li>\n<li>Interfaces / API</li>\n<li>Contact import for Zapier, etc.: Automatically add your contacts from different CRMs or stores to your rating funnel via interface / API &amp; Zapier.</li>\n<li>Reminder emails for invitations, ratings and feedback: Achieve a higher rating rate with tag-based reminder emails.</li>\n<li>Contact import via interface / API: Easy installation with video tutorials</li>\n<li>Reminder emails with direct links to review platforms: Achieve higher review rates due to fewer clicks for the customer</li>\n<li>Negative feedback disables rating redirection: You can disable the rating redirection on the last page of the funnel</li>\n<li>Google customer reviews for stars on Google search ads: The cheapest way to add star ratings to your Google search ads</li>\n<li>Trusted Shops connection for store and product ratings</li>\n<li>In the free trial phase: 100 rating invitations (including free version), then 10 requests in the free version per month</li>\n<li>Premium: Unlimited review requests: invite your customers to the funnel every day and enjoy many reviews</li>\n<li>5 Stars Rating Premium support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://rratingg.tawk.help/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Do your support requests and ideas here in tickets please.</a><br />\nKB will be updated on more FAQs.</p>\n",

If a customer does not comply with this request, he can be reminded again after a period of time of your choice.</p>\n<h4>1b public feedback</h4>\n<p>Anytime your customers can click on the public funnel link to submit an internal evaluation. If a customer does not comply with this request, he is NOT reminded again after a period of time of your choice.</p>\n<h4>2a Negative feedback</h4>\n<p>After leaving negative feedback, dissatisfied customers are navigated to a form to describe their problem. This feedback remains internal and does not influence your public rating score. A reminder function is also possible here if the customer does not provide a more detailed description of the problem.</p>\n<h4>2b Positive feedback</h4>\n<p>In the next step, satisfied customers are invited to submit a public rating. There are several ways to do this, which are pointed out to the customer. There is also a reminder function here if the customer does not provide feedback.</p>\n<h4>Google Ads Stars Rating</h4>\n<p>In both cases, the Google customer survey can be conducted for Google Ads stars.</p>\n<h4>3 Result</h4>\n<p>With our system you generate an above-average evaluation score, which increases your sales and your customer proximity and sets you apart from your competitors. You can even turn negative feedback from your customers positive by systematically improving the points mentioned.
