(so you don&#8217;t have to manually track and remove orphan files left on your server)</p>\n<h3>Important Considerations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A soft delete that places your post, page, or custom post type in Trash will not trigger the removal of its child attachments.

        "installation": "<h3>Automatic Installation</h3>\n<p>The automatic installation is the easiest option to install a plugin as WordPress handles the file transfers itself. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress dashboard and follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8220;Add New&#8221;</li>\n<li>In the search field type &#8220;Autoremove Attachments&#8221; and click &#8220;Search Plugins&#8221;</li>\n<li>Once you have found the plugin install it by clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;</li>\n<li>Activate &#8220;Autoremove Attachments&#8221; from the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Manual Installation</h3>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it on your server via SFTP. To do a manual install follow the steps below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin to your local computer</li>\n<li>If downloaded as a zip archive extract it to your Desktop</li>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate &#8220;Autoremove Attachments&#8221; from the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20with%20custom%20post%20types%3F'>\nDoes it work with custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. It works with posts, pages and custom post types. All child attachments are removed when the parent is deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20are%20the%20attachments%20removed%3F'>\nWhen are the attachments removed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The files are removed when the parent post, page, or custom post type is permanently removed. A soft delete that places it in Trash will not trigger the removal of your attachments.</p>\n<p>The purge happens when you empty your trash.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20control%20what%20attachments%20are%20removed%3F'>\nCan I control what attachments are removed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. By default, all media files attached to a post, page or custom post type are removed automatically. If you need granular control you can use the filter <code>autoremove_attachments_allowed</code> to define custom rules for controlling when the child attachments should be removed automatically.</p>\n<p>Here is an example on how you can remove the attachments only for specific custom post types:</p>\n<pre><code>function autoremove_attachments_custom_rule() {\n    // Global variables.\n    global $post_id;\n\n    // Variables.\n    $post_type          = get_post_type( $post_id );\n    $allowed_post_types = array(\n        'project',\n        'product',\n    );\n\n    // Default return value.\n    $allowed_to_remove = false;\n\n\n\n    // Custom rules for removing attachments.\n    if ( in_array( $post_type, $allowed_post_types ) ) {\n        $allowed_to_remove = true;\n    }\n\n\n\n    // Return.\n    return $allowed_to_remove;\n}\nadd_filter( 'autoremove_attachments_allowed', 'autoremove_attachments_custom_rule' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>The returned value should be true for the cases in which you want the attachments removed. (false otherwise)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20restrictions%20on%20how%20i%20can%20use%20my%20attachments%3F'>\nAre there any restrictions on how I can use my attachments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depending on how you use the plugin, the answer can be either yes, or no.</p>\n<p>If you keep the plugin running with the additional checks enabled, you have no restrictions on how you can use your attachments. (you can use your media files in multiple locations, without the fear of broken links caused by their removal)</p>\n<p>If you disable the additional checks, you need to make sure you don&#8217;t reuse your media files between posts. If you do and the parent is deleted, you will end up with broken links in all the other locations where the removed attachments were used.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how you use the plugin, if you need to use an attachment over and over again, upload it from the global Media Library menu. ( Media &gt; Add New ) This way, it won&#8217;t be attached as a child to a specific post, page, or custom post type and you will be able to use it without restrictions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
