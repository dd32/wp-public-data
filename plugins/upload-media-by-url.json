        "faq": "<p>Q: Is this plugin free?<br />\nA: Yes, there is no charge to use this plugin.</p>\n<p>Q: Does UMBU change the way files are uploaded?<br />\nA: The plugin does not alter images in any way and only uses the natural functions built into WordPress to download files and insert them into the media gallery.</p>\n<p>Q: How many URLs can I add?<br />\nA: You could probably add as many URLs as you wish, but it is best to keep the limits of about 20 URLs at a time.</p>\n<p>Q: Why did you create this plugin?<br />\nA: To save time. While you can go to a post and add your media by a URL, you can only do a single URL and it will be inserted &#8220;as is&#8221; into your post meaning it will use whatever URL you copied.</p>\n<p>With this plugin, you can go directly to the media library and add as many URLs as you want to add them into the media library.</p>\n<p>Q: How do I use this plugin?<br />\nA: The location of the button is on the Media Library screen.</p>\n<p>Q: Why are some images not added into the media gallery?<br />\nA: UMBU uses a WordPress native download function and may not allow or recognize the file is an image file.</p>\n",
