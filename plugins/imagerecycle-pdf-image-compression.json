Image and PDF optimization is more efficient than any other optimization tool.<br />\nImages can represent from 60% to 80% of a page weight, so an optimization can accelerate your page loading by x3 or more.</p>\n<h3>WORDPRESS IMAGE AND PDF COMPRESSION</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s highly important in WordPress to make an image optimization because when you upload an image, 4 images are generated and stored on your server: a thumbnail, medium, large and original sized images.<br />\nEven more, some plugin can add their own image size for specific layouts like WooCommerce.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20pdf%20image%20optimization%20process%2C%20where%20are%20going%20my%20media%3F'>\nWhat is the pdf image optimization process, where are going my media?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will send your media on our cloud optimizer, then replace the original image with the optimized image.<br />\nOur server is a dedicated high-speed server that host the optimization algorithm.<br />\nLike some others plugin we don&#8217;t do any optimization process on YOUR server, it would be either not very efficient or it would slow down a lot your server.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20a%20backup%20of%20my%20image%20and%20pdf%3F'>\nDo I have a backup of my image and PDF?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we keep a backup of your original files during one month on a dedicated storage server. You can revert your original files in one click during this month.<br />\nLike some others plugin we don&#8217;t use YOUR server to do backup, it slow down your website and charge your server with unnecessary media.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='should%20i%20select%20best%20saving%20or%20original%20quality%20to%20optimize%20my%20media%3F'>\nShould I select best saving or original quality to optimize my media?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on the compression you need. Best saving has a better compression level than lossless compression.<br />\nThe resulting image is not 100% identical with the original even if most of the time it&#8217;s not visible.<br />\nGlobally use Best saving for a final usage of your image and Original quality if you&#8217;ve planned to make treatment later images (with Photoshop for example).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20want%20to%20optimize%20all%20my%20media%20or%20not%20at%20the%20same%20quality'>\nI don&#8217;t want to optimize all my media or not at the same quality\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can exclude some media from optimization with a server folder exclusion. Plus, each media optimization has a setting of quality of compression.<br />\n* JPG image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression<br />\n* PNG image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression<br />\n* GIF image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression<br />\n* PDF image optimization: Best saving (lossy), Original quality (lossless), No compression</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20test%20the%20service%3F'>\nCan I test the service?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there a trial version during 15 days for 100MB of media optimization available. Just register an account from the plugin after install and start image optimization.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20service%20on%20multiple%20site%3F'>\nCan I use the service on multiple site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible of course and there&#8217;s a special tool for that.<br />\nTo make image optimization you got a main account with a key and secret. From the website you can create free and unlimited sub accounts with, if you want, a limited quota.<br />\nOr you can just use your main account key and secret on all your website, it&#8217;s up to you ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20an%20api%20key%3F'>\nWhy do I need an API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ImageRecycle Image and PDF Optimizer uses advanced algorithm to optimize images. The algorithm is hosted on a high-speed dedicated server.<br />\nThe API key and secret are like a login that control that you are allowed to use this server.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20get%20my%20api%20key%3F'>\nWhere do I get my API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To get your API key, just create a free account from the plugin (key is added automatically) or create one from www.imagerecycle.com.<br />\nAfter a key and secret are added image optimization can start and available quota is displayed in Setting &gt; ImageRecycle menu</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20my%20images%20safe%3F'>\nAre my images safe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, privacy is a priority. The ImageRecycle server encryption doesn&#8217;t allow anyone to access your media.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20imagerecycle%20optimization%20work%20if%20my%20website%20is%20using%20a%20cdn%20%28like%20cloudfare%20or%20maxcdn%29%3F'>\nWill ImageRecycle optimization work if my website is using a CDN (like CloudFare or Maxcdn)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the pdf &amp; image optimization will be done without interfering with the CDN.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20imagerecycle%20optimization%20work%20with%20wordpress%20cache%20plugins%3F'>\nWill ImageRecycle optimization work with WordPress cache plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, and it&#8217;s even recommended to use one to speed up even more your WordPress install!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
