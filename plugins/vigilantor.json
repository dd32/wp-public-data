        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does this plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin detects Tor users by using a pre-downloaded list of Tor IP addresses.  One nice thing about the Tor network is that it is very easy to get lists of IP addresses that allow Tor users to access the internet.</p>\n<p>When a user visits your site and tries to perform one of the restricted actions, their IP is checked against the list of known Tor exit IP addresses.  If it&#8217;s a match, they won&#8217;t be allowed to do what they were trying to do.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20the%20exit%20lists%20come%20from%3F'>\nWhere do the exit lists come from?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Exit lists are served from these domains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>www2.openinternet.io</li>\n<li>openinternet.io</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of these lists is maintained by us.  You can see the contents <a href=\"https://www2.openinternet.io/tor/tor-exit-list.txt\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.  Please be kind if you choose to use it for purposes other than this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20are%20the%20exit%20lists%20updated%3F'>\nHow often are the exit lists updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose to update the exit lists every 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, or 360 minutes. Updating every 30 or 60 minutes is recommended.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20real%20time%20checking%20work%3F'>\nHow does the real time checking work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The real-time checking is very fast since it uses the public <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/tordnsel.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tor DNS exit list service</a> run by the Tor project.  A small DNS request is sent that contains the visitor&#8217;s IP address which is compared to a list of observed exit relays.</p>\n<p>The DNS request will yield a positive response from the service if the criteria matches.  Since DNS uses UDP and the packets are small, this is typically a fast and efficient way to perform the check.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20captcha%20protection%20work%3F'>\nHow does the CAPTCHA protection work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to use the optional CAPTCHA protection, first install the &#8220;hCaptcha for WordPress&#8221; plugin and enable the &#8220;Block Tor users from all of WordPress&#8221; configuration option in VigilanTor.</p>\n<p>When a Tor user visits your site, they will be presented with a CAPTCHA challenge.  After correctly solving the CAPTCHA, a session cookie will be set in the browser containing a secret token (stored in the WP database) that bypasses the Tor blocking.  The cookie is saved in the database for 1 hour, and it&#8217;s value is changed on each visit to prevent the cookie from being used by multiple browsers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20php%20version%20does%20vigilantor%20require%3F'>\nWhat PHP version does VigilanTor require?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>VigilanTor should work with PHP 5.6 or greater. It has been tested on PHP 5.6, 7.0 &#8211; 7.4, and 8.0. If you run into any problems, please <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/vigilantor\" rel=\"ugc\">report them here</a>. This plugin is <em>not</em> compatible with any PHP 4 version!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
