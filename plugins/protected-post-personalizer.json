        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>protected-post-personalizer.php</code> to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>In the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu click &#8216;Protected Posts Personalizer&#8217; and change any text you want, then click Save Changes.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Does this change the way WordPress handles passwords?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at all. This plugin is specifically for changing how password-protected and private posts are displayed. Changing these will not affect the password system at all.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I only want to change one thing and nothing else?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s fine. All plugin defaults are WordPress defaults. If you install it and don&#8217;t change the values, nothing will appear different.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can anything go in the &#8216;Assign ID, Class, or Inline Styles&#8217; box?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tecnically, yes. This option inserts text <em>directly</em> into the &lt;p&gt; tag of the password form. That means that, while you <em>could</em> put anything in there, if you put something which is invalid HTML or XHTML odd things will probably happen. Additionally, you&#8217;re site won&#8217;t <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">validate</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to keep the default post previews, but also want to use a customized password form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No can do. Because the text of the  custom password form relies on having a custom function to call it, you must use one of the &#8216;custom&#8217; options. It&#8217;s practically the same thing. Is it that important to tell visitors &#8220;There is no excerpt because this post is password protected&#8221;? Because, in fact, that&#8217;s the only difference.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Neato! But I was really hoping for a protected post plugin that would do&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please, please do submit any ideas for the future at the <a href=\"http://glot.homepie.org/plugins/protected-post-personalizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin&#8217;s homepage</a>. If you can think them and I can program them, we&#8217;ve got ourselves a new feature.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
