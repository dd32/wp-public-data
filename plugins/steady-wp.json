        "description": "<h4>Earn money with your blog or podcast</h4>\n<p>Steady enables readers and listeners to support the projects they cannot do without, by becoming members.</p>\n<p>Members offer sustainable support for projects and personalities, not because they have to, but because they want to. Members are more loyal and committed than subscribers. And members liberate media. Join the membership revolution!</p>\n<h4>Steady Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Recurring payments:</strong> Your members support you with monthly or annual payments (for example, 3 EUR per month). You can offer a range of price levels and set the prices to best suit your project.</li>\n<li><strong>Goals:</strong> Set financial goals to help spur potential members into action.</li>\n<li><strong>Paywall:</strong> With just a few clicks you can set up a paywall to protect members-only content.</li>\n<li><strong>Adblock Detection:</strong> Are your readers using ad-blockers? Steady enables you to present them with a friendly, customizable prompt to say that an ad-blocker has been detected and suggest they sign-up as a member.</li>\n<li><strong>Full service:</strong> Steady takes care of billing and taxation. You receive your money once a month.</li>\n<li><strong>All major payment methods:</strong> Direct debit, credit card or PayPal.</li>\n<li><strong>No strings attached:</strong> Steady takes a 10% commission, but only once you start earning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Memberships with Paywall Plugin</h4>\n<p>The Steady Paywall is an easy-to-integrate tool that displays content to members only. If you want to restrict access to certain content and encourage visitors to become paying members, the Steady Paywall is the ideal tool to use. It takes just minutes to integrate into your website, is easy to configure (no programming skills required!) and is compatible with most desktop browsers and mobile devices.</p>\n<h4>Need a Paywall? Steady can help!</h4>\n<p>Set up a paywall for your WordPress Blog by installing the Steady WordPress Plugin. You can decide when and how to restrict content in each article. All you need to do is click the Steady Button in your WordPress editor at your preferred starting point. Steady will then blur out the remaining content and display a preconfigured message. The Paywall directs visitors to your Steady page, where they can select one of your membership plans. The Steady WordPress Paywall is a simple and straightforward way to protect your premium content for paying members only. And there’s no need to integrate payment providers: Steady takes care of that, too.</p>\n<h4>Adblock Detection</h4>\n<p>Adblock Detection is an additional feature that can be combined with the Steady Paywall Plugin. Adblock Detection helps you benefit from visitors who are avoiding advertising, by creating an opportunity to suggest they become a member, instead. Steady’s AdBlock Detection recognizes when visitors to your website are using ad-blocker software and displays a message which you can customize yourself. You can also set the strength of your adwall – can visitors simply click to close the message, or must they always pay to read? It’s up to you.</p>\n",
