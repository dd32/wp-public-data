        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20break%20my%20database%3F'>\nWill this plugin break my database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. AAL does not change database at all, links are changed on-the-fly. It case you are in doubt, just disable AAL, everything will be just as it was before.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill it slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. AAL does not add any scripts, styles or any other files. It just changes a piece of text(link) to other text(link). This is really-really fast. You will not be able to notice the difference when it&#8217;s enabled or disabled speed-wise.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20php%20version%20is%20required%3F'>\nWhat PHP version is required?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AAL requires at least PHP 5.3 or higher to work. That is a very old version of PHP, you should be using PHP 7+, or at least PHP 5.6 anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='something%20is%20not%20right%20%2F%20i%27m%20not%20sure%2C%20what%20do%20i%20do%3F'>\nSomething is not right / I&#8217;m not sure, what do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just disable AAL plugin, everything will be just as it was before you enabled it. No changes to your site was made.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20enabled%20aal%2C%20but%20my%20affiliate%20links%20are%20still%20broken'>\nI have enabled AAL, but my affiliate links are still broken\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you are using the latest version of AAL, update your plugin.<br />\nIf issue remains, please contact us, we will investigate and release an update.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20links%20are%20being%20changed%3F'>\nWhat links are being changed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin only changes AMarkets affiliate links.<br />\nCurrently it changes old affiliate links aforex.ru, amarkets.org, amarkets.biz, amarkets.info to https://afinance.pro/fx/, while preserving your promocode.<br />\nWhen we discover more broken links, we release updates to this plugin to always keep you covered.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
