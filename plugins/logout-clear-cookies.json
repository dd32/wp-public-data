This is a standard part of every browser&#8217;s security model! It would be a huge security flaw if your browser allowed a website to view, set or clear the cookies used by another website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20redirect%20to%20the%20site%20homepage%20after%20logout%20instead%20of%20back%20to%20the%20admin%20console%20login%20page%20%28%60wp-login.php%60%29%3F'>\nWhy redirect to the site homepage after logout instead of back to the admin console login page (`wp-login.php`)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because the admin console login page actually sets a new cookie when your browser loads it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
