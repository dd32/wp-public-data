        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20chatbot%20the%20same%20as%20chatgpt%3F'>\nIs ChatBot the same as ChatGPT?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ChatBot is an autonomous solution without dependencies on third-party providers like OpenAI (ChatGPT). ChatBot is a platform dedicated to creating customer service chatbots for businesses, while ChatGPT is a universal generative AI service, and using it for customer service requires integration with an additional chat widget interface via OpenAI API. ChatGPT canâ€™t be easily trained for specific business needs, as it requires advanced technical knowledge. In addition, ChatGPT canâ€™t be trained exclusively on the provided data, and that means that the accuracy of provided answers canâ€™t be guaranteed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20chatbot%20account%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need a ChatBot account to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes â€“ you can create your ChatBot account <a href=\"https://accounts.chatbot.com/signup?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=integration&amp;utm_campaign=wordpress_listing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20a%20free%20trial%3F'>\nDo you offer a free trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can test all of the features of our ChatBot software for 14 days.
