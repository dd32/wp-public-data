By reducing unnecessary features, librarians are able to quickly record sessions and get statistical reports easily.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about resource scheduling? Or .ics files? Or attaching instructional materials? Or making me a cup of coffee?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now there are no plans for major enhancements to LIR.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How/Where should I report problems?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can submit issue tickets to our <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/gsulibwebmaster/library-instruction-recorder/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bitbucket issue tracker</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
