        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>You should have some form of XSL support included in your PHP installation. If you are using any version of PHP above 5 you don&#8217;t need to worry; if you are using PHP 4 then you will need to have the <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.xslt.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">XSLT module installed</a>.</li>\n<li>Upload this directory to your plugins directory. It should create &#8216;wp-content/plugins/j-flickr/&#8217;.</li>\n<li>It is strongly advised that you make the &#8216;wp-content/plugins/j-flickr/cache&#8217; directory writable by the web server so that API query results can be cached. The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Codex contains in-depth instructions</a> on how to go about this.</li>\n<li>WordPress users should go to their Plugins page and activate &#8220;J-Flickr&#8221;.</li>\n<li>J-Flickr will not work until you have a Flickr API key. If you already have one go to Settings-&gt;J-Flickr and put it into the box. If you do not yet have a key, you can <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">apply for one</a>.</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s also probably a good idea to put in your Flickr username so that you can use the {{username}} macro in templates.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I use method x?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use any method of the Flickr API that doesn&#8217;t require authentication. Some methods make more sense than others to use, if a method doesn&#8217;t return any output then you&#8217;re using the plugin for the wrong thing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I define my own templates?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a &#8216;templates&#8217; directory within the plugin directory that contains a selection of XSL templates. The included ones are for the (what I would imagine) are the most used result sets but making your own is as easy as creating a valid XSL template and dropping it and then using it (see the Examples section).</p>\n<p>If you wish for a certain method to always use a certain template just name the template after the method sans the &#8216;flickr.&#8217; prefix, e.g. for the method &#8216;interestingness.getList&#8217; name your file &#8216;interestingness.getList.xsl&#8217;. Case sensitivity will be based on your hosts file system.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the template priority?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you define a template in the shortcode this will be used before all others, if one is not defined or the file does not exist then the plugin will search for a method template, if that doesn&#8217;t exist it will fallback to the general templates. The &#8216;photos.xsl&#8217; template is the standard and should not be deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the cache for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The cache exists to be friendly to Flickr, they&#8217;ve been awesome enough to provide a solid API so you should be friendly back to them by not hammering the service. Essentially every shortcode instance you put in your blog is an API call, if the cash didn&#8217;t exist then every request for a page with the shortcode would be an API request. So say you have 5 front page posts each with one shortcode instance, if 1000 visited in a day, thats 5000 API requests just for the homepage.</p>\n<p><strong>You are responsible for managing the number of connections and queries to the Flickr API</strong></p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is a good cache time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve set the default to be 1 day as that&#8217;s plenty of time between requests. The higher the value the better really, so if you only update your Flickr account at weekends then feel free to set it to 5 days (432,000 seconds) or longer.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
