How to fix this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is likely because either your order or your cart contains ineligible order data.  Even if your order data is valid, if your cart contains items which do not support this payment method, it will still fail and you will have to empty your cart first.  That is a WC flaw, it isn&#8217;t caused by our plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20get%20a%20critical%20error%20when%20creating%20orders%20on%20the%20mobile%20app%3F'>\nWhy do I get a critical error when creating orders on the mobile app?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have WC Pay (WooCommerce Payments) installed, disable it.  If not, read the next sentence.  The API is built on the V3 legacy API which uses the WC_API_Orders function.  Functions which attempt to hook into the order methods will malfunction.  The add_order_meta() function is one which we&#8217;ve seen does not match the same number of arguments as exists within the v3 legacy API.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20costs%20involved%3F'>\nAre there any costs involved?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a free plugin, so there are no license fees but you do have to pay your transaction fees as you would with any gateway plugin.  Transaction fees are split between us and Stripe and will be reflected as such in your Stripe account.  The pro and plus versions do have license fees required which can be found on our website at store.arcanestrategies.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20keep%20getting%20a%20generic%20api%20error%20when%20saving%20plugins%20settings'>\nI keep getting a generic API error when saving plugins settings\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This could be a number of things but more often than not it is because of the following:<br />\n(1) The plugin is not enabled (see &#8220;activate&#8221; and settings &#8220;enable&#8221; checkbox), (2) The Stripe Gateway payment method within WooCommerce is disabled OR API keys are incorrect, (3) The Stripe Gateway&#8217;s &#8220;Payment Buttons&#8221; option is disabled; in versions of Stripe Gateay 5.8+ this is also referred to as &#8220;Express Checkouts&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20other%20plugins%20are%20required%3F'>\nWhat other plugins are required?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WooCommerce and WooCommerce Stripe Gateway.

This version is intended only to provide a retail point-of-sale experience in which an authorized representative is logged in to accept credit cards.  This is both for tracking who has accepted charges as well as to prevent the public from seeing the terminal icon while remotely viewing the site.  Because of this, purchases which require customer information (such as recurring billing info or email addresses) cannot be performed as the current session contains the administrator&#8217;s information.  If you need to work around that, visit our website and purchase &#8220;Pro Services&#8221;.  If you are already a PRO Services user, verify that your user is assigned to a location. (https://www.arcanestrategies.com/products/stripe-terminal-for-woocommerce)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20your%20plugin%20work%20outside%20the%20us%3F'>\nWill your plugin work outside the US?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our plugin will support any location that Stripe supports, there&#8217;s no business logic implemented which would prevent support for our plugin in a region where Stripe Terminal is available.  As of date of this writing (January 2020), Stripe Terminal is only supported in North America (US and Canada).  Although Stripe does allow transactions overseas for cards typically used in European countries like Maestro, PIN transactions for those unsupported regions are not available.  Additionally, the readers themselves are not available for purchase outside the US.  As soon as Stripe announces support overseas, anyone who installs either of our plugins will receive notification.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20buy%20a%20reader%3F'>\nWhere can I buy a reader?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our support team will only support the readers purchased directly from Stripe.com or <a href=\"https://store.arcanestrategies.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://store.arcanestrategies.com/</a>.  These readers will not come equipped with the Stripe Terminal software pre-installed unless it&#8217;s purchased from Stripe.com which means you won&#8217;t be able to use the device with Stripe out-of-the-box, unless you buy from Stripe or lease from us.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20the%20cancel%20button%20work%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t the cancel button work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To cancel an order, hit the &#8220;esc&#8221; key on your keyboard or wait for the timeout to expire.  The Verifone P400&#8217;s action buttons (red, yellow, green) are intended to support settings, they do not cancel or edit payments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20pin%20transactions%20supported%3F'>\nAre PIN transactions supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately Stripe Terminal does not support PIN transactions but they do support debit via signature.  We spoke with Stripe and they indicated they have no plan in making PIN transactions possible as they believe that signature debit transactions is sufficient.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20getting%20an%20error%20connecting%20to%20my%20reader%3F%20%20i%20registered%20it%20without%20a%20problem%21'>\nWhy am I getting an error connecting to my reader?  I registered it without a problem!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whe you register your device, Stripe Terminal will assign your WiFi enabled device to a domain on your private network.  This makes it reachable by the API.  Some Domain Name Servers do not play nicely with that setup, so they may block that traffic.  We suggest that you try switching your network&#8217;s DNS provider to CloudFlare (1.1.1.1) or Google (8.8.8.8).  Although Stripe states that Google should work, we&#8217;ve had customers indicate that it does not, so try both.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20the%20customer%27s%20information%20shown%20on%20the%20invoice%20and%20email%20receipt%3F'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t the customer&#8217;s information shown on the invoice and email receipt?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please review the documentation above.  Customer account information is not supported in this version, you must purchase PRO Services.  Out-of-the-box, Stripe Terminal does not gather PII data and WooCommerce will bill to the account which is logged in (the admin performing the checkout).  Our PRO Services add-on allows for customer account support to perform purchases for things like subscriptions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20mobile%20app%20is%20applying%20tax%20on%20tips.%20%20how%20can%20i%20fix%20this%3F'>\nThe mobile app is applying tax on tips.  How can I fix this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a known issue within the WooCommerce legacy API, it is not an issue within our plugin.  Our mobile app leverages the legacy WooCommerce API (through our API handler) which passes the correct tax settings in order to make a fee_line non-taxable for &#8220;Tips/Fees&#8221;.  However, this activity is not supported by the legacy API, so this will remain the case until the plugin is updated for the latest API, which will be either in v3 or v4 of the plugin.  Until then unfortunately the best solution would be to either manually edit each order in your WC backend or counteract your tax by deducting it from the tip input.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
