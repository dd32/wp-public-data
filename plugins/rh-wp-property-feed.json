        "installation": "<p>Once you have installed and set up your Real Homes / Real Places theme and the WP Property Feed Plugin you simply install this connector plugin and the rest is automatic.  You can download and install this plugin using the built in WordPress plugin installer in the wp-admin, just search for \\&#8221;WP Property Feed Real Homes\\&#8221; and install the plugin then \\&#8221;Activate\\&#8221; to make it active.  Once active the connector will automatically update the Real Homes properties each time the WP Property Feed plugin updates from the feeds (normally every hour).  In the settings for WP Property Feed you will see a new Real Homes tab.  The tab will show the last 10 automatic updates that were performed and has a checkbox to allow you to run the connector immediately.<br />\nIt is advised that you set a long time out (max_execution_time) in your php.ini file as feed downloads can take a long time.</p>\n",
