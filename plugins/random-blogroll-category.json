If you only have 4 categories, it will<br />\nreturn all of them in a random order.</p>\n<h3>Retaining arguments sent to wp_list_bookmarks</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re sending arguments to wp_list_bookmarks, you can send those to<br />\nblogroll_random_category and it will pass them along to wp_list bookmarks. In<br />\nthis example, we&#8217;re showing all categories except #23:\n    </p>\n<p>The change below will show five random categories, none of which will be #23.

Now it uses a separate<br />\n  function call so that in some instances you can see random categories, but in<br />\n  others you can see the whole blogroll.<br />\n* Now possible to return multiple random categories without separate function<br />\n  calls, thus eliminiating the possibility that two of the random categories<br />\n  will be the same.</p>\n<h3>1.5.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The leading closing li tag was not actually getting trimmed off due to<br />\nbad copying and pasting.
