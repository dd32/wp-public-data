Push Notifications are clickable messages sent directly to your subscribers’ browsers (even when they are not on your website). These work on all devices — desktops, tablets and even mobile phones — so you don’t even have to invest in building a mobile app for your business. The opt-in and click rates are amazing! Some of our early adopters have seen an opt-in rate of 40% (10X the rate at which an average email list builds, and 20X the rate at which an average Twitter list populates) and a click rate of 20%. Of course, you get to see all this data, right in your PushCrew dashboard, updated real-time.</p>\n<p>Let us help you get amazing returns on your communications.
