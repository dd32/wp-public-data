        "faq": "\n<h4>I selected Player card for a post/page and entered the player URL but video does not play. What is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Twitter needs your player URL to be served over SSL, so your URL must start with <code>https://</code> and not <code>http://</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I see some code that I can improve. Do you accept pull requests?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By all means, feel free to submit a pull request.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want XYZ feature. Can you implement it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please feel free to suggest a new feature. Its inclusion might be speedier if you can provide the code to make it work.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
