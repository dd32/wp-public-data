I believe you don&#8217;t want to mess up with your site&#8217;s setup.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s no clear way of disabling the Block Directory for the nontechies. We expect sites to want to control whether the Block Directory is available and disable it. We would like to disable it on some of our sites.</p>\n<p>There is a long discussion on Github. So many developers came up with possible solutions. The WordPress core solution is easy for developers. Here is the solution: https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/filters/editor-filters/#block-directory</p>\n<p>But for us who are non-techies, afraid of adding codes to the core files.
