        "faq": "\n<h4>Who is this plugin for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Organizations in need of a full-featured calendar and donation system created specifically or synagogues and Jewish non-profits.  Tools 4 Shuls was created to integrate into new and existing websites &#8211; there&#8217;s no need to redesign your site!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can we view a demo of the admin panel and capabilities before signing up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit www.tools4shuls.com to view full system details and demos</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Much is a Tools 4 Shuls subscription?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sticker price for the Donations and Calendar modules is normally just under $100/mo, but you can take advantage of these limited-time promotions:</p>\n<pre><code>Include RSVPs and Payments with the Tools 4 Shuls Calendar - Now FREE (normally $18/mo)\n\nUse coupon code SAVEONT4S to save 50% when signing up for Calendar and Donations modules (that's just $36/mo)!\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>What payment processors can I use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tools 4 Shuls currently supports Paypal and Authorize.net.  There are no monthly fees for either of these services, however you will need a Paypal Payments Standard account for your organization (you cannot use a personal account).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Tools 4 Shuls keep a portion of the money we collect from our community memebers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No!  Your payment processor (Paypal or Authorize.net) will keep a small processing fee for each transacation, but Tools 4 Shuls does not keep anything other than your monthly subscription fee.  The money you collect for RSVP payments and donations goes directly from your members to you, and payment processing is handled securely by Paypal or Authorize.net.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What kind of Paypal account should we sign up for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here are full instructions (since it can get confusing):</p>\n<pre><code>1. Start here: https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=LVDLPFDVJB32S\n\n2. click the \"Start now\" button then select \"business\" and click \"continue\"\n\n3. Choose \"Paypal Payments standard\" (the \"$0\" section) on the next page, and then fill in all the appropriate info on the following pages.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure you use a synagogue administrative email address &#8212; not your own &#8212; when you sign up. This will probably mean that you&#8217;ll need to create a new account rather than upgrading an existing one. This account is completely free (aside from the roughly 3% per transaction fees).  you don&#8217;t need any type of account that has monthly fees.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
