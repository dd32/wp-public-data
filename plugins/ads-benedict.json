        "faq": "\n<h4>Aren&#8217;t there enough bad banner ad plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep.  And this one makes no claims to superiority other than that it is insanely simple and fixes some problems I was having with other ad plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about click tracking? weighting? alternate networks?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you use YOURLS link shortener you can have some rudimentary tracking.  Set your YOURLS address and secret token and a column will be added that keeps track of statistics.<br />\nThere is no protection against fraudulent clicks.<br />\nI use this on ads that are sold and run for a period of time as opposed to ads that have a certain number of impressions or clicks associated with them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it ever&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The only &#8220;features&#8221; I <em>think</em> I&#8217;m going to add are a start date.<br />\nSubject to change as I need to add features for myself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I request a feature?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course.  If it&#8217;s interesting or seems helpful to the rest of the world I might add it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it handle billing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I put the same zone in my template twice could it possibly display the same ad twice?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
