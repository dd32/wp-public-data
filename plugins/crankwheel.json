Allows you to find an agent to call the prospect right away, or have them schedule a meeting, or tell them &#8220;we&#8217;ll get back to you&#8221;. Leads can flow to your CRM via Zapier or directly to Salesforce. Part of CrankWheel, which you can use to seamlessly screen share with prospects coming in through this channel.</p>\n<p>CrankWheel provides <strong>specialized screen sharing</strong> for inside sales teams, a 3rd tool that complements telephone and email. With integrated <a href=\"http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">lead capture</a>, <a href=\"http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">lead enrichment</a> and <a href=\"http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">agent allocation</a>, CrankWheel ushers interested prospects from a company’s website to a phone call and <a href=\"http://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">screen share</a> with one of its salespeople.</p>\n<h3>How it works?</h3>\n<p>The WordPress plugin lets you change any button on your website into an <strong>Instant Demo</strong> or <strong>Call me Now</strong> call-to-action button. It allows visitors to request a phone call and optionally a screen sharing session and will notify you and any other agents at your company about it in real time.</p>\n<p>Presentations and broadcasting are done through <strong>Screen Sharing</strong>. CrankWheel can display the content of your programs, browser tabs and even clone the entire screen, enabling others to see what you see.</p>\n<p>Stop doing what everybody else is failing at &#8211; scheduling meetings and delaying the customer from purchasing your products. By helping out in under a minute you&#8217;re <a href=\"http://crankwheel.com/how-to-massively-increase-the-chance-of-qualifying-sales-leads/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">21 times more likely to sell your product!</a></p>\n<h3>Use Cases</h3>\n<h4>Lead Capture</h4>\n<p>Instant Demo buttons on your website open up popup forms that capture telephone and e-mail information from requesters. You receive a notification immediately after a user submits that data. That&#8217;s the moment when you can call your customer, start screen sharing and even broadcast your screen on their mobile device.</p>\n<h4>Closing Sales Online</h4>\n<p>Some purchases can only be completed through signatures &#8211; in person. Instead of having a website that just points people to your physical location, you can now share your screen with customers, show the documents online and use an e-signature service to close more sales. Imagine how much time can be saved thanks to this!</p>\n<h4>Customer Success Management</h4>\n<p>Embedding request a demo buttons throughout the website visitor&#8217;s journey builds their confidence that at any point they can request high-touch help from a real person. The ability to request that you show your customer exactly what they need to see in order to succeed has never yet been available on WordPress!</p>\n",
