        "description": "<p>The simple concept behind WP-FB AutoConnect is to offer an easy-to-use widget that lets readers login to your blog with either their Facebook account or local WordPress credentials. Although many &#8220;Facebook Connect&#8221; plugins do exist, most of them are either overly complex and difficult to customize, or fail to provide a seamless experience for new  visitors. I wrote this plugin to provide what the others didn&#8217;t:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full support for both WordPress and Buddypress.</li>\n<li>No user interaction is required &#8211; the login process is transparent to new and returning users alike.</li>\n<li>Existing users who connect with FB retain the same local user accounts as before (matched via e-mail).</li>\n<li>New visitors will be given new user accounts, which can be retained even if you remove the plugin.</li>\n<li>Facebook profile pictures can be used as avatars.</li>\n<li>No contact with the Facebook API after the login completes &#8211; so no slow pageloads.</li>\n<li>No 3rd party services: your site talks directly to Facebook, through an app created and owned by you.</li>\n<li>Won&#8217;t bloat your database with duplicate user accounts, extra fields, or unnecessary complications.</li>\n<li>Custom logging options can notify you whenever someone connects with Facebook.</li>\n<li>A powerful set of hooks and filters allow developers to easily tailor the login process to their personal needs: redirect to a custom page, fill xProfile data with information from Facebook, setup permissions based on social connections, and more.</li>\n<li>Fully HTML/CSS valid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Premium Addon</h3>\n<p>In addition to the free features listed above, I also offer a Premium addon to provide some more advanced functionality.  The following is an abbreviated list of Premium features; a more complete list, along with details on each item, is available on the <a href=\"https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect/#premium\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin homepage</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisite Support</li>\n<li>Shortcode Support</li>\n<li>Image-based/styleable login buttons</li>\n<li>Cache Facebook avatars to your local server</li>\n<li>Allow users to manually associate/disassociate their existing accounts with Facebook</li>\n<li>Automatically populate BuddyPress X-Profiles with information from Facebook</li>\n<li>Announce Facebook logins to the BuddyPress Activity Stream</li>\n<li>Show an AJAX spinner to indicate login-in-progress</li>\n<li>Add a Facebook button to the comment form, login form, registration form, and WPMU signup form</li>\n<li>Customize the redirect URL for first-time visitors, returning visitors, and logged-out visitors</li>\n<li>Restrict autoregistration to Facebook friends, Facebook fans, explicitly invited users, everyone, or no one</li>\n<li>Send a customizable welcome mail to autoregistered users</li>\n<li>Customize the role assigned to autoregistered users</li>\n<li>Show/Hide/Customize the Widget&#8217;s links, checkboxes, and textfields.  Show the logged-in user&#8217;s avatar in the Widget.</li>\n<li>Priority support</li>\n<li>&#8230;And more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Donate</h3>\n<p>Countless hours have gone into developing, maintaining, &amp; supporting this plugin. Just keeping it running requires ongoing work due to Facebook&#8217;s ever-changing API &amp; WordPress&#8217; frequent updates. If you find it useful, please consider supporting its continued development by purchasing the Premium addon or <a href=\"https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect/#donate\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">making a donation</a> of any amount.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses the Facebook API to fetch data from Facebook. The data is used to automate user logins, and/or to automate the creation of new local WordPress user accounts. The data may therefore be copied &amp; stored in the WordPress database, and can be removed by deleting any Facebook-linked user accounts. Usage of this plugin means the site administrator is consenting to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policy.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook&#8217;s data policy</a>. Note that using the Facebook API requires loading some JS from Facebook, which may track visitors. This plugin does not use any 3rd party intermediary for processing logins or otherwise &#8211; all data is exchanged directly between your site &amp; Facebook.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Premium addon (if purchased &amp; installed separately) may connect to the developer&#8217;s web store to check for updates &amp; for license verification. This check does not transmit any information about your users, and is used solely to check for updates and for licensing verification.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Please direct all support requests <a href=\"https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect#feedback\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n",

It doesn&#8217;t seem to be necessary for any modern browsers, and breaks validation for HTML5.  If you find it necessary, you can always re-add it with a simple filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5.7 (2012-12-23)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for validating the API key/secret on servers with invalid SSL cert</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5.6 (2012-12-23)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>jQuery is not working for some users on WP3.5.

Although it&#8217;s still included and passed to the actions/filters for backwards-compatibility, calls to the Graph API should now performed via jfb_api_get() and jfb_api_post(), using the access_token provided.  Specific changes:</li>\n<li>Rename jfb_get() to jfb_api_get()</li>\n<li>Add jfb_api_post() for API calls requiring HTTP POST</li>\n<li>Facebook JSON responses are decoded to associative arrays rather than objects (to match the format of the PHP SDK)</li>\n<li>Rename &#8220;accessToken&#8221; to &#8220;access_token&#8221; to better match the naming convention used by the Graph API</li>\n<li>Update jfb_post_to_wall() to avoid using the $facebook class</li>\n<li>Update all queries &amp; error checks in _process_login.php to avoid using the $facebook class</li>\n<li>Rearrange things in _process_login.php, putting the $facebook initialization code into a &#8220;to deprecate&#8221; block</li>\n<li>Get rid of the 2.3.6 &#8216;one-time update&#8217; code to store the app access token in the DB</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4.1 (2012-11-27)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Explicitly pass &amp; check for the user access token in _process_login.php</li>\n<li>Provide the user access token to wpfb_session_established, wpfb_connect, wpfb_existing_user, wpfb_inserting_user, wpfb_inserted_user, and wpfb_login (so you can use it to query the Graph API in your addons)</li>\n<li>Cleanup jfb_output_facebook_callback()</li>\n<li>Fix a harmless notice that may appear if you have WP_DEBUG defined</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4.0 (2012-11-26)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;ve eliminated the old REST PHP library, which was only being used to validate the AppID &amp; Secret in the admin panel; validation is now done with Graph.  IMPORTANT: If you&#8217;ve been using this plugin since the old &#8220;App Key&#8221; days (over a year ago) and the AppID in your admin panel is an old alphanumeric value, you should replace it with the new numeric-only AppID shown in your App&#8217;s settings on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Include the AppID in login logs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.11 (2012-11-19)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a few more things to the Support Info tab</li>\n<li>Update the Premium Options tab to reflect the latest addon version</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.10 (2012-11-11)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix error reporting for a rare login bug</li>\n<li>Use wp_mail() instead of php mail() to send login logs (for servers with custom mail configurations)</li>\n<li>Include a stylesheet with some default widget styles</li>\n<li>Show &#8220;WP-FB AutoConn+&#8221; in the admin menu if the Premium addon is installed</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.9 (2012-11-01)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve browser detection for login logs (+ add detection for Android &amp; iPad)</li>\n<li>Login logs include the full useragent string</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.8 (2012-10-27)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Get rid of old nonce debugging code</li>\n<li>Move the nonce check back to before the Facebook connection</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.7 (2012-10-22)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix when error-detecting the token in the admin panel</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.6 (2012-10-21)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>When connecting with Facebook in the admin panel, cache the app token to the database (so addons/customizations can use it to access the API later)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.5 (2012-10-20)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add log messages when each action/filter is run in _process_login.php (for debugging add-ins)</li>\n<li>Move the Facebook connection to <em>before</em> the nonce check</li>\n<li>Add a new action &#8216;wpfb_session_established,&#8217; so we can talk to Facebook before anything else happens </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.4 (2012-10-16)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users who didn&#8217;t update to 2.3.1 when it was released may now have some malformed avatar URLs in their db (resulting in frontend &#8216;strpos&#8217; error messages); this update will fix those avatars.  Note:  Please remember to update your plugin whenever a new version is released, as Facebook changes their API regularly and skipping updates can sometimes lead to unpredictable behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.3 (2012/08/20)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a problem with Curl detection caused by FB changing things without telling people</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.2 (2012/08/16)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook has yet again broken their API, causing avatars to always fetch size 50&#215;50 (even for the &#8220;large&#8221; size used by BuddyPress and some 3rd party themes).  This update should work around FB&#8217;s bug, returning avatars to their former behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.1 (2012/07/21)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a rare bug with avatar fetching</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.0 (2012/02/22)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major performance improvement: logins should now be substantially faster on sites with large user databases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.2 (2012/02/22)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update version compatibility number</li>\n<li>The &#8216;Failed to get the Facebook User Session&#8217; error now refers to a specific FAQ.</li>\n<li>Add support for debugging memory usage and execution time (via the email logs)</li>\n<li>Combine Admin notices into one action</li>\n<li>Update the admin panel&#8217;s premium teaser to include newly-added features</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1 (2012/01/10)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add an admin panel check to warn users whose servers don&#8217;t have CURL installed</li>\n<li>Add an admin panel check to warn users whose servers dont have JSON installed</li>\n<li>Add a new tab to the admin panel with &#8220;Support Info&#8221; (to include when reporting a bug/issue)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.0 (2011-12-17)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonce fix to resolve a conflict with Buddypress Groups, and potential validation issues with other plugins that use the default nonce name/action (thanks gbellucci!)</li>\n<li>Check for compatibility with WP3.3</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.9 (2011-12-13)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed an old (now unused) database option that was getting written on every pageload (thanks Aaron Frerichs!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.8 (2011-11-28)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed plugin sponsorship messages.

If you have multiple authors and are using the &#8220;First.Last&#8221; format, you may want to change your username format. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.4 (2011-11-16)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Move the Wall Announcement code into a filter, so it can be removed/replaced/customized if desired</li>\n<li>Update WP compatibility number</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.3 (2011-11-15)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the plugin was incorrectly stripping some language_attributes, causing problems for rtl languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.2 (2011-11-08)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminate the outdated xd_receiver.htm file</li>\n<li>Eliminate the outdated validate_php5.php file</li>\n<li>Update the instructions for creating an app (Facebook has changed things around yet again)</li>\n<li>Use https instead of http in channel.html to prevent insecure content warning</li>\n<li>Fix &#8220;wp_insert_user failed&#8221; bug (since 2.1.0)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.1 (2011-10-29)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a critical bug introduced in 2.1.0: not prompting for e-mail <em>could</em> result in false user account matches (i.e. logging someone in as someone else).

    "short_description": "A lightweight but powerful Facebook login plugin, easy to setup and transparent to new and returning users alike.  Supports Buddypress.",
    "description": "<p>The simple concept behind WP-FB AutoConnect is to offer an easy-to-use widget that lets readers login to your blog with either their Facebook account or local WordPress credentials. Although many &#8220;Facebook Connect&#8221; plugins do exist, most of them are either overly complex and difficult to customize, or fail to provide a seamless experience for new  visitors. I wrote this plugin to provide what the others didn&#8217;t:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full support for both WordPress and Buddypress.</li>\n<li>No user interaction is required &#8211; the login process is transparent to new and returning users alike.</li>\n<li>Existing users who connect with FB retain the same local user accounts as before (matched via e-mail).</li>\n<li>New visitors will be given new user accounts, which can be retained even if you remove the plugin.</li>\n<li>Facebook profile pictures can be used as avatars.</li>\n<li>No contact with the Facebook API after the login completes &#8211; so no slow pageloads.</li>\n<li>No 3rd party services: your site talks directly to Facebook, through an app created and owned by you.</li>\n<li>Won&#8217;t bloat your database with duplicate user accounts, extra fields, or unnecessary complications.</li>\n<li>Custom logging options can notify you whenever someone connects with Facebook.</li>\n<li>A powerful set of hooks and filters allow developers to easily tailor the login process to their personal needs: redirect to a custom page, fill xProfile data with information from Facebook, setup permissions based on social connections, and more.</li>\n<li>Fully HTML/CSS valid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Premium Addon</h3>\n<p>In addition to the free features listed above, I also offer a Premium addon to provide some more advanced functionality.  The following is an abbreviated list of Premium features; a more complete list, along with details on each item, is available on the <a href=\"https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect/#premium\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin homepage</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multisite Support</li>\n<li>Shortcode Support</li>\n<li>Image-based/styleable login buttons</li>\n<li>Cache Facebook avatars to your local server</li>\n<li>Allow users to manually associate/disassociate their existing accounts with Facebook</li>\n<li>Automatically populate BuddyPress X-Profiles with information from Facebook</li>\n<li>Announce Facebook logins to the BuddyPress Activity Stream</li>\n<li>Show an AJAX spinner to indicate login-in-progress</li>\n<li>Add a Facebook button to the comment form, login form, registration form, and WPMU signup form</li>\n<li>Customize the redirect URL for first-time visitors, returning visitors, and logged-out visitors</li>\n<li>Restrict autoregistration to Facebook friends, Facebook fans, explicitly invited users, everyone, or no one</li>\n<li>Send a customizable welcome mail to autoregistered users</li>\n<li>Customize the role assigned to autoregistered users</li>\n<li>Show/Hide/Customize the Widget&#8217;s links, checkboxes, and textfields.  Show the logged-in user&#8217;s avatar in the Widget.</li>\n<li>Priority support</li>\n<li>&#8230;And more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Donate</h3>\n<p>Countless hours have gone into developing, maintaining, &amp; supporting this plugin. Just keeping it running requires ongoing work due to Facebook&#8217;s ever-changing API &amp; WordPress&#8217; frequent updates. If you find it useful, please consider supporting its continued development by purchasing the Premium addon or <a href=\"https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect/#donate\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">making a donation</a> of any amount.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses the Facebook API to fetch data from Facebook. The data is used to automate user logins, and/or to automate the creation of new local WordPress user accounts. The data may therefore be copied &amp; stored in the WordPress database, and can be removed by deleting any Facebook-linked user accounts. Usage of this plugin means the site administrator is consenting to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/policy.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook&#8217;s data policy</a>. Note that using the Facebook API requires loading some JS from Facebook, which may track visitors. This plugin does not use any 3rd party intermediary for processing logins or otherwise &#8211; all data is exchanged directly between your site &amp; Facebook.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Premium addon (if purchased &amp; installed separately) may connect to the developer&#8217;s web store to check for updates &amp; for license verification. This check does not transmit any information about your users, and is used solely to check for updates and for licensing verification.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Please direct all support requests <a href=\"https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect#feedback\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n",
