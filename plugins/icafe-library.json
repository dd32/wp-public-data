        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I get started?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Activate the plugin and click on iCafe Library from the side menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are resources organized?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The concept of a bookshelf is used. You create books which can contain Chapters which can contain Sections.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where to I put the resources?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Resource Tiles can be added to any Chapter or Section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are &#8220;Resource Tiles&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Resource should be very narrow in their focus. A &#8220;Tile&#8221; is a simple container that holds related Text, Video, Embed code, or Links together in a organizational and visual way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I reuse a Tile?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many times as you like!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the order of my &#8220;Bookshelf&#8221; or chapters, sections, resources?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply Drag and Drop to the correct order or organization&#8230;Changes are automatically saved.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I display different books on different pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just go to the custom bookshelf page in the plugin admin menu and select the books you wish to display. Then copy the shortcode provide to your page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I link to a particular Resource Tile to share with a user?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just navigate to that tile and copy the URL from the browser.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My tiles are appearing below the navigation instead of to the right?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your template is too narrow. iCafe Library requires a full width template with no sidebars or widget areas.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set a default tile for a book to open to?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Manage Books&#8221; admin menu navigate to the book, chapter, or section that contains the tile you want to make default. Click on &#8220;Add Resource Tiles&#8221; for the desired node and select the radio button beside the desired tile. If you are adding tiles during this operation then you must refresh the &#8220;Add Resource Tiles&#8221; button to see the radio buttons.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I click a book I&#8217;m being directed to my home page not the book?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>iCafe Library currently requires your permalink structure to be &#8220;Post name&#8221;. There are many reasons why this permalink structure is the most popular choice among WordPress sites. You can change your permalinks in your admin menu under Settings&gt;Permalinks.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
