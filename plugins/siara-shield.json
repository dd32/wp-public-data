This simple plugin blocks bad bots from entering and submitting online forms such as contact-us and review forms, creating accounts, or verifying passwords and password changes.

Google’s reCAPTCHA, which is often the backbone of many WordPress Security products relies on allowing Google to monitor all your pages and regular tweaking of security ratings to ensure your customers pass but bad bots are blocked.  And, most importantly, reCAPTCHA relies heavily on whether your customer is in the Google ecosystem.
