Whether you&#8217;re debugging or optimizing performance, our feature-rich Profiler Section ensures you have the data you need to make informed decisions and elevate your site&#8217;s performance.</p>\n<h4>Query Monitor</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Component Loading Time:<br />\nComponent loading time refers to the duration it takes for the individual plugin to load. Monitoring this helps identify potential bottlenecks in the loading process, allowing for optimization to enhance overall website performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Caller Loading Time:<br />\nCaller loading time likely pertains to the time it takes for functions or methods (callers) within WordPress to load and execute. Efficient monitoring of caller loading time can aid in identifying any code-related issues impacting the website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Query and Asset Views: Gain insights into your website&#8217;s queries and assets.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Media Controls</h4>\n<p>Effortlessly compress original images, auto-compress images, compress different image sizes, and resize images to improve loading times.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Lazyload for images, iframes, and videos<br />\nLazyLoad delays the loading of images, iframes, and videos on your website until the user scrolls down the page and needs to see them.<br />\nWe do this in an SEO-friendly way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disable Emoji: Disable Emoji will reduce the number of external HTTP requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Orphaned Images: Orphaned images are those files or pictures within a website that are no longer linked or referenced by any page or content. These images may have been used in the past but are currently not connected to any part of the website. Identifying and addressing orphaned images is important for optimizing storage space, maintaining a clean website structure, and ensuring that all displayed content is relevant and functional. Regularly checking for and removing orphaned images can contribute to improved website performance and more efficient use of resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preload Option: Allows developers to specify resources (such as images, scripts, or stylesheets) that should be fetched or loaded in advance before they are needed by the browser. This proactive loading helps optimize page performance by reducing latency when a user interacts with the website.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>File Optimization</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Minify HTML, CSS, and JS<br />\nThere are several advantages to delivering minified content to final users. Delivering minified content to users offers advantages such as faster loading times, resulting from reduced file sizes, and operational efficiencies, including savings in bandwidth usage and lower resource requirements for both servers and end-users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deferred loading of JavaScript files<br />\nIt is preferable for performance that JavaScript files are either loaded in the footer of your site or deferred so that they don’t block the downloading of other assets on your site, thereby slowing it down. By enabling Load JavaScript deferred, all the JavaScript files on your page, including those minified  will be loaded with the defer attribute</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disable Google Fonts<br />\nGoogle Fonts can be a great addition to your website that considerably improves your typography</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concatenation of JS and CSS files<br />\nThe files are processed and the optimized versions are stored in cache/smack-optimize</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Database Optimization</h4>\n<p>A clean database runs more efficiently and it also helps to speed up your site. Keep your database lean and efficient with features like deleting post revisions, auto-draft posts, trash posts, spam, unapproved comments, and expired transients.
