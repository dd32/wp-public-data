As of 2012 IPv4 is still the most widely deployed Internet Layer protocol.<br />\nIPv4 uses 32-bit (four-byte) addresses, which limits the address space to 4.294.967.296 (2^32) addresses.<br />\nAddresses were assigned to users, and the number of unassigned addresses decreased. IPv4 address exhaustion occurred on February 3, 2011.<br />\nIt had been significantly delayed by address changes such as classful network design, Classless Inter-Domain Routing, and network address translation (NAT).<br />\nIPv4 addresses, as commonly displayed to users, consist of four groups of three decimal digits separated by dots.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20ipv6%20%3F'>\nWhat is IPv6 ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest revision of the Internet Protocol (IP), the primary communications protocol upon which the entire Internet is built.<br />\nIt is intended to replace the older IPv4, which is still employed for the vast majority of Internet traffic as of 2012.<br />\nIPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 running out of addresses.<br />\nIPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for 2?128, or approximately 3.4×10^38 addresses — more than 7.9×10^28 times as many as IPv4.<br />\nIPv6 addresses, as commonly displayed to users, consist of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
