All of the improvements made in <em>WP Fail2Ban Redux</em> were done in a way that would allow existing functionality to work without changes to your filters. However, the demo filters included with the plugin do contain some recommended changes. There are also new features not found in WP fail2ban that will require changes to your filters to be effective. These changes are linked, by filter, below:<br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/thebrandonallen/wp-fail2ban-redux/compare/e3ec3c9...master#diff-3f035b688aa51aa342856e0efe9e5fb35628c3919dd60237c64cbbb9e337a4c7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wordpress-hard.conf</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/thebrandonallen/wp-fail2ban-redux/compare/e3ec3c9...master#diff-ab6c3eee8b8a798511f7315fcbc84eb594f13cf59fca287d2791dffb6e6d5e05\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wordpress-soft.conf</a></p>\n<p><em>Be ye forewarned: Future changes to WP fail2ban may break backwards compatibility with WP Fail2Ban Redux filters.

Download the plugin, and unzip. Inside the plugin folder will be another folder named <code>wp-fail2ban-redux</code> and <code>wp-fail2ban-redux.php</code>.
