Or click import now if the function doesn&#8217;t run immediately.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using instagram only, make sure to click &#8220;Authenticate&#8221; to get your api access key and run the import again. Instagram API has a better protection, so don&#8217;t worry to include your username and password.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I output the feed on my page</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just add the [sprites-feed] shortcode into your page editor and publish the post. Voil√°, your posts should be visible automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our plugin makes use of the wp_cron function and automatically fetches posts from the enabled API&#8217;s every hour, note that wp_cron runs based on your site traffic, so if there&#8217;s literally no traffic, some posts may not be fetched. In order to import the posts immediately, you can use the import button in each of the API&#8217;s settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
