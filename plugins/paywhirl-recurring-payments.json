It removes the hard work necessary to code all the views that allow your users to sign-up for memberships, create user accounts and manage their customer subscriptions. Anyone with an existing website can setup our widget in just a few minutes and start collecting recurring payments immediately, whereas with custom development, it can weeks or months to integrate.</p>\n",

We recommend you style your widget to match your website as this provides a better user experience and will increase your number of subscriptions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Paywhirl in sync with Stripe?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Paywhirl is setup to be constantly in sync with Stripe. If you change something on Stripe, it will reflect in Paywhirl. Same goes for changing something on Paywhirl &#8211; it will be reflected in Stripe. Sometimes this process takes a few seconds.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
