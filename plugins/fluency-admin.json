        "faq": "\n<h4>What browsers does this work in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fluency Admin has been tested in the latest versions of Safari, Firefox. Users of Internet Explorer may experience some display &#8220;issues&#8221; to to each browsers particular css-handling ability.</p>\n<p>Only minimal Internet Explorer testing has been done, no compatibility guarantees. I may fix bugs where possible, if they are pointed out &#8211; some probably can&#8217;t be fixed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t my plugin work with Fluency?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The majority of plugins should work without issue when Fluency is activated, however there are a few that don&#8217;t for one reason or another. If you come across a plugin that doesn&#8217;t play nice with Fluency please let me know so that I can address any issues in a future release.</p>\n<p>Most common cause of a plugins incompatibility are highly custom admin pages, ie. those that don&#8217;t follow the standard WordPress admin design. In the majority of these cases its not particularly feasible for me to write a bunch of custom styles just to get them to play nice.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that most issues that other plugins have are due to poorly designed/coded admin pages, some of these issues I can &#8216;hack&#8217; around with css, but many should be fixed by the author of the plugin in question.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using a version of WordPress other that 3.2.x and some things look weird, what can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to use Fluency 3.2 then you MUST be running WordPress 3.2 upgrading WordPress is easy and you should always do it.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to upgrade for one reason or another then I would suggest downloading a previous version of Fluency, recommended versions are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fluency 2.4 for WP3.1</li>\n<li>Fluency 2.3 for WP3.0</li>\n<li>Fluency 2.2 for WP2.9</li>\n<li>Fluency 2.1 for WP2.8</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get support for plugin X to be added to Fluency?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Post something in the support forums here on WordPress.org or on my Help site (http://help.deanjrobinson.com/groups/fluency-admin/).</p>\n<p>Please note that I will not test be testing commercial paid for plugins or those that require me to signup to some spam laden site just to download and/or use them.<br />\nPlugins that do not work with the latest version of WordPress will also not be tested.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What languages does Fluency Admin support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note: As Fluency 3.2 is a complete rebuild old translations won&#8217;t work, I will release updates as new translations are provided.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in supplying a new or updated translation for your language please get in contact, you&#8217;ll find the .pot file in the &#8216;languages&#8217; folder to get you started.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
