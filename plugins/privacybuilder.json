Each field of user data to be deleted, as specified in PrivacyBuilder, may correspond to multiple keys within the user meta data which your WordPress application has created. Specify, in JSON form, the PrivacyBuilder infofield to be deleted, and the corresponding array of keys of WordPress user meta data to be deleted. Use PHP style double quotes here, not Javascript single quotes.</p>\n",
