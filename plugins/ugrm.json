Minor fix, but very large impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Discovered that with multisite enabled, the server variables will sometimes present as prepended with REDIRCT_ when in a subsite. E.G. UFADGroupsDN will sometimes appear<br />\nREDIRECT_UFADGroupsDN. The code has been extended to accomdate this.<br />\n*As a side note, the Shibboleth plugin UGRM extends appears to have been abandoned. As we&#8217;ve already made code changes to enable the Shibboleth plugin to work<br />\nwith the new WordPress enabled for multisite, and we had to graft on further changes for the REDIRECT_ behavior, we plan to release a fork of the Shibboleth plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a glaring bug in when &#8220;Force Shibboleth return target to HTTPS&#8221; was checked and return target was already https the target would be munged to httpss.</li>\n<li>Discovered Shibboleth on IIS prepends all Shibboleth server variables with a HTTP_ prefix because the variables are populated via CGI as IIS does not support<br />\nenvironment variables (for details, check out: https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPAttributeAccess). Plugin now inspects SERVER_SOFTWARE<br />\nvariable and adjusts accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed header in UGRM.php to resolve current version display on WordPress site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempting to correct WordPress SVN tagging for current</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Still working on SVN versioning</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New version number to resolve wonkyness with WordPress SVN.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a configuration option for requiring HTTPS on the return target. This hooks into the Shibboleth provided shibboleth_seesion_initiator_url filter and ensures<br />\nthe return target uses HTTPS. This allows you seemless provide a Shibboleth integrated WordPress site where the content side is delivered via HTTP and the admin<br />\nside is delivered VIA HTTPS.  The default  Shibboleth plugin behavior is to construct the return target using the current protocol, e.g. if you click the login link from<br />\nHTTP, your return target would be for HTTP.  UGRM now allows you to overide this behavior and alwasy use a HTTPS return target.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
