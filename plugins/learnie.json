        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20learnie%20cost%20money%3F'>\nDoes Learnie cost money?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin itself is free.  You can subscribe to a private space for your users at https://learnie.app and selecting the community button.  Learnie does charge for private branded communities.  You can also select to create a Learnie Pay$ subscription community which will cost you nothing to create but Learnie will charge 15% of a monthly subscription value from your subscribers.   See more about both these offerings below:<br />\nhttps://mylearnie.com/how-to-buy-a-learnie-business-cohort/<br />\nhttps://mylearnie.com/subscription-revenue/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20do%20with%20this%20community%3F'>\nWhat can I do with this community?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have set up the community, users can log in and watch the microlearning you have created or you can allow them to create and be published in your community that is embedded in your wordpress site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20they%20have%20to%20log%20in%3F'>\nDo they have to log in?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Users can see the community page but to access the functions they will have to log in.  For private communities that you license from Learnie you will manage the user population.  For Learnie Pay$ communities, they will be able to subscribe through the plugin to your content community.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20my%20users%20see%20more%20than%20my%20community%3F'>\nWhy do my users see more than my community?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They have joined multiple communities through that account.  They can always navigate back to your community by selecting the community button.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
