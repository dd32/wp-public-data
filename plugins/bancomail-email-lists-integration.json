Joining our PartnerZone is totally free: no additional payment or minimum sales level are requested to stay.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I need a Bancomail account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your Bancomail Account is what makes you a Reseller and gives you privileges like an agreed price that lets you earn from your sales. Also, from your personal area you activate the Web Service and get your credentials.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use any theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes,  &#8216;Bancomail Email Lists Integration&#8217; works great with almost each Worpress Theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any technical requirements?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually you don&#8217;t have to check this, but in case of problems be sure to have &#8216;php_openssl.dll&#8217; and &#8216;php_soap.dll&#8217; extensions installed. Please make sure as well that the server port &#8216;8181&#8217; is open.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is my Shop Page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shop page is automatically published to www.yourwebsite.it/database but you need to add it to your primary menu to make it visible to your users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I make my own price?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can choose a percentual additional mark-up for each sale.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will my customer be able to view my agreed price?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, only you will be able to see and pay the Partner price. Your customer will see the price you decided to show.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will my customer be able to download the product after payment?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. As soon as you make your payment to Bancomail, we craft your Customer&#8217; database and we send you a download link when it&#8217;s ready. Normally this takes up to three working days. It&#8217;s up to you to provide the database to the customer: we won&#8217;t never contact him.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize Styles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, please refer to &#8216;/bancomail-email-lists-integration/css/bm_style.css&#8217; for styles</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize Email Layout?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Copy the file  &#8216;/bancomail-email-lists-integration/templates/email.phtml&#8217; in a new folder of your theme. Rename this folder &#8216;bm-emaillist-integration/&#8217; (yes, call it this way!). Now the plugin will load your custom email, even if you upgrade it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the currency?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No we are sorry, but this is not possible at the moment.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I report bugs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can email us at web@bancomail.com</p>\n</p>\n\n",
