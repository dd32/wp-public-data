        "description": "<p>CubeWP Wallet is a feature-rich plugin designed primarily for developers and themes, allowing them to integrate a wallet system into their websites. With CubeWP Wallet, you can enable transactions to be added to a user&#8217;s wallet, provide withdrawal functionality, and even implement commission charges. This plugin provides a flexible and customizable solution for managing virtual wallets on your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<p>Insert Transactions into Wallet: Developers and theme designers can easily incorporate the ability to add transactions into a user&#8217;s wallet using the provided coding examples. This feature enables users to deposit funds into their wallet for future use.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal Functionality: Users can conveniently withdraw funds from their wallet as needed. This provides them with the flexibility to utilize their wallet balance for various purposes within your website.</p>\n<p>Commission Charging: Admins have the option to apply commission charges on wallet transactions. This feature allows you to monetize the wallet system by deducting a percentage or fixed amount as a commission from each transaction.</p>\n<p>Dispute Request for Refund: Customers can create dispute requests for refunding a specific transaction. This functionality ensures that users have recourse in case of any issues or discrepancies with their wallet transactions.</p>\n<p>Insert Transaction into Wallet Example Code:</p>\n<p>$parameters = array(<br />\n    &#8216;amount&#8217;     =&gt; 100, // Amount to add into the wallet { numeric } [ Required ]<br />\n    &#8216;post_id&#8217;    =&gt; 1, // Add a post ID to this record { Post ID } [ Required ]<br />\n    &#8216;order_id&#8217;   =&gt; 1, // Add an order ID to this record { Order ID } [ Optional ( Cannot be null ) ]<br />\n    &#8216;vendor_id&#8217;  =&gt; 1, // Identify the user who will receive this amount { User ID } [ Optional ( post author will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n    &#8216;currency&#8217;   =&gt; &#8216;Rs&#8217;, // Specify the currency symbol { String } [ Optional ( CubeWP settings will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n    &#8216;commission&#8217; =&gt; array( // Get a commission on the amount { array | false } [ Optional ( CubeWP settings will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n        &#8216;commission_type&#8217;  =&gt; &#8216;percentage&#8217;, // Commission type { percentage | fixed } [ Optional ( CubeWP settings will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n        &#8216;commission_value&#8217; =&gt; &#8217;25&#8217; // Commission value { numeric } [ Optional ( CubeWP settings will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n    ),<br />\n    &#8216;on_hold&#8217; =&gt; array( // Hold the amount for a specific number of days before it is available for withdrawal { Array | False } [ Optional ( CubeWP settings will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n        &#8216;hold_period&#8217;  =&gt; &#8216;7&#8217; // Specify the hold amount period in days { numeric } [ Optional ( CubeWP settings will be used as a replacement ) ]<br />\n    )<br />\n);<br />\nCubeWp_Wallet_Processor::cubewp_add_funds_to_wallet( $parameters );</p>\n<p>Please note that integrating CubeWP Wallet into your website requires coding knowledge as shown in the example above.
