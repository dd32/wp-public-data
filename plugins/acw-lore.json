If you have a history website, The American Civil War only website, or<br />\nyou just want to display quotes from that period, then this plugin is for you. All quotes shall appear beneath the title. For example, if the title of your website is &#8220;General Robert E. Lee&#8221; and the current description is &#8220;The life of General Lee&#8221; then after the installation of the plugin, the line will be changed to a random quote with each refresh of the page.

Those are the quotes. Write your quote, but be careful, each quote must end with a line break &#8220;\\n&#8221; For example, if you want to add the quote &#8220;Why do men fight who were born to be brothers? &#8211; James Longstreet&#8221; by Longstret, you add it at the end of the file, below the last quote and in one<br />\nstraight line. If the line breaks (\\n) automatically, that&#8217;s fine. If you break it intentionally, the quote will be halved in two. Like if you write &#8220;Why do men fight who  were born to be brothers?&#8221; &#8211; James Longstreet  Two quotes will come out of that. &#8220;Why do men fight who&#8221; and &#8220;were born to be brothers? &#8211; James Longstreet&#8221; and that would not be cool.</p>\n<h4>I messed things up, how can I fix everything?</h4>\n<p>Pre-install and plugin and stop pretending to be a programmer.</p>\n<h4>This is an awesome plugin, how can I thank Stefany?</h4>\n<p>I will be very grateful if you put my website www.dyulgerova.info<br />\nin your page.</p>\n",
