WP RSS Aggregator has the functionality I was looking for. I’ve tried other plugins, but <strong>this was the one I knew could do everything</strong>. I get 150 visitors a day, so that’s probably 4,500 visitors per month, and I think maybe <strong>99% of visitors land on one of the articles aggregated by the plugin</strong>.&#8221; &#8211; Ronald Heijnes ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>\n<p><strong>Content Syndication: <a href=\"https://www.wprssaggregator.com/case-study-content-syndication-thebrokerlist/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Broker List</a></strong><br />\n&#8220;WP RSS Aggregator is <strong>time-saving</strong>.
