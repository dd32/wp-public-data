        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20managewp%20free%3F'>\nIs ManageWP free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ManageWP is using the freemium model. All the core features are free for an unlimited number of websites. And for those of you who need more, we have a set of premium features to help you out.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20support%20for%20free%20users%3F'>\nDo you offer support for free users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. No matter if you&#8217;re free or premium user, we are here for you 24/7. Expect a 1h average response time and a 65% answer resolution in the first reply.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20do%20premium%20managewp%20features%20cost%3F'>\nHow much do premium ManageWP features cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our pricing is highly flexible, we don&#8217;t charge anything upfront. The usage is calculated on a per-website, per-addon basis, like Amazon Web Services. Check out our <a href=\"https://managewp.com/pricing\" title=\"ManageWP pricing page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pricing page</a> for more info.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20managewp%20secure%3F'>\nIs ManageWP secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. All of our code is developed in-house and we have a top notch security team. With half a million websites managed since 2012 we did not have a single security incident. We&#8217;ve accomplished this through high standards, vigilance and the help of security researchers, through our <a href=\"https://managewp.com/white-hat-reward\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">white hat security program</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20websites%20on%20several%20different%20hosts.%20will%20managewp%20work%20all%20of%20them%3F'>\nI have websites on several different hosts. Will ManageWP work all of them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. ManageWP plays nice with all major hosts, and 99% of the small ones.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20managewp%20work%20with%20multisites%3F'>\nDoes ManageWP work with multisites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, multisite networks are fully supported, including the ability to backup and clone a multisite network.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20managewp%20work%20with%20wordpress.com%20sites%3F'>\nDoes ManageWP work with WordPress.com sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. ManageWP works only with self-hosted WordPress sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='worker%20plugin%20can%20connect%20to%20managewp%20and%20pro%20sites.%20what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20two%3F'>\nWorker plugin can connect to ManageWP and Pro Sites. What is the difference between the two?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://managewp.com\" title=\"ManageWP website\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ManageWP</a> is focused on the hosting-agnostic WordPress website management. <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/pro\" title=\"GoDaddy Pro Sites website\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Sites</a> is the GoDaddy version of the service. It&#8217;s part of the GoDaddy Pro program, which incorporates different tools for website &amp; client management, lead generation, and tighter integration with other GoDaddy products.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20problems%20adding%20my%20site'>\nI have problems adding my site\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you use the latest version of the Worker plugin on the site you are trying to add. If you still have problems, check our dedicated <a href=\"https://managewp.com/troubleshooting/site-connection/why-cant-i-add-some-of-my-sites\" title=\"Add site FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ page</a> or <a href=\"https://managewp.com/contact\" title=\"ManageWP Contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20managewp%20compare%20to%20backup%20plugins%20like%20backupbuddy%2C%20backwpup%2C%20updraftplus%2C%20wp-db-backup%20%3F'>\nHow does ManageWP compare to backup plugins like BackupBuddy, Backwpup, UpdraftPlus, WP-DB-Backup ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a limit to what a PHP based backup can do, that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve built a completely different backup &#8211; cloud based, incremental, it keeps working long after others have failed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20managewp%20compare%20with%20clone%20plugins%20like%20duplicator%2C%20wp%20migrate%20db%2C%20all-in-one%20wp%20migration%2C%20xcloner%20%3F'>\nHow does ManageWP compare with clone plugins like Duplicator, WP Migrate DB, All-in-One WP Migration, XCloner ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These solutions are simple A-B cloning solutions that tend to break in critical moments. ManageWP does it more intelligently. We first upload the backup archive to a cloud infrastructure that we control, and then we transfer it to the destination website. This effectively compartmentalizes the process into two separate steps, making the whole cloning experience much more robust and stress free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20worker%20php7%20compatible%3F'>\nIs Worker PHP7 compatible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, ManageWP Worker is fully compatible with PHP7. We also have chunks of backward compatible code, that triggers in case you&#8217;re still running PHP5.x &#8211; if your code check comes up with a compatibility flag, just ignore it.</p>\n<p>Got more questions? <a href=\"https://managewp.com/contact\" title=\"ManageWP Contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact us!</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
