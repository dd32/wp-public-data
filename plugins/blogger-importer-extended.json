Offering 20 free imports should be enough for personal blogs without hitting the Google API quota limit.

If a post has more than one image, the first image will be downloaded to the media library and set as the featured image. Any other images will display in the post content, but will be hosted on Google rather than WordPress.</p>\n<p>With the unlimited version, all content is imported into WordPress (unless you select the option to exclude them). There are no limits on the number of posts, pages, comments, images or labels. The only thing which is not imported is draft or sheduled posts.</p>\n<p>With both versions, you can setup all the required 301 redirects from Blogger to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What if I have A LOT blog posts?</h3>\n<p>If you want to import more than 20 posts, please consider purchasing an <a href=\"https://www.pipdig.co/shop/blogger-importer-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">unlimited license</a>.
