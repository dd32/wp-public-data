        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I reorder a variation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The order that the unique products appear on the edit product page doesn&#8217;t matter on the front end. You can re-order the variations (left panel) by dragging and dropping.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the number of columns on the shop and category page</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can goto HDCommerce -&gt; Advanced -&gt; and change the Default Product View Type / Columns setting</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My theme is displaying product titles twice</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No problem! Every theme is coded and designed differently. By default, HDCommerce displays product titles as an H2 tag. You can change this to an H1, H3, or even remove it altogether in the HDCommerce settings -&gt; Advanced section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help, my cart is being cached!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HDCommerce is compatible with WP Fastest Cache out of the box, and we should be compatible with W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, WP Rocket, Comet Cache, and Cachify as well. If you are having caching problems, most cache plugins have an &#8220;excludes&#8221; setting where you can add custom pages so they won&#8217;t get cached. As HDCommerce grows, more cache plugins will start to offer compatibility with us automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a feature request!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please submit your feature request here by using the <strong>support</strong> tab to the right.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Keywords</h4>\n<p>\n<p>hdcommerce, ecommerce, e-commerce, store, shop, products, sales, sell, online store, hdc, hd commerce</p>\n</p>\n\n",
