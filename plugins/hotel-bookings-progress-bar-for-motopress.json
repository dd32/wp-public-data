Booking Confirmation (and Reservation Submitted if bookings are not directly confirmed)</p>\n<p>You can change the default text of each step and colors of the progress bar under the plugin settings (Settings &gt; Booking Progress Bar).

The font color will be inherited from the theme styling, so you can use the theme settings or custom CSS to change this if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20or%20translate%20the%20text%3F'>\nHow can I change or translate the text?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the plugin settings (Settings &gt; Booking Progress Bar) you can change the text and basic formatting of each step. This is useful if you would like to translate the text into another language or would like to change the text. For example, if your confirmation mode is by admin manually, you make like to change step 3 text to &#8216;Booking request sent&#8217; instead of &#8216;Booking confirmed&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20extra%20styling%20like%20margin%20and%20padding%3F'>\nCan I add extra styling like margin and padding?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, using custom CSS and the selector &#8216;#progressBar&#8217; you can style the progress bar to your wildest dreams.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
