The red border was also added in case of a white background. This helps give the bar its own individual look.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it easy to setup?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By all means, all you need to do is sign-up for a Yelp API key (from the link provided within the settings) and enter the phone number of your business.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The Yelp Bar is activated but not showing up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure you&#8217;ve emptied your cache if you&#8217;re using any sort of caching tool.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t there any styling settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whilst you can always edit the plug-in code &amp; related files, Yelp has a strict display code which this plugin abides by. Out of respect for these API conditions, I&#8217;ve not created any detailed customization settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
