Each member of your team can publish to any of the blogs you manage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20my%20user%20token%20in%20airstory%3F'>\nWhere do I find my user token in Airstory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In Airstory, go under Settings &rsaquo; My Account to find your user token.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20paste%20my%20user%20token%20in%20wordpress%3F'>\nWhere do I paste my user token in WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In WordPress, go under Users &rsaquo; Your Profile to paste your Airstory user token.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='our%20team%20is%20using%20airstory.%20can%20we%20each%20send%20our%20own%20drafts%20to%20the%20same%20wordpress%20blog%3F'>\nOur team is using Airstory. Can we each send our own drafts to the same WordPress blog?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! This plugin is installed at the Network Admin level. Each member of your team should update their WordPress profiles with their unique Airstory user tokens. This way, you can each send your own posts to your team blog, with authorship.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20my%20post%20titled%20%22document%22%20in%20wordpress%3F'>\nWhy is my post titled &#8220;document&#8221; in WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin names your post in WordPress using the label on the Airstory project <em>tab</em> you exported. The first tab in Airstory is named &#8220;document,&#8221; which is why your WordPress post is titled &#8220;document.&#8221; You can change that in Airstory or in WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20content%20from%20any%20airstory%20tab%20to%20wordpress%3F'>\nCan I send content from any Airstory tab to WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Go to the Airstory tab with the content you want to publish, and export to WordPress while you’re on that tab. Tabs cannot be combined into a single WordPress export.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20content%20from%20any%20airstory%20project%20to%20wordpress%3F'>\nCan I send content from any Airstory project to WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

How do I resolve this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a safety feature built into the plugin to avoid any unexpected behavior due to missing dependencies. The Airstory plugin relies on two common PHP extensions: &#8220;dom&#8221; (for DOM manipulation, used to clean up incoming content from Airstory) and &#8220;openssl&#8221; (used to securely encrypt your Airstory user token before storing it).</p>\n<p>All modern hosts (Liquid Web, WP Engine, SiteGround, etc.) should support these extensions out of the box, but if you&#8217;re running your own server you&#8217;ll want to <a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-check-php-modules-with-phpinfo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ensure these extensions are both installed and activated</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
