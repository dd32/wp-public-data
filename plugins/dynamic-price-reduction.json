Well Dynamic Price Reduction will save you the hassle of having to manually reduce your product price each week. It also removes the need to create vouchers to reduce the price of the product to account for the time that has passed.</p>\n<p>Dynamic Price Reduction allows you to set the start date of your course/class on the product tab and set the number of weeks the course will run for. Then each week the product price will be reduced by the amount. For example if you have a course which costs €100 and runs for 5 weeks, each week €20 will be deducted from the course. After the number of weeks has expired the price will revert to the original for the start of the new term.</p>\n<p>Benefits of Dynamic Price Reduction include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save time having to manually reduce your product price weekly.</li>\n<li>Save time having to create unnecessary vouchers.</li>\n</ul>\n",
