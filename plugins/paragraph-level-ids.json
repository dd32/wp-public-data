        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the plug-in</li>\n<li>Unzip the files and upload rs-para-level-ids.php to the wp-content/plugins directory.</li>\n<li>Visit the plugins section of your WordPress Dashboard.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin</li>\n<li>Nothing will be changed in your website&#8217;s source code until you visit the &#8216;Paragraph IDs&#8217; options under the WordPress &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu, and update the settings according to your taste.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What kind of tags does the plugin operate on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin only makes additions to &lt;p&gt; tags that have no other attributes.  If any other part of the content or system gives a paragraph tag any kind of styling, name or id, then this plugin will simply ignore it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are the ids and anchors added?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The id attributes are all added dynamically as the page is generated.  The plugin works by counting the number of paragraphs and adding an id or name based on that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when I change the content of my post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the content changes and the author reduces or adds to the number of paragraphs in the text, the anchor or paragraph id will change accordingly.</p>\n<p>This plugin therefore works best with archived content that is not likely to change.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I think your plugin could be improved &#8211; Would you like some help with it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely, I&#8217;m at almost the limit of my coding skills here!
