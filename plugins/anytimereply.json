Also, giving same information to clients is waste of time for business. So, after a few years of research, we have come up with AnyTimeReply support system, which is affordable to small to medium sized business and also individual professionals. We at AnyTimeReply believe that customer satisfaction is critical to win customers loyalty, and loyalty is one of driving factors to increase company revenues.</p>\n<p>Key features:<br />\n   * Free and easy to use<br />\n   * Collect leads<br />\n   * Easy and Free FaceBook chatbot<br />\n   * Round the clock support for your client<br />\n   * Immediate response, no long support chat queue for visitors<br />\n   * Reduces human resources and get more satisfied clients<br />\n   * You can train your assistant yourself<br />\n   * You can check chat log, correct their mistakes and even can continue chat<br />\n   * You can get unsolved queries in your ATR system<br />\n   * Know your clients exact requirements</p>\n",
