        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the contents of the zip file to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/password-vault</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Set a secure password as the SECURE_AUTH_KEY value in the wp-config.php file</li>\n<li>Configure the settings through the settings page.</li>\n<li>Begin documenting account information through the tools page.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin allows you to securly store usernames and passwords online in a password protected repository.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the encryption key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To change the encryption key, first enter the new key in the wp-config.php file.  Then open the settings page,<br />\nand put the old key in the field at the bottom and save the settings.  A new menu option at the top of the page<br />\nwill appear called &#8220;Complete Key Change&#8221;.  Select this link, check the checkbox to verify that you have a backup<br />\nand click the &#8220;Complete Key Change&#8221; button.  Depending on how much data you have in the main table and the audit<br />\ntable this process may run quickly or it may take a long time.  No matter how long it takes do NOT stop the process.</p>\n<p>Stopping the process can cause you to loose access to some or all of the data.</p>\n<p>After the process is done, go back to the main page and remove the old encryption key and save the settings.  This will<br />\nremove the link from the menu at the top of the page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many Groups can I have?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically as many as you want.  The field is an INT(11) in MySQL so you should be able to have 2,147,483,647 groups.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where are the users configured?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The users are simply users from WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can a user see an account if they don&#8217;t have access to it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sort of.  They will be able to see that the account exists, but they won&#8217;t be able to see the password.  Even if they<br />\nfigure out the ID number and stick it in the URL field manually it still won&#8217;t show them the password.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can someone have write permissions without read permissions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. If you grant write permissions to a user, they get read permissions automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can someone have owner permissions without read or write permissions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. If you grant owner permissions to a user, they get read and write permissions automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What takes priority, group or user permissions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Neither, they are merged.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My site is behind a load balancer, and I&#8217;ve got the &#8220;Requires SSL&#8221; setting checked, but it isn&#8217;t working.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is because the application is using the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/is_ssl\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">is_ssl()</a> function within WordPress<br />\nwhich isn&#8217;t correctly handle load balancers.  For now it is recommended that you follow the directions in the is_ssl()<br />\ndocument and add the &#8220;Force SSL URL Scheme&#8221; plugin to your site so that the site forces SSL.  If this doesn&#8217;t work, contact us<br />\nvia the forums and we&#8217;ll figure it out.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does auditing turn itself on every time I upgrade or activate the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is done as a security precaution.  Every time the plugin is activated it turns auditing back on if it is disabled.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
