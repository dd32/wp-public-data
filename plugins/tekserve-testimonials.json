        "faq": "<h4>How do I show my quotes on a page?</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to call custom post types in the loop, and you can display a single post with some code for a custom shortcode. This plugin includes a shortcode that is compatible with the Genesis framework; if enough people ask I can do a little more to add compatibility outside of the Genesis framework.</p>\n<h4>Can I display a section with rotating quotes?</h4>\n<p>Sure! You&#8217;ll have to write the rotator, and you can set up an admin panel to select the quotes, or just use shortcode attributes. However, there are already many existing plugins that already provide this function, and that may be easier for you to implement. This was written to provide a lightweight implementation of a specific function: to enter, store, and display a single quote at a time.</p>\n<h4>Can I display more than one quote on a page?</h4>\n<p>Yep. You can either use the shortcode several times to display multiple specific quotes:</p>\n<pre><code>[tekserve-testimonial id=\"1\"] [tekserve-testimonial id=\"2\"] [tekserve-testimonial id=\"3\"] </code></pre>\n<p>Or assign a Testimonial Type to a set of quotes and display them in an unordered list with a single shortcode:</p>\n<pre><code>[tekserve-testimonial type=\"just-these\"] </code></pre>\n<h4>How do I find a quote in the Testimonials list? There&#8217;s no title!</h4>\n<p>Actually, there is a title, you just don&#8217;t choose it yourself. This plugin automatically assigns your testimonial a title that shows you the quote, source, and id (for the shortcode).</p>\n",
