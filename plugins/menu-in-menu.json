If you then need to maintain one of the items in the subset, you only need to update<br />\none menu, and the change automatically gets reflected in all the other menus that include that subset!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s as easy to use as adding a Post, Page, Category or Tag to your menu&#8230;</p>\n<p>With the plugin activated, go to your Menus page in admin.<br />\nAs well as being able to add Posts, Categories, etc, to your menu, you should now see a metabox for<br />\n<strong>Navigation Menus</strong> which has checkboxes for each of your defined Menus (if you don&#8217;t see the metabox,<br />\ncheck your Screen Options settings at the top of the page).<br />\nAll you need to do is create your submenu (as you would any other menu),<br />\nopen the menu you want to insert the new submenu into,<br />\nselect the submenu from the Navigation Menus metabox,<br />\nAdd it,<br />\nand position it.<br />\nSave and you&#8217;re done!</p>\n<p>The inserted Menu <em>replaces</em> the Navigation Menu item in the menu. You can insert multiple instances of the<br />\nsame submenu into one menu, and you can include a submenu into as many other menus as you need.</p>\n<h4>Perpetual Loops</h4>\n<p>The one thing that the plugin guards against is getting into a never-ending loop : it won&#8217;t prevent you<br />\nsetting one up (see FAQs as to why), but it <em>will not</em> output any submenu that has itself as an antecedent.</p>\n<p>For example, you can set up menus such that Menu A includes Menu B, which includes Menu C. Fine, no problem.<br />\nHowever, if you were to also add Menu B into Menu C as a Navigation Menu item,<br />\nthen no matter which menu you choose to output, you have a potential loop<br />\n(&#8230; B, includes C, includes B, includes C, &#8230; and so on).</p>\n<p>If WP_DEBUG is enabled, the plugin will print a warning wherever it has taken action to prevent a loop condition.<br />\nThis behaviour can be changed by hooking into a filter (see FAQs).</p>\n<h4>Frontend Only</h4>\n<p>The plugin only performs the menu replacement at the frontend of WordPress (ie. not on Admin pages).<br />\nThis behaviour can be changed by hooking into a filter (see FAQs),<br />\nbut please ensure that you do <strong>not</strong> enable it for the Menus admin page!</p>\n",

        "faq": "<p>If you have a question or problem that is not covered here, please use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/menu-in-menu\" rel=\"ugc\">Support forum</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I see the Navigation Menus metabox on the Menus page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check your Screen Options (top of the page). Screen Options give you the ability to turn off/on metaboxes,<br />\nand it&#8217;s possible that Naviagtion Menus is turned off : just activate the checkbox in Screen Options and<br />\nthe Navigation Menus metabox should appear (assuming the plugin is activated, of course).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t an included menu appearing in the menu I put it in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that the inclusion might have created a perpetual loop, and the plugin won&#8217;t allow that &#8211; it<br />\nsimply refuses to output any menu that is contained within itself (ie. has itself as an antedecent). If you enable<br />\nWP_DEBUG you will see a message <em>if</em> the plugin has taken action to prevent a perpetual loop.<br />\nIf it&#8217;s not a perpetual loop situation then it may be that another plugin is getting in the way. And that is<br />\na lot harder to resolve!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the plugin stop me setting up a perpetual loop?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because they have the potential to be used deliberately.<br />\nTake an example where Menu A includes Menu B, and Menu includes Menu A.<br />\nIf you output Menu A, you&#8217;ll get Menu A with Menu B included.<br />\nIf you output Menu B, you&#8217;ll get Menu B with Menu A included.<br />\nThey may be occasions where this is useful.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I resolve an unintended perpetual loop?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Enable WP_DEBUG and check the message produced by the plugin. Part of the message gives the names of menus<br />\nthat have included one another, the last one being the one that would have caused the loop. Somewhere<br />\npreceding it you should see the same menu name. The first name was the menu that was requested to be<br />\ndisplayed, and it included the 2nd, which in turn included the 3rd, etc. You can use this to determine<br />\nhow you need to restructure your menus so as to avoid any perpetual loops.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I prevent the notification of a perpetual loop, while keeping WP_DEBUG enabled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a filter you can hook into. Add the following code (modified to suit) to your theme&#8217;s<br />\nfunctions.php (or wherever you feel is more appropriate)&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'mim_notify_recursion', your_function_name );\nfunction your_function_name( $notify ) { return false; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, <code>$notify</code> is <strong>false</strong> <em>unless</em> WP_DEBUG is enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get notification of perpetual loops without having to enable WP_DEBUG?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the flip side of the previous question,<br />\nand you simply need to return <strong>true</strong> &#8211; instead of false &#8211; from a &#8216;mim_notify_recursion&#8217; filter (see above).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I enable the menu replacement for Admin pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there&#8217;s a filter you can hook into. Add the following code (modified to suit) to your theme&#8217;s<br />\nfunctions.php (or wherever you feel is more appropriate)&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'mim_expand_menus', your_function_name );\nfunction your_function_name( $expand, $current_screen ) {\n  //ex. enables everywhere except Menus admin page...\n  return $expand || empty( $current_screen ) || $current_screen != 'nav-menus';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default, <code>$expand</code> is <strong>true</strong> <em>unless</em> running Admin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
