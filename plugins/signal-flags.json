This plugin provides letter flags in square and 4:3 aspect ratios, but all the pennants are 2:1 and the triangle flags 4:3. Designs are a compromise based on experience mainly of flags commonly used in dinghy and yacht racing in the United Kingdom, and those supplied for use on yachts in the UK and Europe.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I change the colours?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin provides flags in two different colour schemes:<br />\n* <code>natural</code> which aim to look like real flags<br />\n* <code>primary</code> which uses primary colours.</p>\n<p>We are looking at options for creating custom colour schemes in the plugin, and are also working on a tool to create custom flag files and upload them for use in the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I change the shapes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin provides two different shapes for letter flags:<br />\n* <code>rect</code> (rectangular) which is normally used in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and is provided here in a 4:3 aspect ratio<br />\n* <code>square</code> which are normally used in the US</p>\n<p>We are working on a tool to create custom flag files and upload them for use in the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I change the thickness or colour of the outline?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin does not support this. We are working on a tool to create custom flag files and upload them for use in the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I change the designs e.g. the size of the circle on numeral pennants 1 and 2?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at the moment, but we are working on a tool to create custom flag files and upload them for use in the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you think a design is simply <em>wrong</em> then look at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/signal-flags/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> to see if this has already been discussed or start a new topic.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
