I was prompted to develop this plugin due to encountering bugs, lack of display options, and mostly the lack of updates and support for this original plugin.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='q%3A%20does%20this%20plugin%20require%20a%20configuration%20%3F'>\nQ: Does this plugin require a configuration ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: No ! Just activate the plugin and add the p5.js block to any page or post to get started.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20how%20should%20i%20size%20my%20canvas%20with%20this%20plugin%20%3F'>\nQ: How should I size my canvas with this plugin ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: It is highly recommended to define the height and width of your block in the block settings panel, and use <code>createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)</code> to ensure that your sketche&#8217;s sizing is responsive. However, you can define a fixed size for the canvas in your script using for example <code>createCanvas(600, 400)</code>. In this case, the size of the block will adapt to the canvas size defined in the script automatically, unless the size of the block has been defined in its setting panel.</p>\n<p>In order for your sketch to be rendered properly when using <code>createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)</code>, it is important to remember that in the context of the p5.js block, the variables <code>windowWidth</code> and <code>windowHeight</code> refer to the width and height of the block. When using dynamic sizing in your script, define the desired height and width of your canvas in the block settings panel.</p>\n<p>Warning : when using <code>windowHeight</code>, the preview won&#8217;t work. You can fix this by using an integer value (e.g. <code>createCanvas(windowWidth, 500)</code>), or leave as is, since it won&#8217;t affect the final page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20how%20can%20i%20make%20a%20canvas%20that%20takes%20the%20full%20width%20of%20the%20window%20%3F'>\nQ: How can I make a canvas that takes the full width of the window ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: To achieve this effect, select the &#8220;Full width&#8221; alignment option in the block&#8217;s toolbar, and use <code>createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)</code> in your script. Don&#8217;t forget to set the height of your canvas in the block settings panel. The width setting will be ignored.</p>\n<p>A horizontal scroll bar can appear in pages using full width alignment. To fix it, you can add this CSS to your site&#8217;s custom CSS:</p>\n<pre><code>`css\n</code></pre>\n<p>body {<br />\n    overflow-x: hidden;<br />\n}<br />\n    `</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20where%20can%20i%20contribute%20to%20the%20project%3F'>\nQ: Where can I contribute to the project?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: You can contribute on the <a href=\"https://github.com/florian-rieder/gutenbergp5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a> of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
