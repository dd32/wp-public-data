The Local Geo Search pages use the same theme the rest of your site uses and includes all of the html head tags that your site includes. Like any other page, you can embed videos and images too!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20local%20geo%20search%20alone%20get%20my%20website%20top%20page%20results%3F'>\nCan Local Geo Search alone get my website top page results?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We cannot guarantee top page results for your key terms and locations.
