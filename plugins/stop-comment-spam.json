        "description": "<p>If you use Akismet, you are likely happy how it recognizes spam, but probably it still bothers you that you have to check recognized spam and reject it. If your blog is target of heavy spam, you may get large number of spams a day, and although Akismet prevents spam to show up on your blog, you still have to administer (delete) it.</p>\n<p>Stop Comment Spam jumps in that place. It is very likely that you may identify large amount of spam by very precise keywords, and if spam contains specified keyword, it may undoubtedly be considered as 100% spam and rejected without need for Akismet or you to interfere.</p>\n<p>For instance, my blog is overwhelmed by, what we call Russian spam. Thing is that my blog uses Cyrillic alphabet, and Russian spammers recognize that, so they pay more attention to spam it with comments containing Russian language. As my blog is not in Russian language, I needed tool to recognize if Russian language is used in a comment, and if that is the case, to simply reject it. That is how this plugin became. It also helps a lot with Chinese spam and other verious automated spammers.</p>\n<p>You may use it to prevent using obscene words or other unwanted words in comments posted on your site. You just define list of words that are unacceptable, and any comment containing any of them would be rejected.</p>\n<p>Also, you may set similar keyword rules for comment author web site URL. If you have some nasty spammer that is persistent to advertise his site, you just put his site url in forbidden url list and he is gone, any comment using that site as commenter site URL will be rejected.</p>\n<p>There is option to limit number of allowed links in comment text. That would help stopping link spammers. All you have to do is set number of allowed links within comment. If spammer posts one more than allowed, his comment will be refused.</p>\n<p>This plugin is simple and straightforward. It will help you to filter out exact words or phrases, but it is not strong against more profane spammers. But, that is what Akismet is for. This plugin works as Akismet companion. It filters out obvious spam and lets Akismed deal with rest.</p>\n<p>Author uses this plugin personally since year 2009, and it prooved to be very helpful. It stopped two times more spamm comments than Akismet. This does not mean Akismet is worse, just that two thirds of spam comming to my blog were so obvious that simple tool like StopCommentSpam could handle it leaving Akismet to deal with less but more delicate spam.</p>\n<h3>Keyword examples</h3>\n<p>To stop spam comments using Russian language add these as forbidden comments contents:</p>\n<p>ы</p>\n<p>ю</p>\n<p>щ</p>\n<p>я</p>\n<p>э</p>\n<p>ь</p>\n<p>й</p>\n<p>ё</p>\n<p>пасибо</p>\n<p>что</p>\n<p>все</p>\n<p>Все</p>\n<p>Мне</p>\n<p>мне</p>\n<p>автор</p>\n<p>Что</p>\n<p>To stop some spam linking to spam or malicious sitees ad these to forbidden URL contents:</p>\n<p>.cn</p>\n<p>healthcare</p>\n<p>drugstore</p>\n<p>mail</p>\n<p>loan</p>\n<p>finance</p>\n<p>insurance</p>\n<p>viagra</p>\n<p>baidu.com</p>\n<p>clearance</p>\n<p>forum</p>\n<p>xxx</p>\n<p>topic</p>\n<p>gscraper</p>\n<p>jimdo</p>\n<p>nikeschuhe</p>\n<p>jordan</p>\n<p>discount</p>\n<p>money</p>\n<p>pharmacy</p>\n",
