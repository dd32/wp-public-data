It also deals with the export of personal data outside the EU. The main<br />\nobjective of the GDPR is to give citizens and residents control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory<br />\nenvironment of international business by unifying regulation within the EU. When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace<br />\nthe Data Protection Directive (officially Directive 95/46 / EC) of 1995. The Regulation was adopted on April 27, 2016.<br />\nIt becomes an executive as of May 25, 2018 after a transition of two years and, unlike a directive, does not oblige<br />\nnational governments to approve any enabling legislation, so it is directly binding and applicable.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows you to comply with GDPR by sending a personalized email for each company that will include a single<br />\nconfirmation link, which the company must access and complete a small form to give their consent. In this form you can<br />\ninclude each of the checkboxes that the company must accept or not, registering this information in the database to recover<br />\nat any time.
