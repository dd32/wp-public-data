        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does this plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Better Redirects for Gravity Forms</strong> uses a combination of WordPress action hooks and Gravity Forms filters to find out if your forms have a <strong>confirmation redirect URL</strong> specified. So if you have a page / post / custom post type / taxonomy / front page / shop page / or any other link that you have updated within WordPress, your Gravity forms will still redirect to the proper URL.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20for%20external%20urls%3F'>\nDoes this work for external URLs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this does not work for external URLs. <strong>Better Redirects for Gravity Forms</strong> will have no trace that the external URL has been modified. If you require this feature, please submit it as a <strong>customisation request</strong> within the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/better-redirects-for-gravity-forms/\" rel=\"ugc\">Support forums</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20your%20code%3F'>\nCan I see your code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, please visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/michael-sumner/better-redirects-for-gravity-forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository link</a>.
