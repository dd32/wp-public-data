What is the difference between ACTIVE and CLOSED conversations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not much actually, and really the difference is really up to you. When building the app we&#8217;ve grouped the chat messages to make your conversations by open or close to help make things more clear. However, you can close your conversation if you don’t want it to be on the top. You won&#8217;t lose data by closing anything, and you will still get new messages. Active / Closed is just to simplify and optimize your conversations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='2.%20types%20of%20attributes'>\n2.
