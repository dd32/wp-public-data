        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20%22star%22'>\nWhat is a &#8220;star&#8221;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In Custom Ratings, a &#8220;star&#8221; is a general term used to describe the rating object. A &#8220;star&#8221; can be a cupcake, heart, star, smiley face, shoe, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20rating%20tally%3F'>\nWhat is a rating tally?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The rating tally is a non-interactive display of the current ratings of a post. This is displayed visually as the number of stars out of a total of 5 stars. This hooks into the &#8220;the_excerpt&#8221; filter. Where ever that filter is used, the Custom Ratings rating tally will be displayed (unless disabled in the settings).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20vote%20display%3F'>\nWhat is a vote display?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The vote display is an interactive component which allows users to rate a post. This rating can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars out of 5. The vote display hooks into &#8220;the_content&#8221; filter.  Where ever that filter is used, the Custom Ratings vote display will be displated (unless disabled in the settings).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20with%20wpml%3F%20how%20does%20the%20cumulative%20tallying%20system%20work%3F'>\nWill this work with WPML? How does the cumulative tallying system work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Custom Ratings has been designed with WPML compatiblity in mind. All of the votes of a specific post are shared amongst the different language versions. One caveat is that a post in the default language must be created in order for Custom Ratings to function. The default language post holds all of the rating information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20custom%20post%20types%3F'>\nDoes this work with custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can choose which (if any) custom post types Custom Ratings gets applied to.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20caching%20of%20ajax%20vote%20data%20work%3F'>\nHow does the caching of AJAX vote data work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each time a page loads with Custom Ratings components, an AJAX request is sent to the web server to get the vote information for the posts on that page. The &#8220;Expires&#8221; and &#8220;Cache-Control&#8221; values can be specified for this request if desired. CDNs and other caching tools can read these HTTP headers and handle the caching from there.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20custom%20ratings%20in%20my%20custom%20development%3F'>\nHow can I use Custom Ratings in my custom development?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Custom Ratings has been designed to offer lots of flexibility for custom theme development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Custom_Ratings::get_rating_object_image_src()</code> can be used in your theme to get the &#8216;star&#8217; (rating object) image</li>\n<li><code>echo Custom_Ratings_Public::display()</code> can be used to manually output the rating tally</li>\n<li><code>echo Custom_Ratings_Public::vote()</code> can be used to manually output the rating vote interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters\" title=\"creating your own queries\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">creating your own queries</a>, you can order the results in different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The post meta key <code>_wpcr_rating_stars_avg</code> can be used to order posts by rating average</li>\n<li>The post meta key <code>_wpcr_rating_stars_count</code> can be used to order posts by total rating count</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
