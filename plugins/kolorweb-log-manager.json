You will always know when there are errors and can access the log viewer with one click for more details.</p>\n<h4>Toggle Debugging</h4>\n<p>Now you can enable / disable debugging with one click. It is no longer necessary to manually edit wp-config.php. Head over to the help section, follow the simple instructions to enable this feature, and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>\n<h4>Always keep an eye on the size of the debug.log file</h4>\n<p>With this feature your debug.log file will never be larger than you want.</p>\n<h4>Smart Download</h4>\n<p>When you click to download debug.log, a version of the smart log will be downloaded. What is a smart register? It is a version of debug.log similar to the group view. Only the last unique entry for each error will be included. The exported file will be in html format and can be opened directly in the browser for quick reading, or in your favorite text editor.</p>\n<p>This makes it much easier to parse the file, look for errors, and skip all redundancy due to the many possible occurrences of the same error.</p>\n<h4>One Click Error Filtering</h4>\n<p>You can filter errors with a single click on the error legend. Click on multiple error types to filter for multiple error types. Click a second time to deselect an error type. This feature works great even with custom errors.</p>\n<h4>Clear Log</h4>\n<p>Easily clear your debug.log file with one click.</p>\n<h4>Group View</h4>\n<p>Log entries are grouped, making it much easier to see each unique error. You can click to list the date and time when the error occurred. Grouped items can be sorted by newest or latest.</p>\n<h4>List View</h4>\n<p>All log entries are listed by date and time and can be sorted by newest or latest.</p>\n<h4>Sort By Date</h4>\n<p>Log entries can be sorted by date by newest or latest in either list or group views.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Refresh</h4>\n<p>Log automatically refreshes to display new errors.  No need to manually refresh the screen. However, there is a link to manually refresh if desired.</p>\n<h4>Realtime Search</h4>\n<p>Quickly search and find specific errors.</p>\n<h4>Custom Errors</h4>\n<p>Now you can easily define custom error messages.  When that error occures in your log file it can have it&#8217;s own color coding, count and label.  Testing for custom errors or issues is now much easier.</p>\n<h4>Error Color Legend</h4>\n<p>Errors are color coded to make it easier to identify certain errors such as fatal, notices, warnings, deprecated and database.</p>\n<h4>Debug Status</h4>\n<p>Debugging status is located at the top of the viewer and admin bar to make it easy to see if debugging is enabled or disabled.</p>\n<p>You can also see log size and last modified timestamp. This information automatically updates when changed.</p>\n<h4>Dashboard Widget</h4>\n<p>This widget gives you a quick summary regarding how many and what type of errors are in the log view. You can also access the log viewer with just one click.</p>\n<h4>Persistent Settings</h4>\n<p>Customize your log viewer to your heart&#8217;s content. Your settings such as view, sort order, sidebar folding and more persist accross logins. When you login as your user, log viewer will be just like you left it.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20to%20i%20access%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to I access the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once activated, you can access the plugin one of 3 ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the &#8220;Log Manager&#8221; link in the admin bar</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Tools&#8221; in the sidebar, then click on &#8220;Log Manager&#8221;</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Dashboard&#8221;, then from the dashboard click the link in the widget</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20debug%20toggling%3F'>\nWhat is debug toggling?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This feature allows you to enable/disable debugging with a click. No more manually updating WP_DEBUG in wp-config.php.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20enable%20debug%20toggling%3F'>\nHow do I enable debug toggling?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the plugin is activated, the system tries to automatically set all the DEBUG constants in your wp-config.php<br />\nIf toggle button does not appear in the settings means that your wp-config.php is not writable or not found in the default WordPress configuration path.<br />\nIf wp-config.php is not writable, you will have to manually set the values for DEBUG constants and you will not be able to use the one-click debug toggle function. The plugin will continue to work without problems, but without the magic of this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='step%201'>\nSTEP 1\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1.1  To manually enable WordPress debugging you can paste these lines of code into the wp-config.php file</p>\n<p>define( &#8216;WP_DEBUG&#8217;, true );<br />\ndefine( &#8216;WP_DEBUG_LOG&#8217;, true );<br />\ndefine( &#8216;WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY&#8217;, false );</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='step%202'>\nSTEP 2\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>2.1  To manually disable WordPress debugging you can paste these lines of code into the wp-config.php file</p>\n<p>define( &#8216;WP_DEBUG&#8217;, false );<br />\ndefine( &#8216;WP_DEBUG_LOG&#8217;, false );<br />\ndefine( &#8216;WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY&#8217;, false );</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Refresh the page in the browser and you are ready to go. Happy coding with WordPress!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20filter%20errors%3F'>\nHow do I filter errors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Errors are grouped by error types. These error types are listed at the top of the viewer and color coded. You can click on any of these error to filter results by those errors.</p>\n<p>You can click on multiple errors to limit results to only those errors. Click a second time to deselect that error type. This feature works great with custom errors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20custom%20errors%3F'>\nWhat are custom errors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In settings, you can define custom errors.  Each custom error has a key, label, and colors. The key is used in your custom error message in order to allow the log manager to define and manage your custom errors. The label and color are used to easily filter and categorize the error while browsing the log.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20custom%20errors%3F'>\nHow do I use custom errors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you write an error to the log, you have to start the error message with a # and the custom error key followed by a :.</p>\n<p>Example: If you defined a custom error with a key: my-custom-error</p>\n<p>In your code: error_log( &#8216;#my-custom-error:  The error message goes here&#8217; );</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20refresh%20the%20log%20viewer%3F'>\nDo I need to refresh the log viewer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The log manager will automatically refresh and display new entries every 15 seconds by default. This feature is implemented using AJAX to avoid reloading the entire page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20group%20view%3F'>\nWhat is Group View?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In Group View similar error entries are grouped together making it much easier to see unique errors and when they happened. Click on show details to view all the dates of the events that generated the error.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20count%20in%20the%20admin%20bar%3F'>\nWhat is the count in the admin bar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The count shown in the admin bar represent the number of unique errors in the log. So if there are 10 entries for the same error, it will only count as 1.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20sidebar%20folding%3F'>\nWhat is sidebar folding?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the sidebar will be folded when the log viewer is active. This increases the viewing. To disable, or toggle this behavior, click on settings then &#8220;Fold sidebar &#8230;&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20minimum%20length%20for%20a%20search%20query%3F'>\nWhat is the minimum length for a search query?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When using the realtime search, the search query must be at least 3 characters or more in length.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20report%20bugs%3F'>\nWhere can I report bugs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Report bugs and suggest ideas at:  https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/kolorweb-log-manager/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
