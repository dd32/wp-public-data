Child pages is a feature specific for the post type “Page” (not standard “Posts”) where you can say a given page is a child of some other page, it is useful to show a hierarchical list of pages. Here the synchronised pages are only similar in their layout. But if you want make that all synchronised pages have a parent page, it’s up to you to make it – you can automatically get the list of all synchronised pages from a given import.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
