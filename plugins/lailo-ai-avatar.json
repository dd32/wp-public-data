Integrated into your website, Lailo e.g. can help your website visitors with questions or searches or play back media of all kinds. This way, it inspires its users not only as a digital assistant, but also as an intelligent search and clever product advisor. And of course it speaks all the major world languages and even understands dialects without any problems. Its appearance is just as changeable as its possible applications. Further information about the Lailo &#8211; Ai Avatar, some sample application scenarios can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.lailo.ai/en/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.lailo.ai/en/</a>.</p>\n<h4>Step by step integration</h4>\n<p>In order to integrate your Lailo &#8211; AI Avatar, use this plugin to first create a new Lailo &#8211; AI Avatar configuration and choose a descriptive name for it. Next, connect your configuration with your Lailo &#8211; AI Avatar by copying the <a href=\"https://portal.lailo.ai/Bots/BotSettings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bot Secret</a> from the <a href=\"https://portal.lailo.ai\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lailo Portal</a> and inserting it into the corresponding configuration field. After this, specify how the Lailo &#8211; AI Avatar shall be displayed on your pages. Choose from multiple different widget types and easily adjust colors to fit your corporate design and theme. As a second last step, set the language of your Lailo &#8211; AI Avatar configuration to the same language as specified in the Lailo portal. Of course, Lailo &#8211; AI Avatars support all major languages. However, the plugin currently only supports English and German, so that we&#8217;d like to invite you to write an email to our <a href=\"mailto:&#x69;&#x6e;&#x66;&#x6f;&#064;&#108;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#111;&#x2e;&#x61;&#x69;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support team</a> if you need support for other languages. Finally, press the save button and you will find your new AI Avatar entry in the overview table.</p>\n<p>Once you successfully created your AI Avatar configuration you will find a short code in the rightest column of the configuration overview table. Copy the shortcode and open the the page in which you would like to insert your AI Avatar. Paste the shortcode to the top of your page. If you now visit this page the Avatar will be displayed and you can start interacting with it. Simple as that!</p>\n<p>Please note: you can have multiple Avatars with different settings throughout your website but make sure to always only add <strong>one shortcode per page.</strong> For example you can have a Half Screen Widget on your About Page and a Tiny Widget on your front page. Don&#8217;t forget to make sure that you inserted the correct shortcode (especially after editing the Avatar&#8217;s name).</p>\n<p>If you have any questions feel free to contact our <a href=\"mailto:&#x69;&#x6e;&#x66;&#x6f;&#064;&#108;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#111;&#x2e;&#x61;&#x69;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support team</a> at any time.</p>\n<h4>About</h4>\n<p>To learn more about the Lailo &#8211; Conversational UI Platform and its product Lailo &#8211; AI Avatar please visit our <a href=\"https://www.lailo.ai/en/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>.
