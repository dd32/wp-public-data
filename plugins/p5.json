If possible, choose a real timezone (eg &#8216;Europe/London&#8217;) which may be more accurate than offsets (&#8216;+2:00&#8217;) in some cases. </li>\n<li>\n<p>Be sure that your template files use the WordPress function to protect your content :</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Password_Protection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress codex</a> for more info.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What happens when a password expire ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The password is deleted from the database, so it is no longer attached to your post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Expired passwords aren&#8217;t deleted. Why ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin use WordPress cron feature to periodically delete expired passwords. Please make sure this functionnality is working on your WordPress installation. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cron-control/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP-Cron Control</a> plugin is a good way to see what&#8217;s happening with the cron.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My post is no longer protected. Why ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In WordPress, a post is protected as long as it has a password attached. When all the post passwords have expired, the post is no longer protected. It&#8217;s as simple as that.<br />\nTo keep a post protected, assign it a password without an expiration date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are my already defined passwords conserved after installation ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are my password-protected posts still protected when I deactivate/uninstall p5 plugin ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. After deactivation or uninstallation, your posts are still protected with the first password that was attached to each of them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My password is supposed to be expired, but I still can see my protected content</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Be sure that the timezone is well defined in /wp-admin/options-general.php</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin provide some hooks ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Actually these actions are defined :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>p5_insert_password, called after insertion of a new password</li>\n<li>p5_update_password, called after password update</li>\n<li>p5_save_password, called indifferently after p5_insert_password or p5_update_password.</li>\n<li>p5_delete_password, after a password has been deleted</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
