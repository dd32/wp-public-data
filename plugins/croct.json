        "description": "<p>Understand your audience interests and deliver the right content, to the right person, at the right time.</p>\n<p>Croct for WordPress provides powerful personalization capabilities using plain English. Personalize your content with more than 100 variables such as visitor context, device, browser, location, and much more!</p>\n<h3>WHAT IS CONTENT PERSONALIZATION?</h3>\n<p>Content personalization refers to the ability to generate content dynamically based on the visitor&#8217;s context.</p>\n<h3>WHAT&#8217;S IN IT FOR YOU IF YOU USE PERSONALIZATION?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Boost sales and engagement</li>\n<li>Sell more products</li>\n<li>Increase customer loyalty</li>\n<li>Increase the time users spend on your website</li>\n<li>Help visitors find the right content</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WHAT IS CROCT?</h3>\n<p>Croct is a personalization platform that provides a solution for developers to create natively personalized applications, as well as for marketing and product professionals to craft unique experiences based on the user&#8217;s behavior, interests, and browsing history.</p>\n<h3>CROCT PLUGIN FEATURES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully integrated with WordPress with just a few clicks.</li>\n<li>Shortcodes for inline content personalization.</li>\n<li>Over 100 user variables, such as interests, device, browser, geolocation, referrers, query strings, etc.</li>\n<li>Visitor interest tracking on a per-post basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>HOW TO SET-UP AND APPLY PERSONALIZATION?</h3>\n<p>It only takes a few clicks to install the plugin and unlock the power of personalization. No need to insert code snippets or play with the styling of the plugin.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, on the left-side menu, click Croct to open the settings page. Next, enter your app ID and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; to activate the integration.</p>\n<p>If you do not have an account, please <a href=\"https://croct.com?utm_source=plugin&amp;utm_medium=WordPress&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get in touch</a>, so we can set up an account for you.</p>\n<h3>HOW TO CAPTURE THE AUDIENCE&#8217;S INTERESTS?</h3>\n<p>Croct can help you understand your audience&#8217;s interests based on posts and pages they visit. All you need to do is tell Croct what interests are related to each post in the section &#8220;Croct &#8211; User Interest&#8221; (on the sidebar menu, under Document) when publishing or updating a post. You can enter multiple interests separated by commas.</p>\n<h3>HOW TO INSERT DYNAMIC CONTENT?</h3>\n<p>This plugin introduces two new shortcodes that allow you to create personalized posts.</p>\n<p>The <code>[personalized]</code> shortcode works as a placeholder for contextual information, while the <code>[if]</code> shortcode allows you to show a content block conditionally.</p>\n<p>The following example shows a conditional content block that will be displayed only for people who are sailing from Brazil. The content of the block is personalized according to the visitor&#8217;s city, with fallback to &#8220;Brazil&#8221; in case the visitor&#8217;s location is unknown.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[if condition=&#8221;location&#8217;s country is &#8216;BR'&#8221;]<br />\n  This paragraph is personalized for everyone who lives in [personalized value=&#8221;location&#8217;s city&#8221;]Brazil[/personalized].<br />\n  [/if]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the example shows the use of the <code>[personalized]</code> and <code>[if]</code> shortcodes combined, they can be used standalone. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello everyone from <code>[personalized value=\"location's city\"]</code>Brazil<code>[/personalized]</code>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Data Processing</h3>\n<p>This plugin collects information about the visitor activities and sends to Croct to help you better understand your audience and personalize the content for them.</p>\n<p>By installing and activating the Croct for WordPress plugin you agree to our <a href=\"https://croct.com/legal/customer/terms-of-service\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a> and <a href=\"https://croct.com/legal/customer/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\n",
