This means that the featured image is set (only first time) when a visitor loads the page where it needs to be shown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For new content, the featured image is set in the publishing process.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>No options page to setup</strong>, simply install and activate.</p>\n<p>If you want to exclude certain post type (e.g. pages), you can do it by using a filter. See <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/faq/\" rel=\"ugc\">FAQ</a> for more details.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy Add Thumbnail doesn&#8217;t add any plugin data</strong> to your WordPress database. It simply adds the _thumbnail_id meta key with the ID of the attachment to be used as feature image (just the same that WordPress does when you set it manually).</p>\n<p>Therefore it requires to have attached/uploaded at least one image to the post. If there&#8217;s not any image attached to the post, this plugin can&#8217;t help you.</p>\n<p>Easy Add Thumbnail has not any control over how/when/where your featured image is displayed in your site, <strong>the display of the featured image in your site is TOTALLY controlled by your theme</strong>, this includes size, position, display it or not&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.7 or higher.</li>\n<li>PHP 5.6 or higher.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ul>\n<li>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory of your WordPress installation (or install it directly from your dashboard) and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Remember that your theme must support the use of thumbnails, if not, the thumbnail information will be set in the database but you&#8217;ll not see them in your site.</p>\n",

And using this standard (and friendly) method WordPress simply has not any knowing about images not attached to the post.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20check%20if%20a%20post%20has%20%22attached%22%20images%3F'>\nHow can I check if a post has &#8220;attached&#8221; images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In that post edit screen, click the &#8220;Add Media button&#8221;, then click to &#8220;Media Library&#8221; tab, and select &#8220;Uploaded to this post&#8221; in the dropdown, you must see at least one image. If you see the &#8220;No items found.&#8221; message, that means that your images were not uploaded within that post. And therefore, the plugin can&#8217;t use any image to set as feature image.</p>\n<p>If you can see images when selecting &#8220;Uploaded to this post&#8221; but the plugin is not using it for feature image. You need to try for theme/plugins conflicting. Try using a WordPress default theme (i.e. Twenty Fifteen) and disabling all other plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20theme%20is%20showing%20big%20images%20instead%20of%20thumbnail%20sizes%2C%20what%20happens%3F'>\nMy theme is showing big images instead of thumbnail sizes, what happens?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As stated above this plugin uses standard WordPress method to set the featured image, this does not include any size information. <strong>The size used by your theme for displaying image thumbnails depends totally on how your theme was coded.</strong></p>\n<p>Contact to your theme author for support if you&#8217;re having this problem.</p>\n<p>You can find more information about how to properly show thumbnails in your theme on codex reference for <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_post_thumbnail\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the_post_thumbnail</a> (check &#8216;Thumbnail Sizes&#8217; section) and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/set_post_thumbnail_size\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">set_post_thumbnail_size</a> functions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20exclude%20pages%20or%20other%20post%20types%20%3F'>\nHow can I exclude pages or other post types ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use Easy Add Thumbnail for your pages or any other post type, you can exclude them by simply adding a little snippet of code to your theme functions.php file <strong>before enabling the plugin</strong>.<br />\nThe following example will exclude pages:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter ('eat_exclude_types', 'my_excluded_types', 10, 1);\nfunction my_excluded_types ( $exclude_types ){\n    $exclude_types[] = 'page'; \n    return $exclude_types;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to exclude a custom post type you need to know the value of &#8216;name&#8217; used in <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register_post_type()</a> function for registering that post type.<br />\ne.g. If you have a custom post type and its &#8216;name&#8217; is &#8216;book&#8217; the you&#8217;ll use:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter ('eat_exclude_types', 'my_excluded_types', 10, 1);\nfunction my_excluded_types ( $exclude_types ){\n    $exclude_types[] = 'book'; \n    return $exclude_types;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to exclude more than one post type just duplicate the $exclude_types[] line for each one.</p>\n<p><strong>This snippet must be added to your site BEFORE enabling Easy Add Thumbnail in your site</strong>,<br />\nif you add it later it will stop assigning the thumbnails for new posts in the excluded types after that moment, previous posts will not be modified.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20post%20thumbnail%20and%20featured%20image%20the%20same%3F'>\nIs the post thumbnail and featured image the same?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. When I released first version of this plugin years ago, featured images was named as <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post thumbnails</a>, but later WordPress team decided to change the name to &#8220;featured image&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In fact, WordPress core functions for featured image, still uses original <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_post_thumbnail\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">thumbnail</a> names.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because the plugin name (that can&#8217;t be changed in the Extend directory without having issues) says &#8220;thumbnail&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20works%20in%20wordpress%20older%20than%204.7%3F'>\nWill this plugin works in WordPress older than 4.7?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe, but WordPress installs older than 4.7 are not supported by me. <strong>Try at your own risk</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
