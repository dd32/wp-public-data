You can accept the design automatically created for you, or you can drag/drop/click until you get the design you want. This design will appear on your WordPress site when you use this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20will%20my%20customers%20know%20the%20tickets%20are%20from%20me%3F'>\nHow will my customers know the tickets are from me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can include your branding, your business name and your logo on the ticket sales page; then using this plugin these branded sales pages will appear on your WordPress website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20website%20to%20sell%20tickets%3F'>\nDo I need a website to sell tickets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In addition to this plugin you can also place a link to your Coconut Tickets sales page in your email or any social media tool you are using. When the customer clicks then Coconut Tickets takes control of the sales process for you either through the plugin or by redirecting your customer to Coconut Tickets website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20will%20i%20receive%20the%20ticket%20revenues%3F'>\nWhen will I receive the ticket revenues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Customers make their payments directly into your PayPal or Stripe account. There is no delay and no need to wait for the event to complete. Coconut Tickets is not a financial intermediary and never receives the ticket payment money.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20hidden%20fees%3F'>\nAre there any hidden fees?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To use Coconut Tickets services you need only pay the fixed fee for each ticket you sell, collected at the end of each month. However, your payment services provider is likely to charge you a fee for your use of their services (e.g. PayPal 2.9% fee for withdrawals).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20be%20used%20to%20edit%20my%20events%20on%20coconut%20tickets%3F'>\nCan this plugin be used to edit my events on Coconut Tickets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this plugin is purely for the display of your sales pages. The plugin has no administrative rights to your events.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20to%20obtain%20specific%20information%20from%20my%20event%20visitors%3F'>\nWhat if I need to obtain specific information from my event visitors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using Coconut Tickets you can design your own registration form to capture exactly the information you need from your event attendees. Forms can include conditional questions the result of which decides which question to ask next.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20custom%20ticket%20categories%3F'>\nCan I create custom ticket categories?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can combine the in-built ticket periods (e.g. whole day, or whole event) with the ticket categories of your choice. For example you can create a family ticket which permits entry for 4 people or a mother and child ticket permitting entry for 2 people.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20event%20offers%20merchandise%20to%20improve%20the%20event%20experience%2C%20how%20would%20i%20do%20that%3F'>\nMy event offers merchandise to improve the event experience, how would I do that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can create optional products that a customer can select after they have chosen their tickets.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20control%20entry%20to%20my%20events%3F'>\nHow can I control entry to my events?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Coconut Tickets has a QR scanning system for event checkin which uses an Android app that can be downloaded for free from Google Play. All online tickets issued by Coconut Tickets can be read by the scanner.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20be%20sure%20that%20every%20ticket%20booker%20will%20pay%3F'>\nHow can I be sure that every ticket booker will pay?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For paid events the event visitor must pay to complete their online registration. Tickets will not be issued unless payment is received.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20a%20wordpress%20event%20ticketing%20system%3F'>\nIs this a WordPress event ticketing system?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the purpose of this plugin is so that you can sell tickets directly from your WordPress website.
