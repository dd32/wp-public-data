        "faq": "\n<h4>What does it do again?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin embeds a button/popup on your site or on specific pages, prompting visitors to subscribe to notifications of new posts on your feed.<br />\nOnce a visitor subscribes, he/she will receive a notification (like a push notification) when you publish a new post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So how is this better than my RSS feed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is not better, it is an extension to your RSS feed. It makes your RSS feed available to users who don&#8217;t use an RSS reader (about 90% of internet users don&#8217;t know what RSS is)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How long does it take for a notification to appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depends on the settings selected by the user (typicall a few hours).<br />\nOf course, a notification will appear only when Chrome is open.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work with firefox or internet explorer, or safari?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it works only with Chrome, but that is most of your visitors anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it plant the code on all pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the default action, alternatively you can get the simple embed code from grabthatfeed.com and enter in manually on a page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this a free service?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it come with ads?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
