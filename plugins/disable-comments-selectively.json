This plugin has been tested with all the default WP themes (from 2010 to 2023) and works as intended.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20rss%20feeds%20still%20show%20old%20comments'>\nThe RSS feeds still show old comments\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably because it&#8217;s been cached, either by your browser or by WP itself. You can quickly <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Force-Refresh-in-Your-Internet-Browser\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">force refresh</a> your browser to check that, but if it&#8217;s been cached by WP then you&#8217;ll need to clear that or wait for it to expire.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='comment%20widgets'>\nComment Widgets\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tested this with the default WP Recent Comments widget and it works fine, but I can&#8217;t guarantee what happens with any of the hundred other comment widgets out there.</p>\n<p>If it uses the normal WP function calls for comments, it should be okay &#8211; if it&#8217;s making custom database calls directly, then no.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
