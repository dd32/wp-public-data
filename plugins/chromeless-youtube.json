        "description": "<p>This plugin is a custom YouTube video player.  The default player has custom control buttons that are hidden while the video is playing. Don&#8217;t worry, there is an option to use the default YouTube controls if you want. The player is meant to play only one single video, by simply entering it&#8217;s YouTube ID number.  You can then size the player to any width and height, enabling you to display videos anywhere on your site.  Every chromeless widget you create is unique, you can have multiple videos on one page, each with a different source and size.<br />\nThis plugin is a must have for any WordPress developer.  Adding videos to your site has never been easier.  YouTube hosts over 35% of the video media on the internet, it would be silly not to utilize their their simple yet powerful website to store all of your videos.</p>\n<p>To display these videos on your site, you need to embed a whole bunch of HTML, these embed snippets are the code needed to play each YouTube video on your site. This can sometimes be tedious and that is why I created the Chromeless YouTube Plugin.</p>\n<p>The Chromeless YouTube Player is super easy, just drag a widget into your sidebar, type in the YouTube ID number of a video, give it a width and height and that is it.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I get a blank black screen?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If YouTube has the  code disabled you cannot play the video outside of youtube.com, the result is a blank black player screen. You can check to see if this is your issue by visiting youtube and clicking on the<br />\n button, if code comes up then good otherwise you cannot play it externally.</p>\n<p>I am working on adding some error reporting for this in future versions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I use this player?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This player allows you to easily place specific YouTube videos wherever you want on your Blog or Website.  Your videos can be sized and scattered among your pages or posts, and without the default controls cluttering the experience.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is a YouTube ID number?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ID number is YouTube&#8217;s unique identifier for each video.  You can find the ID number in the address bar at the end of the URL after the &#8220;v=&#8221; part.  It can also be found in the embed code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many players can I create?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Theoretically there is no limit, but for practical reasons you may want to limit yourself to a couple of players for each page.  Use your judgment, the more players that are buffering data at the same time, the more likely there is to be loading issues.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have more than one video per player?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, for now you are limited to one. Future releases are planned with support for playlists, so stay tuned.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My player won&#8217;t respond?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try refreshing the page using F5, sometimes the video requests to YouTube will get stuck, due to traffic.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My player is stuck loading?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try refreshing the page using F5.  If you have another player with the same video (same video ID) open in another tab the two players may interfere with each other depending on which browser you are using.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I control playback?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using the chromeless controls, just click on the video to display the basic control buttons.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
