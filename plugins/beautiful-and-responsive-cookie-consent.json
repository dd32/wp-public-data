It is optimized for performance and for a low database impact.</p>\n<h4>NOTE: Using this plugin alone does not make your site automatically compliant.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20backend%20cookies%3F%20%28itp%20%3E%3D%202.1%29'>\nWhy backend cookies? (ITP &gt;= 2.1)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most Cookie Banner plugins set javascript cookies. In Safari and Firefox these cookies have a short lifetime, even if the cookie is set with an very long expiration date.<br />\n<strong>Consequence:</strong> Your user have to opt in every seven days again. And sees the banner every seven days. Which is kind of annoying.<br />\nWith this Plugin the consent cookie stays save and is not limited in lifetime. If you use the option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20remove%20tab%20at%20the%20bottom%3F'>\nHow to remove tab at the bottom?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just go to Settings &gt; Cookie Consent Banner &gt; Consent Management and uncheck the checkbox &#8220;Show &#8216;Cookie Settings&#8217; tab&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20have%20a%20setting%20for%20blocking%20scripts%20or%20cookies%20until%20acceptance%3F'>\nDoes this plugin have a setting for blocking scripts or cookies until acceptance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. With the premium add-on (<a href=\"https://beautiful-cookie-banner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">beautiful-cookie-banner.com</a>) you can enable autoblocking. But be aware: there is no 100% guarantee that this will always work. As this is heavily dependent from your wordpress installation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20should%20i%20organize%20my%20trackingscripts%20and%20cookies%3F'>\nHow should I organize my trackingscripts and cookies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The technical recommandation is to use the google tag manager. It is an awesome and free tagmanager. Since version 2.2 this plugin natively supports it. But as always: check if it is legal to use it in your jurisdication☝️.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20custom%20template%20and%20want%20to%20modify%20the%20cookie%20message.%20how%3F'>\nI have a custom template and want to modify the cookie message.
