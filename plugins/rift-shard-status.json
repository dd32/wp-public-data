Can you add $LANG to the translations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Chances are very good that I don&#8217;t speak $LANG well enough to translate the plugin myself. But you can help translating it into your language. Download the translation file from https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/rift-shard-status/trunk/i18n/rift_shard_status.pot and translate the strings there. You can do this with a text editor or special tools.</p>\n<p>You can find guides about translations all over google, for example: http://forums.lesterchan.net/index.php?topic=108.0</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m trying to use a translated version, but it always shows the wrong language</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin isn&#8217;t translated into your language yet, it will always show English strings.</p>\n<p>If you know the plugin is translated into your language, but it still only shows in English, check that your blog is set up for another language: https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language</p>\n</p>\n\n",
