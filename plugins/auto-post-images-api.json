You can choose to have images selected at random or using the POST ID or POST SLUG.</p>\n<p>To insert images into posts you no longer have to insert them one by one using the editor. All you have to do is name them appropriately and upload them to a folder &amp; the plugin will automatically insert them into the corresponding post.</p>\n<p>Want to add more images to the post? All you have to do is put more images into the folder and they will show up on the post without having to edit the post.</p>\n<p>Need to remove a image from a post? Then just delete the image and it will no longer appear in the post.</p>\n<p>No more hassle of editing the post.</p>\n<p>Images tagged with the POSTID are displayed on that post. If the thumbnail option is enabled the plugin will use thumbnails in the post to link to the full size images. The plugin will automatically create thumbnails when needed.</p>\n<p>Usage: Upload images by naming them as <code>'apiPOSTID'</code> where &#8216;POSTID&#8217; is ID of post where the image should be displayed. If you wish to use a different filename format then you can edit the regular expression pattern in the settings page.</p>\n<p>Multiple images can be attached to a post simply by ensuring that all of them have the same prefix. For posts that do not have images a default &#8220;Image coming soon&#8221; image is displayed; this can be disabled from the settings screen.</p>\n<p>Example Image Name: <code>'api66.jpg', 'api66a.jpeg', 'api66_two.gif', 'api66something'</code>, etc. Note: When posting multiple images to the same post by naming them with the same &#8216;apiNNN&#8217; prefix. Avoid numbers immediately after the POSTID. For example: <code>'api662.gif'</code> will not work if the ID of the POST is 66; instead name it something like <code>'api66image2.gif'</code>. Again, if you wish to use a different filename format then you can edit the regular expression pattern in the settings page.</p>\n<p>Demo: <a href=\"http://sethulakshmi.karunanidhi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dash of Salt &amp; A Pinch of Love</a></p>\n<p>Author Home: <a href=\"http://www.karthikeyankarunanidhi.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Karthikeyan</a></p>\n<p>Plugin Home: <a href=\"http://www.karthikeyankarunanidhi.com/plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Auto Post Images (API)</a></p>\n",

Drop me an email \ud83d\ude42</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I not show the default image when there is no image for a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Dashboard </li>\n<li>Click Settings</li>\n<li>Click Auto Post Images (API) Settings</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;<strong>No</strong>&#8221; under &#8220;<strong>Display default image if not image is found?</strong>&#8221; </li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Update Settings&#8221;</li>\n<li>Now the default &#8220;Image Coming Soon&#8221; image is not displayed for posts that do not have images.</li>\n<li>Posts that have images will continue displaying the images as usual</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want to use thumbnails.

All you have to do is change the regular expression &#8220;<strong>Image search Regular Expression?</strong>&#8220;. Just make sure it has <strong>POSTID</strong> somewhere in the expression so that the plugin knows which images are attached to which post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I name the images differently when SEO is enabled ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You still upload the images using the same filename format specified in &#8220;<strong>Image search Regular Expression?</strong>&#8220;. The plugin will use this to search for images associated with the post and then rename them using the posts title.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What image types are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anything that the browser supports.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the image position and style</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can customize the image position and style by providing your own CSS classes in the <strong>Customize appearance</strong> section in the settings page. You can also change the styles in <strong>/auto-post-images/css/kkimageinpost.css</strong>.<br />\nIf you like to change where the images are displayed (top, bottom, left, right, center) then providing your own CSS style class here is the best way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a question that is not answered here</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Email me. I&#8217;ll be happy to answer it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to donate</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are really thinking about donating&#8230; Thanks, I really appreciate it. Instead of donating money just write a few lines about the plugin and link to the plugin (https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/auto-post-images-api/) and my site (http://www.Karunanidhi.com) or use the following code: <code>'&lt;a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/auto-post-images-api/\"&gt;Auto-Post-Images (API)&lt;/a&gt; plugin by &lt;a href=\"http://www.Karunanidhi.com\"&gt;Karthikeyan&lt;/a&gt;'</code></p>\n</p>\n\n",
