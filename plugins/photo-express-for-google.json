        "description": "<p>Browse your Google+/Picasa Web albums and select images or whole albums to insert into your posts/pages. This is an unofficial<br />\nfork of Picasa Express 2.</p>\n<p>The fork has been necessary because the authentication for private photo albums of &#8220;Picasa and Google Plus Express&#8221; has been broken since<br />\n April 2015 due to changes to the authentication protocol. This is the first release after a major change to the code. Please<br />\n  be so kind and test this version before putting it into production.</p>\n<p><strong>This fork supports OAUTH authentication with Google, so you can access private photos and albums again! Currently this only works on a blog-wide mode (Google+ Express access level: blog). I am working on a solution for a per user authentication.</strong></p>\n<p>Upgrade notice:<br />\n*   The plugin requires at <strong>least PHP 5.4</strong>. Using a version before PHP 5.4 leads to parse errors.<br />\n*   If you have shortcodes for single images that have been generated using a prior version of &#8220;Photo Express for Google&#8221; (0.1) or &#8220;Picasa and Google Plus Express&#8221; (all versions), you&#8217;ll have to update them to make photoswipe work correctly. Please have a look into the FAQ.<br />\n*   The prefix for all CSS classes has changed from &#8220;pe2&#8221; to &#8220;peg&#8221;. Please consider this when upgrading from &#8220;Picasa and Google Plus Express&#8221;.<br />\n*   The function to store authentication data on a user basis has been removed. The use case for storing it on a per user basis was not clear. If you rely on this function, please post a feature request with your particular use case.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use your Google user to access your photos and albums</li>\n<li><strong>Private</strong> album access after granting access via Google auth service</li>\n<li>Select albums / images from GUI listing by album cover and name</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile gallery</strong> display support with PhotoSwipe</li>\n<li>Google+ style <strong>phototile</strong> gallery display or standard gallery utilizing native WordPress image thumbnail size</li>\n<li>Create a gallery of a subset of photos from an album by <strong>filtering the album with tags</strong></li>\n<li>Gallery and image shortcodes for display of entire album or selected images</li>\n<li><strong>WordPress MU</strong> support &#8211; sitewide activation, users, roles</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Additional settings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image link:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mobile gallery</strong> with PhotoSwipe &#8211; in desktop browsers PhotoSwipe is clean and works nicely.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Photoswipe does not work anymore for single images</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With version 0.2 of Photo Express for Google the internal photowsipe library has been updated to version 4. The newest version of photoswipe needs to know the size in pixel of the image that should be displayed in photoswipe. Therefore you&#8217;ll need to add the &#8220;image_size&#8221; attribute to your old <code>[peg-image]</code> shorttags. It should contain a value describing the images size in the format &#8220;x&#8221; (i.e. &#8220;1920&#215;1080&#8221; for full HD). This manual step is not needed for any single picture that has been added with Photo Express for Google version 0.2 or later. All shortcodes generated by Photo Express for Google version 0.2 include the &#8220;image_size&#8221; attribute. So an alternative way of updating old shortcodes is to delete them and insert them again with the current version of Photo Express for Google.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Tag searches in albums returns inconsistent results</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google+ / Picasaweb tag searching currently contains a bug that causes images<br />\nto slowly start dropping out of tag search results, causing fewer than<br />\nexpected images to be returned.</p>\n<p>I have posted several issues and am following threads like the following:<br />\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/google-picasa-data-api/YxBzKZYeIa4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Groups: Picasa Data API</a></p>\n<p>Hopefully Google will discover the cause of the problem soon.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Username validation fails</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If when in the options and configuring the username, the &#8220;Checking user:&#8221; test<br />\nreturns an error, it could be related to changes Google has been making when<br />\nmigrating from picasaweb to Google+.</p>\n<p>The error message provided should give you a URL you can click, which will<br />\nthen provide you with Google&#8217;s error message.  In most cases, the error<br />\nappears to be related to older &#8220;short username&#8221; values that Google no longer<br />\nsupports.</p>\n<p>Simply change the username you are using to your Google email address and save<br />\nthe settings.</p>\n<p>If this still doesn&#8217;t work, check your hosting provider&#8217;s PHP preferences &#8211; some hosting companies disable connect functions and WordPress can not request data from other sites.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Error with media-upload.js</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When attempting to insert an image into a post and receive the error:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Error: Cannot insert image(s) due to incorrect or missing /wp-admin/js/media-upload.js&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are several possible causes for this:</p>\n</p>\n<h4>1 &#8211; if you attempt to open the selection dialog before the page has</h4>\n<p>\n<p>completely loaded, some of the required JavaScript libraries may not be loaded<br />\nyet.  Refresh the page and wait for it to load completely, then try again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2 &#8211; it is known that the &#8220;CKEditor for WP&#8221; plugin conflicts with the</h4>\n<p>\n<p>media-upload.js file.  Disable this plugin and try again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I select several images to insert at a time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When browsing the album&#8217;s images you may click on multiple photos to insert at once.  These images will be inserted into the post as using the thumbnail size you have defined in &#8220;Single image thumbnail size&#8221; in settings.</p>\n<p>If you have selected the option to &#8220;Relate all of a post&#8217;s images&#8221; and you are<br />\nusing a link type of one of the thickbox, lightbox or highslide libraries, all<br />\nof the photos within the post will be related for next/prev navigation within<br />\nthe display window.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I select several images for &#8220;Gallery&#8221; display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two options to filter images in a &#8220;Gallery&#8221; display:</p>\n<p><strong>#1 &#8211; Use tags to filter photos in an album</strong> so that only photos with a specific<br />\ntag are displayed.</p>\n<p>This is done by inserting an &#8220;Album&#8221; shortcode, but in the &#8220;Options&#8221; prior to inserting populate the &#8220;Photo tag options&#8221; to select photos with the &#8220;Featured&#8221; tag, or a customized tag name typed into the text box.</p>\n<p>NOTE &#8211; filtering by tags requires private album access.  This is a<br />\nGoogle+/picasaweb requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 &#8211; Manually select the photos</strong> (and optionally their sort order).</p>\n<p>This is done while browsing an album&#8217;s photos, click the &#8220;Image&#8221; button.<br />\nAfter clicking the &#8220;Image&#8221; button, it will switch to &#8220;Gallery&#8221; indicating that<br />\nany photos selected this time will be inserted into the post in &#8220;Gallery&#8221;<br />\nformat using the default blog thumbnail size.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want private albums browsing</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the settings page press the link titled &#8220;Click here to configure private access to Google Photo&#8221;. You will be guided through a multi step setup process and be redirected to Google and asked to grant access. If you press the &#8220;Grant access&#8221; button on Google, you will be returned to settings page and access will now be granted.</p>\n<p>After successfully authorizing the access for the blog, the next time you open<br />\nthe album / image selection dialog, you will see all of your photos and<br />\nalbums, including any private ones.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I revoked access to my server on Google&#8217;s site, and now the plugin doesn&#8217;t work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On revoking access through Google instead of this plugin, Google will not inform your server. If you revoke access on Google&#8217;s side, you have to click the &#8220;Click here to revoke the token&#8221; link on the settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Caption widths aren&#8217;t determined correctly</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a single-image thumbnail width dimension of &#8220;Height&#8221; or &#8220;Any&#8221;, the width is dynamically based on aspect ratio.  Thus the value generated for the caption is not terribly accurate, causing strange caption wrapping sometimes.</p>\n<p>The best solution here is to change the single-image thumbnail dimension to &#8220;Width&#8221;, because then the width of the caption can be determined precisely.</p>\n<p>Another option would be to try a &#8220;Caption container style&#8221; setting of &#8220;width: auto;&#8221;, although this isn&#8217;t ideal either because it will scale the container to fit any size of caption text, and the text will never wrap.

    "description": "<p>Browse your Google+/Picasa Web albums and select images or whole albums to insert into your posts/pages. This is an unofficial<br />\nfork of Picasa Express 2.</p>\n<p>The fork has been necessary because the authentication for private photo albums of &#8220;Picasa and Google Plus Express&#8221; has been broken since<br />\n April 2015 due to changes to the authentication protocol. This is the first release after a major change to the code. Please<br />\n  be so kind and test this version before putting it into production.</p>\n<p><strong>This fork supports OAUTH authentication with Google, so you can access private photos and albums again! Currently this only works on a blog-wide mode (Google+ Express access level: blog). I am working on a solution for a per user authentication.</strong></p>\n<p>Upgrade notice:<br />\n*   The plugin requires at <strong>least PHP 5.4</strong>. Using a version before PHP 5.4 leads to parse errors.<br />\n*   If you have shortcodes for single images that have been generated using a prior version of &#8220;Photo Express for Google&#8221; (0.1) or &#8220;Picasa and Google Plus Express&#8221; (all versions), you&#8217;ll have to update them to make photoswipe work correctly. Please have a look into the FAQ.<br />\n*   The prefix for all CSS classes has changed from &#8220;pe2&#8221; to &#8220;peg&#8221;. Please consider this when upgrading from &#8220;Picasa and Google Plus Express&#8221;.<br />\n*   The function to store authentication data on a user basis has been removed.
