Just activate the plugin and pick a tile image and color on the settings page. Then, anyone who pins your site to their start screen with Windows 8.1/IE11 will see your site&#8217;s logo/image (at the size of their choosing), which will also live-update to display your latest 5 posts, with images if they&#8217;re available.</p>\n<p>Live tiles feature your post titles and excerpts or images from the posts.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Take the easy route and install through the wordpress plugin adder OR</li>\n<li>Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>While some features will begin working immediately, you should definitely configure the settings in Settings -&gt; Windows Pinned Tiles</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Live tiles not updating&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To see the live tiles, you must be running Windows 8.1 and the pinned tiles must be larger than the &#8220;small&#8221; size (I think they look best with the &#8220;Wide&#8221; size, which will try to pull in images from your posts). Once you pin a site (or refresh an existing pin by trying to re-pin a site), the live tile should begin working almost immediately. Note that there may be additional delays beyond the settings in the plugin settings page for checking for new posts, due to the multiple levels of feeds needing to update themselves.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Large and wide tile size options not displaying</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either the image you selected is too small (minimum 310px square) or the filesize of the image you uploaded is too large (maximum 200kb after WordPress converts the image to PNG and resizes it). If the filesize is too large, try a less complicated image (graphics like logos will typically work better than pictures).</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Users must be running Windows 8.1 and the tile must be the &#8220;wide&#8221; or &#8220;large&#8221; size. You can set the frequency with which the tile should check for new posts in the plugin settings page. The tile data is generated by Microsoft (via http://buildmypinnedsite.com/) from your RSS feed.</li>\n<li>Add support for all four Windows 8.1 tile sizes: Large (310px square), Wide (310px x 150px), Medium (150px square), and Small (70px square).</li>\n<li>Automatically convert uploaded/selected images to the correct format (PNG) and generate all four image sizes. Note: if original image is less than 310px square, not all tile sizes will be available. Any of the images that are larger than 200kb after beeing converted and resized won&#8217;t be displayed (typically only an issue for very busy images; graphics tend to work better).
