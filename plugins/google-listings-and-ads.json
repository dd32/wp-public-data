It will sync all your WooCommerce product data, and you can also add or edit products individually or in bulk. To ensure products are approved by Google, check that your product feed includes the following information:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>General product information</li>\n<li>Unique product identifiers</li>\n<li>Data requirements for specific categories (auto-assigned by Google):\n<ul>\n<li>Apparel &amp; Accessories</li>\n<li>Media</li>\n<li>Books</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20manage%20my%20product%20feed%20and%20my%20google%20ads%20campaigns%3F'>\nWhere do I manage my product feed and my Google Ads campaigns?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can manage and edit all of your products and your Google Ads campaigns right from your WooCommerce dashboard and on the WooCommerce Mobile App.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20will%20my%20products%20appear%3F'>\nWhere will my products appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you start running a <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/google-for-woocommerce/get-started/google-performance-max-campaigns/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Performance Max campaign</a>, your approved products will reach more shoppers to help grow your business by being shown on Google Search, Google Maps, the Shopping tab, Gmail, Youtube, the Google Display Network, and Discover feed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20performance%20max%20campaigns%3F'>\nWhat are Performance Max campaigns?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/google-for-woocommerce/get-started/google-performance-max-campaigns/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Performance Max campaigns</a> help you combine your expertise with Google AI to reach your most valuable customers and drive sales.
