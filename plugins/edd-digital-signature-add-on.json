Their primary focus isn’t a legally binding document. We focus solely on legally binding contracts.  Many people make the false assumption that the addition of a signature add-on on their WordPress form is enough to make it an agreement legally binding. We took years coming up with a policy that adheres to strict ESIGN and UETA national and international document signing rules. The best thing you can do is not be caught in a court room with a contract that’s not legally binding document.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20e-signatures%20legal%3F'>\nAre E-Signatures Legal?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Signatures that are obtained electronically or digitally are legally binding in the U.S. and throughout many nations around the world. There are two digital signatures acts in the U.S. that set the legality of these signatures.  Both acts note that e-signatures and electronics records hold the same power as paper documents and handwritten signatures. According to both, a signature or document that’s on electronic form is still legal and enforceable.</p>\n<p>These acts are the:</p>\n<p>*[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) (ESIGN, 2000)<br />\n*[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act) (UETA, 1999)</p>\n<p><strong>The ApproveMe WP E-Signature plugin is compliant with both acts</strong></p>\n<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong><br />\nThe U.K. has legislation that’s similar to the U.S. ESIGN Act, which was enacted in 2000. It’s called the UK Electronic Communication Act. ApproveMe is the primary WordPress Plugin to sign contracts and demands an e-signature solution to be reliable with the act.</p>\n<p><strong>European Union</strong><br />\nThe adoption of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of Dec. 13, 1999 prove the use of electronic marks on digital and electronic contracts inside the EU. 30 European nations have formally adopted the Directive 1999/93/EC. Europe effectively uses the Digital and Electronic marks, and the ApproveMe WP E-Signature is compliant with Europe’s law and is enforceable in the EU.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20need%20to%20for%20me%20to%20renew%20the%20approveme%20license%3F'>\nIs there a need to for me to renew the ApproveMe License?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>o   Yes, you must renew the license, as it’s only good for one year from the date you purchased it.
