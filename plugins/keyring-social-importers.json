Disable it by creating a stub plugin, or dropping this in your theme&#8217;s functions.php; add_filter( &#8216;keyring_instapaper_download_article_texts&#8217;, &#8216;__return_false&#8217; );</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Jetpack/WordPress.com</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Import posts from either self-hosted, or hosted copies of WordPress, via the Jetpack/WordPress.com API.</li>\n<li>Post author is always overridden.</li>\n<li>Tags, content, title, excerpt are all carried over.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Moves</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Imports your data daily.</li>\n<li>Creates a summary post, which is a bulleted list detailing each category of activity for the day.</li>\n<li>Stores raw and summary data for further processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Nest (Camera)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to pick hours of the day to take snapshots from your cameras.</li>\n<li>You can pick anything between no snapshots, or one every hour, per camera.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot will be downloaded directly into your Media Library.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot will also be published as a Post (with post type of &#8220;image&#8221;) using the Author/Category/Tag options you select.</li>\n<li>If you click the &#8220;Check For New Content Now&#8221; button, when configured for auto-import, then all cameras with at least one scheduled snapshot will take one right now, regardless of what time they&#8217;re scheduled (good for verifying that things work, or taking a specific snapshot for whatever reason).</li>\n<li>Does not require a Nest Aware subscription, since the relatively infrequent snapshots are under request limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pinterest</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: This is a new addition, and is pretty rough still. Not recommended for production sites.</li>\n<li>Imports every individual pin as a post (can be a LOT), with a Post Format of &#8220;image&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Stores the image for each pin in your Media Library.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pocket</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Imports links and creates a post for each of them, with the Link post format.</li>\n<li>Uses as many details (e.g. title) as possible from Pocket.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Strava</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Activities are imported as new Posts.<br />\n* Activity type is stored as post meta for easier querying.</li>\n<li>GPS data is stored as an encoded polyline if available.

        "changelog": "<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: Add a Pocket importer, props @roccotripaldi.</li>\n<li>Change: Updated readme.txt to include contributors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: Added a Strava importer. Kudos @mdrovdahl. Props @marekhrabe for additional contributions.</li>\n<li>NEW: Introduce a new global option to set the status of posts created via import. Set to &#8220;Pending&#8221; or &#8220;Draft&#8221; to hold them for publication. Set to &#8220;Private&#8221; to keep for your own records, or &#8220;Publish&#8221; to publish automatically (previous and current default).</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Handle Swarm checkins created by someone else by associating that person (via People &amp; Places). Includes a reprocessor to handle old posts.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: If a Swarm checkin is marked as &#8220;off the grid&#8221;, then mark the geodata as non-public, and mark the created post as &#8220;private&#8221;. Include a reprocessor to do the same to old posts.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Now handles Featured Image and all post meta on Jetpack imports.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Remove deprecated calls to <code>screen_icon()</code></li>\n<li>Enhancement: Reprocessor for expanding old short URLs for Twitter included. Props @chrishardie.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a filter <code>keyring_importer_posts_pre_insert</code> which allows you to filter all post content before posts are imported/created.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Nest importer will now automatically attempt to re-download an image if the first attempt fails (significantly improves reliability).</li>\n<li>Change: <code>sideload_media</code>&#8216;s last argument has changed to allow more flexibility.</li>\n<li>Bugfix: <code>sideload_media</code> previously didn&#8217;t handle multiple URLs properly. Now it should.</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Shortened URLs are expanded correctly for Twitter now. Props @chrishardie.</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Updated Instagram to use max/min_id rather than timestamps for looping through media.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: Added a Jetpack/WordPress.com importer.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Fix Twitter importer so that it correctly obeys the option to import retweets. Props @glueckpress for reporting.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Lots of code cleanup/linting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Places support for Nest and TripIt importers.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Instagram importer now supports Video posts, and People.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: REST API support.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: New filter for disabling Instapaper remote content download.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: New filter for injecting custom CSS into the header of an importer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NOTE: Update to Keyring 1.7 for full compatibility.</li>\n<li>NEW: Added &#8220;Reprocessor&#8221; concept (accessible via Tools &gt; Import &gt; Reprocess Keyring Data) to allow developers to re-use the raw import data for posts, and update/reprocess information.</li>\n<li>NEW: Nest Camera importer.</li>\n<li>NEW: Pinterest importer.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Instapaper now downloads the full content of articles and stores it within the content of posts, so that you can search them later. It applies a <code>noindex</code> tag to those post pages to avoid duplicate content issues. Note that this is retroactive, so it&#8217;ll go back and find all your old links and try to download their content over time. If you don&#8217;t want that to happen, you&#8217;ll need to set a postmeta/Custom Field against all of them called <code>remote_content</code> (set it to &#8216;1&#8217;), or you can filter <code>keyring_instapaper_download_article_texts</code> and <code>__return_false</code> to always turn it off; add_filter( &#8216;keyring_instapaper_download_article_texts&#8217;, &#8216;__return_false&#8217; );</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Compatible with <a href=\"https://github.com/beaulebens/people-places\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">People &amp; Places</a> (must be installed manually currently) to associate people and places across all services under a single taxonomy.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Bundle Reprocessors to fix an old encoding bug, plus to process Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare imports for People &amp; Places.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Default the UI to save imported content against the current user/author.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Link back to the importer on the success screen.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Add a new filter to the default header (<code>keyring_importer_header_css</code>) so that you can easily inject some custom CSS, without completely recreating the header.</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Remove a bunch of unused global variables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NOTE: Update Keyring to 1.6.2 for best results</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Discovered a problem with the way &#8220;raw&#8221; import data was being encoded and stored (as JSON), which rendered it (sometimes) un-encodeable. Changed to use <code>wp_slash()</code> before storing it, which means all future data is &#8220;clean&#8221;. Working on a script to recover as much as possible, or you can delete old posts and re-import them, and their import data will be stored using the new approach, and thus be more accessible.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: New Fitbit Importer (very basic currently)</li>\n<li>Enhancement: New Moves Importer (also pretty basic)</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Assigns imported media as the Featured Image on the post created to display it</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Sort photos attached to Foursquare check-ins the same as the original post</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Use pagination in TripIt API which makes results more reliable, and avoids timeout issues on accounts with lots of trip data</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Handle multiple images on Tweets</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Better handling of retweets (load full content, don&#8217;t truncate), props @petermolnar</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Add a filter drop-down to the Posts page so that you can filter posts by the service from which they were imported</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Switch to HTTPS for Flickr (now required)</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Use user-id in URLs for Flickr (more reliable)</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Auto-import Instagram photos using timestamps instead of ids, which is more reliable</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BREAKING: Change from using a value in post meta (keyring_service) to using a custom taxonomy (&#8216;keyring_services&#8217;) to reference the service a post was imported from. Entries are automatically created for all importers.</li>\n<li>There is a script called &#8216;migrate-keyring-postmeta-to-taxonomy.php&#8217; included in the plugin. Put it in the root of your WP install and run it (as many times as necessary, even if it crashes/runs out of memory) until it produces no output. That will convert all existing posts and remove their keyring_service postmeta.</li>\n<li>Fix deprecated notice and use esc_sql()</li>\n<li>Fix a string that didn&#8217;t havea a textdomain</li>\n<li>Tweak Instapaper importer to use last progress date to get links published closer to when you read them</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Twitter API URLs to use new 1.1 API</li>\n<li>Foursquare check-ins that contain photos now download and attach the photo to your local post, props Chris Finke</li>\n<li>Added an action which is fired after <em>each post</em> is created/imported: do_action( &#8216;keyring_post_imported&#8217;, $post_id, $service_name, $post );</li>\n<li>Add import_start/end actions which are called in core importers (for consistency)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NOTE: Requires the latest version of Keyring (v1.4)</li>\n<li>NEW: Instapaper importer</li>\n<li>NEW: TripIt importer</li>\n<li>Only send the &#8220;must install Keyring&#8221; message once per page</li>\n<li>Better handling of options for each importer</li>\n<li>Check if a service is configured in Keyring before attempting to use it</li>\n<li>Allow default tags to be applied to all imported posts</li>\n<li>Clean up help text and instructions on a few importers</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated to work with Keyring 1.2</li>\n<li>Added TripIt importer (for air travel only, 1 post per &#8220;flight series&#8221;)</li>\n<li>Added &#8220;Default tags&#8221; option for all importers</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial check-in without templating engine</li>\n<li>Auto-import working for all services <strong>except</strong> Flickr, and maybe Instagram</li>\n</ul>\n"

Disable it by creating a stub plugin, or dropping this in your theme&#8217;s functions.php; add_filter( &#8216;keyring_instapaper_download_article_texts&#8217;, &#8216;__return_false&#8217; );</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Jetpack/WordPress.com</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Import posts from either self-hosted, or hosted copies of WordPress, via the Jetpack/WordPress.com API.</li>\n<li>Post author is always overridden.</li>\n<li>Tags, content, title, excerpt are all carried over.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Moves</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Imports your data daily.</li>\n<li>Creates a summary post, which is a bulleted list detailing each category of activity for the day.</li>\n<li>Stores raw and summary data for further processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Nest (Camera)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to pick hours of the day to take snapshots from your cameras.</li>\n<li>You can pick anything between no snapshots, or one every hour, per camera.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot will be downloaded directly into your Media Library.</li>\n<li>Each snapshot will also be published as a Post (with post type of &#8220;image&#8221;) using the Author/Category/Tag options you select.</li>\n<li>If you click the &#8220;Check For New Content Now&#8221; button, when configured for auto-import, then all cameras with at least one scheduled snapshot will take one right now, regardless of what time they&#8217;re scheduled (good for verifying that things work, or taking a specific snapshot for whatever reason).</li>\n<li>Does not require a Nest Aware subscription, since the relatively infrequent snapshots are under request limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pinterest</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: This is a new addition, and is pretty rough still. Not recommended for production sites.</li>\n<li>Imports every individual pin as a post (can be a LOT), with a Post Format of &#8220;image&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Stores the image for each pin in your Media Library.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pocket</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Imports links and creates a post for each of them, with the Link post format.</li>\n<li>Uses as many details (e.g. title) as possible from Pocket.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Strava</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Activities are imported as new Posts.<br />\n* Activity type is stored as post meta for easier querying.</li>\n<li>GPS data is stored as an encoded polyline if available.
