        "description": "<p>Easily double your traffic from social media.</p>\n<p>Many businesses are publishing content as a way to build their audiences and increase traffic to their websites. However, they may not be getting everything they could from each piece of content they create.</p>\n<p>If you are serious about your content, then you also need to be serious about driving as much traffic to it (over social media) as possible. One great way to do this is to <em>share your content on social media more than once.</em></p>\n<p>But wait, doesn&#8217;t that turn me into a spammer?</p>\n<p>One aspect of marketing we often forget is that no one notices everything we do.</p>\n<p>Your social media followers aren&#8217;t like RSS subscribers who see and read every post. In fact, sharing more than once <em>probably is an essential part of providing your audience with the value you promised them.</em> If you don&#8217;t share your links a few times, they may never see any of your updates.</p>\n<p>So how can you share your evergreen content multiple times in a way that doesn&#8217;t turn you into a spammer?</p>\n<p>Sure, you can install a plugin that shares your old blog posts (randomly) once every single hour.</p>\n<p>Or you can be smart about it.</p>\n<p>This is where Evergreen Content Poster comes into play.</p>\n<p>Evergreen Content Poster is a <strong>must-have</strong> WordPress plugin created to help business owners <strong>boost their website traffic</strong>, grow their <strong>social media followers</strong> and keep their existing <strong>followers engaged</strong> by <strong>automatically</strong> sharing your posts and content from your WordPress website in unlimited different ways to your social media accounts. Places like your LinkedIn company page, your Instagram account, your Twitter account are all supported, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Our plugin allows you to create as many variations on a single piece of content as you want, so you never have to share the same message twice.</p>\n<p>If you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ask a question to trigger intrigue for your content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cite a fact from your content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Share a quote</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The possibilities are limitless.</p>\n<p>Save time in your social media marketing efforts, add the power of having unlimited unique posts sharing your content to your accounts by using Evergreen Content Poster.</p>\n<h3>Who Should Be Using The  Evergreen Content Poster Plugin?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>People with <strong>small blogs</strong> that are just starting out</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Large blogs and sites</strong> with hundreds of <strong>posts</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Social media and content marketers</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mom-and-Pop bloggers</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business owners that use the power of content marketing <strong>to attract new clients</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shop owners with a WooCommerce store that want to share their catalogue or products in a unique way to their social following, helping <strong>to increase ecommerce sales</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How Can Evergreen Content Poster Help Me?</h3>\n<p>Evergreen Content Poster is much more than just a WordPress to Facebook, WordPress to Twitter or yet another auto posting plugin.</p>\n<p>Evergreen Content Poster can be used for many use cases and help many different blogs, sites and webshops to boost social media traffic.</p>\n<p>We do this by introducing social media automation functionality that doesn&#8217;t spam your social accounts with the same old boring messages. In fact, it can act as all of the following in one:</p>\n<h3>A WordPress <strong>Social Media Scheduling</strong> Plugin</h3>\n<p>With our plugin, you can set a schedule for how often you&#8217;d like your <strong>old and newer content</strong> to share on social media.</p>\n<p>Set specific times that you want your evergreen content to be pushed to your different social media accounts, or set the number of posts you want to publish every day.</p>\n<p>Want it even more laid back? Only push content to your Buffer account the moment your Buffer queue is empty.</p>\n<p>And the best part?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to mess around with App IDs, authorization tokens or complicated technical steps.</p>\n<p>Connecting your social media profiles is done in a few clicks through Buffer, taking seconds.</p>\n<h4>Buffer Partner</h4>\n<p>In October 2020, we were proud to have been selected as a Partner by Buffer.</p>\n<p>This ensures continued access to Buffer&#8217;s API, meaning that the Evergreen Content Poster will continue to work and continue to improve.</p>\n<h3>A WordPress <strong>Social Media Analytics</strong> Plugin</h3>\n<p>You can&#8217;t improve what you don&#8217;t measure!</p>\n<p>Are you tired of manually adding UTM tags to your links to see which posts are performing the best and are resulting in the most traffic?</p>\n<p>With Evergreen Content Poster, you can automatically include UTM tags in all content shared. Now you can identify which social network is bringing in the most results, straight from your Google Analytics.</p>\n<h3>A WordPress <strong>Content Curation</strong> Plugin</h3>\n<p>We all know the amount of work that goes into creating a piece of content. And while making the best piece of content, there is, is needed if you want to rank your content. Content creation itself is only half the battle; the rest is gaining notice.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we give you the unique ability to create as many variations on a single post within your WordPress backend as you want.</p>\n<p>With Evergreen Content Poster <strong>you decide</strong> which of your content and how your content is shared to which social media channel.</p>\n<h3>What can I do with Evergreen Content Poster</h3>\n<p>Evergreen Content Poster isn&#8217;t like every other social media marketing tool. As content marketers ourselves, we know the importance of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sustaining and growing traffic to your website</li>\n<li>Growing social media following</li>\n<li>Keeping your existing social media followers engaged</li>\n<li>Promoting and sharing of your evergreen content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s why, with our plugin, <strong>you can automatically share posts from:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress to your Facebook pages</li>\n<li>WordPress to your Facebook groups</li>\n<li>WordPress to your Instagram Business accounts</li>\n<li>WordPress to your X (Twitter) profiles</li>\n<li>WordPress to Mastodon profiles</li>\n<li>WordPress to your LinkedIn Profile</li>\n<li>WordPress to your LinkedIn pages</li>\n<li>WordPress to your Pinterest boards</li>\n<li>WordPress to Google Business Profiles (previously Google My Business)</li>\n<li>WordPress to TikTok Business accounts ([learn how to switch your personal account to a TikTok business account] (https://www.evergreencontentposter.com/support/channel-management/convert-tiktok-personal-to-business-account/))</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;re able to do this using our partnership with Buffer, the leading social sharing tool available. And we&#8217;re not just talking about the standard posts from your WordPress website. No, the Evergreen Content Poster, supports ALL content that you can add into your WordPress website and more. The Evergreen Content Poster supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Posts (added straight from the WordPress Post edit screen)</li>\n<li>WordPress Pages (added straight from the WordPress Pages edit screen)</li>\n<li>Custom Post Types (added straight from the Custom Post Type edit screen)</li>\n<li>Products in your WooCommerce store (added straight from each WooCommerce Product edit screen)</li>\n<li>Content that lives outside of your WordPress website (which can be added directly into your Evergreen Content Poster content library)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Data</h4>\n<p>The plugin connects your website to <a href=\"https://buffer.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Buffer</a> (you will need an account with Buffer at the moment, but no worries, you can use the free plan).</p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve connected your WordPress website to your Buffer (buffer.com) account, we can then use their API to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get the social media profile names and ID&#8217;s that are connected in your Buffer account,</li>\n<li>Send the content from the content library within the app to one or more of your social media profiles (which content and which profiles you will send posts to depends on the settings in the plugin)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because we&#8217;ve created our own API to pass on any request towards Buffer, we will never see or use your login details or password.</p>\n<p>Simply connect the Evergreen Content Poster to Buffer. You only have to press the Authorize button on the Buffer website when you make the connection (we then get an access token that is stored in your own WordPress installation after this approval)</p>\n<p>This is all done via our own API to make sure that no private data (such as oAuth client secret keys) are included in this plugin&#8217;s code or made public.</p>\n<p>So to be clear, we <strong>never</strong> store any information on our API or on our web site during this process. All information is only stored on your WordPress website.</p>\n<h3>1.4.4</h3>\n<p>The sun ☀️ is shining. Time to do a little bit of house cleaning and fix some bugs related to database queries. Oh wait, how do the big folks call this? Bug fixes and performance improvements. Ah right, that&#8217;s the one.</p>\n<h3>1.4.3</h3>\n<p>Addressed CSRF vulnerability by adding user authentication, nonce verification, and improving access secret handling.</p>\n<h3>1.4.2</h3>\n<p>Bug fixes and security updates</p>\n<h3>1.4.1</h3>\n<p>Small security update related to the earlier reported XSS vulnerability on the email address input on the admin settings screen.</p>\n<h4>1.4.0</h4>\n<p><strong>🎉 Evergreen Content Poster 1.4.0: Now Tweeting Natively &amp; Welcoming Mastodon</strong></p>\n<p>Hello WordPress wizards! We&#8217;re thrilled to introduce version 1.4.0 of the Evergreen Content Poster, and guess what? It&#8217;s packed with features that&#8217;ll make your social media dance with joy. 🚀</p>\n<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct Twitter Integration: You asked, and we listened! Now, you can share updates straight to Twitter, sans Buffer. It&#8217;s all about making your social sharing as smooth as your morning coffee. ☕️</li>\n<li>Mastodon Support: Joining the herd! With Mastodon now in Buffer&#8217;s network galaxy, we&#8217;ve tweaked our code to welcome this new, buzzing platform. More reach, more impact!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Security Update</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Safer Experience: Thanks to the eagle-eyed DoYeon Park (p6rkdoye0n), a sneaky XSS vulnerability was spotted and squashed. Security is our mantra, and we&#8217;re sorry for this hiccup. Now, it&#8217;s stronger than ever. 🛡️</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>User Experience Boost</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smoother Onboarding: We&#8217;ve jazzed up the onboarding process. It&#8217;s more intuitive, more friendly – because we all need a gentle guide in the complex world of social media. 🌟</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter by Any Other Name: We&#8217;re sticking to calling it Twitter, for old times&#8217; sake. But who knows? We might jump on the rebranding wagon soon. What&#8217;s your take? 🤔</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, we&#8217;re here to make your social media journey a breeze. Update to 1.4.0, and let&#8217;s keep the conversation going. Your feedback is the wind beneath our wings!</p>\n<h4>1.3.6.1</h4>\n<p>Small copy/translation fixes</p>\n<h4>1.3.6.1</h4>\n<p>Small copy/translation fixes</p>\n<h4>1.3.6</h4>\n<p>Another bug fix release while we&#8217;re working on the next big release, oh and we&#8217;ve added a new little feature!</p>\n<p>Not sure if your messages are sent to your social channels? You can now enable notification emails when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a message has been posted successfully</li>\n<li>when a message fails to share on your social media accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we made under-the-hood improvements for the newly added Google Business Profile (previously Google My Business) and TikTok profile option in Buffer. Right now, both still need to be officially supported in the Buffer API, although you can start to send simple updates to your Google Business Profile via the plugin.</p>\n<p>This means that all the extra features on Google Business Profiles, like events with a start and stop date, etc., still need to be supported in the API at Buffer.</p>\n<p>Still, you can already start storing posts in your content library in the plugin correctly with all these extra fields, so the moment the Buffer API supports the extended capabilities, you can start using them.</p>\n<p>This means just basic updates to your <a href=\"https://www.evergreencontentposter.com/blog/optimize-your-google-business-profile/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Business Profiles, which are already a huge contributor local SEO</a> are now supported.</p>\n<p>TikTok content is also already fully supported in the plugin for TikTok Business accounts, for storing content. Still, as the Buffer API doesn&#8217;t support video yet, to start sending to your TikTok account, you will have to hold off a little bit longer for official support from Buffer. Like Google Business Profiles, though, you can already start adding content for your connected accounts.</p>\n<p>Happy sharing!</p>\n<h4>1.3.5</h4>\n<p>Instead of some early easter egg hunting, we&#8217;ve been on a bug hunting safari lately to improve the overall plugin experience.</p>\n<p>But we did not set out to go alone in the jungle. We&#8217;ve had some tremendous help from Sam from Tantrum Kite Surf, Susan and Victor from Poder Migrante!</p>\n<p>So what did they find and get fixed in this release?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When trying to send a post immediately upon publication to Instagram, it would not let you save your content</li>\n<li>When creating a new account with Buffer and you did not have any social networks connected, the connection to Buffer was okay, but there were no social networks to send your content to. We now display a helpful error message that tells you how to connect your social accounts and get them up and running in the plugin.</li>\n<li>When editing existing content in your library, it would lose the new line and line break information. This is now fixed, and we also correctly show the new lines in the content library from now on</li>\n<li>During onboarding, when you create your own custom content categories, these would not be taken into account with the automatic schedule creation. This has also been fixed now.</li>\n<li>We identified a bug where the &#8220;immediately share upon publication&#8221; was not working correctly. That has also been fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you so much for all your feedback! With your help, we can only make this plugin better and better!</p>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<p>Say hello to the Evergreen Content Poster 1.3.4! Or maybe hola would fit better, as this release introduces the translation into yet another language: Spanish! Did you know that the Evergreen Content Poster is already available in 6 languages? If your language is not on the supported list yet and you want to help out, be sure to follow the link from the settings page. Let&#8217;s try to make this the most translated plugin in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Oh, and we also fixed a tiny bug that got into the system after our previous release.</p>\n<p>As always, have a great day!</p>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<p>We recently ran a survey across other WordPress plugin developers and users about the importance of having a responsive backend version of your plugin, and although most people only ever seem to work in the WordPress backend from their desktop, we still thought to have a bit of polish through our plugin to make it fully responsive, you know just in case you need it and since we want to become the best plugin out there 😉</p>\n<p>We also added a banner, only visible to people using the plugin in a language that the plugin isn&#8217;t translated into yet. If you&#8217;re one of those people and want the plugin translated into your local language, you now have an easy way to support the localization.</p>\n<p>Next to that, there is not much to report today. However, we did a lot of underwater code optimizations to make sure that there are absolutely zero notice or other warning errors in your log files, together with some other minor tweaks here and there.</p>\n<p>You might call it an early spring cleaning!</p>\n<p>Enjoy this update, and if you&#8217;ve got any remarks or feature requests, you know where to find us!</p>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<p>Hey there,</p>\n<p>The first release of the new year. Thanks a bunch for sharing your feedback and  &hellip;</p>\n",

Only push content to your Buffer account the moment your Buffer queue is empty.</p>\n<p>And the best part?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no need to mess around with App IDs, authorization tokens or complicated technical steps.</p>\n<p>Connecting your social media profiles is done in a few clicks through Buffer, taking seconds.</p>\n<h4>Buffer Partner</h4>\n<p>In October 2020, we were proud to have been selected as a Partner by Buffer.</p>\n<p>This ensures continued access to Buffer&#8217;s API, meaning that the Evergreen Content Poster will continue to work and continue to improve.</p>\n<h3>A WordPress <strong>Social Media Analytics</strong> Plugin</h3>\n<p>You can&#8217;t improve what you don&#8217;t measure!</p>\n<p>Are you tired of manually adding UTM tags to your links to see which posts are performing the best and are resulting in the most traffic?</p>\n<p>With Evergreen Content Poster, you can automatically include UTM tags in all content shared. Now you can identify which social network is bringing in the most results, straight from your Google Analytics.</p>\n<h3>A WordPress <strong>Content Curation</strong> Plugin</h3>\n<p>We all know the amount of work that goes into creating a piece of content. And while making the best piece of content, there is, is needed if you want to rank your content. Content creation itself is only half the battle; the rest is gaining notice.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we give you the unique ability to create as many variations on a single post within your WordPress backend as you want.</p>\n<p>With Evergreen Content Poster <strong>you decide</strong> which of your content and how your content is shared to which social media channel.</p>\n<h3>What can I do with Evergreen Content Poster</h3>\n<p>Evergreen Content Poster isn&#8217;t like every other social media marketing tool. As content marketers ourselves, we know the importance of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sustaining and growing traffic to your website</li>\n<li>Growing social media following</li>\n<li>Keeping your existing social media followers engaged</li>\n<li>Promoting and sharing of your evergreen content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s why, with our plugin, <strong>you can automatically share posts from:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress to your Facebook pages</li>\n<li>WordPress to your Facebook groups</li>\n<li>WordPress to your Instagram Business accounts</li>\n<li>WordPress to your X (Twitter) profiles</li>\n<li>WordPress to Mastodon profiles</li>\n<li>WordPress to your LinkedIn Profile</li>\n<li>WordPress to your LinkedIn pages</li>\n<li>WordPress to your Pinterest boards</li>\n<li>WordPress to Google Business Profiles (previously Google My Business)</li>\n<li>WordPress to TikTok Business accounts ([learn how to switch your personal account to a TikTok business account] (https://www.evergreencontentposter.com/support/channel-management/convert-tiktok-personal-to-business-account/))</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;re able to do this using our partnership with Buffer, the leading social sharing tool available. And we&#8217;re not just talking about the standard posts from your WordPress website. No, the Evergreen Content Poster, supports ALL content that you can add into your WordPress website and more. The Evergreen Content Poster supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Posts (added straight from the WordPress Post edit screen)</li>\n<li>WordPress Pages (added straight from the WordPress Pages edit screen)</li>\n<li>Custom Post Types (added straight from the Custom Post Type edit screen)</li>\n<li>Products in your WooCommerce store (added straight from each WooCommerce Product edit screen)</li>\n<li>Content that lives outside of your WordPress website (which can be added directly into your Evergreen Content Poster content library)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Data</h4>\n<p>The plugin connects your website to <a href=\"https://buffer.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Buffer</a> (you will need an account with Buffer at the moment, but no worries, you can use the free plan).</p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve connected your WordPress website to your Buffer (buffer.com) account, we can then use their API to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get the social media profile names and ID&#8217;s that are connected in your Buffer account,</li>\n<li>Send the content from the content library within the app to one or more of your social media profiles (which content and which profiles you will send posts to depends on the settings in the plugin)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because we&#8217;ve created our own API to pass on any request towards Buffer, we will never see or use your login details or password.</p>\n<p>Simply connect the Evergreen Content Poster to Buffer. You only have to press the Authorize button on the Buffer website when you make the connection (we then get an access token that is stored in your own WordPress installation after this approval)</p>\n<p>This is all done via our own API to make sure that no private data (such as oAuth client secret keys) are included in this plugin&#8217;s code or made public.</p>\n<p>So to be clear, we <strong>never</strong> store any information on our API or on our web site during this process. All information is only stored on your WordPress website.</p>\n<h3>1.4.4</h3>\n<p>The sun ☀️ is shining. Time to do a little bit of house cleaning and fix some bugs related to database queries. Oh wait, how do the big folks call this? Bug fixes and performance improvements. Ah right, that&#8217;s the one.</p>\n<h3>1.4.3</h3>\n<p>Addressed CSRF vulnerability by adding user authentication, nonce verification, and improving access secret handling.</p>\n<h3>1.4.2</h3>\n<p>Bug fixes and security updates</p>\n<h3>1.4.1</h3>\n<p>Small security update related to the earlier reported XSS vulnerability on the email address input on the admin settings screen.</p>\n<h4>1.4.0</h4>\n<p><strong>🎉 Evergreen Content Poster 1.4.0: Now Tweeting Natively &amp; Welcoming Mastodon</strong></p>\n<p>Hello WordPress wizards! We&#8217;re thrilled to introduce version 1.4.0 of the Evergreen Content Poster, and guess what? It&#8217;s packed with features that&#8217;ll make your social media dance with joy. 🚀</p>\n<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direct Twitter Integration: You asked, and we listened! Now, you can share updates straight to Twitter, sans Buffer. It&#8217;s all about making your social sharing as smooth as your morning coffee. ☕️</li>\n<li>Mastodon Support: Joining the herd! With Mastodon now in Buffer&#8217;s network galaxy, we&#8217;ve tweaked our code to welcome this new, buzzing platform. More reach, more impact!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Security Update</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Safer Experience: Thanks to the eagle-eyed DoYeon Park (p6rkdoye0n), a sneaky XSS vulnerability was spotted and squashed. Security is our mantra, and we&#8217;re sorry for this hiccup. Now, it&#8217;s stronger than ever. 🛡️</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>User Experience Boost</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smoother Onboarding: We&#8217;ve jazzed up the onboarding process. It&#8217;s more intuitive, more friendly – because we all need a gentle guide in the complex world of social media. 🌟</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter by Any Other Name: We&#8217;re sticking to calling it Twitter, for old times&#8217; sake. But who knows? We might jump on the rebranding wagon soon. What&#8217;s your take? 🤔</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, we&#8217;re here to make your social media journey a breeze. Update to 1.4.0, and let&#8217;s keep the conversation going. Your feedback is the wind beneath our wings!</p>\n<h4>1.3.6.1</h4>\n<p>Small copy/translation fixes</p>\n<h4>1.3.6.1</h4>\n<p>Small copy/translation fixes</p>\n<h4>1.3.6</h4>\n<p>Another bug fix release while we&#8217;re working on the next big release, oh and we&#8217;ve added a new little feature!</p>\n<p>Not sure if your messages are sent to your social channels? You can now enable notification emails when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a message has been posted successfully</li>\n<li>when a message fails to share on your social media accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we made under-the-hood improvements for the newly added Google Business Profile (previously Google My Business) and TikTok profile option in Buffer. Right now, both still need to be officially supported in the Buffer API, although you can start to send simple updates to your Google Business Profile via the plugin.</p>\n<p>This means that all the extra features on Google Business Profiles, like events with a start and stop date, etc., still need to be supported in the API at Buffer.</p>\n<p>Still, you can already start storing posts in your content library in the plugin correctly with all these extra fields, so the moment the Buffer API supports the extended capabilities, you can start using them.</p>\n<p>This means just basic updates to your <a href=\"https://www.evergreencontentposter.com/blog/optimize-your-google-business-profile/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Business Profiles, which are already a huge contributor local SEO</a> are now supported.</p>\n<p>TikTok content is also already fully supported in the plugin for TikTok Business accounts, for storing content. Still, as the Buffer API doesn&#8217;t support video yet, to start sending to your TikTok account, you will have to hold off a little bit longer for official support from Buffer. Like Google Business Profiles, though, you can already start adding content for your connected accounts.</p>\n<p>Happy sharing!</p>\n<h4>1.3.5</h4>\n<p>Instead of some early easter egg hunting, we&#8217;ve been on a bug hunting safari lately to improve the overall plugin experience.</p>\n<p>But we did not set out to go alone in the jungle. We&#8217;ve had some tremendous help from Sam from Tantrum Kite Surf, Susan and Victor from Poder Migrante!</p>\n<p>So what did they find and get fixed in this release?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When trying to send a post immediately upon publication to Instagram, it would not let you save your content</li>\n<li>When creating a new account with Buffer and you did not have any social networks connected, the connection to Buffer was okay, but there were no social networks to send your content to. We now display a helpful error message that tells you how to connect your social accounts and get them up and running in the plugin.</li>\n<li>When editing existing content in your library, it would lose the new line and line break information. This is now fixed, and we also correctly show the new lines in the content library from now on</li>\n<li>During onboarding, when you create your own custom content categories, these would not be taken into account with the automatic schedule creation. This has also been fixed now.</li>\n<li>We identified a bug where the &#8220;immediately share upon publication&#8221; was not working correctly. That has also been fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you so much for all your feedback! With your help, we can only make this plugin better and better!</p>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<p>Say hello to the Evergreen Content Poster 1.3.4! Or maybe hola would fit better, as this release introduces the translation into yet another language: Spanish! Did you know that the Evergreen Content Poster is already available in 6 languages? If your language is not on the supported list yet and you want to help out, be sure to follow the link from the settings page. Let&#8217;s try to make this the most translated plugin in the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Oh, and we also fixed a tiny bug that got into the system after our previous release.</p>\n<p>As always, have a great day!</p>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<p>We recently ran a survey across other WordPress plugin developers and users about the importance of having a responsive backend version of your plugin, and although most people only ever seem to work in the WordPress backend from their desktop, we still thought to have a bit of polish through our plugin to make it fully responsive, you know just in case you need it and since we want to become the best plugin out there 😉</p>\n<p>We also added a banner, only visible to people using the plugin in a language that the plugin isn&#8217;t translated into yet. If you&#8217;re one of those people and want the plugin translated into your local language, you now have an easy way to support the localization.</p>\n<p>Next to that, there is not much to report today. However, we did a lot of underwater code optimizations to make sure that there are absolutely zero notice or other warning errors in your log files, together with some other minor tweaks here and there.</p>\n<p>You might call it an early spring cleaning!</p>\n<p>Enjoy this update, and if you&#8217;ve got any remarks or feature requests, you know where to find us!</p>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<p>Hey there,</p>\n<p>The first release of the new year. Thanks a bunch for sharing your feedback and  &hellip;</p>\n",
