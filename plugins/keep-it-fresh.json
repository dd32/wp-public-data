Keep it Fresh doesn&#8217;t remove old posts, nor does it muck with their <code>post_status</code>; rather, Keep it Fresh uses the <code>posts_where</code> WordPress filter to filter out posts older than the given date or amount of days whenever WordPress requests posts outside of the admin area.</p>\n",

        "faq": "<h4>How does Keep it Fresh hide my old events?</h4>\n<p>Keep it Fresh adds a date filter on the posts query each time WordPress requests posts to display (except when in the admin area).</p>\n<h4>`get_posts` still returns old posts. What do I do?</h4>\n<p>The <code>get_posts</code> function will suppress the filters that Keep it Fresh uses to hide old posts by default. To avoid this behavior, pass an array to <code>get_posts</code> with the key <code>suppress_filters</code> set to false. For example: <code>get_posts(array('suppress_filters'=&gt;false))</code>.</p>\n<h4>I love Keep it Fresh, but I&#8217;d like it to do &lt;blank&gt;.</h4>\n<p>Great, I&#8217;m glad to hear feature requests.  Just post a comment on the <a href=\"http://www.jonathankern.com/code/keepitfresh\" title=\"Keep it Fresh Homepage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin&#8217;s homepage</a>.</p>\n",
