        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to embed a Panopto video onto your page, your user normally needs to have iframe permissions. In a larger site where a user isn\\&#8217;t an admin, they likely do not have the ability to embed an iframe.</p>\n<p>This block gives standard users a simple way to embed a video or playlist from Panopto without requiring that they be given potentially dangerous permissions. The plugin verifies the url the user enters and ensures that only subdomains of panopto.com are rendered into iframes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can the html be formatted?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not within the block itself. The iframe is generated within a div and a class <code>panopto-video</code>, so you may use css rules to format it. But if you have multiple panopto videos embedded on a single page, they would need other wrappers to differentiate the rules.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
