Shipping costs can depend on e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total amount of the order</li>\n<li>Total weight of the order</li>\n<li>Number of articles or different products in the order</li>\n<li>Volume or minimal and maximal extensions of the products</li>\n<li>Postal code of the delivery address (the Advanced version also supports alphanumeric postal codes from the UK, Canana and Netherlands)</li>\n<li>Coupon Code (Advanced version only)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin exists in two different versions, this free version, which supports fixed bounds for all properties, and a paid version, which allows all conditions and shipping rules to contain arbitrary mathematical expressions (like an OR operator, multiplication, addition, subtraction, functions like rounding etc.). See the documentation for all the differences.</p>\n<p>Each rule is described as one line of text with an easy structure (semicolons separate the parts of the rule). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>Name=Free Shipping; 100&lt;=Amount; 0\nName=Domestic Small; Articles&lt;5; Amount&lt;100; Shipping=1.50\nName=Domestic Standard; Amount&lt;100; Shipping=3.50\n</code></pre>\n<p>This set of rules describes three shipping costs: Orders of 100€ and more are free, otherwise orders with less than five articles have shipping costs of 1.5€, all others 3.50€.</p>\n<h4>Limitations and common misconceptions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin is not designed to calculte shipping costs on a per-product level (e.g. it is not possible that Article A has shipping costs of 3€, Article B 5€ and if you order both you pay 8€ shipping)</li>\n<li>The plugin allows only limited support for category-based shipping. You can only find out if an article from a particular category is in the order, but NOT how many articles from a given category (e.g. it is not possible to have all articles from Category X ship for 3€ and all articles from Category Y ship for 5€)</li>\n<li>The plugin does NOT sum the results of all rules, but uses the FIRST matching rule it finds.</li>\n<li>The plugin does NOT use the lowest result of all rules, but it uses the FIRST matching rule it finds. (In particular, if you want to provide free shipping under certain conditions, you usually need to place the rule for free shipping FIRST rather than last, because the last rule will only be used if none of the other rules matches).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the full documentation of the Shipping by Rules plugin for WooCommerce see:<br />\nhttp://open-tools.net/documentation/advanced-shipping-by-rules-for-woocommerce.html</p>\n",

The basic concepts of these plugins are identical, so most solutions for VirtueMart will also work in the WooCommerce shipping plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
