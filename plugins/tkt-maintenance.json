You will have to navigate to the native <code>/wp-login.php</code> URL of your website and will be able to login.<br />\nFor Administrators, the Front End will not show the Maintenance Mode. It will continue to show your website, in order to allow you to control your development.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20fully%20customize%20the%20maintenance%20mode%20template%3F'>\nCan I Fully Customize the Maintenance Mode Template?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! You can either use the Plugin settings to customize the template, or, you can also load your 100% custom PHP template, if you wish. To do so, just pass your Custom PHP template to the <code>tkt_mtn_template_path</code> filter which the plugin provides.</p>\n<p>Example (assuming you store the template in your Theme&#8217;s <code>template-parts/post/</code> folder):</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'tkt_mtn_template_path', 'load_my_own_template', 10, 1 );\nfunction load_my_own_template( $template_path ){\n\n    $template_path = get_template_directory() .'/template-parts/post/custm_template.php';//Load your own template.\n\n    return $template_path;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can take a look at the Plugin&#8217;s Template in <code>tkt-maintenance/public/partials/tkt-maintenance-public-display.php</code> file to get a kickstart for your own Template.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
