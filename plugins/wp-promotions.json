If you require a custom feature for the plugin or your website I&#8217;m afraid that you will need to find someone (probably paid) to do it. Feel free to ask though, it might be an upcoming feature or something that the plugin needs!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found a bug! &#8211;<br />\nAwesome &#8211; well kind of. Can&#8217;t squash them all! If you&#8217;ve found a bug that is not a security issue feel free to post it on the WordPress Forums, my website or email me! If the bug is a security issue&#8230; please be a little bit quieter and alert me by email. My thanks for anyone who reports bugs!</p>\n",
