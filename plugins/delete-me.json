Links are always deleted permanently.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20support%20wordpress%20multisite%3F'>\nDoes this plugin support WordPress Multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Network Activation and single Site activation are both supported. Users and their content will only be deleted from the Site they delete themselves from, other Network Sites will be unaffected.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20using%20multisite%2C%20are%20users%20deleted%20from%20the%20network%20or%20only%20the%20site%20deletion%20originated%20from%3F'>\nWhen using Multisite, are users deleted from the Network or only the Site deletion originated from?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, users registered to multiple Sites on the Network are only deleted from the current Site and will remain registered to their remaining Sites. However, if the setting &#8220;Delete From Network&#8221; is checked, users will be deleted from the entire Network.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20for%20a%20user%20to%20delete%20anyone%20but%20themselves%3F'>\nIs it possible for a user to delete anyone but themselves?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the user deleted is the currently logged in user, period.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20shortcode%20display%20when%20users%20are%20not%20logged%20in%20or%20their%20role%20is%20not%20allowed%20to%20delete%20themselves%3F'>\nWhat does the Shortcode display when users are not logged in or their role is not allowed to delete themselves?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing, when using the self-closing Shortcode tag (i.e. <code>[plugin_delete_me /]</code>). However, when the opening and closing Shortcode tags are used (i.e. <code>[plugin_delete_me]</code>Content<code>[/plugin_delete_me]</code>), the content inside the tags will appear instead of the delete link.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20users%20sent%20after%20deleting%20themselves%3F'>\nWhere are users sent after deleting themselves?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <strong>Settings -&gt; Delete Me</strong> subpanel lets you enter any URL you&#8217;d like to redirect deleted users to, set to homepage by default. You can leave &#8220;Landing URL&#8221; blank to have users remain at the same URL after deletion.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20confirmation%20before%20the%20user%20deletes%20themselves%3F'>\nIs there a confirmation before the user deletes themselves?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the delete link on the <strong>Your Profile</strong> page leads to a pre-built confirmation page. You can optionally require users to confirm their password on this page before deletion. The Shortcode delete Link provides a Javascript confirm dialog [OK] [Cancel] by default, but may be disabled if preferred. Additionally, the Shortcode has a setting that provides a Form instead of the Link, which requires users to confirm their password.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='may%20i%20be%20notified%20of%20users%20who%20delete%20themselves%20and%20what%20was%20deleted%3F'>\nMay I be notified of users who delete themselves and what was deleted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The <strong>Settings -&gt; Delete Me</strong> subpanel has a setting called &#8220;E-mail Notification&#8221;, just check the box and save changes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20store%20any%20personal%20information%20about%20users%3F'>\nDoes this plugin store any personal information about users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the only data stored is related to the plugin&#8217;s settings which are located on the <strong>Settings -&gt; Delete Me</strong> subpanel.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
