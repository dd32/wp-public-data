The plugin does not create a search results page, but modifies the SQL database query to make your search engine work better.</p>\n<p>Additionally you can search for whole phrases instead of each single word of phrase. As a result, search will be more accurate than before.</p>\n<h4>New search core</h4>\n<p>We modified the code of search engine. Content search is now faster by about 75% <em>(depending on the level of complexity of searched phrase)</em>!</p>\n<h4>Support to the development of plugin</h4>\n<p>We spend hours working on the development of this plugin.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to <code>/wp-content/plugins/acf-better-search</code> directory, or install plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate plugin through <code>Plugins</code> screen in WordPress Admin Panel.</li>\n<li>Use <code>Settings -&gt; ACF: Better Search</code> screen to configure the plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20version%20of%20advanced%20custom%20fields%20is%20supported%3F'>\nWhat version of Advanced Custom Fields is supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Advanced Custom Fields in version 5 <em>(also free)</em>. ACF below version 5 has a different data structure in database and is not supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='in%20what%20fields%20does%20the%20plugin%20search%3F'>\nIn what fields does the plugin search?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our plugin supports the following fields: Text, Text Area, Number, Email, Url, File, Wysiwyg Editor, Select, Checkbox and Radio Button.</p>\n<p>All these fields may be located in both the Repeater or Flexible Content field.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20work%3F'>\nHow does this work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin changes all SQL queries by extending the standard search to selected fields of Advanced Custom Fields.</p>\n<p>The plugin in admin panel works same as for the search page.</p>\n<p>It works for <code>WP_Query</code> class.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20activate%20advanced%20search%3F'>\nHow to activate advanced search?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Everythings works automatically. For custom <code>WP_Query</code> loop and <code>get_posts()</code> function also if you add <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Search_Parameter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Search Parameter</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20to%20do%20when%20not%20searching%20for%20posts%3F'>\nWhat to do when not searching for posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes it happens that the data in your database is incorrectly arranged. This happens when you import or duplicate posts.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>Incorrect Mode</code>. This is a slower search, but it does not take into account the order of records in the <code>_postmeta</code> table. This solution should help in this situation. Use of this mode is allowed without restrictions. This does not mean any problems with your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20searching%20for%20whole%20phrases%3F'>\nHow does searching for whole phrases?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default search in WordPress is to search for each of words listed. An additional option in the plugin settings allows you to search for occurrences of the whole phrase entered in the search field without word division.</p>\n<p>You can enable it at any time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20lite%20mode%20work%3F'>\nHow does Lite mode work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this mode, the plugin does not check the field types. Phrases are searched in all ACF fields. Thanks to this, the query to the database is smaller and faster by about 25%. However, we do not have control over which fields are taken into account when searching.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20completely%20free%3F'>\nIs the plugin completely free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin is completely free.</p>\n<p>However, working on plugins and technical support requires many hours of work.

Thanks everyone!</p>\n<p>Thank you for all the ratings and reviews.</p>\n<p>If you are satisfied with this plugin, please recommend it to your friends.
