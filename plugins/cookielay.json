        "faq": "\n<dt id='cookielay%20is%20not%20displayed%20on%20my%20website'>\nCookielay is not displayed on my website\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If Cookielay is not displayed on your website, then this may be due to various reasons. First of all, you should check if Cookielay is active at all. The current status is constantly displayed in the upper area. If it is currently inactive, you need to enable Cookielay in the Dashboard first. Additionally, you should check your settings.</p>\n<p>Cookielay is still not displayed? Open the JavaScript console on your website and see if any error messages are displayed. In many cases, these are helpful for troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>If no error is displayed in the console, then check if your active theme or another plugin deregisters jQuery.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='cookielay%20is%20displayed%20again%20with%20every%20page%20view'>\nCookielay is displayed again with every page view\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check your domain in the settings. If your entered URL is incorrect or incomplete, then the cookie cannot be set properly, which leads to repeated display of Cookielay.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20which%20cookies%20my%20website%20sets%20and%20for%20which%20i%20need%20to%20obtain%20consent%3F'>\nHow do I know which cookies my website sets and for which I need to obtain consent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several ways to find out which cookies your website sets. The easiest way is to check the privacy settings of your browser to see which cookies belong to your website. Alternatively, there are also a bunch of websites out there that scan your site for cookies. Just search for them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we can not give you legal advice on which cookies you need to get consent for. Basically, you should get consent from the user for every cookie, unless it is absolutely necessary for the operation of your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20a%20cookie%20to%20cookielay%3F'>\nHow do I add a cookie to Cookielay?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all, you should know what kind of cookie you want to add to Cookielay and what its function is. To add the cookie, click &#8220;Add cookie&#8221; under &#8220;Cookies&#8221;. Enter a title that fits the cookie. In the corresponding field, enter the actual name of the cookie as it is stored in the browser. Fill in all other fields and select a cookie group. If you do not find a suitable group, you should create one first.</p>\n<p>Now it gets exciting: Copy the JavaScript code, which should be executed after the consent or after blocking the cookie, into the appropriate editors (with the script-tag). The corresponding code will then be executed on every page load. For example, for a statistics cookie, you add the tracking code in the &#8220;Scripts (Allow)&#8221; field.</p>\n<p>Now you just have to save the cookie and activate it in the overview.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
