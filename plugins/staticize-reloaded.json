It&#8217;s a good idea to deactivate when making template changes. To flush the cache just edit a post or comment.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Do I really need to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>Probably not, WordPress is fast enough that caching usually only adds a few milliseconds of performance that isn&#8217;t really perceptible by users. Some reasons you may want to use Staticize Reloaded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your site gets Slashdotted</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re on a very slow server</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;ve had a complaint from your host about performance</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How can I tell if it&#8217;s working?</h4>\n<p>Staticize Reloaded adds some stats to the very end of a page in the HTML, so you can view source to see the time it took to generate a page and rather it was cached or not. Remember that the cache is created on demand, so the first time you load a page it&#8217;ll be generated from the database.</p>\n<h4>I see gibberish on the screen when I activate this plugin?</h4>\n<p>Make sure that you deactivated compression on the Miscellaneous options screen and that gzip encoding is turned off on the PHP level</p>\n<h4>How do I make certain parts of the page stay dynamic?</h4>\n<p>There are two ways to do this, you can have functions that say dynamic or include entire other files. To have a dynamic function in the cached PHP page use this syntax around the function:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!--mfunc function_name('parameter', 'another_parameter') --&gt; &lt;?php function_name('parameter', 'another_parameter') ?&gt; &lt;!--/mfunc--&gt; </code></pre>\n<p>The HTML comments around the mirrored PHP allow it to be executed in the static page. To include another file try this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!--mclude file.php--&gt; &lt;?php include_once(ABSPATH . 'file.php'); ?&gt; &lt;!--/mclude--&gt; </code></pre>\n<p>That will include file.php under the ABSPATH directory, which is the same as where your <code>wp-config.php</code> file is located.</p>\n",
