However calling this in functions.php<br />\nsection of your theme may override the plugin&#8217;s functions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s not working on long pieces of code</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the first version so it may not work with extremely large sections of code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My code is still coming out wrong after I update the post</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ignore Code only stops code from being modified on the client side in the visual editor.  It does not do anything<br />\non the server side.  For that you need to do something like remove_filter(&#8216;the_content&#8217;, &#8216;wpautop&#8217;);</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My code is not showing up in the visual editor anymore</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the down side of this plugin, it causes the visual editor to ignore the code entirely so it won&#8217;t be<br />\nrepresented as anything on there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My CSS is still getting mangled</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use this plugin in conjunction with Preserved HTML Editor Markup Plus to work with even more code.  However<br />\nread that plugin&#8217;s documentation closely as installing it can modify the way your website looks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It killed my website!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because this is the first version, it is highly recommended you have FTP and database access to your website in case<br />\nyou need to uninstall this plugin manually if it crashed your website.  This precaution is a good one to take for<br />\nevery plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
