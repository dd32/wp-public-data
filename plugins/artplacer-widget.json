Using ArtPlacer you can create three types of Widget buttons: Client Room, Sample Room and Augmented Reality.<br />\n• The ArtPlacer Client Room Widget shows how an artwork will come together in a space. It helps collectors to visualize exactly what the original artwork would look like in their actual room.<br />\n• The ArtPlacer AR Widget places artworks on surrounding walls in real time. This mobile feature is functional in iOS and Android devices and connects with the ArtPlacer Mobile App.<br />\n• The ArtPlacer Sample Room Widget helps to visualize artworks outside the gallery or studio environment and out into the world. Choose from a variety of over 800 pre-set spaces to showcase your art at scale!<br />\nRequirements<br />\nArtPlacer integrates seamlessly with your WooCommerce catalog so you need to have this plugin installed to run dynamic integrations in a snap. If you don’t have WooCommerce, you can use the [artplacer] shortcode instead.</p>\n",
