And a free plugin!!</p>\n<p>@allancaeg\n</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Lite features (Free)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-step or Single-step</strong>: Choose between multi-step and one-step checkout layouts. While Fluid Checkout changes the layout of the checkout page, it will still look and feel like your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimized for mobile</strong>: Fluid Checkout is optimized for mobile devices and will surface the most appropriate keyboard type on fields such as phone and email. In fact, Fluid Checkout was created with mobile devices in mind, and enhanced with more functionality and style for bigger screens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Easily add trust symbols to the checkout page</strong>: Add any widget such as accepted payment methods, security badges, reviews, testimonials, or anything that can boost the perceived trust customers have on the website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shipping before billing</strong>: Customers expect to fill up shipping information before thinking about billing, by asking for the shipping information before billing, we remove unnecessary friction, matching the customer&#8217;s expectations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hide optional fields</strong>: The average checkout page has 16 open fields, by removing optional fields from the immediate view we can reduce that number to about 8-9 fields. These fields can still be entered as the customer can click the &#8220;Add &#8221; links to reveal the fields they need. Examples of these fields are the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Address line 2&#8221;, &#8220;Phone&#8221; and &#8220;Order notes&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instant field validation</strong>: The default WooCommerce checkout only validates when the form is submitted, leading to confusion and frustration. Customers want the &#8220;Place order&#8221; button to be the last thing they click to complete their purchase. Some things can only be validated when placing the order, such as if the credit card is valid and has enough funds to cover the order total, however, most errors at checkout can be prevented by instantly validating the customer data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrated coupon code field at the checkout</strong>: When users see an open coupon code field at the checkout page the changes they will leave the website and go &#8220;coupon hunting&#8221; is very high, and they might not come back. The integrated coupon code field is displayed in a custom expansible section, and while less noticeable is still discoverable by customers who have a coupon and need to add it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shipping phone field</strong>: Add a separate phone field for shipping-related questions, in addition to the native billing phone field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automatically saved customer data</strong>: customers won&#8217;t lose any information they already have entered on the checkout page, and will get back exactly where they left when re-visiting it. Only payment information won&#8217;t be saved for security reasons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skip completed steps</strong>: Repeat customers will love how easy it is to complete their next purchase. Fluid Checkout skips the steps where all required information is provided and validated while providing an easy way to review and change any of the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Log-in without leaving the checkout</strong>: Repeat customers with an account registered can log in from the checkout page directly without having to visit another page and make their way back to checkout.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PRO features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Design templates</strong>: choose the design template that best fits your theme and website styles. Choose from the templates: Classic, Boxed, Split and Minimalist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Account matching</strong>: let registered customers complete the purchase without logging in and associate the order to existing customer account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit cart at checkout</strong>: let customers edit product quantity or remove products directly from the checkout page. You might even want to ditch the cart page entirely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Express checkout</strong>: display express checkout buttons from popular payment methods at the checkout page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cart page optimization</strong>: always updated cart, with operations processed via AJAX, cart cross-sells display, coupon code field, and layout consistent with the checkout page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thank you / Order confirmation page</strong>: order details layout consistent with the checkout page on the order received page and account view order pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Billing before billing &amp; force billing same as shipping</strong>: Choose between options to move the billing address section on the checkout form, including forcing billing and shipping addresses into a single address section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Offer gift options</strong>: let customers add a gift message to their order that can to be printed with the packing slips generated by popular invoices and packing slips plugins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Local pickup</strong>: hide shipping address when a local pickup shipping method is selected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>International phone number</strong>: format and validate phone fields on the checkout and account pages based on the country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrated coupon code field at the checkout</strong>: more options for positions to display the coupon code field.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Future features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order pay optimization</li>\n<li>Delayed account creation</li>\n<li>Customize checkout steps and fields</li>\n<li>&#8230; and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want all features?

And a free plugin!!</p>\n<p>@allancaeg\n</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Lite features (Free)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-step or Single-step</strong>: Choose between multi-step and one-step checkout layouts. While Fluid Checkout changes the layout of the checkout page, it will still look and feel like your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimized for mobile</strong>: Fluid Checkout is optimized for mobile devices and will surface the most appropriate keyboard type on fields such as phone and email. In fact, Fluid Checkout was created with mobile devices in mind, and enhanced with more functionality and style for bigger screens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Easily add trust symbols to the checkout page</strong>: Add any widget such as accepted payment methods, security badges, reviews, testimonials, or anything that can boost the perceived trust customers have on the website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shipping before billing</strong>: Customers expect to fill up shipping information before thinking about billing, by asking for the shipping information before billing, we remove unnecessary friction, matching the customer&#8217;s expectations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hide optional fields</strong>: The average checkout page has 16 open fields, by removing optional fields from the immediate view we can reduce that number to about 8-9 fields. These fields can still be entered as the customer can click the &#8220;Add &#8221; links to reveal the fields they need. Examples of these fields are the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Address line 2&#8221;, &#8220;Phone&#8221; and &#8220;Order notes&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instant field validation</strong>: The default WooCommerce checkout only validates when the form is submitted, leading to confusion and frustration. Customers want the &#8220;Place order&#8221; button to be the last thing they click to complete their purchase. Some things can only be validated when placing the order, such as if the credit card is valid and has enough funds to cover the order total, however, most errors at checkout can be prevented by instantly validating the customer data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrated coupon code field at the checkout</strong>: When users see an open coupon code field at the checkout page the changes they will leave the website and go &#8220;coupon hunting&#8221; is very high, and they might not come back. The integrated coupon code field is displayed in a custom expansible section, and while less noticeable is still discoverable by customers who have a coupon and need to add it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shipping phone field</strong>: Add a separate phone field for shipping-related questions, in addition to the native billing phone field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automatically saved customer data</strong>: customers won&#8217;t lose any information they already have entered on the checkout page, and will get back exactly where they left when re-visiting it. Only payment information won&#8217;t be saved for security reasons.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skip completed steps</strong>: Repeat customers will love how easy it is to complete their next purchase. Fluid Checkout skips the steps where all required information is provided and validated while providing an easy way to review and change any of the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Log-in without leaving the checkout</strong>: Repeat customers with an account registered can log in from the checkout page directly without having to visit another page and make their way back to checkout.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PRO features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Design templates</strong>: choose the design template that best fits your theme and website styles. Choose from the templates: Classic, Boxed, Split and Minimalist.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Account matching</strong>: let registered customers complete the purchase without logging in and associate the order to existing customer account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit cart at checkout</strong>: let customers edit product quantity or remove products directly from the checkout page. You might even want to ditch the cart page entirely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Express checkout</strong>: display express checkout buttons from popular payment methods at the checkout page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cart page optimization</strong>: always updated cart, with operations processed via AJAX, cart cross-sells display, coupon code field, and layout consistent with the checkout page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thank you / Order confirmation page</strong>: order details layout consistent with the checkout page on the order received page and account view order pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Billing before billing &amp; force billing same as shipping</strong>: Choose between options to move the billing address section on the checkout form, including forcing billing and shipping addresses into a single address section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Offer gift options</strong>: let customers add a gift message to their order that can to be printed with the packing slips generated by popular invoices and packing slips plugins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Local pickup</strong>: hide shipping address when a local pickup shipping method is selected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>International phone number</strong>: format and validate phone fields on the checkout and account pages based on the country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrated coupon code field at the checkout</strong>: more options for positions to display the coupon code field.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Future features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order pay optimization</li>\n<li>Delayed account creation</li>\n<li>Customize checkout steps and fields</li>\n<li>&#8230; and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want all features?
