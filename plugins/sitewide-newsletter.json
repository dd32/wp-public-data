Firstly if any emails fail to be sent the failing email addresses will be shown in a list, so you can decide what to do. Secondly there is a &#8220;Test&#8221; checkbox, which when checked will only send the newsletter to the site admin email address.</p>\n<p>If you have a lot of users this plugin may take a long while to run, as it sends a separate email for each user. There is some reasoning behind that: in the future I may write in some special codes that you can use in your emails that will insert the users email address (so they can unsubscribe, for instance), a link to their wp-admin folder, and more user-specific data. That stuff is pretty much impossible to do if you use BCC to send one email to multiple people.</p>\n",
