Isn&#8217;t this supposed to be automated ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s automated and there is no need for the wordpress admin to approve a good comment.<br />\nBut to validate a comment for foul language and slangs, which is called a toxicity check, it takes time, like many many seconds, to detect it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20it%20take%20so%20much%20time%20for%20a%20toxicity%20check%20%3F'>\nWhy does it take so much time for a toxicity check ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The toxicity check connects to TensorFlow, here using <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/js\" title=\"TensorFlow using JavaScript\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TensorFlowJS</a>, which is a Google&#8217;s product and the data sets used are on Google&#8217;s servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='so%20this%20connects%20to%20some%203rd%20party%20backend-service%20%3F'>\nSo this connects to some 3rd party backend-service ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it connects to an API at toxicity.co.in which is again, my (free) service which runs on Deno at Deno Deploy &#8211; deno.com which in turn goes to Google for returning the results of toxicity. Sometimes it takes a minute or more to return the result and at times, it even times out. If it times out the admin has to manually validate the comment in wp-admin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20remain%20free%20forever%20%3F'>\nWill this plugin remain free forever ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I want it to remain free forever and open-sourced.<br />\nThere is so much of free stuff on the internet and even open-sourced.<br />\nI want to be part of the community and don&#8217;t intend on commercializing it.<br />\nBut if toxicity service at my deno.com account take a hit on many requests, I will then have to shell out minimum $10/mo ($2 per million requests per month, $0.30/GiB outbound data transfer)<br />\nEven then that&#8217;s okay and I can fund that minimum amount, but if it goes beyong $10 a month, then I will seek funding of some sort.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
