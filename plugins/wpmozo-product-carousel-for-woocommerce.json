        "installation": "<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>\n<p>PHP 7.0 or greater is required (PHP 7.3 or greater is recommended)<br />\nMySQL 5.6 or greater, OR MariaDB version 10.1 or greater, is required<br />\nFor a detailed list of server requirements, please refer to the official WordPress requirements documentation.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Installation</h3>\n<p>Automatic installation is the most straightforward approach. With this method, WordPress manages the file transfer for you, and there&#8217;s no need to leave your browser. To perform an automatic install of WPMozo Product Carousel for WooCommerce:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Log in</strong> to your <strong>WordPress Dashboard</strong>.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the Plugins menu and click “<strong>Add New.</strong>”</li>\n<li>In the search field, type “<strong>WPMozo Product Carousel for WooCommerce</strong>”.</li>\n<li>Once you locate the plugin, you&#8217;ll see details like the version, ratings, and a brief description. Click “<strong>Install Now</strong>,” and WordPress will take care of the installation process.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>If you prefer to <a href=\"https://documentation.wpmozo.com/wpmozo-product-carousel-for-woocommerce/installation/\" title=\"install WPMozo Product Carousel for WooCommerce manually\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">install WPMozo Product Carousel for WooCommerce manually</a>, you&#8217;ll need to download the WPMozo Product Carousel for WooCommerce plugin and upload it to your server using your preferred FTP application. If you need guidance on this process, the WordPress codex offers detailed instructions on manual plugin installation.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>While automatic updates typically occur without a hitch, it&#8217;s always wise to back up your website before applying any updates.</p>\n<p>Should you run into any display issues with the carousel after updating, it may help to flush the permalinks. To do this, go to <strong>WordPress</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Permalinks</strong> and click “<strong>Save</strong>.” This action often resolves any permalink-related issues post-update.</p>\n",
