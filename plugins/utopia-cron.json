Rather than trying to load the page in your browser at regular intervals, enter the URL here and the page will be loaded from WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the timing exact?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No. It uses blog visitor page views to do the timing, so on a blog that&#8217;s rarely visited, it may not be called often enough. As well, if there are a lot of URLs to visit in your list, there may not be time enough to reach them all. In this case, enter fewer URLs, or call them less often.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where can I read more?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit http://ActiveBlogging.com/info/wordpress-cron-plugin/</p>\n"
