Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. According to WHO( World Health Organization ), This disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell. Since we all are now hit by the long-term lockdown and shutdown worldwide, itâ€™s imperative to raise awareness and update your clients and website visitors about the status of your business. The best way to do this is probably through your WordPress-powered business site.</p>\n<p>This plugin displays the Coronavirus ( Covid19 ) live report as a chart or graph. You can display the case data of the whole world and country you care through a single shortcode in your WordPress post or page. You can use this shortcode with some attributes also. This is a very simple plugin with a sole purpose of allowing website owners a quick way to add a COVID-19 chart to their website. You can display all charts as news, worldmeter map, death toll over page navigation. It also shows a specific country like India, Italy, the USA, etc.</p>\n<h3>Note:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This plugin is relying on a 3rd party as a service and under www.domo.com</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Service Link <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> www.domo.com/covid19/</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Share the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Tracker on your blog or siteâ€”no Domo license or coding required.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 data is gathered every 10 minutes from credible sources, including WHO, CDC, Johns Hopkins University, Worldometer, IHME, The COVID Tracking Project, FRED, The New York Times, the Wikipedia compilation of world testing, SafeGraph, and data from AWS Data Exchange.</p>\n<p>Privacy Policy <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> https://www.domo.com/company/privacy-policy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>ðŸ’Œ Common questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is the recovery time for the coronavirus disease?</strong><br />\nThey found that for people with mild disease, recovery time is about two weeks, while people with severe or critical disease recover within three to six weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Who is most at risk for the coronavirus disease?</strong><br />\nPeople of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.</li>\n<li><strong>Is coronavirus a bacteria or virus?</strong><br />\nThe new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</li>\n<li><strong>Which are the first symptoms of the coronavirus disease?</strong><br />\nThe virus can cause a range of symptoms, ranging from mild illness to pneumonia. Symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, sore throat and headaches. In severe cases difficulty in breathing and deaths can occur.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>HOW IT SPREADS</h3>\n<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.<br />\nYou can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>\n<h3>Protecting yourself and others from the spread COVID-19</h3>\n<p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>\n<li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.</li>\n<li>Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).</li>\n<li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>\n<li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>\n<li>Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.</li>\n<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</li>\n<li>Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>ACC | Advanced Custom Code</h4>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oi37VBW2vkg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Let&#8217;s meet with another plugin, that able to solves tons of problems any WordPress site and able to satisfy your need your demands.
