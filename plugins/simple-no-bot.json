In earlier versions of SNB, the submit button was disabled until this threshold was met.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why not just use Recaptcha 3?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google is great and all, but with every recaptcha, font, map or tag you use, you are passing each visitor&#8217;s usage information to Google and strengthening their control over the web.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The browser automatically generates data from input events and passes it to the server via XHR. The server generates a unique token,<br />\nstores a session in a transient record and returns token to the browser. The browser then injects a new input field to WPCF7<br />\nform that contains token. When form is submitted, SNB rejects the form if no corresponding transient exists (among other things).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work without Javascript</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Contact forms will fail if Javascript is not enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it require cookies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not currently. We may add more behavioral analysis if the latest generation of JS-empowered bots continues to proliferate.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
