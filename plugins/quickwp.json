        "description": "<p>With QuickWP you don&#8217;t need to manually install plugins anymore. With QuickWP you can upload a txt file with a list of plugins which will then be installed and activated automatically. The plugin is especially useful for web developers or agencies who often need to install new WordPress installs but don&#8217;t want to manually install the required plugins. QuickWP also offers a library with predefined QuickWP files. You can download different plugin packages for example &#8220;Essentials for client websites&#8221; with a list of plugins suitable for developing client websites.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>How do I create a QuickWP file?</p>\n<p>You can either manually install all the plugins you would like to add to your list and then go to &#8220;QuickWP-&gt;Create file&#8221; to download a file with all currently installed plugins. You can then use that file for your next WordPress installation. Or you can create the QuickWP file manually by opening it in a text editor and adding the plugin slugs. For more information on how to manually adapt your QuickWP file please check out our <a href=\"http://www.lingulo.com/wp-plugins/quickwp-quickly-install-favorite-wordpress-plugins\" title=\"QuickWP - Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Will I be able to use QuickWP even if there are plugins installed already?</p>\n<p>Yes you will be. If a plugin in your QuickWP file is already installed it will simply be skipped. However note that in some cases there might be an issue if a theme or plugin has previously used the TGM Plugin Activation library. It is best to use QuickWP immediately after installing WordPress.</p>\n<p>Why does nothing happen when I click on &#8220;Start the magic&#8221;?</p>\n<p>Please make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser. Also please make sure your browser is updated to the current version. If the error still occurs please contact us at info@lingulo.com</p>\n<p>Why does the plugin library not show up when I click &#8220;Browse QuickWP files&#8221;?</p>\n<p>If your website is using HTTPS you might not be able to see the library. Instead you can click <a href=\"http://www.lingulo.com/wp-plugins/quickwp-quickly-install-favorite-wordpress-plugins\" title=\"QuickWP - browse the library\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and browse the library directly on the plugin&#8217;s website.</p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/quickwp</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to &#8220;QuickWP-&gt;Browse QuickWP files&#8221; to download a predefined file or create your own file according to our documentation (http://www.lingulo.com/wp-plugins/quickwp-quickly-install-favorite-wordpress-plugins).</li>\n<li>Go to &#8220;QuickWP-&gt;QuickWP&#8221; to upload a QuickWP file, then start the installation process by clicking the large button.</li>\n<li>Wait for the process to finish. In some cases we can&#8217;t activate the plugins automatically so you would need to do that manually after the installation finishes.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
