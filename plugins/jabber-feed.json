I would personnaly advice to create a new account<br />\njust for it (you can also use your personal account of course, anyway the plugin&#8217;s<br />\nbot will create a resource identifier unique for every connection) and to<br />\nconfigure it to refuse any contact and communication (as noone will have to<br />\nadd it to one&#8217;s roster, except you maybe for test or debugging purpose?).<br />\nThe fields are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bot adress (full jid form: mybotname@myserveraddress);</li>\n<li>the password.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Connection Parameters</h4>\n<p>By default Jabber Feed can now use SRV records which is a recommended way to<br />\nadvertize server and port from a domain name (see for instance<br />\nhttp://dns.vanrein.org/srv/ for details).</p>\n<p>This is an advanced section in case your server does not use SRV AND uses a server<br />\nwhich is not the same as the domain from the jid or a port different from the default one (5222).</p>\n<p>Hence there will be very very new cases where you will have to fill this<br />\nsection and if you don&#8217;t understand all what I say here, just don&#8217;t fill<br />\nanything here (if you fill even only one field, then it will be used instead<br />\nof SRV and default values).</p>\n<p>The default values will be used if fields empty and no SRV is configured on<br />\nthe Jabber server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Jabber server (often the same as &#8216;myseveraddress&#8217; of the jid);</li>\n<li>the Jabber port (usually 5222).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>PubSub configuration</h4>\n<p>Where to publish the notifications.

A new column<br />\ncalled &#8220;Jabber Feed&#8221; will display:<br />\n* The publication date on the node (and the last update will appear on a<br />\nbubble when the mouse passes by);<br />\n* &#8216;Error on publication&#8217; when an error has occured during publication (and the<br />\nerror text will be displayed when the mouse passes by);<br />\n* &#8216;Not Published&#8217; when no publication never occurred (which is simply when the post has<br />\n been published on WordPress before the plugin has been installed.</p>\n<h3>Todo</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TTL support for DNS/SRV records.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Still need to test extensively (and if necessary improve) the right system<br />\nin WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>will the non-approved comments be published on the comment nodes?</li>\n<li>will the private posts be published?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the &#8220;configuration&#8221; window, I should make a detection of the<br />\nprerequisites, gray everything if a mandatory one is not fulfilled and give an<br />\nexplanation text.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what about internationalization?!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manage menu: with failed publication, it should be possible to retry the<br />\npublication from this page (with multiple checkbox if possible to massively<br />\nrun publication!).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what about an equivalent of post management for comments?!

No &#8220;from&#8221; with a pseudo in it, and data<br />\nabout real jid accessible from admin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve globally the<br />\nmessage syntax (for instance the message &#8216;updated&#8217; and &#8216;created&#8217; tags).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure the node instead of simply create it with default configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the node authorizations if it is already existing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve the internationalization strings (and set at least 2 default<br />\nlanguages: English and French).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what if the post or page is private? Should it be added on a node? Maybe<br />\na node with a white list that the admin can manage?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apparently if I disapprove or flag a comment as spam from the &#8220;edit comment&#8221;<br />\npage, it does not remove it from the node. Why? Is it a bug from WordPress<br />\nwhich does not trigger the action in all cases? Or is there another WordPress&#8217;<br />\naction for this specific case? Try this also with posts from the &#8220;edit post&#8221;<br />\npage.<br />\nEdit: it seems to be a known bug: https://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5792<br />\nIs planned to be fixed for WordPress 2.9 apparently.<br />\n=&gt; this seems to be fixed now! Woohoo!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add more authentication mechanisms? (current: Digest-MD5, CramMD5, PLAIN,<br />\nANONYMOUS. Only Digest-MD5 and PLAIN has been tested)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SSLv23 added, but what about TLS?  (TLS does not work on Gmail. SSL and TLS works on ejabberd. So<br />\nI have decided to use SSL only for now)<br />\nNote that it looks like the PHP implementation of TLS encryption does not seem<br />\nlike verifying the certificate&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add poster/commenter name in ATOM format.<br />\nPoster&#8217;s name<br />\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add support for button of publishing all posts in once&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Propose max_items to change&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve title naming (different for comments, posts, and even for comments<br />\nof each posts&#8230;)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t there a configuration option for getting notif of subnodes?.. Seem to<br />\nremind yes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contacts</h3>\n<p>You can have some news about this plugin on <a href=\"http://jehan.zemarmot.net\" title=\"my public diary\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my freedom<br />\nhaven</a> or of course, by<br />\nsubscribing on the following xmpp pubsub node:<br />\nhttp://jehan.zemarmot.net/blog/category/technologies/programmation/jabber-feed/feed/<br />\nIf you want to contact me by jabber, ask me first by email (which you can find<br />\non my website.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin archive to wp-content/plugins/ directory on your WordPress installation;</li>\n<li>Uncompress it by keeping it in its own sub-directory called jabber_feed/;</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress;</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin through the appearing sub-menu &#8216;Jabber Feed configuration&#8217; under the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu.</li>\n<li>When aknowledging the configuration by pressing the &#8220;Update&#8221; button, the<br />\njabber login will be tested and the pubsub nodes created. Hence if anything is<br />\nwrong with your configuration, you will be immediately informed.</li>\n<li>This plugin also defines two templates:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8211; <code>jabber_feed_get ($node = 'posts', $what = 'url', $text = '')</code> will return a string being a url (bare, or in a &#8216;a&#8217; or &#8216;link&#8217; tag).<br />\n&#8211; <code>jabber_feed_display ($node = 'posts', $what = 'url', $text = '')</code> is the same as the previous template but display the string instead of returning it!<br />\nThese template functions can be used in your theme.<br />\nNote that if your theme uses the &#8216;wp_head&#8217; function in its header (most cases), a autodiscovery link on the post node will be automatically generated in the header. Otherwise, you can add it by yourself with these functions for instance.</p>\n<h4>dependencies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PHP must be built with the option <code>--enable-sockets</code> on PHP 4 &gt;= 4.0.7 or PHP 5 (though I haven&#8217;t tried with such a version, with PHP 5.3.0 and more, this extension is moved to the PECL repository!). If you have an error relating to socket, this is most likely a dependency issue.<br />\nNote for gentoo users: you must set the &#8216;sockets&#8217; USE flag.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It uses the library &#8216;expat&#8217; to parse XML (enabled with the <code>--with-xml</code><br />\noption of the php compilation).<br />\nNote for gentoo users: you must set the &#8216;xml&#8217; USE flag.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It uses the <code>Auth_SASL PEAR</code> module (<code>pear install Auth_SASL</code> or install with your distribution&#8217;s package manager) for SASL authentication. For now, this dependency is mandatory because this is the only supported authentication mechanism. Maybe in some future will it become optional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OPTIONAL: to have the option of sending formated notification in XHTML, the &#8220;tidy&#8221; PECL extension must be installed.<br />\nIt is based on the libtidy library which must first be installed: http://tidy.sourceforge.net/<br />\nThen with PHP 4.3.X or PHP 5, you can install it as a PECL module: <code>pecl install tidy</code>; or with the<br />\n&#8211;with-tidy compilation option in PHP 5.<br />\nWithout this, you won&#8217;t have access to the XHTML option and all notifications will be sent as a normal textual message.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OPTIONAL: if the plugin is installed on a BSD (Mac included),<br />\nin order to use the SRV records on the admin JID, which is the correct way of resolving the server and port addresses for a domain, the PEAR extension NET_DNS must be installed: &#8216;pear install NET_DNS&#8217; (Note that it will ask to have php compiled with &#8216;mhash&#8217; option).<br />\nIf it is installed on Windows, it is not anymore mandatory if you have PHP<br />\n5.3.0 or later installed (under this version of PHP, you should also install<br />\nthis extension to benefit SRV records).<br />\nLinux servers do not need this extension to have SRV.<br />\nNote for gentoo users: you must set the &#8216;mhash&#8217; USE flag.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Working Platforms</h4>\n<p>This script has been tested only currently on WordPress 2.0 up to WordPress<br />\n2.9.1 with PHP 5.2.1 to 5.2.11, running on a GNU/Linux 64 bits (Gentoo Linux).<br />\nHopefully it should work with other software versions (not for PHP4, because<br />\nof the TLS feature with is PHP5 specific. Yet if you are really interested<br />\ninto PHP4 compatibility and if TLS is not required for your connection, just<br />\nask me, I will try to make a compatibility layer), but I cannot guarantee.<br />\nTell me please if you tried this successfully with another configuration so that I update the known working platforms list.</p>\n<p>At the opposite, if you find a bug or encounter an issue on some configuration, don&#8217;t hesitate to tell me, and I will try and fix it.</p>\n<h4>Examples for using the function templates</h4>\n<pre><code>jabber_feed_get and `jabber_feed_display` have the same parameters, but the\n</code></pre>\n<p>first returns the link whereas the latter displays it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>jabber_feed_get ($node = 'posts', $what = 'url', $text = '')</code></li>\n<li><code>jabber_feed_display ($node = 'posts', $what = 'url', $text = '')</code></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;node&#8217; can be &#8216;all&#8217;, &#8216;posts&#8217;, &#8216;pages&#8217;, &#8216;comments&#8217;, &#8216;current&#8217; (comments of<br />\nthe current page/post) or a number (comments of the given numbered post/page);</li>\n<li>&#8216;what&#8217; can be the bare &#8216;url&#8217;, or included in a &#8216;a&#8217; tag, or a &#8216;link&#8217; tag;</li>\n<li>&#8216;text&#8217; is optional displayed text (only when &#8216;a&#8217; tag).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for instance, if the pubsub server is &#8216;pubsub.jabber.org&#8217; and the node is<br />\n&#8216;blog&#8217;:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>jabber_feed_display ('posts', 'bare')</code> displays simply:</p>\n<pre><code>xmpp:pubsub.jabber.org?action=subscribe;node=blog/posts\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>which is a bare url of the node containing all the posts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>jabber_feed_get ('comments', 'a', 'All the comments')</code> will return:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a rel='alternate'\n    href='xmpp:pubsub.jabber.org?action=subscribe;node=blog/comments;subscription_type=items;subscription_depth=1'&gt;All\n    the comments&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>which is a link for all comments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>jabber_feed_display (5, 'link')</code> will display:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel='alternate'\n    href='xmpp:pubsub.jabber.org?action=subscribe;node=blog/comments/5' /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>which is an autodiscovery link for the comments of post 5.</p>\n<p>Etc.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Question from myself: how people can subscribe on a Jabber node?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately this plugin is rather a &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; plugin as long as<br />\nthere is no Jabber client allowing users to easily subscribe (and configure<br />\ntheir subscription) to xmpp pubsub nodes.<br />\nI could use Gajim to subscribe to nodes though, but I had much difficulty to<br />\n&#8220;browse&#8221; nodes with it, and it is impossible to create a node (at least I have<br />\nnot found).<br />\nAs for Psi, I could not do any subscription at all.</p>\n<p>The only mean for the time being is to use a client with a XML console (the<br />\nonly ones I know with such a console are Gajim, Psi, and Sameplace with an<br />\nofficial plugin) and send this raw XML subscription (which is indeed a non very<br />\nuser-friendly method, I must admit).</p>\n<p>It would be nice if people could implement soon a node subscription feature in<br />\ntheir favorite Jabber client (I will probably try to do so myself as a next<br />\nstep) and also a relation in their favorite web-browser to Jabber links (so<br />\nthat they could have their Jabber client propose them to subscribe and<br />\nconfigure a node just by clicking on a link on their browser).<br />\nHopefully then I will update this readme to advice such Jabber client and web<br />\nbrowser! \ud83d\ude42</p>\n</p>\n<h4>From myself: which jabber server has a good pubsub implementation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am using ejabberd 2.0 and 2.0.1 for my own, but it is pretty flawed on many ways.<br />\nEspecially it is impossible to configure your subscription to a node. What a<br />\nshame! \ud83d\ude41<br />\nAnyway it is sufficient basically for the proof of concept, but probably not<br />\nfor long-term (even mid-term) real use.<br />\nYet I heard that the coming development version of ejabberd (3.0) has had a<br />\nrewrite of the pubsub implementation. I have not tested though.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know sufficiently others server softwares to give an opinion about<br />\nthem. But I was told Openfire should have soon a pretty good PubSub support. I<br />\nam still waiting to test it though.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>From myself: which Jabber client could I advice to visitors of my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As explained, there are few, if none, clients with good PubSub support. This<br />\nis why I told this plugin is more a proof of concept than an useful one. But<br />\nhopefully, soon it will be better!<br />\nProcess One has developped recently a pubsub client called <code>one-channel</code>, as<br />\nfar as I know, the first one ever publicly released, fully dedicated to<br />\npubsub. I had only one review from someone, not so enthousiast though. For my<br />\nown, I have unfortunately been unable to test, as it uses Flash technology<br />\n(Adobe AIR) and my MIPS computer does not take Flash very well (usually it<br />\nwill crash, if it works at all, anyway). If someone had a chance to test it<br />\nwith publication generated by my plugin, I would be happy to get a feedback&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>From myself: but no browser can detect XMPP autodiscovery links. What are they for?!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am writting a small Firefox plugin for this. Soon more infos!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you like to ask questions to yourself? Do you feel lonely?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe. \ud83d\ude09</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Better SRV library gestion: the plugin can now &#8220;switch&#8221; between the NET_DNS library<br />\nif installed, to the core PHP SRV functions (if using Linux or a Windows<br />\nwith a recent PHP) or nothing (no SRV gestion).<br />\nHence for Linux or Windows (with recent PHP), no additional library is<br />\nanymore required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Algorithm for dealing with priority and weight of target in SRV records is<br />\nnow implemented, exactly as in RFC 2782.

A new column<br />\ncalled &#8220;Jabber Feed&#8221; will display:<br />\n* The publication date on the node (and the last update will appear on a<br />\nbubble when the mouse passes by);<br />\n* &#8216;Error on publication&#8217; when an error has occured during publication (and the<br />\nerror text will be displayed when the mouse passes by);<br />\n* &#8216;Not Published&#8217; when no publication never occurred (which is simply when the post has<br />\n been published on WordPress before the plugin has been installed.</p>\n<h3>Todo</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TTL support for DNS/SRV records.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Still need to test extensively (and if necessary improve) the right system<br />\nin WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>will the non-approved comments be published on the comment nodes?</li>\n<li>will the private posts be published?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the &#8220;configuration&#8221; window, I should make a detection of the<br />\nprerequisites, gray everything if a mandatory one is not fulfilled and give an<br />\nexplanation text.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what about internationalization?!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manage menu: with failed publication, it should be possible to retry the<br />\npublication from this page (with multiple checkbox if possible to massively<br />\nrun publication!).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what about an equivalent of post management for comments?! Is it<br />\npossible (apparently not, according to WordPress documentation)?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The item should also be updated when a published post is edited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why not add support to pages? -&gt; current work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create the bot account as well?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why not retry to publish after a timer (let&#8217;s say 1 day?) after a failure,<br />\nwith a number maximum of tries?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What could be fun: if the subscribers could be also publisher, hence<br />\nanswering to a post by directly publishing to the node?<br />\nBut how is a publisher identified?! No &#8220;from&#8221; with a pseudo in it, and data<br />\nabout real jid accessible from admin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve globally the<br />\nmessage syntax (for instance the message &#8216;updated&#8217; and &#8216;created&#8217; tags).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure the node instead of simply create it with default configuration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check the node authorizations if it is already existing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve the internationalization strings (and set at least 2 default<br />\nlanguages: English and French).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And what if the post or page is private? Should it be added on a node? Maybe<br />\na node with a white list that the admin can manage?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apparently if I disapprove or flag a comment as spam from the &#8220;edit comment&#8221;<br />\npage, it does not remove it from the node. Why? Is it a bug from WordPress<br />\nwhich does not trigger the action in all cases? Or is there another WordPress&#8217;<br />\naction for this specific case? Try this also with posts from the &#8220;edit post&#8221;<br />\npage.<br />\nEdit: it seems to be a known bug: https://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5792<br />\nIs planned to be fixed for WordPress 2.9 apparently.<br />\n=&gt; this seems to be fixed now! Woohoo!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add more authentication mechanisms? (current: Digest-MD5, CramMD5, PLAIN,<br />\nANONYMOUS. Only Digest-MD5 and PLAIN has been tested)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SSLv23 added, but what about TLS?  (TLS does not work on Gmail. SSL and TLS works on ejabberd. So<br />\nI have decided to use SSL only for now)<br />\nNote that it looks like the PHP implementation of TLS encryption does not seem<br />\nlike verifying the certificate&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add poster/commenter name in ATOM format.<br />\nPoster&#8217;s name<br />\nhttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add support for button of publishing all posts in once&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Propose max_items to change&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve title naming (different for comments, posts, and even for comments<br />\nof each posts&#8230;)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t there a configuration option for getting notif of subnodes?..
