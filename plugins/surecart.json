These include product variations, product collection, coupons, inventory tracking, shipping calculations, product fulfillment, product returns, and customer area.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIBCcIX8S54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>Product Pricing Options</h3>\n<p>No other ecommerce plugin offers this depth of options on how to price your products.</p>\n<p>SureCart&#8217;s unique approach to let you offer more than one price for a single product is a big reason why SureCart merchants sell more products.</p>\n<p>Some of the pricing options include one-time payments, subscription payments, installemnt plans, free trials, paid trials, setup fees, setup discounts, and name your own price.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHOamau4BWw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>Most Advanced Subscription Plugin For WordPress</h3>\n<p>Selling subscriptions is easy to do, many form plugins, LMS plugins, membership plugins, ecommerce plugins do this.</p>\n<p>But they only assist in selling the subscription and offer little to manage and retain the subscriber! That is where the profit is in selling subscriptions.</p>\n<p>If you are using anything other than SureCart to sell subscriptions, you are likely paying higher payment processor fees and having higher churn.</p>\n<p><strong>Using SureCart Means Lower Fees</strong></p>\n<p>If you are selling subscriptions on Stripe using form plugins, membership plugins, online course plugins, SaaS platforms like ThriveCart, or any of these ways to sell subscriptions with Stripe&#8230;</p>\n<p>You (the merchant) pay an extra 0.5% &#8211; 0.8% of every subscription transaction to Stripe? <a href=\"https://stripe.com/billing/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See Stripe Pricing</a></p>\n<p>When you use SureCart you avoid all of these Stripe fees on subscriptions because we manage the subscription, we handle the invoices, and we can handle the auto payment retries.<br />\nThis can save you huge amounts of money.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Subscriptions are portable! We migrate WooCommerce merchants with active subscribers each week. It&#8217;s seamless, and the subscriber does not need to resubscribe.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Subscription Management &amp; Retention With SureCart</strong></p>\n<p>SureCart has a suite of tools to <a href=\"https://surecart.com/features/subscriptions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">manage subscriptions</a> and reduce churn.</p>\n<p>Selling subscriptions, the biggest source of churn is from failed payments. SureCart will automatically recover failed payments from your subscribers to keep them subscribed.</p>\n<p>Your second source of churn is subscribers wanting to cancel. With SureCart&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bx4u4DV4_Q\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Subscription Saver</a> feature, you will have fewer cancelations and greater insights into why people cancel.</p>\n<p>Additional features include subscription upgrades with proration, subscription downgrades, customers can change the payment method, you can reactivate a canceled subscription, you can pause a subscription, subscribers can change their form of payment to a different payment method, change payment dates, advanced email reminders before payments, and more.</p>\n<p>These management and retention options are just not available elsewhere!</p>\n<h3>The Best WooCommerce Alternative</h3>\n<p>SureCart is the <a href=\"https://wpastra.com/comparison/shopify-vs-woocommerce-vs-surecart/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce alternative</a> WordPress users have been asking for!</p>\n<p>We highly respect WooCommerce and how it has paved the way for adding an online store to WordPress. But it&#8217;s not ideal for everyone.</p>\n<p>It would cost you <strong>$2,849 per year, per store</strong>, in WooCommerce add-ons to get the same features SureCart offers out of the box! And your store would be more prone to plugin conflicts, security vulnerabilities, constant updates required for each plugin, and a potentially slower website.</p>\n<p>(These are reasons told to us by SureCart merchants that switched from WooCommerce)</p>\n<p>There are cases where using WooCommerce may be the only choice for your store due to their deep ecosystem of paid add-ons and payment gateways if you have very specific requirements.</p>\n<p>Where SureCart&#8217;s approach is different. Everything is built in, no add-on required. Everything is made easier, your site will run faster, we are there to support you, you are never alone.</p>\n<h3>SureCart Features</h3>\n<p>These are just some of the key features SureCart users love.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple Payment Processors, Express Checkout ApplePay &amp; GooglePay:</strong><br />\nEasily connect to Stripe, PayPal, and Mollie with support for 135+ currencies, 45+ countries, and dozens of payment methods including cards, wallets, bank debits, and more. You can use multiple processors on a single checkout form. Also, you can optionally accept ApplePay or GooglePay express checkout options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Powerful Payment Options:</strong><br />\nOne-time payments, subscriptions, subscriptions with free trials, setup fees, payment plans (installments), pay what you want, donations. SureCart covers most ways you may want to be paid, all included for free.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Most Complete Subscription Payments System:</strong><br />\nThere is a lot more to subscriptions than simply rebilling on an interval. SureCart’s subscription engine is second to none. With our extensive subscription payments options, you can sell your subscriptions how you want. But SureCart goes beyond other ecommerce platforms by offering prorated upgrades or downgrades. So if you are offering a monthly subscription or an annual subscription and your buyer wants to upgrade, SureCart can prorate the upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Order Bumps &amp; Upsell Funnels:</strong><br />\nSureCart merchants have more profitable stores due to a full suite of revenue optimization features. Generate more revene with one-click order bumps, post purchase <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97gSH-KPFZU&amp;t=25s\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">one-click upsells</a>, and cart abandonment recovery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Affiliate Platform:</strong><br />\nGenerate more sales by adding an affiliate program. Easily launch an affiliate program in just a few minutes. You can customize each aspect of your affiliate program, including lifetime commissions, custom affiliate rates, affiliate coupons, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self Service Customer Area (Subscription Upgrades / Downgrades):</strong><br />\nWith our highly customizable customer area, you can have full control on what a customer sees and is able to do. For example, you can let your customers change their personal details, password, access secure digital downloads, update credit cards on file, upgrade a subscription, downgrade a subscription. All with a beautiful and modern user experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customizable Shopping Experience:</strong><br />\nCustomize product pages, shop pages, cart, and customer dashboard using a intuitive and powerful drag and drop editor that utilizes the WordPress block editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Checkout Form Builder:</strong><br />\nCreate a completely custom checkout form. In fact, create as many as you like. There is no other ecommerce platform with this much customizability. Simply drag and drop fields, price choosers, donation choosers, check boxes, and other parts to create the perfect checkout form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Coupon Discounts:</strong><br />\nIncentivizing buyers with a coupon discount is a great way to increase sales. You can easily create unlimited coupons as well as automatically add coupons with a URL parameter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure digital file delivery:</strong><br />\nSelling digital downloads? This could be software, printables, ebooks, you name it and SureCart can deliver it securely to your buyers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Slide-out Cart:</strong><br />\nIf you want to sell your products or services using a traditional cart allowing buyers to add items then checkout, you will love SureCart’s beautiful and lightning fast slide-out cart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete EU Compliance:</strong><br />\nIf you are an EU-based merchant, you know there are very strict requirements regarding VAT, how you display the prices inclusive of VAT, what information is on invoices, how invoices need to be numbered, etc. SureCart has you covered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrate &amp; Automate:</strong><br />\nThe most important part of an ecommerce platform is how it integrates with other plugins and external platforms. SureCart offers integrations with many WordPress plugins, so you can use SureCart for all of your ecommerce.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seamless Scaling:</strong><br />\nWith other ecommerce plugins, if you get an influx of buyers for that big sale or promotion, unless you have high-powered and high cost hosting, your website will be slow or worse, it will crash. Since SureCart is platform based, when you get an influx of new buyers, you have nothing to worry about because we take care of the scaling for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-time VAT &amp; Sales Tax Calculations:</strong><br />\nOther ecommerce platforms let you integrate with expensive tax calculation services, usually costing $50 per month and up. Not with SureCart, we are fully integrated with TaxJar, and we pay for the calculations, so you don’t have to. And the setup is a breeze.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What Is Unique About SureCart?</h3>\n<p>SureCart was made to give WordPress users a better option for selling on their website. Currently most merchants use WooCommerce, which was made over 10 years ago for building big commerce stores like Amazon, Walmart, etc.</p>\n<p>SureCart takes a different approach entirely. Made from the ground up to be ultra-high performance, look visually stunning, and be so easy to use that the most non-techie user will have no problem.</p>\n<p>Everything can be visually customized to create a truly unique ecommerce experience.</p>\n<p>SureCart also solves the technician problems that you run into with ecommerce plugins. They have performance problems or caching issues or something, it’s always something. Not with SureCart, we do all the heavy lifting on our servers to guarantee you a smooth operation, headache free, developer free.</p>\n<h3>The SureCart Difference</h3>\n<p>SureCart is fundamentally different from other WordPress ecommerce plugins that you may have tried, so it&#8217;s important to understand the differences.</p>\n<p><strong>Platform Based</strong><br />\nThere are two parts to SureCart, the platform, which is the Ecommerce engine, and the plugin.</p>\n<p>The platform is built with the same technology that Shopify, Basecamp, GitHub, Twitter, Stripe and more use. These are all multi-billion dollar companies.</p>\n<p>The plugin connects to the platform in real-time, taking all the load away from your website and onto our platform that was built and optimized for Ecommerce.</p>\n<p>This way you get everything you want with none of the stuff you don’t want. SureCart will not slow down your website, it won’t bloat your database, it’s less likely to have plugin conflicts, and it’s made to work with your caching setup. But the real benefit here is you get assurance and peace of mind because you don’t have to worry about security, storage, or backups.</p>\n<h3>SureCart Integrations</h3>\n<h3>Page Builders</h3>\n<p>SureCart works with all WordPress page builders, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elementor</li>\n<li>Bricks Builder</li>\n<li>Spectra Website Builder</li>\n<li>Divi Builder</li>\n<li>Beaver Builder</li>\n<li>Thrive Architect</li>\n<li>Gutenberg</li>\n<li>Oxygen Builder</li>\n<li>And others</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WooCommerce Themes</h3>\n<p>SureCart works with any theme, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astra Theme</li>\n<li>Avada</li>\n<li>Blocksy</li>\n<li>Divi Theme</li>\n<li>Flatsome</li>\n<li>GeneratePress</li>\n<li>Kadence Theme</li>\n<li>Neve</li>\n<li>OceanWP</li>\n<li>Spectra One Theme</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WordPress Plugins</h3>\n<p>SureCart has 2 types of integrations.

These include product variations, product collection, coupons, inventory tracking, shipping calculations, product fulfillment, product returns, and customer area.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIBCcIX8S54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>Product Pricing Options</h3>\n<p>No other ecommerce plugin offers this depth of options on how to price your products.</p>\n<p>SureCart&#8217;s unique approach to let you offer more than one price for a single product is a big reason why SureCart merchants sell more products.</p>\n<p>Some of the pricing options include one-time payments, subscription payments, installemnt plans, free trials, paid trials, setup fees, setup discounts, and name your own price.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHOamau4BWw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>Most Advanced Subscription Plugin For WordPress</h3>\n<p>Selling subscriptions is easy to do, many form plugins, LMS plugins, membership plugins, ecommerce plugins do this.</p>\n<p>But they only assist in selling the subscription and offer little to manage and retain the subscriber! That is where the profit is in selling subscriptions.</p>\n<p>If you are using anything other than SureCart to sell subscriptions, you are likely paying higher payment processor fees and having higher churn.</p>\n<p><strong>Using SureCart Means Lower Fees</strong></p>\n<p>If you are selling subscriptions on Stripe using form plugins, membership plugins, online course plugins, SaaS platforms like ThriveCart, or any of these ways to sell subscriptions with Stripe&#8230;</p>\n<p>You (the merchant) pay an extra 0.5% &#8211; 0.8% of every subscription transaction to Stripe? <a href=\"https://stripe.com/billing/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See Stripe Pricing</a></p>\n<p>When you use SureCart you avoid all of these Stripe fees on subscriptions because we manage the subscription, we handle the invoices, and we can handle the auto payment retries.<br />\nThis can save you huge amounts of money.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Subscriptions are portable! We migrate WooCommerce merchants with active subscribers each week. It&#8217;s seamless, and the subscriber does not need to resubscribe.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Subscription Management &amp; Retention With SureCart</strong></p>\n<p>SureCart has a suite of tools to <a href=\"https://surecart.com/features/subscriptions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">manage subscriptions</a> and reduce churn.</p>\n<p>Selling subscriptions, the biggest source of churn is from failed payments. SureCart will automatically recover failed payments from your subscribers to keep them subscribed.</p>\n<p>Your second source of churn is subscribers wanting to cancel. With SureCart&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bx4u4DV4_Q\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Subscription Saver</a> feature, you will have fewer cancelations and greater insights into why people cancel.</p>\n<p>Additional features include subscription upgrades with proration, subscription downgrades, customers can change the payment method, you can reactivate a canceled subscription, you can pause a subscription, subscribers can change their form of payment to a different payment method, change payment dates, advanced email reminders before payments, and more.</p>\n<p>These management and retention options are just not available elsewhere!</p>\n<h3>The Best WooCommerce Alternative</h3>\n<p>SureCart is the <a href=\"https://wpastra.com/comparison/shopify-vs-woocommerce-vs-surecart/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce alternative</a> WordPress users have been asking for!</p>\n<p>We highly respect WooCommerce and how it has paved the way for adding an online store to WordPress. But it&#8217;s not ideal for everyone.</p>\n<p>It would cost you <strong>$2,849 per year, per store</strong>, in WooCommerce add-ons to get the same features SureCart offers out of the box! And your store would be more prone to plugin conflicts, security vulnerabilities, constant updates required for each plugin, and a potentially slower website.</p>\n<p>(These are reasons told to us by SureCart merchants that switched from WooCommerce)</p>\n<p>There are cases where using WooCommerce may be the only choice for your store due to their deep ecosystem of paid add-ons and payment gateways if you have very specific requirements.</p>\n<p>Where SureCart&#8217;s approach is different. Everything is built in, no add-on required. Everything is made easier, your site will run faster, we are there to support you, you are never alone.</p>\n<h3>SureCart Features</h3>\n<p>These are just some of the key features SureCart users love.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple Payment Processors, Express Checkout ApplePay &amp; GooglePay:</strong><br />\nEasily connect to Stripe, PayPal, and Mollie with support for 135+ currencies, 45+ countries, and dozens of payment methods including cards, wallets, bank debits, and more. You can use multiple processors on a single checkout form. Also, you can optionally accept ApplePay or GooglePay express checkout options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Powerful Payment Options:</strong><br />\nOne-time payments, subscriptions, subscriptions with free trials, setup fees, payment plans (installments), pay what you want, donations. SureCart covers most ways you may want to be paid, all included for free.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Most Complete Subscription Payments System:</strong><br />\nThere is a lot more to subscriptions than simply rebilling on an interval. SureCart’s subscription engine is second to none. With our extensive subscription payments options, you can sell your subscriptions how you want. But SureCart goes beyond other ecommerce platforms by offering prorated upgrades or downgrades. So if you are offering a monthly subscription or an annual subscription and your buyer wants to upgrade, SureCart can prorate the upgrade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Order Bumps &amp; Upsell Funnels:</strong><br />\nSureCart merchants have more profitable stores due to a full suite of revenue optimization features. Generate more revene with one-click order bumps, post purchase <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97gSH-KPFZU&amp;t=25s\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">one-click upsells</a>, and cart abandonment recovery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Affiliate Platform:</strong><br />\nGenerate more sales by adding an affiliate program. Easily launch an affiliate program in just a few minutes. You can customize each aspect of your affiliate program, including lifetime commissions, custom affiliate rates, affiliate coupons, and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self Service Customer Area (Subscription Upgrades / Downgrades):</strong><br />\nWith our highly customizable customer area, you can have full control on what a customer sees and is able to do. For example, you can let your customers change their personal details, password, access secure digital downloads, update credit cards on file, upgrade a subscription, downgrade a subscription. All with a beautiful and modern user experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customizable Shopping Experience:</strong><br />\nCustomize product pages, shop pages, cart, and customer dashboard using a intuitive and powerful drag and drop editor that utilizes the WordPress block editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible Checkout Form Builder:</strong><br />\nCreate a completely custom checkout form. In fact, create as many as you like. There is no other ecommerce platform with this much customizability. Simply drag and drop fields, price choosers, donation choosers, check boxes, and other parts to create the perfect checkout form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Coupon Discounts:</strong><br />\nIncentivizing buyers with a coupon discount is a great way to increase sales. You can easily create unlimited coupons as well as automatically add coupons with a URL parameter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure digital file delivery:</strong><br />\nSelling digital downloads? This could be software, printables, ebooks, you name it and SureCart can deliver it securely to your buyers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Slide-out Cart:</strong><br />\nIf you want to sell your products or services using a traditional cart allowing buyers to add items then checkout, you will love SureCart’s beautiful and lightning fast slide-out cart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete EU Compliance:</strong><br />\nIf you are an EU-based merchant, you know there are very strict requirements regarding VAT, how you display the prices inclusive of VAT, what information is on invoices, how invoices need to be numbered, etc. SureCart has you covered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Integrate &amp; Automate:</strong><br />\nThe most important part of an ecommerce platform is how it integrates with other plugins and external platforms. SureCart offers integrations with many WordPress plugins, so you can use SureCart for all of your ecommerce.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Seamless Scaling:</strong><br />\nWith other ecommerce plugins, if you get an influx of buyers for that big sale or promotion, unless you have high-powered and high cost hosting, your website will be slow or worse, it will crash. Since SureCart is platform based, when you get an influx of new buyers, you have nothing to worry about because we take care of the scaling for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-time VAT &amp; Sales Tax Calculations:</strong><br />\nOther ecommerce platforms let you integrate with expensive tax calculation services, usually costing $50 per month and up. Not with SureCart, we are fully integrated with TaxJar, and we pay for the calculations, so you don’t have to. And the setup is a breeze.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What Is Unique About SureCart?</h3>\n<p>SureCart was made to give WordPress users a better option for selling on their website. Currently most merchants use WooCommerce, which was made over 10 years ago for building big commerce stores like Amazon, Walmart, etc.</p>\n<p>SureCart takes a different approach entirely. Made from the ground up to be ultra-high performance, look visually stunning, and be so easy to use that the most non-techie user will have no problem.</p>\n<p>Everything can be visually customized to create a truly unique ecommerce experience.</p>\n<p>SureCart also solves the technician problems that you run into with ecommerce plugins. They have performance problems or caching issues or something, it’s always something. Not with SureCart, we do all the heavy lifting on our servers to guarantee you a smooth operation, headache free, developer free.</p>\n<h3>The SureCart Difference</h3>\n<p>SureCart is fundamentally different from other WordPress ecommerce plugins that you may have tried, so it&#8217;s important to understand the differences.</p>\n<p><strong>Platform Based</strong><br />\nThere are two parts to SureCart, the platform, which is the Ecommerce engine, and the plugin.</p>\n<p>The platform is built with the same technology that Shopify, Basecamp, GitHub, Twitter, Stripe and more use. These are all multi-billion dollar companies.</p>\n<p>The plugin connects to the platform in real-time, taking all the load away from your website and onto our platform that was built and optimized for Ecommerce.</p>\n<p>This way you get everything you want with none of the stuff you don’t want. SureCart will not slow down your website, it won’t bloat your database, it’s less likely to have plugin conflicts, and it’s made to work with your caching setup. But the real benefit here is you get assurance and peace of mind because you don’t have to worry about security, storage, or backups.</p>\n<h3>SureCart Integrations</h3>\n<h3>Page Builders</h3>\n<p>SureCart works with all WordPress page builders, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elementor</li>\n<li>Bricks Builder</li>\n<li>Spectra Website Builder</li>\n<li>Divi Builder</li>\n<li>Beaver Builder</li>\n<li>Thrive Architect</li>\n<li>Gutenberg</li>\n<li>Oxygen Builder</li>\n<li>And others</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WooCommerce Themes</h3>\n<p>SureCart works with any theme, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astra Theme</li>\n<li>Avada</li>\n<li>Blocksy</li>\n<li>Divi Theme</li>\n<li>Flatsome</li>\n<li>GeneratePress</li>\n<li>Kadence Theme</li>\n<li>Neve</li>\n<li>OceanWP</li>\n<li>Spectra One Theme</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WordPress Plugins</h3>\n<p>SureCart has 2 types of integrations. The first are natively available directly in the plugin and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyBoss</li>\n<li>SureMembers</li>\n<li>Presto Player</li>\n<li>TutorLMS</li>\n<li>LearnDash</li>\n<li>LifterLMS</li>\n<li>MemberPress</li>\n<li>AffiliateWP</li>\n<li>Thrive Automator</li>\n<li>And more are coming</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second type of integrations are done with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/suretriggers/\" rel=\"ugc\">SureTriggers</a>, which is like Zapier for WordPress. SureTriggers integrates with over 500 apps and services. These will require you to add the SureTriggers plugin to your website to integrate with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ActiveCampaign</li>\n<li>ConvertKit</li>\n<li>FluentCRM</li>\n<li>Google Sheets</li>\n<li>GoHighLevel</li>\n<li>Klaviyo</li>\n<li>MailChimp</li>\n<li>MailGun</li>\n<li>Restrict Content Pro</li>\n<li>SendinBlue</li>\n<li>Slack</li>\n<li>The Events Calendar</li>\n<li>Twilio</li>\n<li>Webhooks</li>\n<li>WhatsApp</li>\n<li>Zoom</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://suretriggers.com/integrations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See the full list</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Join The SureCart Facebook Group</h3>\n<p>Join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/surecrafted\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook group community</a>: Learn the tricks and techniques that other SureCart users are using to grow their business.
