        "installation": "<p>You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it,<br />\nor by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped<br />\ncontents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.</p>\n<p>Once you have installed the plugin, activate it from <strong>Plugins &rarr; Installed Plugins</strong>. This will create a new<br />\nmenu item, <strong>Appearance &rarr; Suffusion bbPress Pack</strong>. When you visit this tab, you will see an option to &#8220;(Re)Build bbPress Files&#8221;.<br />\nClick on that, and the appropriate files will be copied to your theme folder. Your installation of Suffusion is now bbPress-ready!</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What happens if I don&#8217;t use a child theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Short answer &#8211; very bad things. Suffusion is a theme that gets regular updates. A theme update will wipe out your existing<br />\ntheme installation folder. Since the plugin copies files to your theme installation folder, you might suddenly be left with<br />\nbroken bbPress files on your site. Using a child theme ensures that if you upgrade Suffusion, your child theme files will<br />\nremain untouched.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this along with Suffusion BuddyPress Pack?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. You shouldn&#8217;t have any issues getting them to work together.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added some checks to prevent fatal errors in case bbPress is not activated.</li>\n<li>Viewing of group forum topics was causing an error. This has been fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.00</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New version created.</li>\n</ul>\n"
