Also all widgets do include default styling so no coding is required. Of course if you want to remove the default styling this can be done easily via a child theme (see the FAQ&#8217;s below).</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a different widget plugin you may want to check out our list of <a href=\"https://www.wpexplorer.com/best-wordpress-widget-plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Best Widget Plugins</a> for other options.</p>\n<h4>Included Widgets</h4>\n<p>The following widgets are included with the plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>About</li>\n<li>Advertisement (1 or 2 columns)</li>\n<li>Advanced Recent Posts (left thumbnail or top thumbnail styles)</li>\n<li>Business Info</li>\n<li>Comments w/ Avatar</li>\n<li>Facebook Page</li>\n<li>Google Map</li>\n<li>Newsletter</li>\n<li>Posts Slider</li>\n<li>Social Profiles</li>\n<li>Users</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Suggest New Widgets</h4>\n<p>Open a new support request for any recommendations for future widgets to be added to the plugin or extra settings for the current widgets.</p>\n",

The purpose of the plugin is so you can take your widgets with you no matter what theme you decide to use. It works great with our <a href=\"https://www.wpexplorer.com/free-wordpress-themes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Free WordPress Themes</a> but feel free to use it as you choose.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20bundle%20this%20plugin%20with%20my%20themes%3F'>\nCan I bundle this plugin with my themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Please do. Why code new custom widgets for all your themes when you can recommend a singular plugin. If you are going to bundle this plugin with your themes we recommend using the <a href=\"http://tgmpluginactivation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TGMPA Activation Script</a>. Do not simply dump the code into your theme because your end users won&#8217;t be able to update it. And if you have suggestions for future widgets let us know in the forum so we can consider them for future updates. We welcome all suggestions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20remove%20default%20css%20styles%3F'>\nHow to remove default CSS styles?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are recommending this plugin to be used with your theme and wish to remove the default CSS you can do so by setting the &#8220;more_widgets_enqueue_styles&#8221; filter to false.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
