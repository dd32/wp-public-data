It also improves the overall performance of your site by keeping away these unwanted referrers from your website, which means that your web server won&#8217;t need to consume resources when a referrer spammer visits your site!</p>\n<h4>Why you should use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>It is very common to be attacked by <strong>referrer spammers</strong>. Referrer spam consists in making repeated web site requests using a fake referer URL to the site the spammer wishes to advertise.<br />\nSites that publish their access logs, including referrer statistics, will then inadvertently link back to the spammer&#8217;s site. These links will be indexed by search engines as they crawl the access logs.<br />\nThis benefits the spammer because the free link improves the spammer site&#8217;s search engine ranking owing to link-counting algorithms that search engines use.</p>\n<p>This is not really harmful for your site or your site&#8217;s search engine ranking.
