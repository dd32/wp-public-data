Token names expire every 2 hours. The most recently expired field name can also be submitted to without failure. This prevents a commentor from getting caught during the transition between an old and new field name.</li>\n<li>New Feature: Placement of the anti-spam token input is now randomized to appear in different places within the comment form. This coupled with the rotating and random field names makes it difficult for spammers to defeat the system.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that was preventing comment reply ability from the WordPress comment admin area.</li>\n</ul>\n"
