        "faq": "\n<h4>I just enabled Free CDN. Now my contents take longer than usual to be downloaded!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The speed of downloading static contents is 100% decided by Coral servers. Depending on the server status, sometimes it may take a bit longer for the contents to be downloaded. If the performance is not satisfied, you may want to enable the plugin in certain peak times only.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My JavaScripts got broken! My cookies just don&#8217;t work! [Insert error here]</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your javascript doesn&#8217;t work anymore, best bet is to uncheck &#8220;External JavaScript includes&#8221; from &#8220;Using CDN on these contents&#8221; option section. You can also enable Debug mode to see which files get involved, and try excluding them one by one to find out the problematic one and deal with it for good.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the plugin parse the external stylesheet and rewrite the background images there too?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There should be no need. If the stylesheet got rewritten and is served through Coral, all relative (most commonly) background images defined inside it will be pulled from Coral servers too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Everything went wrong! My site is now totally blank/ messed up!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Looks like a plugin conflict. Try disabling your plugins one by one to find out which caused the problem.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
