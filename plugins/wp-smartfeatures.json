Update NOW.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the plugin requires WordPress 3.2 or higher as PHP 5.2+ is required to run this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I designate more than one keyword?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time, but soon.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use this thing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have provided one template tag for use in your theme. It is the <code>smart_featured()</code> tag. It takes 2 optional arguments. The first argument is $term and can be used to override the option set in WordPress admin. The second argument is $post_count and it designates the number of posts that should be returned as &#8220;featured&#8221;. The default is 1.</p>\n<p>The Post Data is returned as a raw object, so you will need a little PHP to work this stuff out. That said, I&#8217;ve intentionally left it raw to find out what the community wants? If you provide some feedback, I can work it in &#8211; I just don&#8217;t want to assume anything.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
