If it doesn&#8217;t: deactivate, relax, look for a different solution (or patch mine).</p>\n<p><strong>Profile Note:</strong> Profiles are not merged! Favorites, topics started etc show main/sub site only. If you want your users to see all their subscriptions in one place, you&#8217;ll have to write some custom code and likely patch my code too.</p>\n<p><strong>BuddyPress Note:</strong> It does work with network enabled BuddyPress, but they don&#8217;t play together nicely because of the BuddyPress/bbPress integration stuff. I have monkey patched this to work. If you do not have BuddyPress installed in /members/ you&#8217;ll have to monkey patch my monkey patch, please see the code. And as for the profiles: Same thing as with bbPress profiles.</p>\n",
