Then the links will be added.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How to uninstall it?</h4>\n<p>Just delete it from wp-admin/import. In fact it does no changes to the database or other core codes.</p>\n<h4>What does the option &#8220;Links Filter&#8221; mean?</h4>\n<p>This option means a filter for a better links list. Since the plugin get links through &#8220;fuzzy match&#8221; by using regular expression, the list may contain some links you don&#8217;t need. Anyway, if you are not sure, just leave it unticked and an entire list will be showed.</p>\n",
