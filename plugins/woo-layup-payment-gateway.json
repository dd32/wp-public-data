Our offering reduces drop-off rates by incentivising prospective customers to convert sooner. There is also a far greater possibility of the customer increasing their basket size which provides a sustainable and economical way to retain your customers and, in turn, increasing the likelihood of future purchases.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20sign%20up%20as%20a%20merchant%3F'>\nHow do I sign up as a merchant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply visit our <a href=\"https://layup.co.za/business/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a> and create your customised merchant profile by completing a few, simple steps. Our dedicated, merchant support team will then make contact to verify and activate your account.

LayUp guarantees an affordable and sustainable alternative payment option that will increase sales through existing markets as well as customer retention by helping them avoid unwarranted debt.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20layup%20make%20their%20money%3F'>\nHow does LayUp make their money?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LayUp charges a percentage fee per payment plan created. This includes transactional and banking processing fees to accept online merchant payments. This fee structure will be negotiated on a per contract basis.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20and%20when%20do%20i%20get%20paid%3F'>\nHow and when do I get paid?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The deposit payment is transferred by EFT within 24hrs in order for you to reserve the purchase 24hrs. Depending on the size and volume of your business LayUp will either settle the residual payments weekly/monthly or once the customer has completed their payment plan. This will be confirmed during the on-boarding process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20we%20have%20to%20commit%20to%20fixed%20terms%20with%20layup%20technologies%3F'>\nDo we have to commit to fixed terms with LayUp Technologies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope! We don’t believe in contractural commitments. LayUp only charges you when your customers decide to checkout with LayUp. We are so confident of our product/ service that we give you the flexibility to stop using our product at any time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20other%20features%20does%20layup%20offer%3F'>\nWhat other features does LayUp Offer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>LayUp offers automated recurring billing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monthly collections and reconciliation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>24/7 merchant and customer support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personalised merchant and consumer dashboards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Split payment features for users to split the payment plan amongst guests</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20risk%20is%20there%20for%20me%20using%20layup%3F'>\nWhat risk is there for me using LayUp?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no risk at all! This is just one of the great features of using LayUp. You will never provide a customer with a product/service until they have paid for it in full and there is no risk of fraudulent payments being received and charge backs occurring.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20customer%20wants%20to%20modify%20their%20payment%20plan%2C%20how%20do%20i%20handle%20this%3F'>\nMy customer wants to modify their payment plan, how do I handle this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, sure you can amend your payment plan.
