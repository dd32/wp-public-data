You do not have to be signed in to the Wolfram Cloud to use this plugin. If you are being asked to do so, your notebook isn&#8217;t public. More information about embedding notebooks in general can be found <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/WolframNotebookEmbedder/docs/Troubleshooting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Why did the styling on my page or in my notebook change after embedding?<br />\nThis could be due to a bug in the notebook&#8217;s CSS OR due to your page&#8217;s CSS definitions &#8220;leaking&#8221; into the notebook. Please see <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/WolframNotebookEmbedder/docs/Troubleshooting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a> for troubleshooting this issue.</p>\n",
