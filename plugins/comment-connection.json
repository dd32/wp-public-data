        "description": "<p>Comment Connection is a plugin that turns an element of comment text to a link for a previous comment. Whenever an author uses @<em>commenter</em>, the text after @ is automatically linked to the previous comment it refers to.</p>\n<p>The plugin works by searching each comment for an occurance of @. Where it finds one, the plugin searches the comment database for a comment on the same post written by the person being referenced.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What is the purpose of this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Comment Connection allows readers to follow conversations by automatically linking to comments that are replied to. This becomes especially important with longer conversations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What symbol triggers the response?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The @ symbol currently modifies comments, though more options may become available later.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin know when not to add a link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In addition to the @ symbol, the reference must be followed by either a new line, colon or comma. This means that neither email addresses nor regular names are turned into a link unless it has the @ symbol.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will the plugin work if I use a different case?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Comment Connection will still find the reference if the case is different. Ex. <em>@john smith</em>: will reference the comment by <em>John Smith</em>.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
