Go to the &#8220;Referer Spam&#8221; menu and start review your options.</li>\n<li>You are now protected!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Using WP-CLI</strong><br />\n    wp plugin install block-referer-spam &#8211;activate</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20sites%20are%20blocked%3F'>\nWhat sites are blocked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To give you the least amount of headache, this plugin is not using one, but indeed several sources of referer spam lists. Our servers merge multiple lists every couple hours to provide you with the best possible protection.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20still%20see%20those%20websites%20in%20my%20statistics%21'>\nI still see those websites in my statistics!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin will not remove existing Google Analytics Spam. What it will do is block further spam from being logged. You can however filter out those websites, a good tutorial for this is here: https://megalytic.com/blog/how-to-filter-out-fake-referrals-and-other-google-analytics-spam.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20tested%20my%20site%20and%20those%20referers%20can%20still%20access%20my%20site%21'>\nI tested my site and those referers can still access my site!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can by caused by three reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The site is not blocked by our list. The list is updated multiple times a day (every 6 hours) and chances are the site will be on it very soon. If not, try custom blocks.</li>\n<li>Some plugins interfere with the &#8220;Rewrite&#8221; block mode on server side level. Examples for these are caching plugins that may not always work. In this case, use the &#8220;WordPress&#8221; block mode instead.</li>\n<li>While using the &#8220;Rewrite&#8221; block mode is faster, you may not be able to write to your servers .htaccess file, in this case please use the &#8220;WordPress&#8221; block mode instead.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20found%20a%20bug%21'>\nI found a bug!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you find a bug, please report it here.
