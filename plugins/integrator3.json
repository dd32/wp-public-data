        "faq": "\n<h4>How is Integrator 3 different from J!WHMCS Integrator? Don&#8217;t they do the same thing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Integrator 3 is a separate, stand-alone product which does not rely upon having either Joomla! or WHMCS. Integrator 3 is designed from the ground up to provide the most dynamic, secure and stable application integration available. While J!WHMCS Integrator has been implemented to wrap WHMCS with Joomla!, Integrator 3 offers the possibility of wrapping WHMCS and Kayako Fusion with Joomla! or WordPress with the exciting possibilities of adding even more connection types such as Drupal or even vBulletin.</p>\n<p>We believe the visual integration alone is worth taking a closer look at Integrator 3, but Integrator 3 also bridges users between connected applications and also provides the ability to have one all inclusive registration form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many connections can I have?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The beauty of Integrator 3 is that it provides the capability to have an unlimited number of connections to different applications and CMS sites.  This permits you to for instance wrap the same install of WHMCS with multiple Joomla sites or WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>By default, your license will include either 2 connections (Lite licenses) or 3 connections (standard licenses), with additional connections at $100 each.</p>\n<p>The possible connections are amazing:</p>\n<p>Lite License<br />\n* Joomla &#8211; WHMCS, * Joomla &#8211; Kayako Fusion, * WordPress &#8211; WHMCS, * WordPress &#8211; Kayako Fusion</p>\n<p>Standard License<br />\n* Joomla &#8211; Joomla &#8211; WHMCS, * Joomla &#8211; WordPress &#8211; WHMCS, * WordPress &#8211; WordPress &#8211; WHMCS, * Joomla &#8211; Joomla &#8211; Kayako Fusion, * Joomla &#8211; WordPress &#8211; Kayako Fusion, * WordPress &#8211; WordPress &#8211; Kayako Fusion, * Joomla &#8211; WHMCS &#8211; Kayako Fusion (like Go Higher!), * WordPress &#8211; WHMCS &#8211; Kayakko Fusion</p>\n</p>\n\n",
