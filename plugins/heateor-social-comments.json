You can enable Facebook Comments, Disqus Comments and/or default WordPress comments simultaneously. You have full control over which of these four commenting systems you want to enable.

This puts your blog in front of new audience which further adds to the likelihood of you getting a new returning visitor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Higher Conversations</strong>: When you know the person commenting on something, it&#8217;s more likely that you will also type out your ideas there, unlike the situation when you don&#8217;t know the person involved in the conversation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Credibility</strong>: In traditional comment form, anyone can put any fake name (Bruce Wayne &#8230;.. ;)) to comment on your blog. If the same comment is from the original Facebook account of the person who is commenting, you can give credibility to this user and also the people will automatically trust it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No Spam</strong>: You can get rid off the spammers and users, commenting using their fake accounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Works for the lazy</strong>: Most people are nowadays lazy. To get these people commenting on your blog, it will just require them to login to their Facebook account (which almost everyone does after powering ON computer).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Important links</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.heateor.com/heateor-social-comments#live_demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Demo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.heateor.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Support Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.heateor.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Us</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heateor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Our Facebook Page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Heateor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Our GooglePlus Page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/heateor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Our Twitter Page</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can send your feedback or/and testimonial at hello[at]heateor[dot]com</p>\n",
