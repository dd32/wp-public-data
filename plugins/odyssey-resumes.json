To add a child theme, create a new folder for your theme in the templates directory.  Then copy only the files you want to customize into the folder.  Set your template to use the child theme and that&#8217;s it!</p>\n<h3>Will this plugin work without ACF?</h3>\n<p>As of now, this plugin requires ACF but this will change in the future.</p>\n",
