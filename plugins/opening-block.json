There are three types of animations, divided into three blocks, and you can select your favorite animation.</li>\n<li>All blocks have a feature that allows viewers to choose not to display animations again. However, to use this feature, the <a href=\"https://ja.wordpress.org/plugins/block-collections/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BLOCK COLLECTIONS plugin</a> must be installed and enabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you download the zip file and install the plugin from the WordPress management screen, it will function as a plugin.</p>\n<p>When you install this plugin, the following three blocks will be registered, and you can use them in the block editor or site editor (confirmed to work with WordPress 6.4.3).</p>\n<p>Below is an overview of the functions of each block.<br />\n1. Logo Anime<br />\nConverts a string to an SVG file and creates an animation that traces its surroundings. The string can be set freely. There are two fonts to choose from: EduVICWANTBeginner and Roboto.<br />\n2.Tea Time<br />\nProduces an animation that plays the set character string as a caption. The string can be set freely. The caption rises like steam from the cup and disappears. The length of this animation is adjustable.<br />\n3.Welcome<br />\nWe will create an animation in which a pen draws the word &#8220;Welcome&#8221;. In this version, the string is fixed to &#8220;Welcome&#8221;.</p>\n<p>You can select the ending animation from the following five options.<br />\n1. Vertical slide<br />\n2. Horizontal slide<br />\n3. Vertical opening<br />\n4. Lateral opening<br />\n5. Circular expansion<br />\nThe opening animation will be created by combining these animations with the animations of each block.<br />\nPlease see the screenshot to see what the specific animation looks like.</p>\n<p>In each block, there is a checkbox located at the bottom right of the screen that allows the viewer to choose not to display the animation next time. This checkbox is always displayed while the animation is running, but it disappears after the animation ends and appears when the user moves the mouse cursor to the bottom right of the screen.</p>\n<h3>Related Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/itmaroon/opening-block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/itmaroon/opening-block/tree/master/src\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source code</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/itmaroon/block-class-package\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">block-class-package:GitHub</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/itmar/block-class-package\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">block-class-package:Packagist</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/itmar-block-packages\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">itmar-block-packages:npm</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/itmaroon/itmar-block-packages\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">itmar-block-packages:GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Arbitrary section</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Logo Anime Block uses a plugin called opentype.js to generate the path of the svg file from the font type.
