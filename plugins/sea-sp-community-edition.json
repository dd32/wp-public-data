        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20%20is%20a%20content%20security%20policy%3F'>\nWhat  is a Content Security Policy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser security standard that controls the domains, subdomains, and types of resources a browser can load on a given web page. CSPs go into a special Content Security Policy header, or it can go on a web page using a meta tag. CSPs are compatible with all modern desktop and mobile browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, and Safari. CSPs detect and prevent certain types of attacks including form jacking and cross-site scripting, browser hijacking and ad injection, as well as unauthorized piggyback tags.</p>\n<p>SeaSP is an extra layer of security that protects your WordPress site from malicious attacks by blocking unauthorized scripts and content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20next%20after%20my%20wordpress%20installation%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s next after my WordPress installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, a strict non-blocking CSP will be automatically added onto your site. Visit each page of your site to collect CSP violations. The Current Violations page of the plugin collects domains that violate CSP directives and see what content is loading on your site.</p>\n<p>Review the domains and click the toggle to approve and include it in the CSP. Check for misspellings of common domains like adobee.com instead of adobe.com. This is a common way hackers inject content into your site.</p>\n<p>To review the subdomains, click the Manage button.</p>\n<p>After this process, you might still see CSP violations for inline scripts, inline styles, blobs, or data. To allow this type of content navigate to the Directive Settings page and toggle the appropriate options (connect src, media src, child src, object src, frame ancestors, unsafe inline, etc.) Each option has a tooltip explaining what the directive allows in your CSP.</p>\n<p>Once you are satisfied with your CSP, toggle the CSP to blocking mode under General Settings to secure your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20tutorial%3F'>\nIs there a tutorial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A walkthough of this plugin can be found <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XdJNh6LEKJw\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20collect%20csp%20violations%3F'>\nHow does the plugin collect CSP violations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin inserts a small JavaScript code in the body of your site as a script tag. As the page loads, violations are collected and sent to the plugin via ajax using a nonce. These errors are parsed for the domains and directives they have violated. This data is stored in your WordPress database, prefixed. This data never leaves your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
