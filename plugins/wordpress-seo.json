Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.<br />\n2. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.<br />\n3. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.<br />\n4. Click the arrow next to ‘HTML tag’ to expand the option.<br />\n5. Copy the meta tag.<br />\n6.

Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the <a href=\"https://yoa.st/3qv\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">importance of breadcrumbs for SEO</a>.</p>\n<p>To implement the <a href=\"https://yoa.st/3qw\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">breadcrumbs</a> function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.<br />\nCopy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nif ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {\n    yoast_breadcrumb( '&lt;p id=\"breadcrumbs\"&gt;','&lt;/p&gt;' );\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your <code>single.php</code> and/or <code>page.php</code> file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in <code>header.php</code> at the very end.</p>\n<p>In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your <code>functions.php</code> file.<br />\nAlternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: <code>[wpseo_breadcrumb]</code></p>\n<p>If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our <a href=\"https://yoa.st/3qx\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20noindex%20urls%3F'>\nHow do I noindex URLS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. <a href=\"https://yoa.st/3qy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about how to do this in this guide</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='google%20shows%20the%20wrong%20description%2C%20how%20do%20i%20fix%20this%3F'>\nGoogle shows the wrong description, how do I fix this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.</p>\n<p>Possible causes could be:<br />\n1. wrong description in code<br />\n2.
