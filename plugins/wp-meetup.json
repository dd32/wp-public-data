Unfortunately, there hasn&#8217;t been an efficient way to link an organization&#8217;s Meetup events easily and efficiently to their WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Until now.</p>\n<p>Nuanced Media&#8217;s WP Meetup plugin fetches event information from Meetup.com and creates posts for each event. WP Meetup also provides an event calendar for displaying events, either on a page or as a widget.</p>\n<p>New in version 2.0!</p>\n<p>• Display multiple groups on one calendar, each group with their own color highlight. Perfect for organizers of multiple, related groups!<br />\n• Display multiple months of events, including past, present, and future events. Help your members plan ahead for special events!<br />\n• Calendar widget that displays a small calendar in the widget area, as well as a new widget that lists seven upcoming events.<br />\n• Increased database stability for calendar creation.</p>\n<p>It has never been so easy to aggregate and display events.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit the plugin homepage at <a href=\"https://nuancedmedia.com/wordpress-meetup-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nuanced Media</a>.</p>\n<p>About Nuanced Media:<br />\nNuanced Media specialized in <a href=\"https://nuancedmedia.com/tucson-website-design/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Design</a>, <a href=\"https://nuancedmedia.com/internet-marketing-tucson-az/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Marketing</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://nuancedmedia.com/brand-tucson-az/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Brand</a> development.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>wp-meetup.zip</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Visit the options page located at Settings -&gt; WP Meetup and follow the instructions.</li>\n<li>To include the event calendar on a page, create a new page and in the content editor, enter <code>[wp-meetup-calendar]</code> where you want the calendar to appear on the page.</li>\n<li>To include a variable number of months on the event calender, use shortcode, e.g. <code>[wp-meetup-calendar number_of_months='4']</code> by default the calender displays two months (the current, and the next).</li>\n<li>Starting with version 1.5.0, you now have the ability to show any number of previous and future events! Try, for example, [wp-meetup-calendar start_month=-2 end_month=2]. This will show a total of 4 months (2 previous months, and the next 2 months, all relative to the current month). Play around with it, it&#8217;s great to be able to have this variable calendar showing!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: With version 2.0.0, shortcodes were added, e.g. <code>[meetup-calendar]</code> by default displays only the current month. The ability to display multiple months still exists, e.g. <code>[meetup-calendar past=1 future=2]</code> will display 4 months (1 previous month, the current month, and the next 2 months).</p>\n<p><strong>Important: If you&#8217;re upgrading from a version prior to 1.2, make sure to disable the plugin and re-enable it.</strong></p>\n",
