This document contains the page names and the slugs.</p>\n<p>Then I create another document from this which details all of the page meta like, descriptions, titles, headers, contents text, footer tags and any other optimisations I want to add.</p>\n<p>This plugin lets me quickly process my sitemap document into real page stubs on the website, complete with the slugs I want.</p>\n<p>The results page is then shown which has edit page links for all of the new pages.</p>\n<p>This allows you to easily open up each tab in the order I’ve planned out (not alphabetically sorted like WordPress defaults) and insert the remaining meta to the pages.</p>\n<p>If this sounds like your workflow then this plugin could save you time!</p>\n",

But its really simple for you to change the block of code that creates the pages. It&#8217;s just a simple<br />\ncall to one of the WordPress functions called <code>wp_insert_post()</code>. The same function is used to create all posttypes by<br />\nsimply altering the <code>post_type</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>You can find documentation for the <code>wp_insert_post()</code> function in the official codex at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_insert_post</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the code within the plugin in the <code>includes/process-data.php</code> file under <code>bpsc_bulk_create_pages()</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20some%20other%20great%20idea%20for%20the%20plugin'>\nI have some other great idea for the plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great!
