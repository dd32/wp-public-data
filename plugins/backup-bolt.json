        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20fast%20is%20the%20backup%20process%3F'>\nHow fast is the backup process?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Backup Bolt initiates backup via PHP PclZip which is the most powerful and fastest solution possible compared to any other backup methods. Usually backups are completed within seconds!.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20backups%20consume%20large%20memory%3F'>\nDoes backups consume large memory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose &#8220;Custom&#8221; backup option to backup only the important wp-content part of your WordPress site so the rest can be downloaded directly via wp.org when you are restoring the backup. At the end, the backups are zip compressed for lowest memory consumption.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20are%20the%20backups%20retained%20on%20server%3F'>\nHow long are the backups retained on server?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Backup Bolt is focused towards storage optimization so backups are auto deleted after 24 hours to avoid flooding server storage. We recommend downloading the backup to your local computer immediately after running the backup.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20backup%20files%20stored%3F'>\nWhere are the backup files stored?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Backups are stored in a secure dynamic folder located in wp-content/backup-bolt-*</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20repeated%20backups%20increase%20backup%20size%3F'>\nDoes repeated backups increase backup size?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Backups created by Backup Bolt are always excluded in further backup process so the backup size remains same even if you backup multiple times.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
