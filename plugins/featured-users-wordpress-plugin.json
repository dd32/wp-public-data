        "description": "<p>While working on a custom WordPress theme we needed the ability to feature users and authors. So we created this ‘Featured users’ plugin which allows the administrator to easily star (feature) users. Then using a custom query in the theme, shortcode or widget; featured users can be displayed by only retrieving users with the custom user meta <code>jsfeatured_user</code>. The plugin does not make any changes to your current theme it only does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds a featured column in the Users panel of the WordPress Admin.</li>\n<li>When a user is featured the plugin adds or updates the custom field ‘jsfeatured_user’ and sets the value to yes.</li>\n<li>Provides custom widget that echoes out shortcode.</li>\n<li>Provides custom shortcode that echoes ul list of featured users.</li>\n<li>Includes theme functions and filters for developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to use and include in your WordPress Installs, please think of us if you need a custom theme or plugin developed!
