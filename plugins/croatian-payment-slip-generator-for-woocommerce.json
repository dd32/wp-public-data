If you don&#8217;t want to sacrifice that plugin, the solution is to deselect the option &#8220;Display image(s) inline in e-mail message body&#8221; in the settings page of this plugin which will be cause that e-mail messages won&#8217;t be sent using <em>PHPMailer</em> module, but using alternative way. By using this approach the images won&#8217;t be displayed inline in e-mail message body, yet they will be treated as regular attachments, although at least the e-mail messages will be delivered to the customers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20handle%20order%20prices%20in%20different%20currency%2C%20so%20they%20could%20be%20converted%20to%20the%20prices%20corresponding%20to%20the%20currency%20on%20the%20payment%20slip%3F'>\nHow to handle order prices in different currency, so they could be converted to the prices corresponding to the currency on the payment slip?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In your <code>functions.php</code> file you should add function to the filter &#8216;wooplatnica-croatia_order&#8217; that would perform conversion of the order price (which could be extracted from the object of class WC_Order passed as a first/only function argument) and would return instance of WC_Order class with updated field values.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
