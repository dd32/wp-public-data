However some users observed a database table overflow with the plugin cache. That happens in rare cases when the plugin data is not cleaned up properly by WordPress. We improved automatic cleanup of the plugin cache. The problem should be solved now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.10.4 &#8211; Aug 11, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improvements for the integration with the Yoast SEO plugin.</strong> There was a minor SEO issue with duplicates of the Open Graph tags on ecommerce store pages.

Categories list and featured products, Expanded categories, Only featured products, All products with filters or Specific Category Page. Choose what works best for your ecommerce site. The new setting is available in the Gutenberg editor: Choose the Ecwid “Store Home Page” block and see the “Store Front Page” settings section on the right.</li>\n<li><strong>Improvements for the &#8220;Import from WooCommerce&#8221; tool.</strong> If you import your products from WooCommerce to Ecwid, the import should work faster now. We made the import of product images faster, which is especially important for a large catalog import.</li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.10.2 &#8211; Jun 30, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP error message (&#8220;Failed opening required&#8221;) for PHP version 5.2 in WordPress admin panel. If your ecommerce site is running on an outdated PHP version, this update might fix a error message for you. Please update your PHP as soon as possible (or ask your hoster to do that for you) — it’s much more secure to use the latest versions of software on your server.</li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.10.1 &#8211; Jun 15, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor improvements for the store dashboard menu items in the WordPress admin backend.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.10 &#8211; Jun 08, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration with the Elementor page builder.</strong> Elementor is one of the most popular page builders. We added Elementor support to Ecwid, so you can add online store functionality to your site pages in Elementor. We added two ecommerce widgets to the Elementor toolbar: the store home page to display the whole storefront and the buy now button to add buy buttons to pages and posts. To try the new widgets, open the Elementor editor in your WordPress admin backend and find the &#8220;Ecwid Store&#8221; section there.</li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.7 &#8211; May 19, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the Yoast SEO plugin. There was a minor SEO issue with duplicates of the canonical tag on ecommerce store pages. The issue has been fixed and everything should work fine now.</li>\n<li>After the last release, the Storefront menu item did not display in the plugin settings in the WP admin. That didn’t affect the store functionality, all the storefront settings and data stayed intact. We fixed the Storefront menu item — you can navigate to the WordPress admin &gt; Ecwid &gt; Storefront and manage your store appearance as usual.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.6 &#8211; May 14, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve compatibility with the Elementor page builder plugin. Ecwid storefronts on Elementor-powered websites loaded slowly on devices with an old iOS version (less than 13.3.1). We fixed it and now stores should work well. </li>\n<li>Better warning messages for the site administrator about the hosting connection issues. Some hosting do not allow WordPress plugins connect external services and APIs in their code. That might be because of a hosting server misconfiguration or a tricky firewall setup. Good news is that the Ecwid plugin would work well even in such environment — you can add a store to your ecommerce site pages and sell. But some of the plugin feature would be disabled. For example, SEO tools wouldn&#8217;t work and the embedded store control panel wouldn&#8217;t show. We added extra warning messages and fallbacks to the plugin code to better handle such situations. If you face such a problem, we recommend contacting your hosting provider to make sure your server can connect the Ecwid API. </li>\n<li>Minor improvements for Twenty Twenty and NewShop themes.</li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.5 &#8211; Apr 21, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor changes in the plugin code to comply with the WordPress plugin marketplace recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.4 &#8211; Apr 15, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the All in SEO plugin. There was a minor SEO issue with  duplicates of the canonical tag on ecommerce store pages. The issue has been fixed and everything should work fine now.</li>\n<li>Minor changes in the plugin code to comply with the WordPress plugin marketplace recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.3 &#8211; Apr 10, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements for the integration with the RankMath SEO plugin. We fixed a PHP warning message (&#8220;call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback&#8221;), which appeared on some sites.</li>\n<li>Several changes in the plugin code to comply with the WordPress plugin marketplace requirements.</li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.2 &#8211; Apr 06, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration with the RankMath SEO plugin.</strong> The “RankMath” plugin is a tool to set SEO meta tags on site pages and to generate a sitemaps. It conflicted with the Ecwid SEO functions: SEO tags and sitemaps generated by Ecwid did not work well with those generated by RankMath. It’s now fixed so if you use the plugin, everything should work fine and Google will index your products pages properly.</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with WPBakery editor and UrbanGo Listing theme.</li>\n<li>Improvements for the &#8220;Import from WooCommerce&#8221; tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9.1 &#8211; Feb 21, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP error message (&#8220;Fatal error: Uncaught ArgumentCountError &#8230;&#8221;). This error is reproduced when the hook &#8220;apply_filters (&#8216;the_title&#8217;, string $title, int $id)&#8221; with one parameter is called in the code. According to the documentation, for this hook you need to pass two parameters. We added an additional check to eliminate the error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.9 &#8211; Feb 20, 2020</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Storefront Settings page in the WordPress admin panel (WordPress admin &gt; Ecwid &gt; Storefront)</strong>. The storefront page on your site is what your customers see when they want to visit your shop. That&#8217;s the home of your ecommerce store. In this major update, we made it easier for you to manage that page — the new &#8220;Storefront&#8221; section in your dashboard has everything you need to do that. Navigate to the WordPress admin &gt; Ecwid &gt; Storefront and manage store navigation, adjust the store URL (slug), add store widgets, create additional ecommerce pages, adjust appearance and more. Read below to find more features introduced on the new Storefront settings page.</li>\n<li><strong>New Storefront Settings Page: Design and content.</strong> personalize your storefront appearance and edit the content of the store page to better reflect your brand and stay connected with your customers.</li>\n<li><strong>New Storefront Settings Page: Navigation.</strong> Help customers find your products on your ecommerce site with the new Navigation section on the Storefront settings page.

We refreshed the design of that page to make it easier for beginners to start selling online.</li>\n<li><strong>A few fixes for compatibility with WPML.</strong> WPML is a popular plugin for multilingual sites. Ecwid supports full-featured multilingual online stores. In this update, we fixed a problem where a direct link to an online store page didn&#8217;t open in a non-default language in WPML.</li>\n<li><strong>Improvements of the store appearance in Jevelin, Bridge and New Shop eCommerce themes.</strong> Even though Ecwid is compatible with every WordPress theme by design, some slight fixes and improvements are sometimes needed to make storefront look better. That&#8217;s why we are always monitoring how Ecwid pages look and behave in WordPress e-commerce themes.</li>\n<li><strong>Fixes for Gutenberg&#8217;s &#8220;Store home page&#8221; block.</strong> Ecwid adds ten ecommerce blocks to Gutenberg. One of the blocks — the store home page — had an issue with the default settings when being added to a new page. We fixed it.</li>\n<li>Minor fix for the shortcode button styles in the page editor in Twenty Twenty theme.</li>\n<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.8.11 &#8211; Dec 30, 2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP error message (“Class &#8216;Ecwid_Import_Page&#8217; not found“) for PHP versions older 5.5. If your ecommerce site is running on an outdated PHP version, this update might fix a error message for you. Please update your PHP as soon as possible (or ask your hoster to do that for you) — it’s much more secure to use the latest versions of software on your server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.8.10 &#8211; Dec 26, 2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Several fixes and improvements for the &#8220;Import from WooCommerce&#8221; tool.</strong> The import tool now works faster and has a neat interface. </li>\n<li><strong>Improved compatibility with popular WordPress cache plugins</strong>.
