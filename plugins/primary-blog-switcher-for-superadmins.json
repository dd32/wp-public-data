It also is annoying when I use other plugins to list user primary blog for display in a member directory, member profiles, etc.</p>\n<p>Telling users to reset their primary blog at their own Dashboard-&gt;My Blogs is a fix, but the SuperAdmin(Teacher in my case) can head off the confusion first with this plugin. There is no other way(AFAIK) for the Network Admin to set the &#8220;Primary Blog&#8221; of a user while editing their profile.</p>\n<p>Now, I can quickly scan the Network Admin list of users and edit profiles and set primary blogs of any user correctly.</p>\n<p>I can also use my <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/menus/\" rel=\"ugc\">Menus plugin</a> to toggle the My Sites menu item so users can no longer fiddle with the Primary Site switcher at all. Problem solved.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<p>The original code for the Primary Site switcher is in wp-admin-includes/ms.php.
