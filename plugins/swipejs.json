The home page for the swipe project is <a href=\"http://swipejs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">swipejs.com</a>. This plugin adapts swipe.js for easier use in WordPress.

        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I edit the styling?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a style.css file included in the plugin. There is a default style that can be overwritten. All of the CSS classes and IDs are in that stylesheet.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My images are different heights</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please format/crop your images to all be the same size. SwipeJS has no cropping or sizing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My newest slide is last</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is proper. Add slide one first. All the posts are in ascending order. This means that the newest post will appear as the last image.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The slider is broken or not working</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The slider uses CSS3 transitions and transforms to move the images. This means you will need a relatively new version of your browser. You can see a list of compatible browsers on <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms3d\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this chart</a>. Red means there is no support and green means full support. If your browser falls in the red zone, either update your browser or you may have to use a different slider.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
