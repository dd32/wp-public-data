        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>jotform-integration.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Place the <code>[jotform id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX]</code> short code in your pages or posts. Replace the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your form&#8217;s ID.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I get my JotForm form ID?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your JotForm form ID can be found in the &#8216;Form URL&#8217; field when you preview your form. It should look something like this:<br />\nhttp://form.jotform.us/form/############## . Just copy and paste the numbers.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting an error &#8220;JotForm Integration Error &#8211; missing form ID&#8221;. What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to include your JotForm form ID in the shortcode tag <code>[jotform id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX]</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see anything happening. What&#8217;s going on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Are you sure you have the right form ID? If you have the wrong ID there won&#8217;t be an error message it will just be empty. Sorry, that is just how JotForm works. Nothing I can do about that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I put a JotForm in a sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I added a widget in version 1.1.0. You should be able to go to appearance &gt; widgets page in the WordPress backend and select the JotForm widget from the list. Enter your form ID number in the field provided and let the plugin handle the rest.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Widgets confuse me, can&#8217;t I just put the shortcode into a widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, WordPress has the option turned off by default.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Ok, so I put the form in the sidebar but it looks terrible. Is there anything you can do to fix it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not a thing. The form is pulled in with an iframe meaning that I can&#8217;t touch the CSS inside the iframe. You will have to modify your form (try top aligned labels instead of left aligned labels) or your template to get it to fit. The other thing you can do is not put the form in the sidebar. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I made changes to my JotForm and the changes aren&#8217;t mirrored on my site. What&#8217;s going on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your browser might be caching the JavaScript that pulls in the iframe. Make sure you have the <code>cache form</code> option turned off in the options panel.</p>\n<p>If that still isn&#8217;t working you can append a query string to your form ID. So instead of entering <code>[jotform id=12345]</code> you could enter <code>[jotform id=12345?update-2012-06-19]</code>. The query string can be anything. As long as it is different from the previous query string your browser wont pull the cached copy.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
