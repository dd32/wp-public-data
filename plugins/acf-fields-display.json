Here, you can see a full list of all your currently used field which is sortable by clicking on the headers, and should you need to learn more about the field or edit it, clicking the label name will take you to the field group&#8217;s page so you can do what you need to. The table sorting functionality incorporates the Tablesorter jQuery plugin by Christian Bach. Docs can be found at http://tablesorter.com/docs/.</p>\n<p>*Note: This doesn&#8217;t display fields in your theme. It just gives you a complete list of your fields that you can reference easily and allows you to edit the field groups easily.</p>\n<p>I tried to mark up the code for this plugin with lots of comments in hope that people can understand how it is working and expand on this functionality. Oh yeah, and all the function and variable names are based off Buster Bluth from Arrested Development.</p>\n",

If you don&#8217;t have the ACF plugin activated, the button won&#8217;t show up.</li>\n<li>Clicking on the button will take you to a page that displays all your currently used fields in a sortable table. Opening up this page in a new tab and referencing this page while constructing your theme will save you a lot of referencing time.</li>\n</ol>\n",
