        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20do%20anything%20special%20to%20enable%20this%3F'>\nDo I have to do anything special to enable this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should fill in the settings on the Settings page. They are just selecting your Privacy Page from the dropdown list of all page names.</p>\n<p>Optionally, enter your Google Analytics ID if you want to enable service-side Google Analytics &#8211; this helps track visitors with ad-blocking enabled. Leave blank if you track analytics with another method, or don&#8217;t want to track analytics.</p>\n<p>The plugin also create a generic Privacy Page, using suggested test from the US Better Business Bureau. This is a page you can edit for your own needs. Or, select an existing Privacy Page via the dropdown list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20is%20the%20gdpr%20%28cookie%20consent%29%20notice%20displayed%3F'>\nWhen is the GDPR (Cookie Consent) notice displayed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The visitor will see the notice if the Cookie Consent cookie the plugin uses is not set. Once the visitor agrees, the message will go away for about a year. If the visitor deletes the cookie, they will see the message again the next time they visit the site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20any%20data%20like%20a%20cookie%20stored%20in%20the%20visitor%27s%20browser%3F'>\nIs any data like a cookie stored in the visitor&#8217;s browser?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;Cookie Consent&#8221; cookie is the only cookie stored when this plugin is activate. It only contains a &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; value. There is no other user data stored on the visitor&#8217;s browser, nor any data stored on your site other than the plugin options.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20tracking%20of%20the%20user%2C%20or%20any%20user%20personal%20information%3F'>\nIs there tracking of the user, or any user personal information?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you enable server-side Google Analytics (GA) by adding your GA ID number, the visitor&#8217;s analytics are sent to GA. The visitor&#8217;s IP address is anonymized before sending it to GA. The geocode for that anonymized IP address will only show the town location, not the user&#8217;s specific location.</p>\n<p>There is no other user-related data or activities saved on your server except the visited page information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20text%20of%20the%20%27cookie%20consent%27%20notice%3F'>\nCan I change the text of the &#8216;Cookie Consent&#8217; notice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not with this version. Maybe with a future version. Unless you dig into the code. We&#8217;ll might add something to the settings page in a future version.</p>\n<p>You can see the Cookie Consent message text and other information at https://cookieconsent.insites.com/ .</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20really%20need%20this%20gdpr%20stuff%3F'>\nDo I really need this GDPR stuff?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We think so. But, we are not lawyers, so we can&#8217;t tell you for sure. We just figured that a simple way to put up a notice would be helpful for all the sites we manage. And we didn&#8217;t find an existing plugin that wasn&#8217;t complex to use for simple sites. That&#8217;s why we wrote the plugin. Then we figured that others might find it useful. So, here it is.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20all%20of%20this%20legal%20and%20compliant%20with%20gdpr%3F'>\nIs all of this legal and compliant with GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Who knows? We&#8217;re not lawyers. But our personal, non-binding, your-mileage-may-vary opinion is that it is enough for simple sites (blogs, brochures, etc) to comply with the (in our opinion) silly GDPR law.</p>\n<p>See the disclaimer above. We are providing this as a simple way of complying with the GDPR terms. Contact your legal advisors to see if it is good enough for your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20the%20privacy%20link%20in%20the%20footer%3F'>\nWhat about the Privacy Link in the footer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If enabled, your Privacy page title/link is displayed in your site&#8217;s footer. Note that there is no CSS for that link; you can adjust CSS using the &#8216;privacy-policy-link&#8217; class in your theme, or in Appearances, Customize, Additional CSS (if supported by your theme).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20place%20a%20privacy%20link%20in%20the%20site%20menus%3F'>\nDo you place a Privacy link in the site menus?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. That&#8217;s up to you. We didn&#8217;t want to mess with your menu.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20the%20google%20analytics%20-%20what%20data%20does%20it%20send%3F'>\nWhat about the Google Analytics &#8211; what data does it send?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Assuming that you enabled this feature by entering your GA User ID on the Settings page, the plugin will send some basic information to your GA account: page name/URL, geolocation, an anonymous IP address (last octet is blanked), a unique client ID value (to identify all the pages that person visits), and the referring page.</p>\n<p>This should be all the info for basic analytics. And the data will be sent for all visitors, including those with ad blockers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20google%20analytics%204%20%3F'>\nDoes this work with Google Analytics 4 ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this is only for Google Analytics Universal Analytics, where your GA code starts with UA.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='but%20universal%20analytics%20%28ua%29%20is%20going%20away%20in%202023%2C%20replaced%20with%20ga%204'>\nBut Universal Analytics (UA) is going away in 2023, replaced with GA 4\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we are aware. A future version of this plugin will use the UA or GA4 value. Still working on that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20report%20additional%20analytics%20info%20to%20ga%20%3F'>\nDoes this plugin report additional analytics info to GA ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, just the basics. If you want more extended GA analytics information, you&#8217;ll most likely need a more powerful process, perhaps even one that you have to write.</p>\n<p>Or use the GA Javascript version that works on the client side. Except that will still get blocked by many ad blockers. Our process is not affected by ad blockers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20something%20doesn%27t%20work%3F'>\nWhat if something doesn&#8217;t work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact us on the plugin support page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20got%20an%20idea%20for%20a%20new%20feature%21'>\nI got an idea for a new feature!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the Support page to send us new ideas.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<p>1.51 (7 May 2022)<br />\n* Better display of privacy page link in page footer if enabled.<br />\n* Some minor changes to the text of the settings.<br />\n* Tested for WP version 6.0.</p>\n<p>1.50 (31 Mar 2022)<br />\n* Better coordination between privacy page settings on the plugin page, and in the Settings, Privacy page. Changing one will change the other.<br />\n* Changed the message next to the Privacy setting on the plugin options screen to indicate the sync between the privacy page value displayed in Settings.<br />\n* Some code optimizations to reduce possible non-fatal error messages on screen if options are not set.</p>\n<p>1.42 (26 Mar 2022) (also 1.41)<br />\n* Adjusted the PHP requirement down to 7.2 (from 7.4). Although we think that you should update your PHP version. The plugin has been tested with PHP 8.x.</p>\n<p>1.40 (22 Mar 2022)<br />\n* Adjusted server-side GA call to use WP functions, instead of CURL, per WP guidelines.<br />\n* Improved gathering of page info to send to GA.<br />\n* Changes to the FAQ to add additional info about UA vs the new GA4. UA will go away sometime in 2023, but we&#8217;ll have an update to work with GA4 by then (with any luck).</p>\n<p>1.32 (12 Mar 2022)<br />\n* Tweaked the reported page to be the full URL of the page</p>\n<p>1.31 (11 Mar 2022)<br />\n* Fixed a missing parameter of the Google Analytics server-side command</p>\n<p>1.30 (11 Mar 2022)<br />\n* Fixed process of saving and using the options. This might require you to re-specify the values on the Settings screen. You should not have to re-create a Privacy page (unless you don&#8217;t have one); you can select your existing Privacy page.<br />\n* Improved the server-side process of doing the Google Analytics call to be more efficient and accurate.<br />\n* We anonymize the IP address, changing the last octet to &#8216;0&#8217; before using that IP address in the server-side GA. The &#8216;anonymize&#8217; flag in the GA call is set to false, since you can&#8217;t anonymize twice (that eliminated GA geocoding). The result is that the IP address is still anonymized, just like your Privacy policy indicates.<br />\n* The only cookie stored by this plugin is the one associated with the Cookie Consent popup. This only stores they answer, not any other data.<br />\n* Improved the privacy page selection and saving that setting also in the Settings, Privacy page. If there is no privacy page selected in either place, a &#8216;choose one&#8217; is shown to match what is seen in Settings, Privacy.<br />\n* Removed some unneeded functions; optimized others for slightly better efficiency.<br />\n* Standardized functions to start with &#8220;SGDPR&#8221; to eliminate possible &#8216;duplicate function&#8217; errors.<br />\n* changed PHP version requirement to version 7.4<br />\n* Updated the screenshot images.<br />\n* Updated the FAQ area of this document.<br />\n* minor text changes and spelling corrections on Settings screen and this document.<br />\n* Changes to the &#8216;branding&#8217; of the plugin to match our other plugins, including additional updated images in the assets folder.<br />\n* Added a sidebar to the Settings screen to show information about other plugins, and a donate button plus the CellarWeb logo.<br />\n* Changed various CellarWeb.com links as needed.<br />\n* <strong>If you are upgrading from a prior version, check the settings after upgrading</strong></p>\n<p>1.23 (19 Nov 2019)<br />\n* fixed some undefined constants that will cause problems in future PHP versions<br />\n* compatibility check for WP 5.3<br />\n* minor changes to function that creates a GUID value</p>\n<p>1.22 (19 Apr 2019)<br />\n* put the &#8216;z&#8217; parameter for the analytics array at the end, where it is supposed to be.</p>\n<p>1.21 (10 Apr 2019)<br />\n* Set the server-side analytics code to get the geolocation of the visitor. This was not captured in prior versions.</p>\n<p>1.20 (10 Apr 2019)<br />\n* Changed all array element names (the part in the brackets) to be strings, rather than &#8216;assumed&#8217; strings. The use of &#8216;assumed&#8217; strings was causing a PHP Warning about undefined constants. PHP ignores that, although that may cause a fatal error in PHP 8x (whenever that gets released). And the PHP Warnings were cluttering up the error.log file.<br />\nSo all array element names are now proper strings.</p>\n<p>1.11 (7 Jan 2019)<br />\n* The plugin needs to set a cookie, but some themes are non-standard, outputting content before<br />\n    this plugin can set the cookie. That causes a &#8216;headers already sent&#8217; error. And some error<br />\n    settings may cause that error message to display on the screen.<br />\n  Since the themes are non standard in how they output content, we have to suppress the<br />\n    &#8216;headers not sent&#8217; message. We do this by saving the error settings, turning off error<br />\n    display, then setting the cookie. Then we restore the error settings to original settings.<br />\n    This effectively hides the error message, while still letting the cookie to be set.</p>\n<p>1.10 (25 May 2018)<br />\n* added support for WP 4.9.6 Privacy functions<br />\n* added requirement for WP 4.9.6; plugin will automatically deactivate if not at that minimum version.<br />\n* added optional checkbox to display the Privacy page name/link in the page footer.<br />\n* some code cleanup</p>\n<p>1.02 (4 May 2018)<br />\n* fixed issue with timing of when cookies are created<br />\n* added reminder when privacy page created that the new Privacy Page should be added to the site menu</p>\n<p>1.01 (4 May 2018) &#8211; Initial Release</p>\n<p>1.00 (28 April 2018) = unreleased version</p>\n"
