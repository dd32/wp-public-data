With Advanced Columns you can do so while still all the other text controls from WordPress Core.</p>\n<h3>Different ways to design your pages</h3>\n<p>Advanced Columns is the most comprehensive layout tool for WordPress: it leverages the power of CSS Grid, and allows for the creation of fixed column layouts, all of this is packed into an intuitive interface that doesn’t require coding skills.</p>\n<h3>One-click presets for a quick editing workflow</h3>\n<p>Advanced Columns comes with a control that allows you to change the entire arrangement of your content, based on the most common columns configurations. With one single click, you can entirely change how your section looks at a specific breakpoint: that&#8217;s a nice time saver!</p>\n<h3>Intuitive no-code drag &amp; drop interface</h3>\n<p>The Advanced Columns Plugin for WordPress offers designers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, customizable Media Query breakpoints, and exceptional flexibility.</p>\n<h3>Plugin standard features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drag &amp; drop interface</strong> – Edit your content directly in the Block Editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Media Queries support</strong> – Perfectly define the breakpoints of your project.</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable columns and rows</strong> – Create grids exactly the way you want.</li>\n<li><strong>Background image support</strong> – The perfect decoration for your content.</li>\n<li><strong>Solid color or gradient overlay</strong> – Fine tune the appearance of your backgrounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick presets</strong> – Apply commonly-used layouts with just a click.</li>\n<li><strong>Precise spacing controls</strong> – Control every detail.</li>\n<li><strong>Single columns z-index control</strong> – Place content on top of everything else.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>For Developers by Developers</h3>\n<p>Developers are in our hearts.

Advanced Columns is extensible, secure and optimized: from the development point of view, this plugin has got your back.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Browse the documentation</a></p>\n<h3>Built on the foundations of CSS Grid</h3>\n<p>Advanced Columns runs on CSS Grid. With such a powerful foundation, there are no limits to what you can build.</p>\n<p>Since column blocks templates are dynamically rendered, styles are dynamically processed too, and are inlined in page only when you actually need them: this way, your pages will perform better in speed tests, and put you in control of their output.</p>\n<h3>Data portability in an instant</h3>\n<p>With a robust set of block transforms: whether you’re coming from Core columns, you’ve been using Core groups or even our Grids plugin, your data and styles can be automatically brought over to Advanced Columns with a single click.</p>\n<p>The choice is yours regarding which blocks to use for your layout. With Advanced Columns one thing is for sure: you are the one in control.</p>\n<h3>Semantically robust markup and style</h3>\n<p>We know what effect heavy markups make, right? Pages become unnecessarily heavy, the code quickly becomes unreadable, and they even mess up your text-to-markup ratio.</p>\n<p>Advanced Columns relies on minimal markup to render, and offers the tools to alter the semantics of the generated HTML to fit your needs.</p>\n<h3>Extensible, future-proof and optimized</h3>\n<p>As developers, we like having control. That&#8217;s why, through various hooks and filters, Advanced Columns provides you with all the tools you need to extend the plugin as you please.</p>\n<p>We prioritize flexibility, and Advanced Columns, with its robust data structure, is a versatile solution that simplifies idea implementation. You know what else we like? Speed! All these goodies are backed up by an optimized platform that has performance at its core.</p>\n<h3>Not yet another page builder</h3>\n<p>Advanced Columns is embracing the power and flexibility of the Site Editor: by following WordPress Core closely, we are ensuring that the plugin stays lean, efficient and secure.</p>\n<p>How cool would it be to add a truly problem-solving plugin to your website and be sure that it won&#8217;t mess up your performance? Well, Advanced Columns is that plugin.</p>\n<h3>The solution for the next generation of WordPress projects</h3>\n<p>Advanced Columns has been designed to be included in a project with ease and its controls be targeted to specific user roles, so that your clients won&#8217;t accidentally mess up your beautiful layouts.</p>\n<p>The plugin integrates seamlessly with Block Themes: this means that you&#8217;ll be able to modify your theme&#8217;s theme.json file and instantly see those changes reflected on our blocks&#8217; controls. Take borders, spacing values, or even colors for example: Advanced Columns will work as one with your theme!</p>\n<h3>Where to start</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com/docs/getting-started/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Create your first layout</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com/docs/columns/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Columns functionality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com/docs/column/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Single column functionality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com/docs/theme-supports/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Theme supports</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com/docs/settings/media-queries/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Media queries configuration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Liked Advanced Columns?</h3>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/advancedcolumns\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a><br />\nVisit the <a href=\"https://advancedcolumns.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a></p>\n",
