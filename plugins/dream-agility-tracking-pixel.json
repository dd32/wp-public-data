Searches for the license in our Database of Tracking Pixel Licenses and returns the license and origin (the url of the site the license is valid for).<br />\n    1.1.a. Fails if the license is invalid (not found in our database).<br />\n1.2.

Fails if the origins do not match.</li>\n<li>Generate Reference Number<br />\n2.1. Generates a hash from your license and uniqueId.<br />\n2.2. Find the item in our database that contains the license-uniqueId hash.<br />\n    2.2.a. If the item does not exist then:<br />\n        2.2.a.1. Check to see if the license-uniqueId hash has converted (the user has already made the purchase)<br />\n            2.2.a.1.a. Fails if the license-uniqueId hash has already converted<br />\n            2.2.a.1.b. If the license has not already converted then generate a new reference code for the license-uniqueId hash<br />\n                2.2.a.1.b.1. Store the new reference code with the license-uniqueId hash, license and uniqueId in the database (for future tracking).<br />\n    2.2.b.
