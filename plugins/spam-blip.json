        "description": "<p>Spam BLIP stops comment and ping spam from being posted, primarily by<br />\nchecking the IP address attempting to post a comment in one or more<br />\nof the public DNS blacklists. A number of options are available<br />\nto refine the check, and with the option defaults, a DNS lookup<br />\nis only performed the first time an address <em>attempts to post</em> a<br />\ncomment; thereafter, the address might quickly &#8216;pass&#8217; because it<br />\nwas not listed, or quickly be rejected because it was listed.<br />\nSpam BLIP creates, and maintains, a database table for this purpose,<br />\nand database lookups are quite fast. Therefore, concerns about<br />\nDNS lookup time can be limited to an initial comment attempt.</p>\n<p>Here are some features of Spam BLIP to consider if you are<br />\nnot yet falling over yourself to get it installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When WordPress is producing a page for a visitor, it checks<br />\nwhether comments are open for each post, and it allows plugins<br />\nto &#8220;filter&#8221; the check. Spam BLIP uses that filter, but <em>does not</em><br />\ndo DNS lookups at this stage, because DNS lookups can take<br />\nperceptible time. Spam BLIP <em>does</em> check optional user-set<br />\nblack and white lists, and optionally existing comments that<br />\nare marked as spam, and of course Spam BLIP&#8217;s own database records.<br />\nThose checks are fast, so they should not have a perceptible<br />\neffect on page loading. Furthermore, on pages with multiple<br />\nposts, WordPress runs the filter for each, but Spam BLIP<br />\nstores the first result, so even the fast checks are not<br />\nrepeated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a comment is actually submitted, Spam BLIP does the above<br />\nchecks, then the DNS lookup only if necessary. At this stage,<br />\nif the DNS lookup causes a perceptible delay, a real human<br />\n(or <em>very</em> clever pet) making the comment should perceive it<br />\nas mere server-side processing. As for spammer robots . . .<br />\nlet them wait.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spam BLIP comes configured with blacklist domains that have<br />\nworked well during development, so a user should not need to<br />\nbe concerned with the blacklists, but there is an advanced<br />\noption to add or delete, activate or disable (yet save)<br />\nlist domains, and configure the interpretation of a return<br />\nfrom a successful lookup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spam BLIP provides user-set whitelist and blacklist options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spam BLIP provides options to check for pings/trackbacks, and<br />\nfor user registrations. (The option to blacklist-check user<br />\nregistration is off by default. See &#8220;Tips&#8221; under the help<br />\ntab on the Spam BLIP settings page.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spam BLIP provides options to configure a &#8216;Time To Live&#8217; (TTL)<br />\nfor its database records, and a maximum number of records.<br />\nThe TTL is important because, generally, an IP address should<br />\nnot be marked permanently. Consider an ISP that quickly<br />\ndisables any account that is found to be spamming. An honest<br />\nISP is also a victim of spammer abuse, and will need to reuse<br />\naddresses. DNS blacklist operators provide means for IP<br />\naddress owners to get records removed &#8212; Spam BLIP provides<br />\na configurable TTL for its records. (Database table maintenance<br />\nis triggered approximately hourly by a WordPress cron event.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spam BLIP will optionally check if a commenter address is a<br />\nTOR exit node. TOR (The Onion Router) is an important protection<br />\nfor people who need or wish for anonymity. You may want to<br />\naccept comments from TOR users (you should), but unfortunately<br />\nspammers have exploited and abused TOR, which has led some<br />\nDNS blacklist operators to include TOR exit node addresses<br />\nwhether or not it is known that the address is spamming. If you<br />\nenable this option (you should), it might let some spam get<br />\nthrough. In this case, mark the comment as spam, and use the<br />\nSpam BLIP option to check existing comments marked as spam; or<br />\nuse Spam BLIP in concert with another sort of spam filter, such<br />\nas one that analyzes comment content. (Please report any<br />\nconflict with other, non-DNS blacklist type spam plugins.<br />\nNote that Spam BLIP is not expected to work in concert with<br />\nother DNS-type anti-spam plugins.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spam BLIP includes a widget that will show options and records<br />\ninformation. The widget might or might not be an enhancement<br />\nto your page, but in any case it should provide feedback<br />\nwhile you evaluate Spam BLIP, so it might be used temporarily.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
