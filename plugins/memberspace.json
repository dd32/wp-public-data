Designed for non-technical people</strong></p>\n<p>We believe anyone should be able to build and run a membership site. You shouldn&#8217;t need to hire a developer or have technical skills. So we&#8217;ve designed our membership plugin to be easy and simple for non-technical people to launch and grow a membership business on any website.</p>\n<p><strong>2. You don&#8217;t get locked into a CMS</strong></p>\n<p>With most membership plugins, you get locked into a content management system (CMS) like WordPress and it&#8217;s really hard to change. MemberSpace works with all <a href=\"https://www.memberspace.com/integrations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">popular CMS platforms</a>, so you can easily move to a different one without impacting your members or their billing details.</p>\n<p><strong>3. We&#8217;re obsessive about customer support</strong></p>\n<p>Our success truly comes from providing great customer support. You can talk with us via live chat or email (under an hour response) and our team is also available for live support hours with you! But don&#8217;t just take our word for it, read our excellent <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.memberspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Trustpilot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.capterra.com/p/175540/MemberSpace/reviews\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Capterra</a>, and other <a href=\"https://www.memberspace.com/reviews/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MemberSpace reviews</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Everything happens on your website</strong></p>\n<p>With MemberSpace, you have 100% control over the design and member experience because everything occurs on your website without your members having to leave. They can sign up, login, access your content, or manage their membership account &#8211; all seamlessly within your existing site.</p>\n<p><strong>5. We offer a free migration service</strong></p>\n<p>We understand that migrating your membership to different software can seem like a daunting task. We want to make it as easy, simple, and painless for you as possible. So if you already have an existing membership system, we&#8217;ll help you migrate to MemberSpace for free (including billing details if possible).</p>\n<p>Membership Plugin Features</p>\n<p><strong>üìà Optimize and grow your revenue</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Members</li>\n<li>Tiered access</li>\n<li>Plan Upgrades &amp; Downgrades</li>\n<li>Abandoned Signups</li>\n<li>Failed Charge Recovery</li>\n<li>Cancelation Alternatives</li>\n<li>Automated Upsells</li>\n<li>Instant Payouts</li>\n<li>Connect Multiple Sites</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>‚ö°Ô∏è Offer flexible plans and billing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paid Subscriptions</li>\n<li>Recurring, Multiple or One-Time Payment Options</li>\n<li>Free Trial Periods</li>\n<li>Drip Out content</li>\n<li>Choose Billing Dates</li>\n<li>Member Approval</li>\n<li>Coupon Codes</li>\n<li>Custom Signup Fields</li>\n<li>Multiple Currencies</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ü§ù Seamless integration experiences</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stripe, Zapier, Circle, Rewardful Integrations, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ü§ó Easy to use and customizable</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>VIP Support</li>\n<li>Mobile Responsive</li>\n<li>Custom Styling &amp; Wording</li>\n<li>Export Members</li>\n<li>Manually Add Members</li>\n<li>Member Emails</li>\n<li>API Access</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>üîê Keep content secure and compliant</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Member Analytics</li>\n<li>Member Invoices</li>\n<li>Encryption Security</li>\n<li>Collect Taxes</li>\n<li>Unlimited Protection</li>\n<li>Multiple Admins</li>\n<li>GDPR, CCPA, &amp; SCA compliant</li>\n</ul>\n",

If you do not have a MemberSpace subscription, there is a link under the Account tab that will take you to our site to sign up.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Once signed up, add your subdomain under the configuration tab and we&#8217;ll grab all your details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That&#8217;s it &#8212; MemberSpace will now protect any pages that match your configuration!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have any questions, please reach out to us on our <a href=\"https://www.memberspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>. We&#8217;ll get back to you fast!</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20a%20transaction%20fee%3F'>\nWhy is there a transaction fee?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The fee creates a powerful incentive &#8211; we want you to make as much money as possible! The better you do, the better we do. That&#8217;s why we continually release new features to help you grow. We also help you offset the fee by automatically recovering all your failed recurring charges and abandoned member signups. In addition, we provide cancellation alternatives you can turn on for members (e.g. apply a discount, extend trial). Say your membership generates $20K/year, we&#8217;ll likely recover about 5% ($1,000) for you in extra revenue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20or%20cancel%20my%20plan%20whenever%20i%20want%3F'>\nCan I change or cancel my plan whenever I want?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can upgrade/downgrade between plans whenever you want and we&#8217;ll automatically handle the prorated charge or credit. You can also cancel your plan whenever you want.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20collect%20money%20from%20my%20members%3F'>\nHow do I collect money from my members?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We integrate with Stripe for secure credit card payments. After you connect your Stripe account to MemberSpace (1-click), you&#8217;ll create subscription plans. After your members sign up and pay for your plans, you&#8217;ll receive the money (minus any MemberSpace &amp; Stripe fees) in your bank account. This usually takes two business days.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20memberspace%20work%20well%20for%20web%20design%20agencies%3F'>\nDoes MemberSpace work well for web design agencies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can connect unlimited client websites under your own MemberSpace Agency account. It&#8217;s easy to invite your client to collaborate on a membership site, and to transfer ownership to them when you&#8217;re done. Agencies can pass along special incentives to your clients, so be sure to <a href=\"https://memberspace.com/agencies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sign up as an Agency</a> if that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll be using MemberSpace.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
