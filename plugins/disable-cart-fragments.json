This AJAX call is made to override caching plugins, which is good, but it generally takes time.</p>\n<h4>How does Disable Cart Fragments solve the issue?</h4>\n<p>With our plugin, you have the best of both worlds: You keep using the caching plugin <em>and</em> you still get to update the cart totals <strong>when the cart is not empty</strong>. This check is made via WooCommerce cart cookies, so it still employs JavaScript but doesn&#8217;t rely on slow AJAX requests. The check is made instantly, whether you&#8217;re using a caching plugin or not.
