For customers that had chosen &#8220;bank transfer&#8221; as their preferred method of payment, it provides the bank details of the seller that best fits the given transaction. Bank payments via Wise would be preferred by some customers for their lower overall fees, or because they don&#8217;t fancy other methods like credit cards, paypal or similar services. Also in some countries, like Germany, it&#8217;s become customary to pay for stuff online via bank transfers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20everything%20work%3F%20is%20it%20there%20a%20%27pro%27%20version%3F'>\nDoes everything work?
