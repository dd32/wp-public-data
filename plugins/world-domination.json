My dashboard figure is different to the one shown on W3Techs\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For performance reasons I cache the dashboard information for one week so, if the market figure changes in the meantime, you will get this discrepancy.

        "changelog": "<p>I use semantic versioning, with the first release being 1.0.</p>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: A big jump in version numbers, but little to see. A lot of the code has changed, though, hence the release number. Basically, all the code was in one file and it was getting big and cumbersome, so it&#8217;s been split.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: I took the opportunity to replace some of the code with some that I&#8217;m using across all my plugins &#8211; a shared resource, which will be kept in-step</li>\n<li>Bug: Fixed a bug that would prevent the dashboard image from displaying</li>\n<li>Bug: Also fixed some a bit more minor, but could throw up the occasional PHP error</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: After updating PHPCS and the sniffs, I&#8217;ve made some further code improvements. Nothing major, don&#8217;t panic.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintenance: Nice try W3Techs. You changed the URL and threw in a change of format to try and fox my plugin. Well, I&#8217;m onto you. Consider this my explosive reply! In other words, it stopped working &#8211; this fixed it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Some of the setting screen output wasn&#8217;t being sent for translation. That&#8217;s now fixed. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.alexclassroom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Alex Lion</a> for highlighting this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: We&#8217;re now integrating the excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-somethingty-percent\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp-somethingty-percent</a>, which uses Canvas / GD to generate a graphic representation of the WordPress market share</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Squashed a pesky bug that meant I wasn&#8217;t initially defining a variable. Thanks to <code>emrikol</code> for pointing this out.</li>\n<li>Bug: I added some new plugin meta in 2.0.2 and it appears it wasn&#8217;t working. How did I miss that? Please don&#8217;t tell me&#8230;</li>\n<li>Enhancement: If the plugin fails to get the new stats rather than keep using the old one ad-infinitum (and potentially serving up wrong information), after a few days you&#8217;ll get an error message.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: I tried to make this plugin as robust as possible, but maybe a little too so. If new data can&#8217;t be retrieved for the market rate, it keeps using the existing, cached, data. Which is great until it goes on for too long. Now, after a week of failure, you&#8217;ll get an error</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved date handling to make you feel better. After all, time is a great healer.</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Detection of WooCommerce. Doesn&#8217;t do much now but is for a future update. Added it now for, I dunno know, I felt like it :shrug:</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Moved some code around to prepare it for some future updates. Think ahead folks!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Why, in the name of all things holy, did nobody not say that I was incorrectly referring to WordPress being a CRM and not CMS? I&#8217;m not angry, just disappointed. It&#8217;s now fixed, though.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added some shiny, new plugin meta</li>\n<li>Maintenance: You know how it followed WordPress.com coding standards before? Now it&#8217;s the WordPress VIP coding standards! </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Code quality enhancements to bring it in line with WordPress.com VIP coding standards</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Now uses <code>wp_remote_get</code> alternative when run on the WordPress.com VIP platform</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Total re-write of the caching to ensure that if the data is not available previous information will be re-used (less chance of an error message as a result but, on the down side, may see older data as a result)</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Sides shored up with lots of security additions &#8211; escape them all!</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Now I show the CMS percentage on the dashboard and not just the overall one</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Brand new shortcodes so that you can embed this information in a post if that&#8217;s your bag. Baby.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Using a time constant for the caching rather than hard-coding long strings of numbers that I&#8217;m only likely to type wrong</li>\n<li>Enhancement: The Github links are on me! Now added to all the files and all the meta</li>\n<li>Enhancement: When you hover over the dashboard link to the source it will now show you when the data was last updated</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a timeout to the file fetching. Okay, so it&#8217;s the default (5 seconds) but it&#8217;s now easier for me to tweak that, if needs be</li>\n<li>Bug: Some of the plugin meta was missing due to the wrong plugin name being used. Oops. Needless to say, it&#8217;s fixed</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
