        "installation": "<p>To install the plugin, you&#8217;ll need to download the .zip file and upload it to your plugins from the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; page in the admin dashboard. Once uploaded, enable the plugin if it hasn&#8217;t been enabled automatically.<br />\nNote that on enabling the plugin for the first time, everything sets up automatically, and you don&#8217;t have to do anything. However, if the database and pages weren&#8217;t created automatically, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new menu item named &#8216;Dashboard&#8217; appears in the wp-admin page. Click on it and confirm the alert message to update the database.</li>\n<li>Go to &#8216;Settings&#8217; submenu and open the &#8216;Pages&#8217; tab. Select dashboard pages from your existing pages or click on &#8216;Create Automatically&#8217; button if there is no published page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have decided to remove this plugin and we were unable to assist you in resolving your issue, it&#8217;s important to clean up the plugin&#8217;s data (including database tables and uploads) before deleting it. Follow these simple steps to do so:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Manage Data&#8217; submenu and open the &#8216;Cleanup&#8217; tab.</li>\n<li>Select the items you wish to delete permanently or choose &#8216;Select All&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Click on the &#8216;Cleanup&#8217; button and wait for the alert indicating whether the clean-up was successful or not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>* IMPORTANT: Do not visit any other dashboard pages in admin as this may cause the database tables and other files to be re-created. Instead, open the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; page directly and remove the plugin from there.</p>\n<p>Once you have completed these steps, the plugin will be removed completely from your system. We recommend taking a backup before proceeding, in case you need to restore the plugin in the future.</p>\n",
