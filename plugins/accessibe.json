        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20accessibe%20adhere%20to%20wcag%3F'>\nDoes accessiBe adhere to WCAG?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! accessiBe‚Äôs solution adheres to the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.1 at the AA level success criteria, and level AAA in certain areas, the highest WCAG level.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20accessibe%20solution%20without%20using%20the%20accessibe%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I use the accessiBe solution without using the accessiBe plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, that‚Äôs possible although we don‚Äôt recommend it. By using just our service your site‚Äôs accessibility will improve but you‚Äôll have to manually add our JS code to your theme and configure it. So why mess with code if you can install our plugin üòâ</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20accessibe%20plugin%20without%20using%20the%20accessibe%20solution%3F'>\nCan I use the accessiBe plugin without using the accessiBe solution?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry, no. That‚Äôs not possible. Our AI service (SaaS) does the ‚Äúheavy lifting‚Äù.

To mention a few: Joomla, Squarespace Shopify, WiX, BigCommerce, Volusion, Magento, Concrete 5, Weebly, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20accesswidget%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does accessWidget cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We aim to enable complete web and WordPress accessibility for everyone on the internet. accessWidget starts from $49 a month.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20accessibe%20plugin%20or%20solution%20affect%20loading%20speed%3F'>\nDoes the accessiBe plugin or solution affect loading speed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not! accessWidget loads asynchronously with your website. Meaning, that the browser loads your website in parallel with accessWidget, and does not wait for it to load or process anything.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20accessibe%20plugin%20and%20solution%20gdpr%20%26%20ccpa%20compliant%3F'>\nAre the accessiBe plugin and solution GDPR &amp; CCPA compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the accessiBe plugin is GDPR &amp; CCPA compliant as it does not collect any data from the visitors.
