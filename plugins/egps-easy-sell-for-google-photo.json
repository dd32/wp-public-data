It periodically scans your Google Photos account for newly added albums and photos, and seamlessly integrates them into your website&#8217;s gallery. This automated process ensures that your gallery stays up-to-date without requiring manual intervention, allowing you to focus on your photography while the plugin handles the rest.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='important'>\nIMPORTANT\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>DO NOT DELETE PHOTOS OR ALBUMS on Google Photos. Instead, set visibility in the EGPS admin panel<br />\nOnce you upload and arrange your photos into albums, please do not make any changes to their arrangement.<br />\nThis is important because the Google Photos API does not support photo deletion, and photos that have been purchased must remain available for download in their original location. Thank you for your understanding.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20trial%20period%20available%20for%20the%20egps%20plugin%3F'>\nIs there a trial period available for the EGPS plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, a trial period is not available at the moment.<br />\nHowever, the gallery part of the plugin is free to use, allowing you to showcase your photos and albums on your website at no cost.

With an annual plan, you typically enjoy a discounted rate compared to the month-by-month option. Additionally, an annual plan offers peace of mind, as you won&#8217;t need to worry about monthly renewals, allowing you to focus more on your photography business.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20payment%20methods%20are%20accepted%20for%20purchasing%20a%20subscription%3F'>\nWhat payment methods are accepted for purchasing a subscription?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, we accept payments exclusively through PayPal and Stripe. For your security and privacy, our servers do not process or store any payment data. When you make a purchase, you&#8217;ll be securely redirected to either PayPal or Stripe to complete your transaction. This ensures that your payment information is handled in accordance with the highest standards of security and compliance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20cancel%20my%20subscription%3F'>\nHow can I cancel my subscription?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can cancel your subscription at any time by accessing your account settings within feldvebel.hu&#8217;s admin area. Simply navigate to the subscription section and follow the prompts to cancel. In addition, subscriptions can also be canceled directly through the payment service used for the purchase—either PayPal or Stripe, depending on your chosen method.<br />\nPlease note that cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and no refunds will be provided for unused portions of your subscription.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20get%20a%20refund%20if%20i%20cancel%20my%20subscription%3F'>\nCan I get a refund if I cancel my subscription?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We can refund purchases within the first 14 days, provided you haven&#8217;t genereated a license key for your website.
