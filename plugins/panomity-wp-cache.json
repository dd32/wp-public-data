For example for one hour, this would be 3600.<br />\nIf you do not feel confident in editing source files, please consider our managed WP hosting. This comes with the plugin PANOMITY WP Turbo and lets you set a custom cache expiration time, is cached in RAM, can cache all pages of a domain, is updated automatically and provides cache matrics.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
