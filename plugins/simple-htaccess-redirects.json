        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>simple-htaccess-redirects</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Add redirects on Redirect Settings Page in admin menu</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why should I use your plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin provides an easy way to add new rules into your .htaccess file so you can make changes on the WordPress backend rather downloading, editing, and re-uploading the file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Do I Add A Redirect Rule?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.5.8, you have to use the add url in the input fields. You must have the &#8220;Old Url&#8221; input have a page slug (/old-url) and the &#8220;New Url&#8221; the full url of the redirect (http//your-domain.com/new-url). Once you have the url in the correct areas, make sure to click the checkbox of the rule you are adding and hit save!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Does The Scan Url Tab Scan My Site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It scans your pages for all embeded links and puts them into a csv file that you can download. Any page that isn&#8217;t linked on the front end wont show up in this scan.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will happen to my code that is already there?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing! This plugin makes sure to add the new rules to the bottom of the file and will not rewrite the code that is already there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the 404 affect my htaccess file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The 404 redirect rule was implemented in a way that it doesn&#8217;t even touch the .htaccess file. Instead it uses WordPress functions to use a custom link instead of going to the 404 error page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the &#8220;Add this Redirect rule&#8221; work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;Add this Redirect&#8221; option must be selected when you click Save Changes to publish to the .htaccess file. It will add the correct code to the bottom of the file without deleting anything.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the &#8220;HTTP Status&#8221; mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HTTP Status will tell you the status of the path you gave the plugin so you can confirm that it is a valid path.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does &#8220;Validate File&#8221; do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0 Validate File opens a <a href=\"http://www.htaccesscheck.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">popular validator</a> and submits the .htaccess file contents into their website for validation. Their Terms of Service can be found <a href=\"http://www.htaccesscheck.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I made a mistake?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin makes sure the outputted code is valid, so a mistake may redirect people to the wrong place. Always double check before saving the changes! If you make a mistake, there is always the &#8220;Reset .htaccess file&#8221; button that will set your file back to default. Make sure to remove the redirect rule as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to delete a redirect rule?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.5.8, go to the &#8220;Active Redirects&#8221; page and click on the checkbox of the redirect you want to remove. This does not remove your htaccess code but only the redirect.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are my redirect rules saved anywhere else?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All the rules you create are also submitted into the log.txt file in the assets folder so you have a back up of the rules of the .htaccess just in case something goes wrong.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
