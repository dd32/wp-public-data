Choose from a variety of layouts, positions, and transitions directly from the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<h4>🪶 Lightweight</h4>\n<p>The plugin is built on top of the Cookie Consent JS library by Orest Bida, a standalone vanilla JavaScript library with no third-party dependencies, that loads blazingly fast and won’t slow down your website.</p>\n<h4>♿ Accessible</h4>\n<p>An a11y friendly plugin — fully accessible and WAI-ARIA compliant.</p>\n<h4>🌐 Translatable</h4>\n<p>Modify any text in the cookie consent banner and settings modal, and provide translations.

If one is detected, you have the option to hide the cookie consent banner from them.</p>\n<h4>🧩 Google Consent Mode (GCM) integration</h4>\n<p>Integrate with Google Consent Mode (GCM) to adjust how Google tags behave based on the user’s consent preferences. Supports both Google tag (gtag.js) and Google Tag Manager (GTM) implementations.</p>\n<h4>⌨️ Control it programmatically</h4>\n<p>Programmatically control the plugin.
