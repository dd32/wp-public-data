        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I display the image credits?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the shortcode <code>[image-credits]</code> or function <code>get_image_credits();</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>[image-credits]</strong> can accept <em>before</em>, <em>after</em>, and <em>sep</em> (seperator) parameters. By default, the before is &#8220;Image Credits: &#8221; and the separator is &#8220;, &#8221; (a comma plus a space). Example modified usage:</p>\n<pre><code>[image-credits before=\"Image Credits... \" sep=\" - \"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>get_image_credits();</strong> accepts one parameter, <em>$seperator</em>, which is again by default &#8220;, &#8221; and returns the results (doesn&#8217;t echo). You will either need to return or echo the function depending on your code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m not good at coding and don&#8217;t want to manually put the shortcode in every single one of my posts. Can you give me some example code to work with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. Throw this into your theme&#8217;s functions.php file and the image credits will appear at the bottom of every post:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Add image credits to the end of posts\n * \n */\nadd_filter( 'the_content', 'ac_image_credits' );\n\nfunction ac_image_credits( $content ) {\n\n    if ( is_singular( 'post' ) ) {\n\n        $content .= '&lt;p&gt;[image-credits]&lt;/p&gt;';\n\n    }\n\n    return $content;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Which image credits does it display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Both the shortcode and function will get the credits for all images contained within the post content, including the featured image.</p>\n<p>It searches through the post content for attachment IDs rather than get the IDs of the images attached to the post because sometimes you may upload an image then not actually use it, or you may reuse an image that is attached to an old post. This makes the credits more accurate.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
