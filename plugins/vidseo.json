If required, instead of simply copy-pasting content provided by Youtube (not 100% accurate), you can modify it, improve it and even format it (HTML) by adding titles, links, paragraphs and more relevant content.</p>\n<p><strong>In fact, you can use any other content, not specifically related to your video (if no narration) to boost your SEO.</strong></p>\n<p>If using Viemo, as Vimeo is not providing video transcription for the moment, it will require to create content or transcript your video manually.</p>\n<p><strong>VidSEO plugin</strong> features great flebility (Youtube + Vimeo) with content allowing to show (excerpt) or hide transcription to users. So while a visitor may be in a position to watch and listen to your content without the need to see your transcript, it’ll actually be the keywords copied from the audio that enables them to find your page in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro features :</strong></p>\n<p>Presently, Automated transcription tools can’t yet deliver <a href=\"https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/youtube-1-billion-videos-closed-captioning-accuracy-1201990083/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">100% accuracy</a> and still need human intervention to produce usable results. For example, most inaccuracies in automated transcriptions can be caused by heavy accents, mispronunciation, inaudible speech, background noise, overlapping sounds, dialect, and slang.

So despite video sitemaps, all content explained/provided in videos cannot be used for your SEO strategy. In other words, videos are cool for people visiting your website but they will never be the reason why people are actually visiting your website.</p>\n<p>**Video transcription pick up where meta descriptions and video tags fail to offer more detail. **Transcripts are a textual representation of the spoken content in video. Search engines can’t watch a video or listen to audio, but they do crawl text and use text for indexing purpose. Adding transcription to embeded videos provides much more crawlable content to search engines, allowing them to understand video content on a deep level, increasing not only your keyword density, but also your keyword diversity (for Google to find and rank).</p>\n<p><strong>About this :</strong> pages that contain more than <a href=\"http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2015/27698/2-million-blog-posts-are-written-every-day-heres-how-you-can-stand-out\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">2,000 words are more likely to appear in the top ten search results on Google</a>, so transcriptions from slightly longer videos stand a great chance of getting you noticed.</p>\n<p>Also, if video transcriptions benefit rankings, <strong>they will also benefit your traffic</strong>. The higher up your target keywords are in Google, the closer to position one, which drives more traffic and clicks to your landing pages and content. A higher ranking will generate more traffic, and increased traffic drives higher rankings. It’s all intertwined.</p>\n<p><strong>About this :</strong> Video transcription can be very impactful for websites. David Schneider, writing for SearchEnginePeople, noted that the radio show This American Life puts <a href=\"http://www.3playmedia.com/customers/case-studies/this-american-life/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">6.68% of their search engine traffic down to their transcripts</a> — a healthy audience return for transcribing existing content. Another study by <strong>Liveclicker</strong> compared 37 web pages before and after adding transcripts. Pages with transcripts earned on average 16% more revenue than they did before transcripts were added.</p>\n<p><strong>Video transcription will help you lower bounce rate.</strong> Because putting video transcripts on your website will increase engagement and widen your audience, it’s pretty self-explanatory why your bounce rates would shrink and the average time on page would increase. Transcription provides more content for a customer to consume.</p>\n<p>The countless benefits of video transcription for SEO and your customers are undeniable.
