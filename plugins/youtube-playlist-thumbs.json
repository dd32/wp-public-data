See screenshot #3.</p>\n<p>To trigger the playback of an ordered video in the playlist, add this attribute to the clickable element:</p>\n<pre><code>data-ypt-index=\"X\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where &#8216;X&#8217; is the order number of the video with the first video starting at 0. The <strong>third video would be 2</strong>. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button data-ypt-index=\"2\"&gt;Click to play the third video.&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; thumbnail text and arrow is inserted by CSS.

It is first set when the player is ready and it adjusts when the window changes size. If you are using modals or any dynamic method to show/hide the player, you will need to trigger this function when the player is shown:</p>\n<pre><code>yptThumbHeight();\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, with Bootstrap modals:</p>\n<pre><code>$('#videoModal').on('shown.bs.modal', function (e) { //modal shows\n     yptThumbHeight(); //update the thumb height\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>A Javascript event triggers at the end of a playlist. It can used to trigger other events:</p>\n<pre><code>jQuery(document).on('playlistEnd', function () { //playlist finished last video\n    alert(\"That's all, thanks for watching!\"); //do something\n});\n</code></pre>\n",
