Notice that this is just a NOTIFICATION plugin, it is not an A-Z solution for claiming posts. You can create a custom form using other plugins to allow your users to send you claims. Then once you manually modify the author of the post, ACN will step in and notify the previous and new author of the change.</p>\n<p>ACN features:<br />\n1. Custom email subject and text to be sent to the previous author<br />\n2. Custom email subject and text to be sent to the new author<br />\n3.
