        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does this plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you activate the plugin you need to go to its settings page (<em>Settings &gt; Simple SCSS Compiler</em>). There you can add file groups which are basically one or multiple input files with your SCSS code in it and an output file for your CSS code. (<em>Remember to use full path of files relative to your WordPress document root, for example: /wp-content/themes/theme/styles.scss</em>). Then click on &#8220;Save settings&#8221; and the plugin will convert your input SCSS files to your output CSS file automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20effect%20the%20performance%20of%20the%20site%3F'>\nDoes it effect the performance of the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A little bit. The plugin runs every time your site is opened and checks if your input files were modified since the last time the site was visited. Only if they were then it compiles them to CSS. So, it shouldn&#8217;t make the site slower than a couple of milliseconds, depending on how many SCSS code it needs to compile of course.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20found%20a%20bug%2C%20or%20have%20a%20feature%20request.%20what%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nI found a bug, or have a feature request. What can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just write to me on the &#8220;Support&#8221; tab here on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-scss-compiler/\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin&#8217;s WordPress page</a> and I will look into it as soon as I can.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
