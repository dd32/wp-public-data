        "description": "<p>This plugin requires the WP-PostViews plugin to be installed and setup to work correctly. (https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-postviews/)</p>\n<p>This plugin displays a widget in the sidebar with the most recently viewed posts over the last 2 days, the number of times they were viewed, a link to each, and images corresponding to whether they were &#8220;hot&#8221; posts or not (calculated as a percentage of the most viewed post).</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>recent-post-views.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Put the post in the sidebar via the &#8216;Widgets&#8217; menu, save a title for the widget.</li>\n<li>Use the shortcode [recentpostviews] in your pages and posts. See FAQ&#8217;s for more info. Accepts &#8220;cat&#8221;, &#8220;posts&#8221;, and &#8220;days&#8221; as inputs.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The basic format is [recentpostviews], which will by default show a list of the top 7 posts, from all categories, over the last 2 days.<br />\nOptions are &#8220;cat&#8221;, &#8220;posts&#8221; and &#8220;days&#8221;.<br />\n* &#8220;cat&#8221; is the category ID.<br />\n* &#8220;posts&#8221; is the number of posts you want to display.<br />\n* &#8220;days&#8221; is the number of days back you want the shortcode to query, as in &#8220;over the last (n) days.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Example: [recentpostviews cat=&#8221;5&#8243; posts=&#8221;10&#8243; days=&#8221;3&#8243;]<br />\n*This would display the 10 most recent posts from category 5 over the last 3 days.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not getting any results for the shortcode, try changing the number of days.</p>\n<p>By default, the &#8220;hotlevel&#8221; for posts is 75% or .75 in the shortcode. E.g., a post will not show up as &#8220;hot&#8221; unless it is greater than or equal to the post with the most number of views over the same time frame.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change options, like what is considered a &#8220;recent&#8221; post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just add the widget and select your options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have multiple widgets, and some of them have posts that are viewed the same number of times, but one is not a &#8220;hot&#8221; post. What gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whether a post is hot or not is dependent on the max number of views for any post over the timeframe you have selected. E.g., if you have a widget based on the last 3 days and one based on the last 7, the level for a &#8220;hot&#8221; post will be different. I&#8217;m planning on changing this in a future update, such that the max number of posts for a particular category will be calculated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The number of views for my posts are not updating, why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I actually had this issue myself, and discovered that it&#8217;s because the postmeta table was not updating the number of views. As a temporary solution, I installed the WP-PostViews plugin (at https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-postviews/) and enabled the option in the settings menu that said to register views from everyone, not just guests. Thanks to GamerZ for a great plugin, and for helping to fix this issue. If you&#8217;re having this problem, I suggest that recent-post-views should be used in conjunction with WP-PostViews.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
