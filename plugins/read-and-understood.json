By doing so, the employee may assume responsibility for understanding the content and following any instructions, procedures, or policies contained in it.</p>\n<p>These acknowledgments may then be accessed by administrators via a CSV file containing records created in a given date range.  The records are exported using an Export button on the plugin&#8217;s setting page.  In addition to exportation, the records are accessible through any technique used to access a typical MySql database such as PHPadmin, linked ables, or custom programming.</p>\n<p>The acknowledgments may also be purged (deleted) using the PURGE button also found on the plugin&#8217;s setting page.</p>\n<p>Optionally, the plugin may be configured to accept acknowledgments from users who are not logged-in.  In that case, the user may enter any username desired provided that it meets an administrator specified format as defined by a regular expression.  The default format for such usernames, if allowed, is 1-10 capital letters.</p>\n<p>An Export file is a comma-separated value (CSV) text file which is generated from the administrative Settings Page.</p>\n<p>There is header column that contains the post_title of any acknowledgments found within the specified date range.</p>\n<p>Each row contains the RNU_USERNAME which may represent:</p>\n<pre><code>   1) The WP username of the logged in reader who made one or more acknowledgments\n   2) If so configured, the username entered by a person who is NOT logged in\n   3) If \"all Users\" is checked to export, the WP username with no acknowledgments\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each row contains the RNU_USER_ID which may represent:</p>\n<pre><code>   1) The user_id of the logged-in user who acknowledged the posting(s).\n   2) A zero \"0\", signifying that no person was logged in when the post was acknowledged\n   3) The user_id of person who acknowledged NO postings (and t.he ALL USERS option was selected)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each row may contain an email address which corresponds to the non-zero RNU_USER_ID, regardless of whether any acknowledgments were made.</p>\n<p>Also in each row, there may be a date/time in a cell in a column headed by a post_title. That date/time corresponds to when the user (row) acknowledged that post (column).</p>\n<p>Note that username may NOT necessarily correspond to a unique user and may be repeated.  In fact, if so configured, a person who is not logged in may enter the username of any person.<br />\nFor this reason, the User_id is also given in each row; which, if zero, means that the acknowledgment was made by a person not logged in who entered that username.</p>\n",
