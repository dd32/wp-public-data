You should see message similar to: <code>Google Page-Level-Ads: ANCHORS :: VIGNETTES</code><br />\nIf you see message, ads will start running shortly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Nothing happens although I added #googleads to url</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please double check code you inserted and possible typo slip through. Script you inserted must be <code>AS IS</code> provided by Google AdSense.<br />\nAlso check in plugin settings if you turned off script inserting, or plugin is not activated at all.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Text message informed me ads cannot be displayed</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your website is not optimized for mobile devices. You have to contact your theme developer or change theme itself to one of responsive solutions. Changing theme will not affect your plugin settings at all.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
