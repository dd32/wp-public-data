        "faq": "\n<h4>Q. Are the original images affected by the watermarking process?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. No. One of the primary features of WP Image Protect Premium is that the original image remains unaffected by the watermarking process. The watermarks are only applied as they are viewed on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. There are no errors, but Watermarks are not being displayed</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Ensure the plugin is activated an you have selected the relevant option from Settings &gt; WP Image Protect Settings in your WordPress administration dashboard.</p>\n<p>Ensure your permalinks are working correctly, by checking Settings &gt; Permalinks and ensuring an option other than default is selected.</p>\n<p>If there are still problems try disabling all other plugins, reverting to the default theme and then re-enabling the plugins one-by-one to identify any conflicting plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. My images are not being displayed, even after deactivating the plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. This is a known issue with some configurations. To restore the images goto your WordPress administration panel, click on Settings &gt; Permalinks and press Save.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. There is another problem with the plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Firstly, try de-activating other plugins.  If you have tried this and are still having issues please use the contact link (Premium only) or open a ticket on the WordPress.org support forum (Lite only), providing as much detail as possible &#8211; the version of WordPress and WP Image Protect you are using and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Are my original images affected by Watermarking?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. No. The technology employed in WP Image Protect means that the Watermark is only displayed when the image is rendered.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. How do I specify what images are Watermarked/Excluded from Watermarking?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. By default, watermarks are applied to all uploaded images above the &#8216;Watermark only Size&#8217; threshold found on the plugin settings page. This ensures that smaller images such as thumbnails are not watermarked. Additionally, you can exclude individual images from the watermarking process by selecting the relevant image from Media &gt; Library in your WordPress administration console and checking &#8216;WPIPP Exclude from Watermarking&#8217; checkbox and pressing &#8216;Update&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
