Make sure you edit your profile privacy settings and turn game details (and your profile) to public.</p>\n<p>This plugin will add a widget that displays your Steam gaming statistics. It employs caching to keep your site&#8217;s performance up and make it less susceptible to Steam outages or errors.</p>\n<p>The widget comes with the following preset looks (see screenshots) that you can easily switch between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile Only</li>\n<li>Profile Small</li>\n<li>Profile + Games</li>\n<li>Games Only</li>\n<li>Games Grid</li>\n<li>Full-page Profile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also customize the widget to suit your needs by editing the templates, which support the following attributes pulled from your Steam profile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recently Played Games\n<ul>\n<li>Game Name</li>\n<li>Steam URL</li>\n<li>Player Stats URL</li>\n<li>Icon URL (32)</li>\n<li>Small Logo URL (120 x 45)</li>\n<li>Large Logo URL (184 x 69)</li>\n<li>Time Played Last Two Weeks</li>\n<li>Time Played Total</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Player Profile\n<ul>\n<li>Steam Username</li>\n<li>64-bit Steam ID</li>\n<li>Status</li>\n<li>Profile URL</li>\n<li>Avatar Icon URL (32)</li>\n<li>Avatar Medium URL (64)</li>\n<li>Avatar Large URL (184)</li>\n<li>Time Played Last Two Weeks</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Copy the contents of this archive to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the &#8216;Appearance &gt; Widgets&#8217; menu and add &#8216;Steam Widget&#8217; to a sidebar</li>\n<li>Expand the widget&#8217;s options, enter a Steam Profile ID, and save</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>I put the widget into my sidebar but nothing is displayed on my site.</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, make sure you put your Steam Profile ID in the widget&#8217;s settings.</li>\n<li>Check that your Steam profile is set to public.</li>\n<li>Try saving the widget&#8217;s settings a few times (forcing a data refresh) in case Steam was just experiencing an intermittent problem.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I find my Steam Profile ID?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In either Steam itself or on the Steam website, go to the upper-right where it says &#8220;your account&#8221; and then click on &#8220;View Profile&#8221;. The URL on the page will either be in the format http://steamcommunity.com/id/XXX or http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/XXX where your Steam Profile ID is XXX. For the latter, it will be a unique 17-digit number. If you want to use the former, which has a prettier URL, go to &#8220;Edit Profile&#8221; and enter a &#8220;Custom URL&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize the look of my widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the widget options, change the preset to &#8220;Custom&#8221;. The two template boxes will appear. The &#8220;Game Template&#8221; is used to output every game played recently and the &#8220;Main Template&#8221; is for everything else. To show the game template in the main template, you must use the pattern %GAMES_TWOWEEKS% in the main template.</p>\n<p>Use &#8220;Toggle Show Patterns&#8221; below each template to show the patterns that each template supports. These patterns are replaced with data from your Steam profile.</p>\n<p>Patterns that start with &#8220;IF_&#8221; are conditionals that can output based on whether or not some condition is true. For example, for IF_GAME_STATS{XXX}, if a game supports stats, &#8220;XXX&#8221; is output, otherwise nothing is output. Conditionals can also be followed with an &#8220;ELSE&#8221; pattern that outputs if the preceding conditional was false. For example, IF_GAME_STATS{%GAME_STATS_URL%}ELSE{%GAME_URL%} will output the URL for your game stats if the game supports stats, otherwise it will output the URL for the game&#8217;s Steam community page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the shortcode for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you save the widget&#8217;s settings, it will show you a shortcode that you can use to display that widget in pages or posts. Just copy and paste the code where you want the widget. It&#8217;s recommended to use the full-page preset with the shortcode. You can move the widget into the &#8220;Inactive Widgets&#8221; area when only using the shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
