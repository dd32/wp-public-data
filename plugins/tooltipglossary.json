The title of the page should be the term.  The body content should be the definition.</li>\n<li>Create a main glossary page (example &#8220;Glossary&#8221;) with no body content if you wish to.  If you do not create this page then your terms will still be highlighted but there will not be a central listing of all your terms.</li>\n<li>In the plugin&#8217;s dashboard preferences, enter the main glossary page&#8217;s id (optional as above)</li>\n<li>There are a handful of other optional preferences available in the dashboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the tooltip js and css to work properly.

The plugin creates the unordered list of terms automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add glossary terms?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply add a term under the &#8216;Glossary&#8217; section in the adminstration interface.  Title it the glossary term (ex. &#8220;WordPress&#8221;) and put the term&#8217;s definition into the body (ex. &#8220;A neato Blogging Platform&#8221;).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I need to add or change a glossary term?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just add it or change it.  The links for your glossary terms are added to your page and post content on the fly so your glossary links will always be up to date.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
