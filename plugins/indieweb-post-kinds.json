        "description": "<p>Post Kinds adds support to the Classic Editor for responding to and interacting with other sites using the standards<br />\ndeveloped by the IndieWeb by implementing <a href=\"http://indieweb.org/post_kinds\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">kinds of posts</a>. It is not compatible with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>It can also distinguish certain types of passive posts in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post formats</a>. While it can work alongside<br />\npost formats, it is recommended as a replacement as it is designed as a replacement using IndieWeb Post Types.</p>\n<p>Many sites will not need all of the kinds set up. What kinds of posts you wish to publish are specific to your needs.</p>\n<h3>Privacy and Data Storage Notice</h3>\n<p>Post Kinds stores extra data in a post indicating what you are responding to. This data is either hand-added or can be parsed from the source URL if provided. This means you have additional<br />\nresponsibilities to responsibly use this data, and to remove information on request.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Kind Icons are currently provided by <a href=\"http://fontawesome.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome</a> and are licensed as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CC BY 4.0</a>. A copy of the license notice is bundled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boffosocko.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Chris Aldrich</a> always receives a credit on my plugins due his regular feedback, input, and usage.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Theme Support</h3>\n<p>Post Kinds automatically adds information to <code>the_content</code> and <code>the_excerpt</code> filter. Being as this is inside the content block, which may or may not be desirable, you may remove these filters as noted<br />\nbelow and call <code>kind_display</code> directly. This will allow it to appear outside the content block. To remove the automatic display, add the following to your theme.<br />\n    * <code>add_filter( 'kind_content_display', '__return_false' );</code></p>\n<p>The functions <code>has_post_kind</code>, <code>set_post_kind</code>, and <code>set_post_kind</code> will allow you to manipulate the kind settings in a post. <code>get_post_kind_string</code> will return the display name of a kind.</p>\n<p>If you want to customize the look of the display, you can create a directory in your theme called <code>kind_views</code>, copy the file from the views directory of the plugin, and modify it. This will persist<br />\nthrough future plugin updates.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>The plugin requires the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\" rel=\"ugc\">webmention</a> plugin to support sending/receiving notice of a reply/like to another site which will appear as a comment.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Kinds, like Post Formats built into WordPress, allow you to specify that a post contains a certain type of content. It also, based<br />\non you classifying it that way, displays it appropriately and marks it up accordingly so outside sites can identify it. Kinds are<br />\neither a response to something, such as a URL, or a more passive type of post where you are recording/logging something you did, for<br />\nexample, watched a movie.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20interact%20with%20other%20sites%3F'>\nHow do I interact with other sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is added by webmention support.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bob wants to reply to Sue on his own website.</li>\n<li>Sue enables webmentions(separate plugin) on her site.</li>\n<li>Bob creates a post and sets it as a reply to or a like of Sue&#8217;s post.</li>\n<li>A webmention is sent to Sue&#8217;s site, and Sue&#8217;s site uses the markup added by this plugin to determine what kind of post it is.</li>\n<li>Sue&#8217;s site stores and displays data from the post as a comment on Sue&#8217;s post.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20learn%20more%3F'>\nHow do I learn more?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For more information on the Indieweb and tools for WordPress, visit <a href=\"http://indieweb.org/Getting_Started_on_WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Getting Started on<br />\nWordPress</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='there%20are%20too%20many%20post%20kinds'>\nThere are too many Post Kinds\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can enable/disable more based on preference. Some may be enabled by plugins. You do not have to use ones you don&#8217;t want. Not having a post kind enabled<br />\nwill not disable the functionality on existing posts, it only hides the selection in adding new posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20kinds%20of%20posts%20i%20can%20make%3F'>\nWhat are the kinds of posts I can make?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These kinds have an analog in post formats. Adding context to one of these may make it a Passive Kind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Article</strong> &#8211; traditional long form content &#8211; a post with an explicit post name(title)</li>\n<li><strong>Note</strong> &#8211; short content &#8211; a post with just plain content (also the default)</li>\n<li><strong>Photo</strong> &#8211; image or photo post &#8211; a post with an embedded image as its primary focus.

This is the most well-known example of a passive kind of post. They are formed by having content in the context box on one of these types of<br />\nposts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen</strong> &#8211; scrobble &#8211; listening to an audio post</li>\n<li><strong>Jam</strong> &#8211; Indicating a particularly personally meaningful song</li>\n<li><strong>Watch</strong> &#8211; video &#8211; watching a video</li>\n<li><strong>Play</strong> &#8211; playing a game</li>\n<li><strong>Craft</strong> &#8211; making something&#8230;such as 3D printing, crafting, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Read</strong> &#8211; reading a book, compared to online material</li>\n<li><strong>Eat</strong> &#8211; Representing recording what you eat, perhaps for a food diary</li>\n<li><strong>Drink</strong> &#8211; Similar to Eat</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kinds%20do%20you%20plan%20to%20add%20in%20the%20future%3F'>\nWhat kinds do you plan to add in the future?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The following Kinds are reserved for future use but will not show up in the<br />\ninterface at this time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wish</strong> &#8211; a post indicating a desire/wish.

So to view all the posts marked as &#8220;note&#8221;, for example, one could visit the URL http://www.YOURSITE.COM/kind/note/.<br />\nSimply replace YOURSITE.COM with your particular site name and the particular post kind name to access the others.</p>\n<p>You can also add the date /kind/note/2018/12/24 to see date-based archives.</p>\n<p>For archives if you add exclude_kind as a query variable it will exclude specific kinds from the query <code>?exclude=kind&amp;exclude_terms=note</code>. You can also do this as /exclude/kind/note,checkin as it accepts multiple values</p>\n<p>There is also a special photo photo included, using ?kind_photos=1 or /photos or /photos/yyyy or /photos/yyyy/mm or /photos/kind/note or any other taxonomy. This will use the photo enhancements introduced in 3.4.0 to only show photos from<br />\nall types of posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20rss%20feeds%20for%20each%20kind%3F'>\nDo you have RSS feeds for each kind?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Post Kinds also automatically handles RSS feeds which can be made available or subscribed to for any of the particular kinds. The RSS feed for all the posts marked as &#8220;note&#8221;, for example could be found at either the URL <code>http://www.example.com/kind/note/feed</code> or  <code>http://www.example.com/feed/?kind=note</code> (if one doesn&#8217;t have pretty permalinks enabled). Others can be obtained by replacing &#8220;note&#8221; with the other kinds.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20bookmarklets%3F'>\nDo you support bookmarklets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, a fully automatic bookmarklet is not yet part of the plugin but you can send data directly to the Post Editor</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you add <code>?kindurl=URL</code> to the post editor URL, it will automatically fill this into the URL box in post properties</li>\n<li>If you add <code>?kind=like</code> to the post editor URL, it will automatically set the kind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So &#8211; <code>https://www.example.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?kindurl=URL&amp;kind=like</code> will automatically set a like with the URL</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20post%20automatically%20outside%20the%20post%20editor%3F'>\nCan I post automatically outside the Post Editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub\" rel=\"ugc\">Micropub</a> plugin for WordPress is the easiest way to post outside of the Post Editor.

    "description": "<p>Post Kinds adds support to the Classic Editor for responding to and interacting with other sites using the standards<br />\ndeveloped by the IndieWeb by implementing <a href=\"http://indieweb.org/post_kinds\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">kinds of posts</a>. It is not compatible with Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>It can also distinguish certain types of passive posts in a manner similar to <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post formats</a>. While it can work alongside<br />\npost formats, it is recommended as a replacement as it is designed as a replacement using IndieWeb Post Types.</p>\n<p>Many sites will not need all of the kinds set up. What kinds of posts you wish to publish are specific to your needs.</p>\n<h3>Privacy and Data Storage Notice</h3>\n<p>Post Kinds stores extra data in a post indicating what you are responding to. This data is either hand-added or can be parsed from the source URL if provided. This means you have additional<br />\nresponsibilities to responsibly use this data, and to remove information on request.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Kind Icons are currently provided by <a href=\"http://fontawesome.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome</a> and are licensed as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CC BY 4.0</a>. A copy of the license notice is bundled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://boffosocko.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Chris Aldrich</a> always receives a credit on my plugins due his regular feedback, input, and usage.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Theme Support</h3>\n<p>Post Kinds automatically adds information to <code>the_content</code> and <code>the_excerpt</code> filter. Being as this is inside the content block, which may or may not be desirable, you may remove these filters as noted<br />\nbelow and call <code>kind_display</code> directly. This will allow it to appear outside the content block. To remove the automatic display, add the following to your theme.<br />\n    * <code>add_filter( 'kind_content_display', '__return_false' );</code></p>\n<p>The functions <code>has_post_kind</code>, <code>set_post_kind</code>, and <code>set_post_kind</code> will allow you to manipulate the kind settings in a post. <code>get_post_kind_string</code> will return the display name of a kind.</p>\n<p>If you want to customize the look of the display, you can create a directory in your theme called <code>kind_views</code>, copy the file from the views directory of the plugin, and modify it. This will persist<br />\nthrough future plugin updates.</p>\n",
