Open tddrecentposts.php<br />\n1. Around line 124, you&#8217;ll find the query arguments.<br />\n1. Add (or remove) query arguments from the array as discussed here: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts<br />\n1.

It now utilizes the widget architecture so you can have multiple instances running. Actually, it&#8217;s a complete re-write of the plugin.</li>\n<li>Eliminated the &#8220;hard truncate&#8221; option, because it didn&#8217;t really matter</li>\n<li>Updated the truncate algorithm slightly, so it will remove punctuation at the end of the truncate view</li>\n<li>Cleaned up (er-rewrote) the widget options so play nicer with others.</li>\n<li>This version doesn&#8217;t use the options table to store options (the plugin architecture takes care of that for us), so unfortunately upgrading will cause any previous options to disappear. I clean up (delete) any existing options in the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a &#8220;truncate excerpts&#8221; option allows you to shorten the content that is hand-written in the excerpt field of a new post.</li>\n<li>Added a &#8220;hard truncate&#8221; option which will shorten the preview content to exactly the number of characters you specify.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed xhtml validation errors that this plugin was causing.</li>\n</ul>\n"
