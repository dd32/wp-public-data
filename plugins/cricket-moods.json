        "description": "<p>Cricket Moods is a flexible &#8220;mood tag&#8221; WordPress plugin.  It allows an author to<br />\nadd one or more &#8220;moods&#8221; to every post.  Each mood can be associated with an<br />\nimage file.  The result would be that the author could have an animated happy<br />\nsmiley face next to the words <em>I&#8217;m Happy!</em> for every post she wishes.</p>\n<p>Cricket Moods presents you with a list of available moods when you go to create<br />\nor edit a post.  There is no need for you to remember your list of moods.  Using<br />\nan option panel in WordPress&#8217; administrative menus, you can rename your moods or<br />\neven change a mood&#8217;s graphic without modifying every post that uses that mood.</p>\n<p>Despite this plugin&#8217;s name and my continual references to &#8220;moods&#8221;, this plugin<br />\ncan be used for more than just moods.  For example, instead of displaying your<br />\ncurrent mood, you could give your readers the current weather where you are.<br />\nYou could rename the mood tags to things like &#8220;Sunny&#8221;, &#8220;Overcast&#8221;, and &#8220;Raining<br />\nCats and Dogs.&#8221;  You could then upload little cloud and sun images and use those<br />\nwith the tags instead of the pre-defined mood smilies.  You could even leave the<br />\ntag text or the tag images blank to have either just text or just images.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that Cricket Moods will only be receiving critical bug fixes from<br />\nthis point forth (if we&#8217;re lucky).  I am working on a complete rewrite of the<br />\nplugin called PostBits.  The code for it isn&#8217;t complete and needs a lot of<br />\nwork.  If you&#8217;d like to help, let me know.  Check it out at:</em><br />\nhttp://code.google.com/p/postbits/</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>By default, Cricket Moods will automatically print each post&#8217;s moods just above<br />\neach post&#8217;s content.  You may also have it automatically print the mood just<br />\nbelow the post content by changing the appropriate option in the Cricket Moods<br />\noptions panel.</p>\n<p>Using the &#8220;Moods&#8221; panel under &#8220;Manage&#8221; in the WordPress administrative area, you<br />\ncan add, modify, and delete moods as you see fit.  Leaving the &#8220;Mood Name&#8221; blank<br />\nwill cause Cricket Moods not to display any text with that mood&#8217;s image for a<br />\npurely pictorial representation of your mood.  Conversely, you can leave the<br />\n&#8220;Image File&#8221; blank and no smilie or other image will be shown with that mood.<br />\nDeleting a mood will also remove any references to that mood from your blog<br />\nposts.</p>\n<h4>`cm_the_moods()`</h4>\n<p>If you want your moods to be displayed somewhere other than directly above or<br />\nbelow the content, you must place <code>cm_the_moods()</code> somewhere inside The Loop and<br />\ndisable AutoPrint in the Cricket Moods options.  When called with no parameters,<br />\n    cm_the_moods() only prints the mood image followed by the mood name, an<br />\nampersand, and any more moods followed by ampersands.  For example, on a post<br />\nwith the moods &#8220;Happy&#8221; and &#8220;Bored&#8221; it will print:</p>\n<pre><code>  &lt;img src=\"/wp-images/smilies/icon_happy.gif\" alt=\"Happy emoticon\" /&gt; Happy\n      &amp;amp; &lt;img src=\"/wp-images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif\" alt=\"Bored emoticon\" /&gt;\n      Bored\n</code></pre>\n<p>If there are no moods for the current post, it will print nothing.</p>\n<pre><code>cm_the_moods() can take three parameters:\n\n    &lt;?php cm_the_moods('separator', 'before', 'after'); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>separator</code> (string) Text to place in between multiple moods. Default is <code>' &amp;amp; '</code>.</li>\n<li><code>before</code> (string) Text to place before the first mood. Default is nothing.</li>\n<li><code>after</code> (string) Text to place after the last mood. Default is nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A good way to implement this would be:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;?php cm_the_moods(' and ', '&lt;p&gt;My mood is: ', '.&lt;/p&gt;'); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>`cm_has_moods()`</h4>\n<p>You can also use <code>cm_has_moods()</code> to determine if the current post or a specific<br />\npost has moods associated with it.  It will return true or false accordingly.</p>\n<pre><code>cm_has_moods() can take one parameter:\n\n    &lt;?php cm_has_moods(post_id); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>post_id</code> (integer) The ID of the post you are inquiring about.  Default is the ID of the current post.</p>\n<p>cm_has_moods() must be used inside The Loop if <code>post_id</code> is not provided.</p>\n<h3>Known Issues</h3>\n</li>\n<li>Things get a little fuzzy when you change the author of an existing post with<br />\nmood tags.  If the two authors do not have the exact same mood list, the<br />\nassociated moods may seem to unexpectedly change or not show at all.  It is<br />\nrecommended that you disassociate all the moods from a post before changing the<br />\npost&#8217;s author.</li>\n<li>Editing the post of another user will cause <em>that</em> user&#8217;s moods to be<br />\ndisplayed, not yours.  This is an unavoidable feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Copying</h3>\n<p>Cricket Moods: A flexible mood tag plugin for the WordPress publishing platform.<br />\nCopyright (c) 2008 Keith Constable</p>\n<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />\n(at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
