        "description": "<p><em>WooCommerce remove background</em> is a WordPress plugin, which allows automatically remove or change any background of woocommerce product images using API of <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/?aid=qzfprflpwxrcxmbm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">remove.bg</a> service.</p>\n<p>You can easily set transparent background, make the background to be any color you want or put your own image as the background. The only requirement for photos is to have your products on foreground, meaning that there should be clear distinction between foreground and background on your photo.</p>\n<h4>Key features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically change/remove any background in product photos</li>\n<li>process either all products or only specified</li>\n<li>choose which image types to process (main image or gallery images)</li>\n<li>choose output image size</li>\n<li>back up and restore original images</li>\n<li>preview result before actual processing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Supported images</h4>\n<p>Any JPG or PNG image with up to 8 megabytes.  All photos that have a subject that is clearly meant to be the foreground are supported. For instance, most photos of products, persons, animals, cars and other objects work. If the image resolution is larger than 10 megapixels (e.g. 4000 × 2500 pixels or any other aspect ratio) it is resized to this maximum resolution.</p>\n<h4>How it works?</h4>\n<p>For background removal the plugin uses API of service <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/?aid=qzfprflpwxrcxmbm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">remove.bg</a>. The service allows 50 free requests which provide resulting images of 0.25 megapixels max (e.g. 625×400 pixels). If you like the result, need more requests or higher output resolution &#8211; you can obtain a paid subscription and enjoy the full resolution of outputted photos. Read more about pricing <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/pricing/?aid=qzfprflpwxrcxmbm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>What if I am unsatisfied with the results?</h4>\n<p>We recommend to test the result with a few products by providing their IDs in plugin settings. If you are not satisfied, you can easily restore original images. If you are ok with results, then you can proceed with removing/changing background of all products and obtaining paid subscription at <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/?aid=qzfprflpwxrcxmbm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">remove.bg</a> service.</p>\n<h4>How to use</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign up to <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/?aid=qzfprflpwxrcxmbm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">remove.bg</a> site by going <a href=\"https://www.remove.bg/users/sign_up/?aid=qzfprflpwxrcxmbm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.
