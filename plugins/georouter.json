Configure your routing by continent, country, state &amp; city.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong><br />\n1. Dynamic widgets: Show a dropdown for region selection, or a popup for region suggestion.<br />\n2. Cookie-based preferences: Manual region selection is saved to the browser.<br />\n3. VPN safe: Visitors using a VPN may provide incorrect geolocation results, but can fallback to using the manual region selection widget.<br />\n4. SEO friendly: Query/UTM parameters are retained in redirect ensuring campaign tracking. Routing logic is ignored if the website visitor is a Search Bot ensuring Search Engines index correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>No-code set up</strong><br />\n1. Create a new configuration. Each group of websites requires its own group of routing rules.<br />\n2. Configure your routing rules. Install our code snippet.<br />\n3. Choose to have our specialists install the code snippet for you at no additional charge for a truly no-code experience.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />\nGeoRouter works by loading a small widget on your website. This widget identifies the website visitors&#8217; IP-based Geolocation and performs a redirect or suggests a pop-up accordingly.<br />\nGeoRouter can also load in a widget that allows website visitors to select their Country-Specific website.</p>\n<p><strong>Why use Web Doodle GeoRouter?</strong><br />\nGeoRouter allows your website visitors to see the best website appropriate to their region.<br />\nIf you&#8217;re offering different prices, different language, or are simply tailoring different websites to different regions, GeoRouter will help route your website visitors accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p>Submit your interest at <a href=\"https://www.webdoodle.com.au/georouter/?ref=georouter-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.webdoodle.com.au/georouter/?ref=georouter-wordpress-plugin</a> and receive your GeoRouter namespace to use with this plugin.</p>\n<h3>Terms</h3>\n<p>Web Doodle Terms of Service: <a href=\"https://webdoodle.com.au/terms/?ref=georouter-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://webdoodle.com.au/terms/?ref=georouter-wordpress-plugin</a></p>\n<p>https://georouter.services.webdoodle.com.au/ serves the script to facilitate the service&#8217;s logic.</p>\n<h3>Contributions</h3>\n<p>Feel free to submit any pull requests here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rsoury/georouter-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/rsoury/georouter-wordpress-plugin</a></p>\n",
