For example, a theme that implements the app shell model should be able to extend the core service worker while a plugin that provides push notifications should be able to do the same. Themes and plugins no longer should have to each create a service worker on their own, something which is inherently problematic because only one service worker can be active at a time: only one service worker can win.

The only service worker behavior was to serve an offline template when the client&#8217;s connection is down or the site is down, and also to serve an error page when the server returns with 500 Internal Server Error. As of 0.6, there is a new “Offline browsing” toggle on the Reading Settings screen in the admin. It is disabled by default, but when enabled a <a href=\"https://web.dev/offline-cookbook/#network-falling-back-to-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">network-first</a> caching strategy is registered for navigations so that the offline page won&#8217;t be shown when accessing previously-accessed pages.
