Enter a few and hit Save/Update/Publish.</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note:<br />\nHeadlineEnvy works by attaching to the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/the_title\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the_title</a> filter hook.  If your theme or plugin uses a method of getting post titles that does not trigger that hook HeadlineEnvy will be unable to A/B test those cases.</p>\n",
