So just drop this plugin into plugins directory then all good.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin require cutting edge HTML5 supported browsers to run in the client side?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not really. This plugin supports most mainstream browsers such as IE8+, Firefox3+, Safari 3+ so most of your visitors will be looked after.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I see this in action in the wild?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure try this [example]: https://princesparktouch.com/2019/08/29/winter-2019-presentations/#respond , type in the comment (without submitting) section and refresh the broswer</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can this be extended?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>More to add.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
