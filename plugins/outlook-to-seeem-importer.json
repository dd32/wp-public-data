Choose the import options: upload new contacts as &#8216;published&#8217; or as &#8216;drafts&#8217;, update existing contacts to reflect data in the CSV file (or not), delete info not found in the CSV file for existing contacts (or not). Choose the file you would like to import and click &#8216;Import&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The most important part of using the plugin is having your CSV file in the right format. See the example files under &#8216;Outlook_to_SeeEm_importer&#8217; -&gt; &#8216;Example_CSV_Files&#8217; (in the downloaded .ZIP folder) for examples of proper format.

Again, the only ones necessary are those under <code>First Name</code> and <code>Last Name</code> column headings.</li>\n<li>Once again, the order of columns in the file is not important, however the CSV header (the first line in the file that lists column names) must be present and its labels must correspond to the values separated by commas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>This plugin was inspired by and modeled after <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/csv-importer/\" rel=\"ugc\">CSV Importer</a> by Dennis Kobozev.</p>\n<p>It uses much of the original code from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/csv-importer/\" rel=\"ugc\">CSV Importer</a> in a modified form, as well as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/php-csv-parser/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">php-csv-parser</a> by Kazuyoshi Tlacaelel.</p>\n",
