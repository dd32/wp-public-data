        "faq": "<p><em>What is a domain keyword?</em><br />\nThis is a piece of text that we will look for in the referring domain (host). For example, if you entered &#8220;4web&#8221; as the domain keyword, any sites linking to your site with the text &#8220;4web&#8221; in their domain will be blocked. The following example sites would be blocked in this example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4webmasters.org</li>\n<li>4websitecreators.com</li>\n<li>made4web.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Why can&#8217;t I add a specific domain keyword?</em><br />\nYou may only enter a domain keyword once, so if it exists in the list you can&#8217;t add it a second time. Also, you cannot add a domain keyword that would block your own site. For example, if our site is &#8220;wpmaintainer.com&#8221; and we enter the domain keyword &#8220;wp&#8221; â€“ the plugin will block any links from our site that point to other pages on the site.</p>\n"
