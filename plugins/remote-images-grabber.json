Sample: to grab http://example.com/some-dir/files/my-image.png which is described as &lt;img src=&#8221;files/my-image.png&#8221; on http://example.com/some-dir/some-page.html you should add http://example.com/some-dir/ into the Base URL field.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I enter an URL of a page that has pictures but the plugin grab nothing.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Look through HTML of that page, maybe it is a case described above.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>On the &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; page in your wordpress admin panel, specify the post ID where images should be attached to (if such post doesn&#8217;t exist, images stay unattached), paste the list of images URLs you wish to grab (separated by spaces or one link by line) or simply paste a piece of html-code, and push &#8216;Go!&#8217; button. That&#8217;s all! Or, instead of the above, you may put into the next text field an URL of a web page that links to images.</li>\n<li>The 2nd way is to select &#8216;Images Grabber&#8217; tab in an upload box, then grabbed images are being attached to the currently edited post automatically. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I recommend to use <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>[gallery]</code></a> or other gallery shortcode in the post where you attach images, then they will appear in the post automatically.</p>\n<p>The plugin has no options but one can specify some parameters before running grabber script: minimum and maximum file size, grab images from <code>&lt;img src=</code> and <code>&lt;a href=</code> html-tags or only URLs listed as plain text, and base URL for images presented as relative paths.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
