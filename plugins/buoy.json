        "description": "<p>Buoy is a decentralized 9-1-1 alternative built for and by people who are not well served by existing emergency response services. Buoy makes it easy to tell your friends where you are and what you need. Buoy&#8217;s goal is a world where anyone in distress always has the option to turn to people they trust for support, rather than being forced to rely on people they don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Buoy is not a traditional &#8220;app&#8221; that you can download in the app store, but rather a system for adding crisis response and emergency dispatch services to existing websites. With Buoy, community groups, activist organizations, and social support service providers can quickly connect people who need help with trusted friends, family members, advocates, and other allies who can help them. It is designed to be community owned and operated, so each instance of Buoy can be customized to the unique needs or the organization or community group that hosts it.</p>\n<p>Whether you are a group of street medics coordinating with each other during an action, citizen journalists or copwatchers watching each other&#8217;s backs, domestic violence survivor support advocates, or even single parents picking each others’ kids up from school, Buoy helps you get and give peer-based mutual aid to your friends and comrades.</p>\n<p><em>For service providers</em></p>\n<p>Anyone with a WordPress-powered website or blog can add the Buoy software (a 1-click automatic install) to their website, enabling the site&#8217;s membership to provide peer-based mutual-aid to one another. Moreover, legal aid service providers, domestic, dating, and intimate partner violence prevention advocates, shelters, social groups, alternative medical and mental health collectives, and others can offer members of their community one-click emergency access to a network of trusted peers and/or on-call emergency responders.</p>\n<p><em>For victims and survivors</em></p>\n<p>Buoy makes it easy to tell your friends where you are and what you need, even in the most dangerous or frightening scenarios. Tapping a single button will immediately notify the people you trust most that you need their help, give them a map showing your exact location, and even helps them coordinate with one another to quickly figure out how to help you best. With Buoy and a smartphone, you are never more than one button press away from the people you trust most. (We are even working to support old-school flipfones!)</p>\n<p>You do not need to download or install special software to use Buoy. Simply bookmark a page with your smartphone&#8217;s built-in Web browser to gain instant access to your personal emergency response team. Quickly send them your location with a pre-defined custom message, write a custom message, or schedule a timed alert (like a &#8220;safe call&#8221;) for some time in the future.</p>\n<p>The people you select as your emergency contacts (&#8220;response team&#8221;) will get a notification showing them your location in the real world as well as the locations of any other responders to your call for help. If it&#8217;s safe for you to do so, you can now coordinate with all responders in a live chat room, or responders can coordinate amongst themselves about how best to help you if you are unresponsive.</p>\n<p><strong>See the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buoy/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">screenshots</a> for an example walkthrough of how Buoy works.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/List-of-Buoy-enabled-websites\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find a Buoy-enabled web site.</a><br />\nIf you like this plugin, <strong>please consider <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=meitarm%40gmail%2ecom&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=Inline%20Google%20Spreadsheet%20Viewer%20WordPress%20Plugin&amp;item_number=inline%2dgdocs%2dviewer&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">making a donation</a> for your use of the plugin</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26redirect%3Dtrue%26sort%3Drelevancerank%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dbooks%26ref%3Dntt%255Fathr%255Fdp%255Fsr%255F2%26field-author%3DMeitar%2520Moscovitz&amp;tag=maymaydotnet-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">purchasing one of Meitar&#8217;s web development books</a> or, better yet, contributing directly to <a href=\"http://Cyberbusking.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meitar&#8217;s Cyberbusking fund</a>.

        "faq": "<p>Read <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the full FAQ</a> on our wiki. Below is a subset of the most common questions we get about Buoy.</p>\n\n<h4>Where do I get Buoy? I don&#8217;t see it in the app store.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Buoy is not an app, it is a tool that adds emergency dispatch services to websites. To use Buoy, you must have a user account on some community-run website, such as those provided by addiction recovery support groups, domestic violence shelters, local volunteer medical collectives, or similar.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know of any such groups, take a look through our <a href=\"https://github.com/betterangels/buoy/wiki/List-of-Buoy-enabled-websites\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">List of Buoy-enabled websites</a>. Maybe there&#8217;s a group near you!</p>\n<p>If not, consider starting such a group in your town. Reach out to collectives such as <a href=\"http://wecopwatch.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cop Watch</a>, a local legal aid service provider, <a href=\"http://criticalresistance.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Critical Resistance</a>, <a href=\"http://smartrecovery.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SMART Recovery</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ncadv.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">NCADV</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.blackcrosscollective.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Black Cross Health Collective</a>, or other similar organizations and ask them how you can start a chapter in your neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Then get in touch with the <a href=\"https://betterangels.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Better Angels</a> (that&#8217;s us!) and we&#8217;ll help you install and set up Buoy for your community.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Buoy track my location?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Buoy never tracks or record your movements. The only time Buoy knows where you are is when you press the emergency alert button. Buoy then sends this information only to the people you added to your emergency response team.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I only use Buoy in a real emergency?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although Buoy is designed to be useful in even the most phsyically high-risk situations such as domestic or dating violence abuses, kidnapping, home invasion, and other frightening scenarios, you can use Buoy however you want. We particularly encourage you to use Buoy when you feel like your situation may not rise to the level of calling 9-1-1 or when you feel like the presence of police officers will not improve the situation.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you feel you are being followed as you walk home on campus, use Buoy. Your friends will be able to watch your location on their screens and quietly chat with you as you walk home, ensuring you reach your destination safely.</li>\n<li>If you or someone you are with feels suicidal, or has a bad trip, and you don&#8217;t want cops showing up to your house but need assistance, use Buoy. Responders will be notified of your physical location and will be able to coordinate a response action with you and with each-other in real time without ever notifying the authorities of the situation.</li>\n<li>If you are with a group at an outing such as a hike or a large amusement park and get separated from your group, use Buoy. Each group member will be able to see one another&#8217;s current location on a map, can easily coordinate where to meet up, and can even access turn-by-turn directions to one another&#8217;s locations with one tap of your finger.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",

Further, if your phone is destroyed or confiscated during an incident, a copy of the media you uploaded will still be saved on your Buoy's server, in a remote, safer location.
