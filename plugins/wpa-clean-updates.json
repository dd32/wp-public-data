So no, it will not slow WordPress down.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20update%20management%20plugins%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with update management plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It has been tested by the guys over at Digishock.com and WebsiteNazorg.nl on various platforms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20security%20considerations%20are%20there%20in%20using%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat security considerations are there in using this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is handling no user or system input/output. It does nothing with the database. It does however avoid your server from installing unneeded themes and so limiting the codebase on the server. Limiting the code base is a security best practice.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20there%20be%20future%20updates%20to%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWill there be future updates to this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we will release a new version every 10 months. A new version will not mean new code. It is just to avoid the plugin being marked as abandoned. New code will only be added if WordPress needs it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
