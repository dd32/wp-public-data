        "description": "<p>ScottCart is a free WordPress eCommerce plugin that allows you to sell anything, anywhere.

In order to collect payments using PayPal you will need to have a PayPal account and enter your account Email or Merchant ID on the Payments tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20use%20pages%3F'>\nDoes the plugin use pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When this plugin is installed it automatically created 5 pages. The Shop, Cart, Account, Order Cancelled, and Purchase Confirmation pages. In these pages is a shortcode which is used by the plugin to display information on that page. You may wish you include these pages in your theme menu. Products will automatically appear on the Shop Page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20create%20a%20new%20product%3F'>\nHow can I create a new product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create a product on the Products page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20view%20my%20orders%20inside%20the%20wordpress%20dashboard%3F'>\nCan I view my orders inside the WordPress dashboard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, When someone purchases your product, you will be able to see their order on the Orders page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20an%20ssl%20certificate%20required%3F'>\nIs an SSL certificate required?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ScottCart can function without one just fine, making it easy to set up in a testing or development environment. We still strongly recommend you have an SSL certificate for your production web site, both for security and for the peace of mind of your customers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20themes%20work%20with%20easy%20digital%20downloads%3F'>\nWhat themes work with Easy Digital Downloads?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any properly written theme will work with ScottCart.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='getting%20a%20404%20error%3F'>\nGetting a 404 error?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a product, you need to resave your permalink structure. Go to Settings &gt; Permalinks and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='orders%20placed%20through%20paypal%20not%20showing%20in%20the%20admin'>\nOrders placed through PayPal not showing in the admin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using a firewall that is blocking PayPal.com, that can cause this issue. Also if your WordPress is installed in a different folder then this issue you can happen. Please contact us if you continue to have problems.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
