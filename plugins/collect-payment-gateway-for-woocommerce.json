There is a selection of options on the screen.</li>\n<li>Read what each one does below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enable/Disable</strong> – Check this checkbox to Enable Collect on your store’s checkout</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> – This will represent <strong>Collect</strong> on your list of Payment options during checkout. It guides users to know which option to select to pay with Collect. <strong>Title</strong> is set to “Collect” by default, but you can change it to suit your needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Description</strong> – This controls the message that appears under the payment<br />\nfields on the checkout page. Use this space to give more details to customers about what <strong>Collect</strong> is and what payment methods they can use with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test Mode</strong> – Check this to enable test mode. When selected, the fields in step six will say “Test” instead of “Live.” Test mode enables you to test payments before going live. The orders process with test payment methods, no money is involved so there is no risk. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Payment Option</strong> – Select how Collect Checkout displays to your customers. A popup displays Collect Checkout on the same page, while Redirect will redirect your customer to make payment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>API Keys</strong> – The next two text boxes are for your Collect API keys, which you can get from your Collect Dashboard. If you enabled Test Mode in step four, then you’ll need to use your test API keys here. Otherwise, you can enter your live keys.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> to update the settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some account might be experiencing poor network connections, which can sometimes affect order status updates after a transaction, we strongly recommend that you set a <a href=\"https://app.collect.africa/settings/keys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Webhook URL</a> on your Collect dashboard. This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we’ll send a notification to the <strong>Webhook URL</strong>, which will update the order and mark it as paid. You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your Collect dashboard under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>API Keys &amp; Webhooks</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>If you do not find <strong>Collect</strong> on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ve checked the “Enable/Disable” checkbox</li>\n<li>You’ve entered your API Keys in the appropriate field</li>\n<li>You’ve clicked on Save Changes during setup</li>\n</ul>\n",
