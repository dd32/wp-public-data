        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On &#8220;shutdown&#8221; (after WP finishes a request), it checks a timer. If it has been 3 minutes since it last checked, it looks at all the scheduled posts, and runs them through a WordPress core function that either publishes them (if they should have gone out already), or re-schedules them, if their schedule has somehow gone away.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20post%20missed%20its%20schedule%20anyway%21'>\nMy post missed its schedule anyway!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Normally, the plugin checks every 3 minutes. So it&#8217;s possible the post might go out a few minutes late. I hope this isn&#8217;t the end of the world. It&#8217;s a tradeoff between this and checking all the time. Additionally, if a check determines that there are currently no scheduled posts, it won&#8217;t look again for 15 minutes. Most people schedule posts more than 15 minutes in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20those%20times%3F'>\nCan I change those times?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. There are filters: <code>scheduled_post_guardian_delay_minutes</code> and <code>scheduled_post_guardian_stretch_delay_minutes</code>. Return a different number than 3 and 15 for those if you like.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
