This is often due to a security issue or a violation of the community standards.  How long the plugin will remain in this state has a couple of factors to it, but in general no longer than 60 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Closed</strong> means the plugin is permanently closed.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20updated%20a%20plugin%2C%20why%20hasn%27t%20it%20changed%20in%20the%20report%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve updated a plugin, why hasn&#8217;t it changed in the report?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To keep the traffic to wordpress.org to a minimum, the plugin will only update the data daily.
