On July 1, 2023, standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new data. This means that any Universal Analytics data that you&#8217;re using in Google Ads campaigns will start to degrade and your ad performance may be impacted.

Instead, Analytics Cat &#8211; Google Analytics simply focuses on letting you add your Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) Code to your site in less than 2 minutes, without slowing your site down.</p>\n<h4>Which features does Analytics Cat &#8211; Google Analytics have?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) tracking code to your WordPress site with ease.</li>\n<li>Hide your Google Analytics tracking code from logged-in users so you don&#8217;t pollute your data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How to use Analytics Cat &#8211; Google Analytics?</h4>\n<p>There are multiple ways to add the Google Analytics tracking code to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p><strong>1.

Pasting your Google Analytics script into a header/footer script plugin</strong><br />\nThis is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes &#8220;header script plugins&#8221; aren&#8217;t built from the ground-up to support Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>What this means is that :<br />\na) These plugins lack Google Analytics-specific functionality.<br />\nb) These plugins will not adapt if Google Analytics changes again. Since Analytics Cat is a dedicated Google Analytics WordPress plugin, we&#8217;ll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes to Google Analytics.<br />\nc) These plugins usually don&#8217;t support hiding your Google Analytics code from logged-in users.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Using Some Other Google Analytics WordPress Plugin</strong><br />\nThere are some good Google Analytics plugins out there, but many of them are bloated, have too many settings and are slow.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll love Analytics Cat &#8211; Google Analytics Cat iff what you want is a simple, reliable Google Analytics plugin,</p>\n<h4>Does Analytics Cat &#8211; Google Analytics Plugin work with Universal Analytics?</h4>\n<p>Yes.
