We spent considerable time analyzing existing code and used some speed enhancing tricks to make this version much, much faster.  Since our clients were extremely happy with the results, we decided to make this available to the general public at no cost.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I tell if this is actually making a difference in performance?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can try this in place of the original widget, or use the two side by side.  A good test is to time how quickly you can switch from month to month in each widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I discover an issue?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feel free to email us and we will try to help.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
