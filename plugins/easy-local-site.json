This will mean that it is always activated, even after migrating a database from a production site where the plugin is not installed/activated, so you don&#8217;t have to remember to manually activate it.</p>\n<h4>The WP_LOCAL_DEV constant method</h4>\n<p>You must use the WP_LOCAL_DEV constant method as outlined by Mark Jaquith: <a href=\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/wordpress-local-dev-tips/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">markjaquith.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/wordpress-local-dev-tips</a></p>\n<p>If the WP_LOCAL_DEV constant is not defined this plugin will do nothing. This means you can safely put it in your mu-plugins folder and include it in your Git repository on a production site.</p>\n<h4>Overriding outgoing emails</h4>\n<p>To override outgoing emails, you must define WP_LOCAL_EMAIL in local-config.php as follows:</p>\n<p>define( &#8216;WP_LOCAL_EMAIL&#8217;, &#8216;me@myemailaddress.com&#8217; );</p>\n<h4>Download from GitHub</h4>\n<p>You can also download this plugin from GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/lumpysimon/wp-easy-local-site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/lumpysimon/wp-easy-local-site</a></p>\n",
