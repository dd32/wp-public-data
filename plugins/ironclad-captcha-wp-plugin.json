I want to type there something different. How can I do this?<br />\nA: Log into your Iconclad CAPTCHA account (where you got your API-key), click on Settings link next to the name of your site/blog and change this or several other settings.</p>\n<p>Q: My captcha appears under &#8220;Send comment&#8221; button. Is it possible to move it ABOVE that button?<br />\nA: Yes, but due to some limitations of WP you should do it by hand. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s quite easy! Open &#8220;wp-content/themes&#8221; folder of your WP installation and locate folder with the name of the color theme you use in your WP now. Then locate &#8220;comments.php&#8221; file inside that folder and change the following string:</p>\n<p>ID); ?&gt;</p>\n<p>You should move it several lines upper, to make it right below the line with &lt; textarea &gt; definition. Save the file and upload it to your WP site if you edited it locally.</p>\n<p>In some versions of WordPress these lines are in wp-includes/comment-template.php file. You should move specified lines above, right before &#8216;</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>p class=&#8221;form-submit&#8221;&gt;&#8217;.</p>\n"
