The WordPress mobile app should tell you that &#8220;XML-RPC services are disabled on this site&#8221; if the plugin is activated.</li>\n<li>Use the curl command to send an XML-RPC request to your site. If the response contains &#8220;XML-RPC services are disabled on this site&#8221; then the plugin is working properly and WordPress will not send data back to XML-RPC requests.</li>\n<li>Try the XML-RPC Validator, written by Danilo Ercoli of the Automattic Mobile Team &#8211; the tool is available at <a href=\"https://xmlrpc-check.hostpress.me/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://xmlrpc-check.hostpress.me/</a>.
