This is not optimal but still works. If you have a custom theme you can add the hook below the body yourself or request an update on your theme at the shop that created it. Eitherway this plugin will work on the themes that have or do not have the hook.

Just pop in the ID and you are good to go!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes it work with Google Tagmanager?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. Just copy and paste the ID in the field and add the function below the  tag. Newer templates have a hook there so that works even better.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes it work with Google Analytics?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. Just copy and paste the ID in the field and you are good to go.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes it work with all themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Note that there are themes that don&#8217;t have the &#8216;wp_body_open();&#8217; hook below the body tag in the header.php.<br />\nFor these (older) themes there is the option to put the second half of the Google Tagmanager code in the footer.<br />\nThis is not optimal but still works.
