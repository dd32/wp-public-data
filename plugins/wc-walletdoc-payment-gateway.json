        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20i%20require%20an%20ssl%20certificate%20on%20my%20store%3F'>\nDo I require an SSL certificate on my store?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. An SSL certificate must be installed on your store in order to use the Walletdoc payment gateway.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20reserve%20payments%20and%20charge%20the%20card%20later%3F'>\nCan I reserve payments and charge the card later?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. If you disable &#8220;Capture&#8221; Walletdoc will reserve the funds and change the order status to &#8220;On Hold&#8221;. You can then adjust the order value by removing or adding items to the order (as long as the final amount is less than or equal to the reserved amount). Once you are ready to charge the order simply change the order status to &#8220;Processing&#8221; or &#8220;Completed&#8221;. Walletdoc will then capture the amount. Do note that reserved funds that are not captured within 7 days are automatically reversed by Walletdoc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20bank2bank%3F'>\nWhat is Bank2Bank?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Bank2Bank is an EFT payment method that allows customers to pay using all major South African Banks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20saved%20cards%20work'>\nHow do saved cards work\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the &#8220;Saved Card&#8221; setting is enabled, Walletdoc will provide your registered customers with an option to store their cards for future purchases. The card is tokenised with Walletdoc and stored securely in our card vault. If the card is a Visa or Mastercard, Walletdoc will tokenise the card directly with Visa and Mastercard respectively. The next time your customer checks out of your store he will be able to chose a card he previously stored for a quick checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20visa%20and%20mastercard%20tokenisation'>\nWhat are the benefits of Visa and Mastercard tokenisation\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Walletdoc will attempt to tokenise all Visa and Mastercard cards stored on Walletdoc directly with Visa or Mastercard. Once a card is tokenised, Walletdoc no longer holds the original card number of the customer, but instead retains a secure token representing the card. The token can only be used for processing payments for your store. Besides the security benefit, if a card expires or is lost or stolen, the bank will update Walletdoc with the details of the replaced card. The token will continue to work which means your customer will not have to add his new card. This provides a higher rate of conversion for your store.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%203d%20secure%20version%202'>\nWhat are the benefits of 3D Secure Version 2\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With 3D Secure version 2 banks are able to analyse information on the users browser or mobile device. The banks can then do a risk assessment and if the risk is deemed low they can skip the requirement of customer authentication (such as OTP). This is called a frictionless transaction and provides a richer experience for your customer, provides you a higher rate of conversion and still gives your the same chargeback protection as a normal 3D Secure transaction.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
