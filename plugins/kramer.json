The blog post linking to yours does not need to ping your post for the comment to be shown in your weblog. This means that by default you can carry out conversatios between blogs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a limitation on using Technorati?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the limit is 500 queries per day, per API key. It is recommended that the cache time is set to 4-6 hours.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the cache work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The cache time is the time taken between reqests to Technorati for new inbound links for a post, for each post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do can I include inbound links for a page in my sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply edit your template, and at the position that you want the list of inbound links place <code>&lt;?php kramer_inbound(); ?&gt;</code></p>\n</p>\n\n"
