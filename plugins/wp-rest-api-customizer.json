Few of them might be used by your theme, other plugins are even your app.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20enabled%20post%20id%20from%20post%20url%20custom%20route%2C%20how%20to%20use%20it%3F'>\nI enabled POST ID from POST URL custom route, how to use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By enabling it, you created a new route. Send a GET request to https://www.geekdashboard.com/wp-json/wp-rest-api-customizer/url-to-id and add your post url in header with key &#8216;url&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20enabling%20comments%20without%20authorization%20is%20safe%3F'>\nIs enabling comments without authorization is safe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is completely safe. But make sure you enabled comment moderation in WordPress settings -&gt; Discussion to prevent spam comments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20use%20of%20adding%20featured%20image%20urls.%20i%27m%20already%20getting%20image%20id%27s%3F'>\nWhat is the use of adding featured image urls. I&#8217;m already getting image id&#8217;s?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on your requirements. Assume you&#8217;re showing 20 recent posts with title and feature image in your Android application. By addig featured image url&#8217;s to JSON object, you&#8217;re saving 20 requests and ultimately saving user&#8217;s data, your site bandwidth and improving app performance. Presto!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20my%20own%20routes%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I create my own routes with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently our plugin didn&#8217;t support creating own routes. We are planning it in next updates. However if you need a custom router which is useful to others (like gettig post id from post url), ask us via support. We&#8217;ll add it and update the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20contribute%20to%20wp%20rest%20api%20customizer%3F'>\nHow can I contribute to WP Rest API Customizer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can get in touch with from our <a href=\"https://www.geekdashboard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blog</a> or <a href=\"https://www.geekdashboard.com/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a> page and we&#8217;ll have a discussion.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
