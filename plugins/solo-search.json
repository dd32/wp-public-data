Never dull. Please subscribe), I often use short, single names for pages. &#8220;About&#8221;, &#8220;Blog&#8221;, that kind of thing. For my posts, however, I use something long and descriptive. For example, &#8220;See what the stars of The Banana Splits look like now. Number 3 will amaze you&#8221;. For this reason, I have exact matching switched off for pages but on for posts &#8211; if someone types in that post title than they are very welcome to have it served straight up to them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='for%20the%20%22exact%20match%22%20feature%2C%20it%20only%20works%20for%20posts%20and%20pages.%20can%20i%20add%20additional%20taxonomies%3F'>\nFor the &#8220;exact match&#8221; feature, it only works for posts and pages. Can I add additional taxonomies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>What kind of monster are you?</p>\n<p>But, seriously, not at the moment. But if this interests you, please let me know!</p>\n</p>\n\n",

It&#8217;s a big change, so required a bigger jump in revision, despite there being no visible changes.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Also added some spit and polish across the code and README more generally</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added an uninstaller file to get rid of any cruft when you remove the plugin (not that you&#8217;d ever do that of course!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved code quality</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: You didn&#8217;t ask for it, but you got it anyway &#8211; the search will now display content if you search for an exact match on the title</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Settings now allow you to turn each of the options on and off, to your likely. You can switch them all of, if you want, although that&#8217;s a waste of an active plugin, if we&#8217;re being honest</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a link in the plugin meta so you can go straight to the settings. Because I care</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Various tweaks and fiddles, some of which may even be legal</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Fixed text domain</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
