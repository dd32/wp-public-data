You do this by asking Facebook for a authentication token via the link at the top of the settings page.  Enter that token into the form and save the page settings (or save the page settings after you also enable Twitter).  If you didn&#8217;t do step 4 you can also do that here once you&#8217;ve submitted the authentication token.  Clicking on &#8220;share info with facebook&#8221; is the same things as step 4.</li>\n<li>Choose if you want all posts to post to your Facebook feed by default.</li>\n<li>Choose how many characters of your post (including title) you want as the &#8220;comment&#8221; part of the link post.  Defaults to 0. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Twitter Instructions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To enable Twitter click on the &#8220;enable Twitter&#8221; checkbox.</li>\n<li>Enter your twitter username and password.</li>\n<li>Choose if you want all posts to post to your twitter feed by default</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Social Networks</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To enable links at the bottom of your blog posts click on &#8220;Enable links for posting to socialmedia blog and bookmark sites.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Next click on the networks you want to have links for.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now when any users posts a blog post on your WordPress blog it will automatically be posted to Facebook and/or Twitter.</p>\n<p>Give it a try.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q. Does Full Circle support multiple user bolgs.<br />\nA. No, current version is meant for blogs that are typically one user.  Using it on a multiple user blog would only post to one twitter account, and one Facebook account.  v2.0 may have support for multiple user blogs, but I have not yet decided that yet.</p>\n<p>Q. Does Full Circle support php4<br />\nA. No, trying to use this pluggin with php4 results in php errors.  Full Circle will not be supporting  php4.</p>\n",
