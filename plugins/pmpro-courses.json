In most cases, you will only need to have one module active at a time. Navigate to Memberships &gt; Courses to choose from the following settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Default Module: Use the built-in course and lesson custom post types to build a basic e-learning component in your WordPress membership site.</li>\n<li>LearnDash: Enable the LearnDash module to enable course protection by membership level for your courses in the LearnDash LMS.</li>\n<li>LifterLMS: Enable the LifterLMS module to enable course protection by membership level for your courses in LifterLMS.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: This Add On does not include any update scripts to manage enrollment for existing members. For the LearnDash and LifterLMS modules, all members who have an existing membership level will not be automatically enrolled in courses. Course protection and enrollment is hooked in the level change event: only new members or members that cancel or change their level will be updated. You must manually add and remove current members from protected courses.</p>\n<p>The default (built-in) module does not rely on enrollment and will not require any update script.</p>\n",
