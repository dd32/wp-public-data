Unfortunately, this plugin works only with older versions of WP.<br />\nLater, I explored the plugin &#8216;<a href=\"http://rmarsh.com/plugins/highlight-comments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Highlight Author Comments</a>&#8216;, which highlights only comments of authors.<br />\nHighlight Comments is a plugin that combines Comment Hilite and Highlight Author Comments. Its goal is to work on current WP-versions.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
