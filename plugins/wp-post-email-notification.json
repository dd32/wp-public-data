The widget uses ajax to submit the entered e-mail address.</p>\n<p>Within the administration area you get a reactive and clean overview of all subscribers and some additional settings, that fits perfectly into the user-experience of WordPress. You can delete or add subscribers manually as well as change the subject and body of the notification-email.</p>\n<p>Sending the emails is regulated in jobs.
