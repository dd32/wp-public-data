        "description": "<p>This plugin helps answer the question what day and month this is, in natural language.</p>\n<p>It is a plugin that enables you to have displayed anywhere in your site any date in a format that temporarily overrides just at the spot where you use it,the default format you have set through your dashboard.  Specifically, the date displayed using this, will have the day and month fully spelled out.</p>\n<p>It is an internationalised function that returns a date with its day and month named in the language determined by the locale that prevails when the shortcode is used, saving you the need to do an explicit translation.</p>\n<p>To apply it, use the shortcode <strong>[dayspell when=&#8217;yyyy-mm-dd&#8217;]</strong> where <strong>&#8216;when&#8217;</strong> is an <strong>optional</strong> parameter that you can use to supply a date you wish spelled.  If omitted, the value of &#8216;when&#8217; defaults to the current date. If used, &#8216;when&#8217; must be given a value in the format &#8216;yyyy-mm-dd&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The plugin will then give back a date with the day and month named.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for this came partly from the film &#8220;If it&#8217;s Tuesday, this must be Belgium&#8221;, released by United Artists, starring Suzanne Pleshette and Ian McShane, among others.</p>\n<h4>Why would you want to make use of such a functionality?</h4>\n<p>By means of this plugin you can have the current date inserted within the body of a page, a post or a widget.</p>\n<p>For another thing if, like me, you have set for the sake of expediency your WordPress implementation to date your posts and pages in a brief form such as 10/12/2021, that might be lacking in character for use in a communication to your readers. It could at times also lead to ambiguity. (e.g. is the foregoing date December 10 or October 12?).</p>\n<p>Then, as suggested above, using this plugin could be useful to emphasize the day and month when a particular set of circumstances would apply, in contrast to the date when you posted notification of that situation.</p>\n<p>In particular, you could apply this plugin to advise your readers in an unmistakable manner about when a certain status holds, to report when a milestone was achieved, or to warn of a deadline that is about due.</p>\n<h4>To use this plugin</h4>\n<p>Insert where you want the spelled-out date to appear this shortcode:</p>\n<p><em>[dayspell]</em></p>\n<p>This will cause to be displayed the current date as for example:</p>\n<p><em>Friday, January 8, 2021</em></p>\n<p>If there is a particular date you want to publish on your site, supply its value with the <strong>&#8216;when&#8217;</strong> parameter:</p>\n<p><em>[dayspell when=&#8217;yyyy-mm-dd&#8217;]</em></p>\n<h4>Example:</h4>\n<p>If you were to write in a post:</p>\n<p><em>This year Christmas occurs on [dayspell when=&#8217;2021-12-25&#8242;].</em></p>\n<p>It will result in the display at that place of the following:</p>\n<p><em>This year Christmas occurs on Saturday, December 25, 2021.</em></p>\n<h4>Caution</h4>\n<p>If you do supply a date via the &#8216;when&#8217; parameter, ensure that you always do so using the <strong>format &#8216;YYYY-MM-DD&#8217;</strong>. This means <strong>NO SLASHES, NO COLONS, NO COMMAS!</strong>  Anything used other than hyphens to delimit the year, month and day will result in the warning:</p>\n<p><em>A valid date in yyyy-mm-dd format is required</em></p>\n<p>You get this warning also in response to bad dates (e.g. 2021-02-30, 2021-13-25.)</p>\n<h4>More examples</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A restaurateur could prepare and publish ahead of time a menu of meals  for a given day with;</p>\n<pre><code> \"The  *soupe du jour* for [dayspell when='2021-01-16'] is minestrone\".\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will cause to be published;</p>\n<pre><code> \"The *soupe du jour* for Saturday, January 16, 2021 is minestrone\".\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An accountant might want to send his clients a reminder with:</p>\n<pre><code>   \"The  final deadline to electronically file your individual tax return for the year 2020 if you got an extension is [dayspell when='2021-10-15']!\" \n</code></pre>\n<p>which will result in:</p>\n<pre><code>   \"The final deadline to electronically file your individual tax return for the year 2020 if you got an extension is Friday, October 15, 2021!\"\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>International use</h4>\n<p>As the plugin operates on a multi-lingual basis, it will automatically produce a day and month name using the language that applies in your particular context. This last is usually determined by the locale that is set by the language you select in the &#8220;general&#8221; tab of the settings menu in your administrator dashboard.</p>\n<p>For example a blogger in France could in the last days of March write her readers a warning such as:</p>\n<pre><code>      \"Prenez garde aux farceurs le [dayspell when='2021-04-01']!\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will then be seen by her readers as:</p>\n<pre><code>      \"Prenez garde aux farceurs le jeudi 1 avril 2020!\"\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Living Fossil can use your Support</h4>\n<p>Please show your approval by giving this plugin a star rating.</p>\n<p>If you enjoyed this plugin and you believe that the added convenience to you is a fair trade-off against the typical cost of your next glass of beer or wine, then you passing on that to reward me with a donation would be much appreciated. It would also make up for all such glasses I missed when I relied on coffee alone to keep me alert over the many hours I toiled to learn PHP and how to build working plugins ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This file is part of day-spelled.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Day Spelled&#8217; is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Day Spelled&#8217; is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br />\nSee the GNU General Public License for more details.</p>\n<p>A copy of the license is included in the root of the plugin&#8217;s directory.<br />\nThe file is named <code>LICENSE</code>.</p>\n<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License.
