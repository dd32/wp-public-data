This is similar to the way direct messages work in Twitter.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that site administrators can always send private messages without requiring the recipient to follow them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I allow certain user IDs to be private messaged without needing them to follow the sender?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can!  Simply add the following line to /wp-config.php or /wp-content/plugins/bp-custom.php:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'BP_PM_RECIPIENT_WHITELIST', '1,2' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, anyone can send a message to user ID 1 and 2 without needing them to follow the sender of the message.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I noticed that the error message is in English!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is.  But fear not!  You can send me a translation file for inclusion in the next release of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
