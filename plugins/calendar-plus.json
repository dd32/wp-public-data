If you want multiple calendar categories (as example categories 1-4) in the Calendar use the shortcode {CALENDAR 1,2,3,4} and if only a single category as example:<br />\n{CALENDAR 2}<br />\nPlease do not confuse Calendar categories with Post categories. They are different. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Uninstalling:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Deactivate the plugin on the plugins page of your blog dashboard</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete the uploaded files for the plugin</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remove the text {CALENDAR ID} from the page you were using to show calendar, or delete that page</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
