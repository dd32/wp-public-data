Here&#8217;s how:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zQnWMGF6rY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=6&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Finale is built to empower store owners who want to run promotions and convert more visitors into buyers. It&#8217;s for those who don&#8217;t believe in &#8216;let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;ll buy someday&#8217; philosophy. Instead want to seize every opportunity to generate more orders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;This plugin is everything I was looking for and more. The best part is that all the settings are intuitive- I didn&#8217;t have to spend hours figuring things out. I could get started within minutes of installation. And yes, a big thumbs up for support, they ensure you win with the plugin.&#8221;<br />\n  -Phil de Gruchy Founder, Blue Lama</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Finale&#8217;s Lite Features</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Set Up Sales Between Two Fixed Dates and Time</a></strong><br />\nIn WooCommerce you cannot start a campaign at a set time. But Finale allows you to pick a time. This is great for running flash sales like happy hours, deals of the day (Wow Wednesdays, Tipsy Thursdays), prime time specials, lunch hour deals and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Run a Countdown Timer to Give Shoppers a Clear Deadline for Action</a></strong><br />\nMost shoppers wait until the last few hours to make their purchase. In fact a typical sales graph shows that 90% of sales happen on the big last day. It&#8217;s when the fear of missing out is at its peak. Make this insight into buyer psyche work in your favor.<br />\nUse Finale to set up stunning countdown timers on the product page to remind shoppers about the deadline. You&#8217;ll be surprised by the power of a subtle reminder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Set up a counter bar to show the real-time stock status </a></strong><br />\nVisualization is powerful. Don&#8217;t tell your visitors the number of items left in stock, show them. A counter bar shows the real time stock status and gives people a compelling reason to hurry up. It&#8217;s persuasive and moves as more and more people buy. Similar to Amazon&#8217;s counter bar on daily deals that says &#8216;x% of deal claimed&#8217;, it gives you the power to use scarcity with class!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Create rules to customize campaigns</a></strong><br />\nRule builder allows you to create your rules to customize campaigns. It makes the experience of using Finale hassle-free. No need to visit individual product pages to set up campaigns. Choose from 4 nifty rules to customize your campaigns. Set up campaigns: On certain hand-picked products, or all products in a specified product category, or chosen product type or only on products under or above a certain price point.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Finale: The Must Have Tool For Running Scarcity &amp; Urgency Led Promotions At Any Time of The Year</h3>\n<p><strong>Set up your deals of the day, clearance sales, end-of-season offers, early bird discounts, members-only offers, and festive campaigns in minutes.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Finale is a game changer. It&#8217;s one of the most effective sales-booster I&#8217;ve ever tried! It&#8217;s amazing how easy is to manage sales and display triggers that motivate customers to purchase more and come back to the store. Different sets of conditions and types of rules lead to impressive results. The outcome is almost unbelievable! Also the support is outstanding&#8230; Thanks, Daman you did a great job!&#8221;<br />\n  &#8211; Razvan Popescu</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Watch this video to set up your first promotion in 2 minutes.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MAKcGagngtI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>No matter what time of the year, people always need a push or a reason to make a decision.

Choose the start date/time, duration, pause period and number of recurrences.<br />\nThe campaign will start, pause and re-start as per your inputs. Never again log back in to re-start campaigns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Set up High-Converting Sticky Header &amp; Footer</a></strong><br />\nAnnounce new campaigns in style. Put up urgency-triggering elements like the sticky header/footer on your store. Introduce new arrivals, announce campaigns, category-wide or store-wide discounts, time-limited offers with class. Increase click-through rate to the relevant product pages/ category pages with offers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Display Countdown Timer In Your Email Campaigns &amp; More</a></strong><br />\nGrab the shortCodes and display these visually compelling countdown timers or counter bars on dedicated landing pages, blog posts, pop-ups and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Generate buzz for upcoming products</a></strong><br />\nLift curtains off new products in style. Set up a countdown timer on upcoming products and hide the ‘Add to Cart&#8217; button during the waiting period. Set it to become auto-visible as soon as the counter strikes zero.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Maximize conversions through Smart Events</a></strong><br />\nInstruct Finale to execute decisions based on real-time status. Bump up discounts when the campaign expiry time is close. Or increase the prices of products when remaining stock is little. Or bump up total units when few items are left in stock. You can even use Events to offer Early Bird Discounts (limit discounts to the first set of buyers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Embed Shortcodes</a></strong><br />\nFinale has 3 short codes for your campaigns (countdown timer, counter bar and custom text). Grab these short codes and embed them in your site and also in emails. Think dedicated landing pages, blog posts, urgency-inducing emails etc. Great for flash sales, festive campaigns, new launches and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Finale Deal Pages</a></strong><br />\nList all your deals on a single page so that shoppers can discover and browse them easily.

Because there is a definite deadline attached to the task.</p>\n<p>We experience fear of missing out and fear of losing money on the tickets. This propels us into fast action.</p>\n<p>Similarly deadline-based campaigns and stock scarcity make people experience fear of missing out.</p>\n<p>This acts against their natural procrastination and nudges them to the finish line.</p>\n<h3>Why We Built Finale?</h3>\n<p>Most store owners run campaigns. But they are ineffective without awareness and definitive expiry deadline.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/woocommerce-discounts-deals/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">studied several top stores</a> to see what they were doing to clock high conversion rates.</p>\n<p>And discovered they had the master key to sales i.e. shopper psychology nailed.</p>\n<p>Here is what Top store owners do to increase conversions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run Time-bound flash sales</li>\n<li>Introduce Limited-edition products</li>\n<li>Announce Exclusive deals of the day and weekend offers</li>\n<li>Build hype around new launches</li>\n<li>Create awareness around festive campaigns through visual elements on the store</li>\n<li>Put up a faster shipment deadline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These well-planned campaigns help them set high sales records. We wanted to bring the same <a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/woocommerce-discounts-deals/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bag o&#8217; nifty conversion hacks</a> to small WooCommerce store owners.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s what led to Finale.</p>\n<p>Also, store owners like you told us they wanted us to build a plugin that could help them run recurring campaigns.</p>\n<p>They found it a tedious task to go back to the admin panel to re-start campaigns.</p>\n<p>These demands solidified the core features of Finale.</p>\n<h3>About The Team</h3>\n<p>Finale is backed and supported by a strong team of developers, support engineers and marketers from <a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">XLPlugins</a>. The team is constantly updating the plugin and ensuring its compatibility with the latest WooCommerce versions.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also coming up with new and varied use cases of Finale and creating short videos around it.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to educate store owners to make the most of our tools.</p>\n",

This is great for running flash sales like happy hours, deals of the day (Wow Wednesdays, Tipsy Thursdays), prime time specials, lunch hour deals and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Run a Countdown Timer to Give Shoppers a Clear Deadline for Action</a></strong><br />\nMost shoppers wait until the last few hours to make their purchase. In fact a typical sales graph shows that 90% of sales happen on the big last day. It&#8217;s when the fear of missing out is at its peak. Make this insight into buyer psyche work in your favor.<br />\nUse Finale to set up stunning countdown timers on the product page to remind shoppers about the deadline. You&#8217;ll be surprised by the power of a subtle reminder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Set up a counter bar to show the real-time stock status </a></strong><br />\nVisualization is powerful. Don&#8217;t tell your visitors the number of items left in stock, show them. A counter bar shows the real time stock status and gives people a compelling reason to hurry up. It&#8217;s persuasive and moves as more and more people buy. Similar to Amazon&#8217;s counter bar on daily deals that says &#8216;x% of deal claimed&#8217;, it gives you the power to use scarcity with class!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Create rules to customize campaigns</a></strong><br />\nRule builder allows you to create your rules to customize campaigns. It makes the experience of using Finale hassle-free. No need to visit individual product pages to set up campaigns. Choose from 4 nifty rules to customize your campaigns. Set up campaigns: On certain hand-picked products, or all products in a specified product category, or chosen product type or only on products under or above a certain price point.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Finale: The Must Have Tool For Running Scarcity &amp; Urgency Led Promotions At Any Time of The Year</h3>\n<p><strong>Set up your deals of the day, clearance sales, end-of-season offers, early bird discounts, members-only offers, and festive campaigns in minutes.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;Finale is a game changer. It&#8217;s one of the most effective sales-booster I&#8217;ve ever tried! It&#8217;s amazing how easy is to manage sales and display triggers that motivate customers to purchase more and come back to the store. Different sets of conditions and types of rules lead to impressive results. The outcome is almost unbelievable! Also the support is outstanding&#8230; Thanks, Daman you did a great job!&#8221;<br />\n  &#8211; Razvan Popescu</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Watch this video to set up your first promotion in 2 minutes.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MAKcGagngtI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>No matter what time of the year, people always need a push or a reason to make a decision.

Increase click-through rate to the relevant product pages/ category pages with offers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Display Countdown Timer In Your Email Campaigns &amp; More</a></strong><br />\nGrab the shortCodes and display these visually compelling countdown timers or counter bars on dedicated landing pages, blog posts, pop-ups and more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&amp;utm_campaign=wp-repo&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_term=Main\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Generate buzz for upcoming products</a></strong><br />\nLift curtains off new products in style.

Because there is a definite deadline attached to the task.</p>\n<p>We experience fear of missing out and fear of losing money on the tickets. This propels us into fast action.</p>\n<p>Similarly deadline-based campaigns and stock scarcity make people experience fear of missing out.</p>\n<p>This acts against their natural procrastination and nudges them to the finish line.</p>\n<h3>Why We Built Finale?</h3>\n<p>Most store owners run campaigns. But they are ineffective without awareness and definitive expiry deadline.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/woocommerce-discounts-deals/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">studied several top stores</a> to see what they were doing to clock high conversion rates.</p>\n<p>And discovered they had the master key to sales i.e. shopper psychology nailed.</p>\n<p>Here is what Top store owners do to increase conversions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run Time-bound flash sales</li>\n<li>Introduce Limited-edition products</li>\n<li>Announce Exclusive deals of the day and weekend offers</li>\n<li>Build hype around new launches</li>\n<li>Create awareness around festive campaigns through visual elements on the store</li>\n<li>Put up a faster shipment deadline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These well-planned campaigns help them set high sales records. We wanted to bring the same <a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/woocommerce-discounts-deals/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bag o&#8217; nifty conversion hacks</a> to small WooCommerce store owners.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s what led to Finale.</p>\n<p>Also, store owners like you told us they wanted us to build a plugin that could help them run recurring campaigns.</p>\n<p>They found it a tedious task to go back to the admin panel to re-start campaigns.</p>\n<p>These demands solidified the core features of Finale.</p>\n<h3>About The Team</h3>\n<p>Finale is backed and supported by a strong team of developers, support engineers and marketers from <a href=\"https://xlplugins.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">XLPlugins</a>. The team is constantly updating the plugin and ensuring its compatibility with the latest WooCommerce versions.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also coming up with new and varied use cases of Finale and creating short videos around it.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to educate store owners to make the most of our tools.</p>\n",
