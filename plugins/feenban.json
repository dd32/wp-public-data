        "faq": "<h4>Why the name FeenBan?</h4>\n<p>This plugin is called FeenBan because it was a special request from Michael W. Dean of the Freedom Feens Talk Radio Show. Find out more about Freedom Feens at http://freedomfeens.com.</p>\n<h4>Can you make it so non-logged in users can see all comments?</h4>\n<p>Not really because it all hinges on knowing who&#8217;s looking at the page. If the site doesn&#8217;t know the visitor&#8217;s identity, it&#8217;s not going to know if they&#8217;re shadowbanned. Aside from logging in, there are two common ways to identify the user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookies</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of these are so easy to work around. The shadowbanned user can discover their status if they happen to switch from laptop to phone between browsing sessions. They&#8217;ll then just make up a new alias and you&#8217;re back to square one.</p>\n",
