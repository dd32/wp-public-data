If a highlighted word does not appear in the excerpt it will attempt to create a better excerpt with the first searched word.</p>\n<h4>Custom Result Ordering</h4>\n<p>As well as ordering the first five results by popularity, you can choose to have results ordered by either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date created</li>\n<li>Date modified</li>\n<li>Title</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Advanced Search Form and Result Filtering</h4>\n<p>Display an advanced search form on the search results page to let users filter results by post type, post categories and tags.</p>\n<h4>Related Searches</h4>\n<p>If the current search has zero results you can display links to searches that look similar, which other users have tried.</p>\n",

In the search field type &#8220;Search Results Optimizer&#8221; and click the search button. Once you&#8217;ve found the plugin click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>To install Search Results Optimizer manually you need to download the newest version and transfer it to your website via FTP. For more information on this see the WordPress guide to <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Managing Plugins</a>.</p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;. That should return things to normal.</p>\n<h4>Activation</h4>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I add a search?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To add a search you just need to search your site like a user would. You&#8217;ll then find your new search in the dashboard.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are similar searches?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a search is stored it has some common filler words removed, so to Search Results Optimizer &#8220;example&#8221; looks the same as &#8220;another example&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is search result popularity?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the click-through rate for a specific search, calculated by dividing the number of times a result has been clicked by the number of times the result has been displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a way to manually group related searches and visualize result popularity across various search phrases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I contribute code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can submit a pull request via <a href=\"http://github.com/chrisgorvan/search-results-optimizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
