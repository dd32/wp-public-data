(Default is &#8220;Archives&#8221;.)</li>\n<li>Modify the CSS of the theme to taste, using any of the following styles:\n<ul>\n<li><code>STO_cma_archive_list</code> &#8211; this is applied to the <code>ul</code> tag that covers the entire calendar, apart from the title.</li>\n<li><code>STO_cma_line</code> &#8211; this applies to the <code>li</code> tag that represents each year.</li>\n<li><code>STO_cma_month</code> &#8211; this applies to each letter that represents a month.</li>\n<li><code>STO_cma_link</code> &#8211; this applies to each month that includes an article (and is, hence, a link.)</li>\n<li><code>STO_cma_empty</code> &#8211; this applies to each month that is empty (and is, hence, not a link)</li>\n<li><code>STO_cma_zwsp</code> &#8211; this applies to the whitespace gap between June and July. You may like to make it narrow.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code>.STO_cma_month a {\n    line-height: 1.2em;\n    padding: 0.2em;\n}\n\n.STO_cma_empty{\n    color: #4984E3;\n    line-height: 1.2em;\n    padding: 0.2em;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You almost certainly will want to change the example style to fit your theme.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>When would I use this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default WordPress archive listing takes one line for every month. Once your blog gets over about a one or two years old, this becomes unwieldy. That&#8217;s the point where you should consider this plug-in instead. This plug-in only takes two or three lines per year.</p>\n<p>When your blog gets to be about 4-6 years old, it will start to get unwieldy again. Hopefully, by then, we will have a solution for that too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I localise it for my language?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widget automatically uses the first character from each month based on your locale. So all you need to is override the default title to a word meaning &#8216;archives&#8217; in your language.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t tested it on any right-to-left languages. If this doesn&#8217;t work, let me know, and I will come up with a workaround.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
