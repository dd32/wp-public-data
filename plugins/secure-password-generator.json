Using certain special characters such as &#8220;]&#8221; within shortcode attributes causes problems, so these will be placed between the opening and closing tags of the shortcode. Using only the bare opening tag with no options will work fine, but it is recommended to use the full shortcode just to be safe and avoid any conflics in future versions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
