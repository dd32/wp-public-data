        "faq": "\n<h4>What are the requirements for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A recent version of WordPress. The plugin doesn&#8217;t do anything too fancy, so it probably runs on older versions too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you do WordPress consultation work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! I&#8217;m a Zend Certified PHP 5.3 engineer, and can customize or create WordPress plugins and themes. Visit http://www.mdpatrick.com or email me (see support, below) for more details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize what is displayed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses the css class &#8216;pmidcitationplus&#8217; in the div that surrounds the references block. If you would like, you may use this class to then style it by adding code to your <em>style.css</em> file of your theme folder.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit http://www.mdpatrick.com/pmidcitationplus/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For now, you may email me at <strong>dan atsymbolgoeshere mdpatrick.com</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
