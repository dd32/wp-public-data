        "faq": "\n<h4>How faster is my website going to be?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on how image-heavy that specific page is. As you can see from the screenshots the increase is substantial when the page is image-heavy on either size-wise or number-wise, as in big images or many images (or incrementally if both).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about search engines not being able to see the image before the page is loaded?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Guess what? They don&#8217;t &#8220;see&#8221; it and what really makes the difference is the alt attribute which will stay the same and untouched. Not to mention that if that claim was remotely true, the page speed increase outweights by far the former thesis.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
