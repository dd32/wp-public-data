        "faq": "\n<h4>Will my QR codes &#8220;expire&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The QR codes (and any underlying short URL&#8217;s) created by both free users and paid subscribers are permanent and will continue to function indefinitely, however temporary scan limits may apply as outlined below.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use your QR codes commercially?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. There are no restrictions on commercial use however temporary scan limits may apply as outlined below.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are your QR codes ad-free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Our QR codes are guaranteed 100% ad-free. If you see an ad after scanning one of our QR codes, your scanning app put it there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is a license required to create QR codes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The QR code is clearly defined and published as an open ISO standard. Denso Wave owns the patent rights on the QR code creation process, and the methods used to encode and create them, but has chosen not to exercise those rights. The term &#8220;QR code&#8221; itself is a registered trademark of Denso Wave Incorporated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do QR Codes Have To Be A Certain Size?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>People often ask how big or small (physically) a QR Code can be, well the simple answer is that there are no limits, a QR Code doesn’t have to be a set size and can be printed to any required size. The surface area of a QR Code is only limited by its environment and expected use combined with the resolution of the scanning device, there isn’t a technical limitation.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
