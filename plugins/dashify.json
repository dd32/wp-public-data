You can clear this filter at any time from the order view.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Improvements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The order date and time is entirely localized, including aspects like whether it should show AM/PM or use a 24-hour clock.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bug fixes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The order time was off by some hours if the WordPress time zone setting was set to anything other than UTC.

Re-releasing to try fixing missing download on WordPress.org.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.1.0 (2024-02-25)</h3>\n<h4>New features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Order trend graphs</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.0.0 (2024-01-21)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First release of Dashify!</li>\n</ul>\n"
