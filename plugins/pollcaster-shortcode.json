        "faq": "\n<h4>What is Pollcaster?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pollcaster.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pollcaster</a> is a web app that makes it possible for anyone to build beautiful, engaging polls. It&#8217;s the perfect way to share rich, immersive polls with your audience. <a href=\"http://www.pollcaster.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about Pollcaster</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is this plugin useful?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler. This plugin allows Authors to embed a poll on a WordPress page or post, whereas only Editors and Admins can copy and paste javascript embed codes.<br />\nA quick tip: with embed codes, you need to make sure to be in the &#8220;Text&#8221; tab of the writing area. If you are in the &#8220;Visual&#8221; tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes work in either text editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>But wait! I already have a poll using the old embed code! Will it still work on WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your poll will continue to function and look good doing it. Heck, if you want to keep using the old method for future polls, that’s fine. We just created the shortcode, because it’s cleaner and simpler.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it difficult to install and get setup?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope, it’s easy. Check out the Installation section for the details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do all the parameters in the code mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>id: the unique id of your poll on our system.</li>\n<li>width: the pixel or percentage width of your poll container. (&#8220;500px&#8221; or &#8220;100%&#8221; &#8211; Default: &#8220;100%&#8221;)</li>\n<li>height: the pixel or percentage width of your poll container. (&#8220;500px&#8221;, &#8220;100%&#8221;, &#8220;auto&#8221; &#8211; Default: &#8220;auto&#8221;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If that was over your head, don’t worry. Just install the plugin, copy the shortcode from Pollcaster after creating the poll, and paste it into WordPress. Your poll will look great.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get more help with Pollcaster?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’re happy to help.
