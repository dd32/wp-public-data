        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>For safety, we recommend you make a backup of your WordPress installation before using this plugin</li>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Click on the new menu item “I Agree! Popups“ and create your first popup.</li>\n<li>If you wish for your popup to appear across the entire site, check the <em>Sitewide</em> box under the <em>Appearance On Site</em> configuration option when creating or editing the popup.</li>\n<li>If you wish to assign your popup to an individual post or page, select the popup from the <em>I Agree!</em> dropdown when editing the post/page where you would like the popup to appear.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. What does I Agree! Popups do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. I Agree! allows for the creation of Terms and Conditions or Disclaimer popups for use on your WordPress site. You have the option to assign these popups to individual posts and pages, or choose a single one to appear &#8216;Sitewide&#8217;. If a user arrives at an area of your site where one of these popups is active, they will be required to acknowledge the popup and ‘agree’ to the content before they can continue.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. How customisable are the popups?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. We wanted to keep I Agree! as easy-to-use as possible, so all of the customisation options are available when creating and editing a popup. The customisable attributes include the transparent background layer colour, popup background colour, button background and text colours, the default &#8216;Agree&#8217; and &#8216;Disagree&#8217; button text, the &#8216;Disagree&#8217; redirect URL, and how long a visitor is remembered in their browser once they have acknowledged the popup’s content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Are the popups responsive?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes. Popups created with I Agree! are fully responsive and designed to play nicely with devices of all shapes and sizes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Does I Agree! remember a visitors choice the next time they visit?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes. If a visitor agrees to the terms or acknowledges a disclaimer, I Agree! stores a single, non-intrusive cookie in their browser to remember them for a time period specified by you. If they disagree, the visitor will be redirected to a URL of your choice.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Can I have more than one popup active at a time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, within reason:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are planning to use your popup(s) on individual posts and pages, you can have as many active as you like and assign them to whichever posts/pages you choose. However, a single post/page can only have one popup assigned to it at a time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you choose for a popup to appear &#8216;Sitewide&#8217;, this will take ultimate priority and override all the others. You can still create, edit and save as many as you like, but to use them on the site you will first need to disable the overriding popup by unchecking the &#8216;Sitewide&#8217; box and updating.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Can I assign one popup to multiple posts and pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, as many as you like!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Does this plugin require jQuery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, this plugin relies on jQuery. If the theme you&#8217;re using has been configured correctly, WordPress will include jQuery automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. What happens if a user has JavaScript disabled in their browser?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. The popups created with this plugin will not display without JavaScript enabled. However, all modern browsers have JavaScript enabled by default and just 2.4% of all web users browse without it. Unfortunately, this out of our (and your) hands.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
