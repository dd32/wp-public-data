        "description": "<p>Seriously Simple Podcasting is a top-rated podcasting plugin for WordPress, built by <a href=\"https://castos.com/podcast-hosting-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Castos</a>. Using the onboarding wizard to start a podcast, multiple player options to display your podcast on your site, and multiple free extension modules to supercharge your content, Seriously Simple Podcasting powers over 30K+ podcasts.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/560129506\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The plugin is, and will <em>always</em> remain, free to use. The only costs associated with using Seriously Simple Podcasting is if you choose to host your audio and video files with a dedicated podcast hosting provider, such as Castos. Similar to using a website hosting provider to keep your WordPress site fast and running smoothly, we recommend hosting podcast files with a dedicated provider. But remember, this isn’t required!</p>\n<p>Every plugin feature is fully functional, no matter who you choose as your podcast hosting provider. Seriously Simple Podcasting gives you maximum control over your content so you can start podcasting without limits.</p>\n<p>However, Castos is specifically designed to sync with Seriously Simple Podcasting to save you time in your publishing workflow. This means anytime you update your podcast’s information or upload a new episode file, the changes automatically sync with your Castos hosting account. You only have to do the action once, saving hours each week. Read more about how <a href=\"https://castos.com/how-castos-and-seriously-simple-podcasting-work-together/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Castos and Seriously Simple Podcasting work together</a>.</p>\n<p>With other podcast providers, you’ll need to make updates to your podcast’s RSS feed via your hosting provider account and again on WordPress to manually sync the information.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO SET UP SERIOUSLY SIMPLE PODCASTING</strong></p>\n<p>Getting started with Seriously Simple Podcasting is a seriously simple process. In just four steps, you’ll go from installing the plugin to your WordPress site to submitting a functioning RSS feed to every podcast directory.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ekj4W9hljA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin to your WordPress site.</li>\n<li>Begin the onboarding wizard, and create your first podcast.

    "description": "<p>Seriously Simple Podcasting is a top-rated podcasting plugin for WordPress, built by <a href=\"https://castos.com/podcast-hosting-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Castos</a>. Using the onboarding wizard to start a podcast, multiple player options to display your podcast on your site, and multiple free extension modules to supercharge your content, Seriously Simple Podcasting powers over 30K+ podcasts.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/560129506\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>The plugin is, and will <em>always</em> remain, free to use. The only costs associated with using Seriously Simple Podcasting is if you choose to host your audio and video files with a dedicated podcast hosting provider, such as Castos. Similar to using a website hosting provider to keep your WordPress site fast and running smoothly, we recommend hosting podcast files with a dedicated provider. But remember, this isn’t required!</p>\n<p>Every plugin feature is fully functional, no matter who you choose as your podcast hosting provider. Seriously Simple Podcasting gives you maximum control over your content so you can start podcasting without limits.</p>\n<p>However, Castos is specifically designed to sync with Seriously Simple Podcasting to save you time in your publishing workflow. This means anytime you update your podcast’s information or upload a new episode file, the changes automatically sync with your Castos hosting account. You only have to do the action once, saving hours each week. Read more about how <a href=\"https://castos.com/how-castos-and-seriously-simple-podcasting-work-together/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Castos and Seriously Simple Podcasting work together</a>.</p>\n<p>With other podcast providers, you’ll need to make updates to your podcast’s RSS feed via your hosting provider account and again on WordPress to manually sync the information.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO SET UP SERIOUSLY SIMPLE PODCASTING</strong></p>\n<p>Getting started with Seriously Simple Podcasting is a seriously simple process. In just four steps, you’ll go from installing the plugin to your WordPress site to submitting a functioning RSS feed to every podcast directory.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ekj4W9hljA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the Seriously Simple Podcasting plugin to your WordPress site.</li>\n<li>Begin the onboarding wizard, and create your first podcast.
