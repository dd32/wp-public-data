        "description": "<p>This is a simple parallax image plugin that uses the parallax.js script by pixelcog &#8211; http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/</p>\n<p>To insert your full width parallax image, simply use the [dd-parallax] shortcode.  Include text to be overlaid on the parallax between the open and close [/dd-parallax] code.  This plugin has been tested with WordPress 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 themes as well as a few themes that use Bootstrap.  I can&#8217;t guarantee that it will work with all themes, but it&#8217;s worth a shot.</p>\n<p>** Please note for WP 5.0 **<br />\nCurrently this plugin works, but the TinyMCE button only works with the classic editor.  A Gutenberg widget is in the works.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code>[dd-parallax img=\"imagename.jpg\" height=\"600\" speed=\"3\" z-index=\"-100\" mobile=\"mobile-image.jpg\" offset=\"true\"] \n\nText to be overlaid on the paralllax window\n\n[/dd-parallax]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Available parameters for use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>img &#8211; use the filename from the media library for this, not the full path.  Just use imagename.jpg or image.png. (You can also use a fully qualified URL)</li>\n<li>height &#8211; This is the height of the parallax window. The unit is in pixels.  Just enter a number</li>\n<li>speed [optional] (default = 2) An integer between 0 and 10.  The speed at which the parallax effect runs. 0 means the image will appear fixed in place, and 10 the image will flow at the same speed as the page content.</li>\n<li>z-index [optional] (default = 0) &#8211; The z-index value of the fixed-position elements. By default these will be behind everything else on the page.</li>\n<li>mobile [optional] &#8211; If you want a mobile fixed image for mobile display, choose a different image, otherwise it will select the full sized image from the parallax and make it a responsive image.</li>\n<li>offset [default = false] (options: &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221;) &#8211; This will pull the parallax content all the way to the left of your screen.  You can put the contents into a &#8220;container&#8221; class if you&#8217;re using bootstrap or just center the contents for horizontal centering.  On testing with the WordPress 2016 Theme, keep offset at False.  With Bootstrap Themes, I recommend using the &#8220;offset=&#8217;true'&#8221; parameter.</li>\n<li>position [optional] – (defaults to &#8216;Left&#8217;) This is analogous to the background-position-x css property. Specify coordinates as right, left, center, or pixel values (e.g. -10px 0px). The parallax image will be positioned as close to these values as possible while still covering the target element.</li>\n<li>text-pos [optional] &#8211; Default is &#8216;top&#8217; (to maintain compatibility with ver 1.6).  Available options are &#8220;top&#8221;, &#8220;center&#8221;, &#8220;bottom&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Admin-Settings page enables or disables the TinyMCE icon (if you don&#8217;t want it in your WP-Editor)</p>\n<h3>Demo</h3>\n<p>View a demo of this plugin <a href=\"https://www.duckdiverllc.com/parallax-image-plugin-demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n",

If you view the media library in &#8220;list&#8221; mode yourdomain.com/wp-admin/upload.php?mode=list &#8211; there you&#8217;ll see the filename with the .jpg or .png extension.<br />\n    * Second &#8211; If not the first answer.  Check your z-index.  Changing the z-index will adjust the layering of your screen with CSS, and may need to be changed depending on how your theme displays the backgrounds and colors.
