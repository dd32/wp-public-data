        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>First of all, you need to create adzones. Adzones are the places where advertisements will be displayed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In order to create an adzone, you need to go to the &#8220;Advertising-&gt;Adzones&#8221; section and click &#8220;Add a new adzone&#8221;</p>\n<p>In this section you need to specify the size of the zone, and you can also indicate on which devices this zone is available, you can specify the color, text, and many other settings.</p>\n<p>After you have created an adzone, you can place it anywhere on the site using a shortcode where you need to specify the adzone ID [ar_ad_manager_display_adzone id=&#8221;123&#8243;]</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You need to create an Advertiser. An advertiser is needed to be able to group and manage banner statuses.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if you want to show ads from Adsense, create an advertiser with the name &#8220;Adsense&#8221;, specify the script link for initializing banners https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxx</p>\n<p>Optionally, you can also specify the date and time, as well as the days of the week when you want to display advertising from this advertiser.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Next you need to create a Banner. Let&#8217;s continue with the Adsense example. For example, you want to install a banner on the title of an article where you have already placed the ad zone mentioned above.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For convenience, name the banner (Adaptive Google, under the title).</p>\n<p>Enter the advertiser you created in the previous step</p>\n<p>Specify the adzone you created in the first step.</p>\n<p>Enter the script in the &#8220;Banner script&#8221; section<br />\n    <code>php<br />\n&lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"<br />\n      style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\"<br />\n      data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx\"<br />\n      data-ad-slot=\"23434567\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;<br />\n&lt;script&gt;<br />\n      (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<br />\n&lt;/script&gt;</code><br />\nYou can also specify other settings, for example, specify a country if you want to display a banner only for specific countries or ID posts and categories if you want to display a banner for specific articles and categories.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Additional settings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Go to the &#8220;Dashboard&#8221; section, here you can set additional classes for adzones, if you want to set styles for your project, you can enable statistics. And also indicate the provider through which we will identify user countries</p>\n"
