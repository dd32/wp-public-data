You may try to run it inside some fields that are created by other plugins, e.g. inside tabs, accordions, lightboxes, etc. And with some of them it seems that H5P doesn&#8217;t work although it is, but the content is set to a height of 0 pixels.

In some cases, this plugin may be a feasible workaround at least.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;observer&#8221; mode, it will try to add a so called ResizeObserver to the container that holds the iframe with H5P content. That observer will send a resize pulse whenever the container changes in size, e.g. when it becomes visible. This should be a safe option just taking some extra resources.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;interval&#8221; mode, it will trigger H5P to resize in regular intervals which should let it be displayed in many cases. However, if they appear too frequent, they may cause the browser to stall. Choose the time interval wisely! Also, some H5P content types may break that way. The only way around this is then the &#8220;selector&#8221; mode.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;selector&#8221; mode, you need to determine a CSS selector that will identify all the elements that you interact with to display other contents, e.g. the tab buttons. If that selector is set in the plugin&#8217;s settings, it will trigger a resize pulse when that element is clicked. This way, you prevent stalling the browser or breaking H5P content types. Depending on how the other plugin was created, there may not ba a suitable CSS selector then.</p>\n<p>If necessary, you can use the <em>manage_h5presizepulse_options</em> capability to control access to the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE: H5P IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF H5P GROUP.
