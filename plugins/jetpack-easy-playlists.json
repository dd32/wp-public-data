        "description": "<p>Audio support in WordPress makes me cry. No native player, the fields in the Media library seem wrong for audio, and let&#8217;s not get into ID3 tag reading. The audio shortcode and player provided by Jetpack is a step in the right direction. However, the ability to directly create a player or playlist on a post/page from attached mp3s makes me sad again. Writing that shortcode is nasty business for anything beyond a file or two.</p>\n<p>And what about the [gallery] shortcode for images? So easy to round up all your attached pictures and display them all automagically. Why no love for [audio]?</p>\n<p>This plugin acts as a wrapper for Jetpack&#8217;s [audio] shortcode. It rounds up all the mp3s attached to your post/page and adds them as a playlist in the Jetpack player. Simply attach your mp3s to your post/page and use the shortcode &#8220;[jplaylist]&#8221; where you want your playlist</p>\n<p>JEP supports all the options that [audio] does, and now allows you to call up attachments from other pages/posts. You can also turn on &#8220;list mode,&#8221;  &#8220;random mode,&#8221; add download links, and even a pop-up button.</p>\n<p>Requires <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jetpack</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jamesfishwick.com/software/auto-jetpack-playlist/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Homepage</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>jetpack_easy_playlists.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the [jplaylist] shortcode to display a playlist of all the mp3s attached to your post</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I order the songs in the playlist?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on &#8220;Add Audio&#8221;. Go to &#8220;Gallery&#8221;. Drag and drop your mp3s into the order you want (it ignores images). The plugin goes by ascending order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the title and artist info for a mp3?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Song title corresponds to the &#8220;Title&#8221; field, and song artist corresponds to the, um, &#8220;Caption&#8221; field (I know this makes not a ton of sense, but I&#8217;m working with what I&#8217;m given folks). WordPress makes a laughable guess as to the title of the mp3 when you upload it. I recommend you change this info as soon as you upload inside the post/page. You can also change this in the media library.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about other audio formats than mp3?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry, other audio formats aren&#8217;t supported by Jetpack&#8217;s player.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about accessing the player options (color, size, etc)? Can I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can use any of those options. You can either use the janky pipe (|) method to connect everything like you&#8217;re told to with the [<em>audio</em>] shortcode, or you can use proper attributes.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>[jplaylist bgcolor=&#8221;000000&#8243; lefticon=&#8221;00ff00&#8243; righticon=&#8221;FF0000&#8243; animation=&#8221;no&#8221; loop=&#8221;yes&#8221;]</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>[jplaylist bgcolor=000000|lefticon=00ff00|righticon=FF0000|animation=no|loop=yes]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use attachments from a different page/post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. You use the &#8220;pid&#8221; attribute with a post/page id or permalink slug.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>[jplaylist pid=&#8221;173&#8243;]<br />\n[jplaylist pid=&#8221;software/jetpack-easy-playlists/&#8221;]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jamesfishwick.com/2012/jetpack-easy-playlists-update/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More details</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I turn on &#8220;list mode?&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use [jplaylist print=&#8221;ol&#8221;] for an ordered list,  [jplaylist print=&#8221;ul&#8221;] for an unordered one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make my playlist have links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[playlist linked=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I turn on &#8220;random mode?&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use [jplaylist random=&#8217;true&#8217;] for random song ordering.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add a pop-up button</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use [jplaylist  external=&#8221;true&#8221;] for a window with the dimensions 350&#215;500. If you want to customize the dimensions, then use a comma seperated width and height, like [jplaylist  external=&#8221;600,800&#8243;]. The playlist window will use the title of your post/page. It will also be linked to your default stylesheet so you can make it pretty. I leave it to the user to suss out the page structure of the pop-up.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you support my favorite player WordPess player plugin xyz?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe! You can talk to me about it at least.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m hitting an upload limit. Help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Welp, that&#8217;s nothing to do with the plugin or even WordPress. You can edit (or create) the php.ini file in your root directory to tweak this. Better yet, contact your host re: increasing your upload size.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
