They are used by businesses to increase customer engagement, provide a more personalised experience, and improve customer retention. Intelligent recommendations can be based on data from customer surveys, browsing behaviours, and purchase histories, as well as other sources of customer data. They are often implemented as part of a larger customer relationship management system, and have been shown to be effective in increasing customer satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue.</p>\n<p>Product recommendations are a critical aspect of any retailer’s ecommerce strategy.

Please note that if you have connected multiple websites on our platform, the Recommendation API Key for each website is different and cannot be used interchangeably.</p>\n<h4>Regarding the Data Server Key</h4>\n<p>By default, we do not generate a Data Server Key when establishing a connection with your website, so you cannot obtain it in the same way as the Recommendation API Key. Please contact us at <a href=\"https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/</a> to obtain it.</p>\n<h4>Regarding Test Mode</h4>\n<p>The main function of this plugin is to add a product recommendation component to your product detail pages. If you want to view the functionality of the recommendation component without disturbing buyers, enable Test mode. When Test mode is enabled, the recommendation component will only work when the browser address bar&#8217;s query parameter includes wd_demo=true.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When Test mode is enabled:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug</a>, the recommendation component will not be displayed.<br />\n<a href=\"https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug?wd_demo=true\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug?wd_demo=true</a>, the recommendation component will be displayed as usual.<br />\n<a href=\"https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug?else_search=else_value&amp;wd_demo=true\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug?else_search=else_value&amp;wd_demo=true</a>, the recommendation component will be displayed as usual.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When Test mode is disabled:</p>\n<p>The recommendation component will be displayed to buyers only if you have correctly filled in the Recommendation API Key, and your products have been initialized successfully.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Regarding Custom Data Server</h4>\n<p>By default, the functionality of recommendation components on all websites is centrally stored on the same server. If you, for security reasons or to customize the recommendation algorithm for your products, want us to handle your data separately, please contact us at <a href=\"https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/</a> to obtain it.</p>\n<h4>Regarding Custom JS</h4>\n<p>By default, the style of the recommendation component may not match your website&#8217;s design, or you may need some more advanced features.
