When the button is clicked, the plugin will find the date that is available (have a less scheduled post than the limit). If there is some date that available, the plugin will assign the nearest available future date.</p>\n<p>However, to automatically set the schedule set for you, this plugin will add single javascript only when you are in the editor.
