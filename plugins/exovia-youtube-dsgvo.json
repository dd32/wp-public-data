Our new plugin offers you a solution for exactly this!</p>\n<p>With our YouTube DSGVO plugin, you can display YouTube videos on your website for free and in compliance with data protection laws. Instead of loading the videos directly, a colored placeholder of your choice is displayed first. By adding your own words, this becomes an attractive interaction area for your visitors.</p>\n<p>Only when your visitors click on one of the consent buttons, a connection to the YouTube server is established and data is transferred to YouTube. Then the desired video is loaded and can be played.</p>\n<p>Both the placeholder and the YouTube video are mobile-optimized and automatically adapt to the display size. You can also assign a maximum width to both elements to achieve the best possible visual result.</p>\n<p>With our plugin, you protect the privacy of your visitors while taking advantage of videos for your website success.</p>\n<p>Want a live demo?

Developers can then use <code>npm run dev</code> for development mode and <code>npm run build</code> for production builds. The correct proxy can be set in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>.</p>\n<p>This provides complete transparency of the functionality and source code, giving developers the opportunity to customize and enhance the plugin.</p>\n<p>We welcome feedback and contributions from the developer community.</p>\n<h3>Privacy and Data Usage</h3>\n<p>This plugin connects to YouTube to embed videos in a GDPR-compliant manner. When a user interacts with the video, a connection to YouTube&#8217;s servers (https://www.youtube-nocookie.com) is established, and data may be transmitted.</p>\n<p><strong>Third-Party Service:</strong><br />\n&#8211; <strong>YouTube:</strong> This plugin uses YouTube&#8217;s no-cookie iframe embed to display the fallback videos.

However, if you still wish to use our plugin to embed multiple videos within your content, you can include the iframe in the shortcode and use <code>echo get_field()</code> to output this unsafe HTML. This approach ensures that your iframe is not filtered out by ACF, allowing you to display videos as intended.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
