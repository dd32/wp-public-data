        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.6.1 or greater</li>\n<li>PHP version 5.4 or greater</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twiganything.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twig Anything</a> WordPress plugin version 1.5 or greater</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of API Endpoints, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type ‚ÄúAPI Endpoints‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found the plugin, you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the API Endpoints plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>twig-anything-api-endpoints.zip</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What formats can my API Endpoints output in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>JSON, XML, CSV (comma separated values), YAML and pretty much anything with just a bit of config. You have full control of what is output and which format.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many API Endpoints can I create?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create as many endpoints as you need. There are no limits!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I control access to my API Endpoints?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can configure a minimum user role required for each endpoint separately. You will then pass <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> variables in your call to the API, which will be used to authenticate with your existing WordPress users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I configure access to each API Endpoint separately?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, every single API Endpoint has its own optional minimal role required to access the API.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I create a separate WordPress user to access API Endpoints?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your API is public and meant to be accessed by anyone, then no.</p>\n<p>However, if you API needs authentication, then I recommend creating a separate WordPress user and using its username/password to access the API. A separate WP account for consuming your API would make it easier to switch it ON/OFF or change its permission level accordingly when required.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I configure the URL to my API?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, you would access your API endpoint by a URL like this:</p>\n<pre><code>http://my-wordpress.com/api-endpoint/endpoint-name\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#8230; where <code>api-endpoint</code> is the common root URL, and <code>endpoint-name</code> is unique for every endpoint. Both of these pieces are configurable in the settings screen.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I control HTTP headers output by an API endpoint?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can configure HTTP headers in the settings screen. To access it, click on the &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu and then on the &#8220;API Endpoints&#8221; sub-menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if API returns an error?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As any API, yours can return an error. For example, if someone tries to access a protected API endpoint without appropriate authentication. If this is the case, the <em>Error Template</em> from the settings screen will be used.</p>\n<p>There is a default error template in JSON format in place, but you can easily tune it to your own needs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I preview the API output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the <em>Settings</em> screen, in front of every api endpoint there is an <em>&#8220;Open&#8221;</em> button. Clicking on it opens a new tab in your browser linking to the URL the API.</p>\n<p>You can also use special tools to test you API, for example <a href=\"https://www.getpostman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Postman</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does it require Twig Anything plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Twig Anything is a super-powerful plugin that allows to fetch any data from anywhere and display it in your WordPress site. It is universal and extensible, and already has a lot of things like intelligent error handling and local cache. It also understands Twig syntax, which allows for endless applications and various scenarios. &#8220;API Endpoints&#8221; greatly benefits from all of this!</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the developer behind both plugins is the same üôÇ</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I turn a CSV file into an API?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You will need <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/twig-anything-csv/\" rel=\"ugc\">CSV Format</a> add-on to read let it data from a CSV file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I turn someone else&#8217;s API into my own API?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just configure your Twig Template to fetch data from a URL and then output it either entirely or partially in your template.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
