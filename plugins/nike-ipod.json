Thanks, James! http://www.jamesfrost.co.uk/\n* Added image class for graph pictures, allows you to use your own CSS\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.4.3</h4>\n<pre><code>(June 25, 2009)\n\n* Updated Nike+ API locations: fixes what Nike’s changes broke\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.4.2</h4>\n<pre><code>(May 19, 207)\n\n* Updated Nike+ API locations: fixes what Nike’s changes broke\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.4.1</h4>\n<pre><code>(April 1, 2007)\n\n* Changed Global variable schemes to be less generic, this should fix most users’ problems with the plugin not working\n* Updated path to Sparkline.php so it is automatically calculated… should work now for blogs in a subdirectory\n* Fixed a typo in admin\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<pre><code>(March 20, 2007)\n\n* Regoranized code into multiple functions, simplifying the logic\n* Added \"Personal Best\" display\n* Added challenge and challenge detail\n* Integrated Sparklines graphs. Distributed under the BSD license. http://www.sparkline.org/\n* Changed package to be installed in a directory in the plugins folder\n* Changed caching directory to /wp-content/plugins/nikePlus/cache/ because we are now generating so many cached files\n* Added button in admin to manually get an update the next time the plugin is called (next page load), overriding the cache time\n* Saving options in admin now automatically reloads cache on next page load\n* Added ability to plot the powersong and user clicks in graphs. Commented out code because it produced fugly graphs\n* The code for plotting powersong initializations and user audible feedback clicks are still there and work, but it’s unfortunate that the graphs were so ugly\n* Added \"My Records\" support and admin checkbox\n* Changed caching method to only get the requested number of recent runs, not the whole list of files. This greatly reduces the initial cache time\n* Fixed bug where certain SSL certificates on II6 would not validate to pull secure data form nike.com (Thanks Bryan! – http://www.thebirdwells.net/)\n* Added note to GoDaddy users on how to use the web proxy option in admin\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<pre><code>( January 19, 2007 )\n\n* Added number formatting to the calories and miles numbers\n* Added warning message to admin if chosen local path is not writable\n* Fixed bug where version notification was messed up in the admin\n* Fixed a kilometer vs. mile issue where it was not converted correctly for general run data ( http://www.ear-fung.us/apps/nikeplus/#comment-3071 )\n* Tried to resolve goal distance issues, the data displayed is now *CLOSER* to what is actually on the Nike website\n* MAJOR – Implemented \"Recent Runs\" with admin options\n* Cleaned up admin options page a bit\n* Now only displays non-completed goals\n* Increased textbox for localpath so most users will be able to see the whole path\n* Added GPL license\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<pre><code>( Jan 16, 2007 )\n\n* Fixed a caching bug that made the program never get new information. Sorry guys :(\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<pre><code>( Jan 16, 2007 )\n\n* Stupid mis-labeling on my part made the plugin appear in the wp-admin as still version 1.1\n* Supressed error message is the function file_get_contents() is disables by the host\n* Changed Goals list to more accurately reflect the sidebar.php unordered list structure so that It might be formatted correctly automatically\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<pre><code>( Jan 16, 2007 )\n\n* Fixed caching issue where the caching was not consistent and was incorrectly reported in the html as retrieving the data from Nike\n* Added notification of new versions to the admin panel\n* Made it so that the power song would not display if Nike.com didn’t return any info\n* Added Goals list and ability to turn them on and off\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<pre><code>( Jan 15, 2007 )\n\n* Added ability to link your power song to the iTunes Store\n</code></pre>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<pre><code>( Jan 15, 2007 )\n\n* Initial Version\n</code></pre>\n"
