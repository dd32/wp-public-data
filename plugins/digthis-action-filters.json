Seems, a tedious amount of time doesn’t it? I’ve created a plugin for just that reason but it lists all hooks and filters and allows you to search through them to see whats being hooked.</p>\n<p>To do this i’ve used a helper class from Query Monitor where I initially saw this being used, i’ve extended it to be more user friendly.</p>\n",
