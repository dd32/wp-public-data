        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20helpfulcrowd%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does HelpfulCrowd cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The HelpfulCrowd plugin is completely free. We also have a free 14-day trial of our premium Review marketing platform for businesses looking to build trust faster and accelerate growth.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20import%20my%20existing%20product%20reviews%20into%20helpfulcrowd%3F'>\nCan I import my existing product reviews into HelpfulCrowd?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can import your existing reviews to HelpfulCrowd. We have made this process very easy for you by allowing you to export your existing reviews straight from within the main HelpfulCrowd platform.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20collect%20reviews%20on%20my%20storefront%20and%20also%20send%20review%20requests%20after%20a%20customer%20buys%3F'>\nCan I collect reviews on my storefront and also send review requests after a customer buys?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Our free plugin lets you display our review widgets, collect reviews from your storefront and also let customers ask product questions that you can then respond to and display on product pages. Increasing your review content is easy by starting the free trial of the premium version which unlocks a number of powerful growth features including automatic post purchase review requests.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20helpfulcrowd%20support%20different%20languages%3F'>\nDoes HelpfulCrowd support different languages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we currently support 27 different languages out-of-the-box for our storefront reviews widget and review request emails. Our website widgets can be displayed in the same language as the visitors browser language, or you can force a specific language for all visitors irrespective of browser language setting.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20decide%20which%20reviews%20to%20publish%20and%20which%20to%20hide%20on%20my%20storefront%3F'>\nCan I decide which reviews to publish and which to hide on my storefront?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While we strongly recommend that you publish all reviews received, you also have the ability to moderate reviews and hide them from your storefront. Naturally if a review does not comply with our review publishing guidelines then these shouldn&#8217;t be published on your storefront.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20automatically%20publish%20reviews%20on%20my%20storefront%3F'>\nCan I automatically publish reviews on my storefront?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Auto publishing is a feature to help with managing reviews. If you wish to manually review and publish every review then you do this simply in the premium version of the HelpfulCrowd app.  Regardless of whether you have auto published enabled or disabled you will receive an email when new reviews are received and you can also decide to publish or archive reviews from the email.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20automatically%20share%20my%20best%20reviews%20on%20social%20channels%3F'>\nCan I automatically share my best reviews on social channels?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. To connect your social accounts login to our main app after starting the free trial and then connect your social accounts under the &#8220;Marketing&#8221; menu. After connecting, you can then either choose to manually share each review from the reviews moderation page or use the automatic sharing feature &#8220;Social transmit&#8221; to automatically share your best reviews on a preset frequency.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
