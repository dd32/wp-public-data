        "description": "<h3>The modern contact form widget</h3>\n<p>ContactForm.Pro is a powerful and user-friendly widget that allows you to easily create and embed a customisable floating contact form on your website. The WordPress plugin acts as a “bridge” between our app, allowing you to install the plugin straight from the WordPress App store. You don&#8217;t need mail servers with ContactForm.Pro, as we take care of all the hosting and processing, reliably sending messages straight to your email inbox.</p>\n<p>Unlike static forms, which require programming knowledge and complicated mail servers, ContactForm.Pro is a dynamic widget that can be easily customised and updated without requiring any coding or technical expertise.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a blogger, business owner or web developer, ContactForm.Pro is the perfect solution for any website owner looking to improve their online presence and streamline communication with their website visitors.</p>\n<h3>How ContactForm.Pro works</h3>\n<p>By installing the ContactForm.Pro WordPress plugin, you establish a connection between our app and WordPress. To utilise the plugin, sign up and create an account on our website. This allows you to customise the plugin and specify the email address you want the messages to be sent to.</p>\n<p>After installing the WordPress plugin, the ContactForm.Pro widget will remain deactivated until you enter the personalised code generated within our website&#8217;s app. The widget is exclusively bound to your website to prevent unauthorised installation or misuse by others.</p>\n<p>Once installed correctly, ContactForm.Pro will appear by default in the bottom right corner of your website. Visitors can open it by clicking the icon and close it by either pressing the icon again or clicking the “Close” in the corner of the widget window. The widget will only load fully when opened and does so by temporarily injecting HTML into your source code.</p>\n<p>When a user opens the widget and decides to send you a message, they will see a screen resembling a conventional static contact form. By default, the user will be prompted to provide their name and email before composing the message. When the user sends the message, it is sent to our mail server for processing and then delivered as an email directly to your inbox. From there, you can respond to the message directly and communicate with the visitor.</p>\n<h3>One-click install, sign up to form in minutes</h3>\n<p>Installing ContactForm.Pro is a quick and simple process that connects our app to your WordPress website in just a few minutes. Once installed, you can easily customise the contact form widget through the app on our website.</p>\n<h3>Floating widget</h3>\n<p>ContactForm.Pro floats by default in the bottom right corner of your website, appearing initially as a launcher icon that can be clicked to open. Our platform allows you to customise the launcher open and close icons from a list of presets, and change the colours to match your website&#8217;s design. Additionally, you can choose to enable other options such as dimming the website when the widget is opened, drawing focus to the contact form and increasing the chances of engagement.</p>\n<h3>No mail server necessary, straight to your email</h3>\n<p>When a visitor sends a message through the ContactForm.Pro widget, it is sent automatically to the email address of your choosing. You can easily change the target email address within the app on our website, if you need to replace it at a later date. Our platform handles all the processing and server-side work, so there&#8217;s no strain on your website and no mail server necessary.</p>\n<h3>Mobile ready and responsive design</h3>\n<p>ContactForm.Pro&#8217;s widget is designed with mobile responsiveness in mind, ensuring that it works seamlessly across all devices and browsers. Whether your website visitors are using a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone, they can easily access and use the contact form widget. Our platform uses responsive design techniques to ensure that the widget looks great and functions properly on all screen sizes, without sacrificing any of its features.</p>\n<h3>Spam filter powered by machine learning</h3>\n<p>At ContactForm.Pro, we understand that spam is annoying for website owners. That&#8217;s why our contact form widget is powered by machine learning algorithms and Akismet anti-spam technology. We also utilise Friendly Captcha to ensure that messages are from legitimate visitors and not spam bots. Our spam protection features work seamlessly in the background, keeping your inbox free from unwanted messages, saving you time and allowing you to build meaningful connections with your visitors.</p>\n<h3>Reliable Delivery</h3>\n<p>Using your own mail server can sometimes present challenges, as email providers like Gmail and their competitors may classify your emails as spam and block their delivery. This can result in missed messages and unreliable communication. However, ContactForm.Pro offers a reliable solution to address this issue. With the proper infrastructure in place, ContactForm.Pro ensures that your emails are delivered without being flagged as spam. This ensures that you receive all legitimate visitor messages without interruption, fostering seamless and trustworthy communication.</p>\n<h3>Who is ContactForm.Pro for?</h3>\n<p>ContactForm.Pro is a versatile solution suitable for any type of website, whether it&#8217;s a blog, online shop, or a simple static HTML page. As ContactForm.Pro takes care of all the server-side processing, it seamlessly integrates with any website, regardless of the underlying technology or platform. Customisation is made easy through the intuitive app editor available on our website. You can effortlessly tailor the contact form to match your website&#8217;s design and requirements, ensuring a cohesive and personalised user experience no matter your own skill level.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade</h3>\n<p>At ContactForm.Pro, we understand that every website has differing needs, which is why we offer payment plans that cater to your needs. We offer a completely free version of our plugin that has some limits, but can be used forever without any payment required. And for those who need more advanced features, we have paid plans that offer additional options, form and message limits. Best of all, when you change plan (Upgrade or Downgrade), you won&#8217;t need to update the widget as it&#8217;s done seamlessly for you. We strive to offer plans that work with your budget and needs so that you can get the most out of ContactForm.Pro.</p>\n<h3>Full ContactForm.Pro feature list</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy install</strong> &#8211; With just a few clicks, you can install ContactForm.Pro on your WordPress website using the convenient plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile friendly</strong> &#8211; ContactForm.Pro is fully compatible with any screen size, including mobile devices, and is built using responsive design.</li>\n<li><strong>Spam protection</strong> &#8211; We use a multi-layered spam protection system, powered by machine learning, to help prevent spam submissions.</li>\n<li><strong>All-in-one app</strong> &#8211; We forward messages directly to your email address, eliminating the need for downloading any additional apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Customisable design</strong> &#8211; Our widget is customisable, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it with your website design, including uploading custom profile pictures.</li>\n<li><strong>Hide your email address</strong> &#8211; ContactForm.Pro ensures that your email address is kept hidden, providing protection against spam bots.</li>\n<li><strong>Free plan</strong> – We offer a forever free plan with certain limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated support team</strong> &#8211; ContactForm.Pro provides a dedicated support team to assist with any issues and a comprehensive help center for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Just to note&#8230;</h3>\n<p>When installing the ContactForm.Pro plugin, it&#8217;s important to note that it does not directly install ContactForm.Pro onto your website. Instead, it acts as a bridge, establishing a connection between our web app and your WordPress site. This bridge enables a convenient one-click installation process, rather than the alternative of manually copying and pasting. Once installed, the plugin provides helpful tips and guidance on how to effectively use ContactForm.Pro, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.</p>\n",
