Just wait to fully load and do not leave the page.<br />\n        Even in case you get a timeout error is going to be fine, it saves font by font, so probably you will have a nice list already.<br />\n* To avoid to download more than 500 fonts at once, the fonts that are been used are the ones that get downloaded.</p>\n<p><strong>Using the custom tags:</strong></p>\n<p>If you would like to personalize the looks of a given text block you may use the advanced options otherwise leave it empty for defaults:<br />\n[pcode color=&#8221; font=&#8221; size=&#8221;]  text  [/pcode]<br />\n* Color is the hexadecimal value of the color with #.<br />\n* Font the name of the font as you can see in the options page. Case sensitive with the extension ttf.<br />\n* Size is a number beetween 8 and 22.</p>\n<p>*Any question or suggestion that is not listed here, better let&#8217;s do it in my support forum *(i recibe email updates from that forum)<br />\n<a href=\"http://arturoemilio.es/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Support and comments Forum</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>A question that someone might have</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you like this plugin and have some suggestion or wish some new function  just<br />\ndrop  by  my  page  and  live  a  comment in the support forum:  <a href=\"http://arturoemilio.es/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Comment  about  my  plugin  in   my<br />\nhomepage</a>.<br />\nOr drop by and send me a message from the contact form <a href=\"http://arturoemilio.es/contactar/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Access from here</a></p>\n</p>\n\n"
