Filters should filter information, thus receiving information/data, applying the filter and returning information/data, and then used. However, filters are still action hooks. WordPress defines add_filter/remove_filter as &#8220;hooks a function to a specific filter action&#8221;, and add_action/remove_action as &#8220;hooks a function on to a specific action&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>What is Browser Update?</h4>\n<p>Browser Update is a way to find out what are the latest versions of the major browsers around, and also learn about alternative browsers that may fit even better than the one are currently using: an outdated browser makes computer unsafe. This function use <a href=\"https://browsehappy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Browse Happy</a>, a website created by the Web Standards Project in August 2004, to convince internet users to use a web browser other than Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. It focuses on security issues in Internet Explorer and suggests four alternatives: Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari and Google Chrome. The core of the site is a collection of stories of people who have switched from Internet Explorer to alternative web browsers. WordPress automatically implements this feature with an annoying widget that is displayed on the dashboard without administrator control, even when you consciously use an out-of-date browser for the most varied reasons.</p>\n<h4>About it</h4>\n<p>The code of this plugin, is not written with a php framework, but with a simple php editor, manually, compatible UTF-8 without BOM, and Unix LF.
