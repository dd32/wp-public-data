Next, change the page template by selecting <strong>Page Attributes</strong> &gt; <strong>Template</strong> and selecting the<br />\n&#8220;Status Page for Runscope&#8221; template.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the <strong>Publish</strong> metabox, click the <strong>Publish</strong> button to save and create the new Page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the edit screen of your new Page, a metabox called <strong>Status Page for Runscope Settings</strong> will appear. Following the instructions provided in the<br />\nmetabox, enter a <strong>Access Token</strong> and <strong>Bucket Key</strong>, and save those settings by clicking the <strong>Update</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>View your Page. If your Runscope settings were entered correctly, the page should pause briefly, and then show the last state of each Test in the<br />\nbucket, as well as a summary of the bucket at the top of the page. Done!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Tips &amp; Tricks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got object caching turned on in WordPress, the page will automatically cache the last response it got from Runscope for 60 seconds. It&#8217;ll mean<br />\nthe results of your page will be slightly out of date (by up to 60 seconds), but the results will display much quicker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s totally possible to display multiple status pages for different buckets in Runscope! Just create a new Page per each bucket and make sure to enter the right bucket key into each.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
