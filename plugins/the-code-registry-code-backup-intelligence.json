It securely replicates your site&#8217;s code for analysis, providing insights on code complexity, security vulnerabilities, third-party components, licensing issues, and code quality.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Secure code replication for analysis</li>\n<li>Code complexity assessment</li>\n<li>Security vulnerability detection</li>\n<li>Third-party component identification</li>\n<li>License compliance checking</li>\n<li>Code quality evaluation</li>\n<li>Integration with The Code Registry&#8217;s web application for advanced features</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The plugin securely backs up and replicates your site&#8217;s code.</li>\n<li>Our service analyzes the code for any issues and generates AI-powered insights.</li>\n<li>Results are displayed in your WordPress admin dashboard.</li>\n<li>Detailed reports are available in the dashboard and as downloadable PDFs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Free vs. Paid Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin and code analysis features are free to use indefinitely.</li>\n<li>All features are available during a 14-day evaluation period.</li>\n<li>Some advanced features are only accessible through our main web app which you will have access to.</li>\n<li>Automated monthly code re-analysis works during your trial and then requires a paid subscription.</li>\n<li>Existing data and basic features remain accessible after the evaluation period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Internationalization</h3>\n<p>This plugin is internationalized and uses the text domain the-code-registry-code-backup-intelligence. If you&#8217;re interested in translating the plugin to your language, you can use this text domain with the WordPress translation tools.</p>\n<p>To generate a POT file for translations, you can use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n<pre><code>wp i18n make-pot . languages/the-code-registry-code-backup-intelligence.pot --domain=the-code-registry-code-backup-intelligence\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please ensure that all translatable strings in the plugin use this text domain for proper internationalization.</p>\n<h3>Source Code and Build Process</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses npm and webpack to compile and minify its JavaScript and CSS files. The compiled files are located in the admin/js/dist and admin/css/dist directories.</p>\n<p>For developers interested in reviewing or contributing to the source code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The uncompiled source files are located in the src directory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To set up the development environment:</p>\n<p>npm install</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To build the project:</p>\n<p>npm run build</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To watch for changes and rebuild automatically:</p>\n<p>npm run watch</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The build process uses Vite for bundling and optimization. The configuration can be found in vite.config.js.</p>\n<p>We welcome contributions and encourage developers to review and adapt our code to push WordPress development forward.</p>\n<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>This plugin securely transmits your site&#8217;s code to The Code Registry&#8217;s servers for analysis. We do not store your complete codebase after analysis. For full details on how we handle your data, please view our <a href=\"https://thecoderegistry.com/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\n<p>For more information about our services, please visit <a href=\"https://thecoderegistry.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Code Registry</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/the-code-registry-code-backup-intelligence</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Use the Code Backup &amp; Intelligence menu item in the WordPress admin panel to start your first analysis.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20my%20code%20safe%3F'>\nIs my code safe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we prioritize security. Your code is transmitted securely, analyzed on our protected servers, and not stored after analysis. We comply with strict data protection standards.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20the%20analysis%20take%3F'>\nHow long does the analysis take?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Initial setup typically takes about 5 minutes. The analysis itself usually completes in around 15 minutes for average-sized sites, though larger sites may require more time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20delete%20my%20account%20and%20data%3F'>\nCan I delete my account and data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can easily delete your account and all associated data at any time through the plugin interface.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20is%20my%20code%20analyzed%3F'>\nHow often is my code analyzed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>During the free trial and with an active subscription, your code is automatically re-analyzed monthly. Without a subscription, you can still access previous analysis results.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
