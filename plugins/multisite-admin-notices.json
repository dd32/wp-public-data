This notices are styled identically to the &#8220;normal&#8221; WordPress notices that you might see (WordPress<br />\nupdates, &#8220;post published&#8221; messages etc).

Here you can add, remove and update notices.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does it do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Allows a network admin to add, remove or change admin notices for their network&#8217;s sites. This notices<br />\nare dismissable</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who can see the notices?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anyone how is logged into the admin page of a network site. This may later change to only admins of that<br />\nnetwork site.</p>\n<p>Notices can be dismissed by the user, and they shall no longer see that notice (on any site).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I request a feature?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but regrettably due to time/work limitations I can&#8217;t take any <em>unpaid</em> on. If you really need a feature,<br />\nyou can get in touch to <a href=\"http://stephenharris.info\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hire me</a>.</p>\n<p>Pull requests are welcome, but to be merged into the plug-in will need to ensure that it does not disrupt the aesthetics<br />\nof the plug-in. I realise that there could hundreds of options that could potenitally be added, but the aim of this<br />\nplug-in is to be very simple to use and minimal.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
