        "installation": "<h4>Minimal Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 5.4 or newer</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.9 (newest version recommended)</li>\n<li>PHP Version 5.6 or newer</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>We recommend installing Germanized for WooCommerce through the WordPress Backend. Please install WooCommerce before installing our plugin.<br />\nAfter the installation you may easily adapt the settings to your own needs.</p>\n<h4>Product specific shortcodes</h4>\n<p>You may use one of the following product-specific shortcodes to output notices within PageBuilders or on custom-built-pages.<br />\nThe <code>product</code> parameter is optional. Shortcodes are falling back to the global $product variable in case the <code>product</code> parameter is missing.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_unit_price product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs unit price for a product.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_units product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs units included with the product e.g. 100 ml.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_delivery_time product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs delivery time for a product.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_tax_notice product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs tax notice for a product.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_shipping_notice product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs shipping costs notice for a product.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_defect_description product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs defect description for a defective copy.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_product_cart_desc product=\"123\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs mini cart description for a product.</p>\n<h4>General Shortcodes</h4>\n<pre><code>[revocation_form]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inserts online revocation form within your WooCommerce store. Customer and shop manager receive a confirmation by email.</p>\n<pre><code>[payment_methods_info]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Very useful as page to inform the user of your WooCommerce payment gateways &#8211; Inserts an overview of all enabled payment gateways plus their descriptions.</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_email_legal_page_attachments email_id=\"customer_processing_order\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This shortcode outputs the legal page content attached to a specific email template. In case the email_id attribute is missing the shortcode tries to determine the current email template being sent.<br />\nThe shortcode is useful to output the legal page attachments in custom email templates built via a GUI (e.g. email customizer plugins).</p>\n<pre><code>[gzd_complaints]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inserts a text that informs the customer about the EU Online Dispute Platform &#8211; this Shortcode should be inserted within your imprint.
