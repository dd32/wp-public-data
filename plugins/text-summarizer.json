When you register for the plugin and select a plan, tokens are assigned to your account. These tokens are consumed each time you generate a summary. Please note that tokens are replenished on a monthly basis through a recurring payment corresponding to your selected plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20run%20out%20of%20tokens%3F'>\nWhat happens if I run out of tokens?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you run out of tokens, the plugin won&#8217;t be able to generate new summaries until your token balance is replenished. You can either wait for the monthly token refill based on your plan or purchase additional tokens at any time to continue using the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20the%20summaries%20generated%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow can I use the summaries generated by the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once a summary is generated, you can simply copy it and use it wherever you need! The aim is to provide you with a concise overview of a larger piece of content, which you can use for quick reference, content creation, or any other purpose you see fit.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20encounter%20problems%20with%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I encounter problems with the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;re here to help!
