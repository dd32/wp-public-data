        "description": "<p>The Clean My Archives plugin was developed because so many archives plugins were overly complicated.  I wanted something extremely simple to use that simply got the job done on my own <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">site&#8217;s archives</a>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I created a simple <code>[clean-my-archives]</code> shortcode that you can place on any page (or any shortcode-ready area) and list your post archives by month and year.</p>\n<p>This plugin also integrates with WordPress caching plugins.  So, long lists of archives can be cached for later use and loaded quickly.  If you have many years of blog posts, I highly recommend some sort of persistent caching or paginating your archives (see FAQ).</p>\n<h3>Professional Support</h3>\n<p>If you need professional plugin support from me, the plugin author, you can access the support forums at <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Theme Hybrid</a>, which is a professional WordPress help/support site where I handle support for all my plugins and themes for a community of 75,000+ users (and growing).</p>\n<h3>Plugin Development</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a theme author, plugin author, or just a code hobbyist, you can follow the development of this plugin on it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/clean-my-archives\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<h3>Donations</h3>\n<p>Yes, I do accept donations.  If you want to donate, you can do so from my <a href=\"https://themehybrid.com/donate\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donations page</a> or grab me something from my <a href=\"http://a.co/flUb0ns\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amazon Wish List</a>.</p>\n<p>I appreciate all donations, no matter the size.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First and foremost, I wanted a simple archives solution for, what&#8217;s now, over 12 years of blog posts.  You can check out <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my archives</a> to see how the plugin performs.</p>\n<p>The second reason was to share my solution with other users who want the same simplicity.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add the <code>[clean-my-archives]</code> shortcode to a shortcode-ready area, such as the page editor. That&#8217;s it.  You have nothing more to do.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are some other configuration options. Examples follow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Limit the number of posts with the `limit` parameter:</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives limit=&#8221;100&#8243;]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Reverse the order with the `order` parameter (default is `DESC`):</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives order=&#8221;ASC&#8221;]</p>\n<pre><code>[clean-my-archives order=\"DESC\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Use the `year` parameter to limit to a year:</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives year=&#8221;2013&#8243;]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Use the `month` parameter to limit by month:</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives month=&#8221;12&#8243;]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Load specific post types with the `post_type` parameter:</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives post_type=&#8221;post&#8221;]</p>\n<pre><code>[clean-my-archives post_type=\"post, page\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Disable the comment count from showing:</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives show_comment_count=&#8221;0&#8243;]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Change the month and day date/time format</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[clean-my-archives format_month_year=&#8221;F Y&#8221; format_post_date=&#8221;d:&#8221;]</p>\n<p>For a full list of formats, see the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP Date Formats</a> guide.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it support pagination?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sort of.  Technically, it doesn&#8217;t.  However, WordPress pages support pagination.  So, you could enter the following in your page editor to paginate by year.</p>\n<pre><code>[clean-my-archives year=\"2013\"]\n\n&lt;!-- nextpage --&gt;\n\n[clean-my-archives year=\"2012\"]\n\n&lt;!-- nextpage --&gt;\n\n[clean-my-archives year=\"2011\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
