It adds a toggle button with an arrow indicator to the right hand side of your admin bar (placed to the bottom so that it&#8217;s always visible), when this button is clicked, the admin bar shifts back into view, and can be toggled back out of view again!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20the%20user%20doesn%27t%20have%20javascript%20enabled%3F'>\nWhat happens if the user doesn&#8217;t have JavaScript enabled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As long as your theme has the &#8220;no-js&#8221; class on the &#8220;html&#8221; tag by default (most themes do), nothing! The plugin falls back to old admin bar in this case.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
