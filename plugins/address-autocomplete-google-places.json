Some made inefficent API calls which resulted in additional costs. Some had bugs which caused address results to be provided for countries that were not available. Others had additional features like maps, which weren&#8217;t needed.</p>\n<p>This plugin does one thing, and it does it well.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
