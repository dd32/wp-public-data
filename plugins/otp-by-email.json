What does this plugin do ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are collecting an email address in your CF7 form from a visitor, you can use this plugin to validate that email.</p>\n<p>The email field name will be used to create a unique OTP mail tag shortcode to insert into your notification mail (sent to that email).  The shortcode will be replaced by a unique URL which the recipient can click on to validate their email.  This unique link is created using WordPress nonce API, and it stored in the DB as a transient with a default validity of 72 hours (3 days).  You can customise this validity period, please refer to the FAQ below for more details.  When a recipient clicks on a valid link, they are redirected to the <em>On Success</em> page you configured in the OTP tab.  If the link is no longer valid, they are taken to the <em>On failure</em> page instead, where you may give them the option to send them a new OTP link.</p>\n<p>You can use this plugin to go beyond simple email validation, as each valid user now has a unique way to identify themselves on your server.  I have used this plugin to create a conference registration and submission form for speakers without having them to actually create a user account on the server.  A visitor registers as a speaker, and once their email is validated, they use their OTP link (which expires a week prior to the conference start date) in order to submit talks for the conference without having to have an account.</p>\n<p>If you need to explore such functionality, you can contact me on &#8220;vrata at syllogic dot in&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='1.%20is%20it%20possible%20to%20change%20the%20time-limit%20for%20the%20link%20validity%20%3F'>\n1.
