        "faq": "\n<h4>\nMy functionality plugin isn&#8217;t working!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all, backup all of the code in your functionality plugin. Then deactivate and delete your functionality (it will have the same name as your site). To recreate the functionality plugin, visit the &#8216;Edit Functions&#8217; link in the WordPress admin menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I get rid of this plugin once my functionality plugin has been created?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! Once this plugin has been activated and the functionality plugin created, all it does is create a link in the WordPress admin menu for easily editing the functionality plugin, and include your CSS code on the front-end of your site. If you don&#8217;t want this, feel free to delete this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhen would I use this plugin over the Code Snippets plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is more suited to people who only have a few snippets and prefer editing a file to using a graphical interface. If you have more snippets, and like to be organized, you may feel more at home using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets\" rel=\"ugc\">Code Snippets</a> plugin, which I also created.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIsn&#8217;t this just like the Pluginception plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, in that they are both a plugin for creating plugins. However, this plugin is a bit more easier to use and specific than Pluginception.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
