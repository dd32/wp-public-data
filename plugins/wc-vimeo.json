You can access this data in your email templates, as it is stored as custom fields on the Product. The names of the custom fields are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_id</code>: The ID of the Vimeo video; the ID in the Vimeo URL https://vimeo.com/<strong>18293829</strong></li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_password</code>: The password needed to access the video (will only be set if video is password protected at Vimeo)</li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_link</code>: The link to the Vimeo video (this is a full link <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/18293829\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://vimeo.com/18293829</a>)</li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_name</code>: The name, or title of the Vimeo video</li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_uri</code>: The uri of the Vimeo video (this is the link without the leading domain, e.g. /18293829)</li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_description</code>: The description of the video, if set</li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_duration</code>: The duration of the video, in seconds</li>\n<li><code>wc_vimeo_status</code>: The status of the video, if it is available to be viewed</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20this%20meta%20data%20%2F%20make%20it%20available%20to%20my%20customers%20once%20they%27ve%20purchased%20my%20products%3F'>\nHow can I use this meta data / make it available to my customers once they&#8217;ve purchased my Products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin works by setting meta data from the Vimeo video on the Product when you select a video. There are many ways to deliver this meta data to your users on purchase of a product.</p>\n<p>One way is to create an email template in your theme. See the sample gist here: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vastolf/42cc9359d6b616675d70659e6de6f7a4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://gist.github.com/vastolf/42cc9359d6b616675d70659e6de6f7a4</a></p>\n<p>Copy the content of the gist. In your theme (or child theme&#8217;s) folder create a file at <code>/woocommerce/emails/customer-completed-order.php</code> and copy the contents of the gist into that file. So the full directory would be <code>/wp-content/themes/{your theme or child theme}/woocommerce/emails/customer-completed-order.php</code></p>\n<p>This gist gives some examples of how to access the Video data in your confirmation email, but you could do something similar in the processing email or other confirmation emails. You can edit this file and reformat it to suit your styling tastes.</p>\n<p>For more information about custom WooCommerce emails,  see the section called &#8220;Creating Custom Templates with Code&#8221; at <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/how-to-customize-emails-in-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://woocommerce.com/posts/how-to-customize-emails-in-woocommerce/</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20just%20uploaded%20a%20video%20to%20vimeo%2C%20but%20it%27s%20not%20showing%20up%20in%20the%20list%20of%20vimeo%20videos%20when%20i%20create%20a%20product'>\nI just uploaded a video to Vimeo, but it&#8217;s not showing up in the list of Vimeo videos when I create a product\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is likely due to caching. Video Sales for Woocommerce with Vimeo uses WordPress transients, a way of caching data that is resource intensive to generate or access.</p>\n<p>This greatly increases performance, as your site doesn&#8217;t need to make a direct request to Vimeo every time it needs to check video data, and can instead use data from a recent request that already completed. This cache is set to clear every 15 minutes by default.</p>\n<p>Note that depending on how many videos you have at Vimeo, making requests to get video data can be resource intensive. If you have many videos, you might consider increasing the cache clearing interval.</p>\n<p>You can change the cache clear interval or clear the cache manually at <a href=\"https://your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&amp;tab=vimeo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&amp;tab=vimeo</a> (see screenshot 2)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20video%20data%20is%20not%20updating%20with%20the%20changes%20i%20made%20at%20vimeo'>\nMy video data is not updating with the changes I made at Vimeo\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made a change to some video data at Vimeo, those changes may not be reflected on your site immediately.</p>\n<p>To ensure that this plugin can work with other plugins that use meta data from the Product, a Vimeo video&#8217;s data gets stored on each individual Product it gets associted with.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a video at Vimeo with a name like &#8220;My Video&#8221; and you change it to &#8220;My Film&#8221;, any Products that had the &#8220;My Video&#8221; video from Vimeo selected will need to be updated when the Cron task runs for this plugin.</p>\n<p>Products with Vimeo videos get checked for updates from Vimeo during the Cron task, which runs automatically on a set time interval, and which you can set yourself (default is every 15 minutes). Settings for Cron are at <a href=\"https://your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&amp;tab=vimeo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://your-site.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&amp;tab=vimeo</a> (see screenshot 2)</p>\n<p>When the Cron task runs, all video meta data on the Products that needs updating gets updated. This shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an issue unless you have an update from Vimeo you need reflected immediately on your site; in that case, run the cron manually on the WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Vimeo page</p>\n</p>\n\n",
