For example the minified version of 1.7.0 would be named less-1.7.0.min.js</li>\n<li>Upload that file to plugins/wp-less-compiler/assets/js/</li>\n<li>Open plugins/wp-less-compiler/wp-less-compiler.php and change the <code>LESS_JS_VER</code> constant to the version-suffix you used earlier.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that this will be overwritten when the plugin updates, but a persistent way to do this is coming soon.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
