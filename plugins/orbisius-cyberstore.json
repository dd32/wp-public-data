        "description": "<p>Start selling your digital products such as software, e-books, reports in minutes with a simple Buy Now button.<br />\nIf the price is set to 0 users will be able to download files.<br />\nOrbisius CyberStore allows you to set up your e-store and start selling digital products such as software, e-books, pdf, reports in minutes.<br />\nIt adds a simple Buy Now button which sends the customer to PayPal to complete the payment and after that he/she is returned to your site.</p>\n<h4>Demo</h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EKNMYjzwlM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>Benefits / Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n<li>Downloads links are served from the main domain e.g. yourdomain.com/?orb_cyber_store_dl=f47c137</li>\n<li>When download link is clicked the download dialog is shown i.e. the file does not show within the browser (forced download)</li>\n<li>Handles PayPal Live and Sandbox (at the same time &#8211; your clients will be directed to PayPal but your transactions will go to the Sandbox, use Sandbox IP Address)</li>\n<li>Functionality to enable/disable products (when a product is disabled the buy now link will not be shown and the file can&#8217;t be downloaded even with the download link)</li>\n<li>Customize the text for the successful and unsuccessful transaction</li>\n<li>In case of a failed transaction the email is sent to the admin so he can handle the failed transaction manually</li>\n<li>There is a dollar sign button in edit page/post that allows you to choose a product and this will insert the correct shortcode which will be later replaced by Buy Now button</li>\n<li>Protection against multiple calls made from PayPal IPN which paypal makes to notify the site owner for the transaction.</li>\n<li>Download expires after 48 hours</li>\n<li>Download limits: maximum 3 per order</li>\n<li>Allows functionality the form submission to go in a new window</li>\n<li>Optional shipping address requirement (both available as a global setting and per individual product)</li>\n<li>Supports a secure HOP URL. The main idea of the Secure HOP URL is to redirect to another URL. The script must redirect to an address passed by the &#8220;r&#8221; parameter.<br />\nHaving this kind of redirect is very useful because when your visitors are about to return to your site PayPal checks and if the returning URL is a non-ssl link then it puts a warning with makes the user experience less than optimal. Orbisius CyberStore includes a sample redirect script that you can install on your secure site.</li>\n<li>Supports free products (since v1.2.3) for download and adds a Download button instead of Buy Now button</li>\n<li>Since v2.0.0 supports variable products e.g. a digital product with multiple licenses, product notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>New attributes</h4>\n<p>render_price=&#8221;1&#8243;<br />\nWhen this attribute is set in the shortcode will make the plugin show the price above the buy now button.<br />\nWhy this is important? Because if you enter the price on a page and later go and modify the product price of the product<br />\nyou may forgot to update the page. That&#8217;s not good to for the users.</p>\n<p>currency_prefix=&#8221;$&#8221; : currency sign shown before the price, it defaults to $ for CAD, USD, AUD<br />\ncurrency_suffix=&#8221;USD&#8221; : text shown after the price<br />\nprice_label=&#8221;Price&#8221; : text shown before the price<br />\nprice_suffix=&#8221;(one time)&#8221; text appended after the currency suffix</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\n[orb_cyber_store id=&#8221;123&#8243; render_price=&#8221;1&#8243; price_suffix_label=&#8221;(one time)&#8221;]</p>\n<p>This example this will display<br />\nPrice: $249.95 USD (one time)</p>\n<p>If you want the price to be shown for all products insert this in your functions.php of the current theme<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;orb_cyber_store_ext_filter_render_price&#8217;, &#8216;__return_true&#8217;, 10);</p>\n<h4>Free Test/Staging Site by qSandbox</h4>\n<p><a href=\"//qsandbox.com/?utm_source=orbisius-cyberstore&amp;utm_medium=sidebar&amp;utm_campaign=product_readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Free Test/Staging Site</a> (quick set up).<br />\n    Test drive plugins &amp; themes without the risk of crashing your main site.

    "description": "<p>Start selling your digital products such as software, e-books, reports in minutes with a simple Buy Now button.<br />\nIf the price is set to 0 users will be able to download files.<br />\nOrbisius CyberStore allows you to set up your e-store and start selling digital products such as software, e-books, pdf, reports in minutes.<br />\nIt adds a simple Buy Now button which sends the customer to PayPal to complete the payment and after that he/she is returned to your site.</p>\n<h4>Demo</h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EKNMYjzwlM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>Benefits / Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to use</li>\n<li>Downloads links are served from the main domain e.g. yourdomain.com/?orb_cyber_store_dl=f47c137</li>\n<li>When download link is clicked the download dialog is shown i.e. the file does not show within the browser (forced download)</li>\n<li>Handles PayPal Live and Sandbox (at the same time &#8211; your clients will be directed to PayPal but your transactions will go to the Sandbox, use Sandbox IP Address)</li>\n<li>Functionality to enable/disable products (when a product is disabled the buy now link will not be shown and the file can&#8217;t be downloaded even with the download link)</li>\n<li>Customize the text for the successful and unsuccessful transaction</li>\n<li>In case of a failed transaction the email is sent to the admin so he can handle the failed transaction manually</li>\n<li>There is a dollar sign button in edit page/post that allows you to choose a product and this will insert the correct shortcode which will be later replaced by Buy Now button</li>\n<li>Protection against multiple calls made from PayPal IPN which paypal makes to notify the site owner for the transaction.</li>\n<li>Download expires after 48 hours</li>\n<li>Download limits: maximum 3 per order</li>\n<li>Allows functionality the form submission to go in a new window</li>\n<li>Optional shipping address requirement (both available as a global setting and per individual product)</li>\n<li>Supports a secure HOP URL. The main idea of the Secure HOP URL is to redirect to another URL. The script must redirect to an address passed by the &#8220;r&#8221; parameter.<br />\nHaving this kind of redirect is very useful because when your visitors are about to return to your site PayPal checks and if the returning URL is a non-ssl link then it puts a warning with makes the user experience less than optimal. Orbisius CyberStore includes a sample redirect script that you can install on your secure site.</li>\n<li>Supports free products (since v1.2.3) for download and adds a Download button instead of Buy Now button</li>\n<li>Since v2.0.0 supports variable products e.g. a digital product with multiple licenses, product notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>New attributes</h4>\n<p>render_price=&#8221;1&#8243;<br />\nWhen this attribute is set in the shortcode will make the plugin show the price above the buy now button.<br />\nWhy this is important?

That&#8217;s not good to for the users.</p>\n<p>currency_prefix=&#8221;$&#8221; : currency sign shown before the price, it defaults to $ for CAD, USD, AUD<br />\ncurrency_suffix=&#8221;USD&#8221; : text shown after the price<br />\nprice_label=&#8221;Price&#8221; : text shown before the price<br />\nprice_suffix=&#8221;(one time)&#8221; text appended after the currency suffix</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\n[orb_cyber_store id=&#8221;123&#8243; render_price=&#8221;1&#8243; price_suffix_label=&#8221;(one time)&#8221;]</p>\n<p>This example this will display<br />\nPrice: $249.95 USD (one time)</p>\n<p>If you want the price to be shown for all products insert this in your functions.php of the current theme<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;orb_cyber_store_ext_filter_render_price&#8217;, &#8216;__return_true&#8217;, 10);</p>\n<h4>Free Test/Staging Site by qSandbox</h4>\n<p><a href=\"//qsandbox.com/?utm_source=orbisius-cyberstore&amp;utm_medium=sidebar&amp;utm_campaign=product_readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Free Test/Staging Site</a> (quick set up).<br />\n    Test drive plugins &amp; themes without the risk of crashing your main site.
