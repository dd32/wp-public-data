Once the plug-in is installed, you must provide a MailChimp.com APIKey, then select a list to enroll your visitors to.</p>\n<p>The default widget is practical, but not very pretty. Basically, it includes a typical widget layout containing three input fields, one hidden field to track the page URL, and a submit button. The HTML for the widget can be customized to fit your site and WordPress theme. If you choose to do this, please don&#8217;t try to change the input fields&#8217; NAME or ID attributes.
