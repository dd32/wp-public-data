We require that these match in order for this integration to work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%E2%80%99t%20my%20orders%20syncing%3F'>\nWhy aren’t my orders syncing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is likely because products have not been synced or linked.<br />\nIf you’d like to sync new products from WooCommerce to Faire, you can do that by following the steps in the help center. If you have existing products on Faire, you can link the existing products to products in WooCommerce following the steps in the help center.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20only%20sync%20inventory%3F'>\nCan I only sync inventory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; you can choose to only sync inventory from WooCommerce to Faire.<br />\nI don’t want to sync all product details from WooCommerce to Faire (I use different images/prices/etc)<br />\nYou have the ability to select any details you wouldn’t like to sync over by adding them to the ‘exclude sync fields’ settings on WooCommerce. This will prevent those details from being overwritten on Faire with details from WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
