But if you don&#8217;t like the fact of plugins like Hello Dolly and Akismet being automatically installed when you upgrade or reinstall your WordPress, this plugin may be for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20install%20one%20plugin%20to%20get%20rid%20of%20two%20other%20plugins%3F%20really%3F'>\nI install one plugin to get rid of two other plugins? Really?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. I can understand if you want to to the dirty work yourself. But if not, this plugin might be just the thing for you.<br />\nAlso if there are other plugins you don&#8217;t want installed on your website, you&#8217;ve come to the right place!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does the plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On WordPress Core upgrades Unwanted Cleaner will check each item in the list you manage in the plugin settings. If plugins were installed during the upgrade process they will be deleted immediately automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20what%20to%20enter%20into%20the%20list%20if%20i%20want%20to%20exclude%20a%20plugin'>\nHow do I know what to enter into the list if I want to exclude a plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to https://wordpress.org/plugins/ and find your unwanted plugin.<br />\nFor example if you don&#8217;t like the &#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; plugin it&#8217;s full slug (URL) will be <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/</a>.<br />\nEnter only the last part after /plugins/ without the ending slash, in this case: hello-dolly</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20delete%20the%20unwanted%20plugins%20without%20updating%20the%20core%3F'>\nCan I delete the unwanted plugins without updating the core?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can.
