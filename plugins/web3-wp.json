        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As an administrator, you can ask your users for their Ethereum address, and this will allow your users to log into your website. There will be future updates to allow further customisability of the plugin so that you can allow users to log in using <strong>either</strong> their crypto or standard WordPress login credentials.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20my%20crypto%20coins%20%2F%20tokens%20safe%3F'>\nAre my crypto coins / tokens safe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, your coins / tokens are 100% safe guaranteed. The reason is because you are only signing to your wallet, meaning it is read-only. There is no transactions taking place, and the plugin is beta-tested before it goes out into the wild.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20suggest%20a%20feature%20%2F%20enhancement%3F'>\nCan I suggest a feature / enhancement?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can! Please submit feedback to info@wp-web3.com and I\\&#8217;ll consider the request.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20for%20mobile%3F'>\nDoes it work for mobile?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! You will need the specified wallet available on your mobile phone, though. And this depends on the wallet provider. For example, the Metamask wallet has an app, which when you sign into WordPress, will open up the app to confirm the sign in.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20about%20gdpr%20%2F%20privacy%3F'>\nHow about GDPR / Privacy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All the data is stored against the user of the account. If the user is deleted, then it will delete the data stored in the account. You can also delete the specific data by searching the database for <code>wp_web3_</code> and you can single out the data to delete easily.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
