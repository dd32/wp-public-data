You can reset the counter number in four different ways- daily, monthly and yearly basis.</p>\n<p>There is also an option to set a number for reset counter value. This would mean that on every reset, the sequence will start with that particular number.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20the%20width%20for%20the%20custom%20order%20numbers%2C%20for%20example%2C%20i%20want%20my%20custom%20order%20number%20to%20be%208%20characters%20long%3F'>\nCan I set the width for the custom order numbers, for example, I want my custom order number to be 8 characters long?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is not possible in the Lite plugin.
