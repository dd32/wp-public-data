Then input your recipe details into the respective boxes, and click the &#8220;Add Recipe&#8221; button. This will save your recipe and insert it into your blog post.</p>\n<p>The Yummly Rich Recipes plugin is easy to use and if you would like more details, we also provide <a href=\"http://bit.ly/yummly-rich-recipes-user-guide\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">step-by-step instructions</a>.

        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I convert old recipes from Ziplist to the Yummly Plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will build a 1-click migration feature in the next version of Yummly Rich Recipes, but if you want you can manually go back and copy all your recipes into our plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to use Yummly’s Recipe Box but I’m already using another recipe plugin.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to integrate Yummly’s recipe box you need to add the Yum button to your site following the instructions on this page <a href=\"http://www.yummly.com/goodies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.yummly.com/goodies</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are already using another recipe plugin, you should email the developer and ask them to integrate the Yum button according to the instructions provided <a href=\"http://www.yummly.com/goodies/yumbutton\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can my readers view the recipes that have been added to their recipe box?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When your recipes are saved to a reader&#8217;s recipe box, they are accessible anytime, anywhere on Yummly&#8217;s website or mobile apps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yummly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Yummly Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yummly-recipes-grocery-shopping/id589625334?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Yummly iPhone App</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yummly-recipes-shopping-list/id819440982\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Yummly iPad App</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yummly.android&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Yummly Android App</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the plugin to add multiple recipes to one post or page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There should only be one recipe per post or page. The plugin does allow for compound recipes which is one way to include multiple lists of ingredients in your post (e.g., for a salad and a salad dressing). Simply enter your instructions for the main recipe, then start the next line with an exclamation point to create a label, like &#8220;!For the Salad Dressing&#8221;. Then, add the instructions for the secondary recipe. Starting with version 2.4, we no longer support multiple Yummly-formatted recipes within a single post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I created a specially-designed Save Recipe button to match my website, but when I upgraded the plugin, my customizations disappeared. How can I get them back?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting with version 2.4, we no longer support using custom CSS to integrate a designer Save Recipe button. However, we added a new feature to make it easier for you to add in a custom Save Recipe button. Simply go into the plugin settings and toward the top of the page you&#8217;ll see fields to enter custom image URLs for your Save Recipe and Print buttons, should you choose to do so.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I use Yummly&#8217;s plugin or button code, where are the recipes stored?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whether you use The Yummly Rich Recipes plugin or you simply add the Yummly button script to your website, your recipes are always stored on your own website.</p>\n<p>Even with The Yummly Rich Recipes plugin, your recipes are stored safely in a separate DB table in your main WP database. The recipe table is named wp_amd_yrecipe_recipes and you can take a look at it yourself using any WordPress database tools at your disposal.</p>\n<p>Much like Google, Yummly creates a simplified &#8220;index&#8221; entry of your recipes for use in presenting recipe search results, but this is not a full &#8220;copy&#8221; of the recipe and serves only to hold a representation of the partner website. For example, if you change a recipe on your website that you published months ago, Yummly will shortly &#8220;notice&#8221; this and update the recipe search and all of the information in user recipe boxes that link back to the original recipe.</p>\n<p>In short, your website keeps your recipes and Yummly refers all recipe &#8220;view&#8221; traffic back to the original partner content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If the Yummly service were to go down, what would happen to my recipes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is &#8220;nothing&#8221;! 🙂 The display of your recipes on your site has nothing to do with the Yummly service and the only thing that would change is that the Yummly &#8220;Save Recipe&#8221; button would no longer function.</p>\n<p>The Yummly Rich Recipes plugin simply takes the recipe information from your own database and displays it with the SEO annotation and it does this without any connection or communication with the Yummly service itself as the two really are completely independent. The only time there is communication between Yummly and your website is when one of your customers clicks the Save Recipe button, at which time a reference to the recipe and your website is saved in the user&#8217;s recipe box on Yummly.</p>\n<p>If Yummly ever does &#8220;go away&#8221;, you can simply uncheck the option to show the Yummly button and you will continue to enjoy SEO-friendly display of your recipes without any connection to Yummly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do you put a placeholder image into my Edit Post page, instead of my actual recipe?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because of the way WordPress&#8217; text editor works, if you decide to add or remove something from your recipe using the text editor, it can very easily mess up the markup of the code &#8211; so the Yummly plugin prevents that from happening by not allowing you to edit the recipe in the text editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I request a feature to be added in future versions of the Yummly Rich Recipes plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can email <a href=\"mailto:&#x77;&#x6f;&#114;&#x64;&#x70;&#114;&#x65;&#x73;&#115;&#x40;&#x79;&#117;&#x6d;&#x6d;&#108;&#x79;&#x2e;&#099;&#x6f;&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wordpress@yummly.com</a> with your requests.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
