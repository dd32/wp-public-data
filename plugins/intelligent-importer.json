It can create automatically posts or produts. The results are clean, free of errors and allow a great time-saver when you start your website. Import is possible from any site fournisseur (not just with WordPress, it is possible from Prestashop, Magento and even handmade sites).

For example, when importing a catalog, the brand is &#8220;Adidas Rekin&#8221; on the provider catalog and you have as a supplier &#8220;Adidas&#8221;. Or the category in the supplier catalog is Clothing &gt; Men &gt; T-shirt &gt; colorful T-shirt and yours is Shirts an Tee-shirts &gt; Tee-shirts. The AI algorithm can find the nearest correpondance in a really relevant way. On large volumes errors to correct may exist but the bulk of the work will be done by the algorithm.</p>\n",
