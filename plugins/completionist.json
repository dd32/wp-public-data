You can quickly <a href=\"https://asana.com/create-account\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create an Asana account</a> for <strong>FREE</strong>!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20affiliated%20with%20asana%3F'>\nAre you affiliated with Asana?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, I do not have a business relationship with Asana. I just happened to be looking for an Asana integration for WordPress and failed to find an affordable, specialized solution. After noticing many others with the same problem, I decided to create Completionist!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20wordpress%20multisite%20%28wpmu%29%20compatible%3F'>\nIs this WordPress multisite (wpmu) compatible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Feel free to activate the plugin at the network level or per blog/subsite. If you decide to uninstall Completionist, all plugin data will be properly removed across your network.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20languages%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat languages are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Completionist plugin is written in <strong>American English (en-US)</strong> and currently doesn’t support translation. However, your Asana projects and tasks will display their original content which may be in another language. All text labels and messages surrounding the Asana data, though, are in American English.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
