        "installation": "<p>After installation, the plugin automatically adds a script tag to your website, right before the BODY tag.</p>\n<p>Vital keywords will be automatically highlighted on any of your policy pages without you having to do anything.</p>\n<p>Your users will be able to quickly find important privacy sections giving your website an edge over your competition.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Are important privacy keywords automatically highlighted?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I modify the keywords to highlight?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Policy Highlights is an open-source library and contains a configuration file of the keywords to automatically highlight. For the moment we do not allow you to edit the list of keywords to highlight since that would allow any website to specify different keywords. We would like keyword highlighting to be 3rd party independent and consistent across different websites so the user can feel safe. If you would like to suggest changes to the keyword configuration, please contribute to the development community on GitHub.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the project multilingual?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The project is currently only in English. We are working on adding other languages. If you would like to help, please contribute to the development community on GitHub.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does Policy Highlights know when to highlight vital keywords?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Policy Highlights checks for privacy-related trigger words in the page title and URL. If a page trigger is found, Policy Highlights will be started, otherwise Policy Highlights will not be loaded on the page. You can modify the trigger word list on the plugin options page under the &#8220;Page triggers&#8221; section.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
