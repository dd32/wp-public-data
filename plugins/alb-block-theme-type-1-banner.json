        "description": "<p>ALB Block Theme Type 1 Banner is a WordPress block type plug-in that is highly customizable and used for both site editing and blog post editing. This block enables users to display a banner image of full width on their WordPress sites and blog posts. On top of the banner image, users may add other child-blocks, such as ALB Theme Text Blocks, WordPress core paragraph, buttons, and even post titles, which is dynamically pulled in from database. Users are also provided a way to adjust the position of those child-blocks.</p>\n<p>One of the important features of this block plug-in is that users can also upload different images for different screen sizes such as smart phones, tablets, desktops, and wide desktops. In addition, this plug-in knows to load an appropriate version of image according to the screen size and screen density of devices of the viewers of your websites. For example, your viewers’ smart phones will NOT load the banner image of desktop version or tablet version, but mobile version only. This way, your viewers have managed to avoid loading unnecessary data and it is of great help especially if they are operating on limited data plans. In fact, throughout the development of our any digital product, it is our top priority to help end users <strong>avoid loading unnecessary and redundant data and resources</strong>.</p>\n<p>After inserting the banner block with post editor or site editor, users may adjust the banner height and which portion of the image to display. For instance, if users want to display full image, they can set the Banner Image Type to <em>Full Image</em>. Of course, you may choose other Banner Image Type and rest assured that the image will be displayed gracefully without unreasonable distortion. The part of image to be displayed can be adjusted with the options Image Horizontal Position and Image Vertical Position.</p>\n<p>Another cool feature of ALB Block Theme Type 1 Banner is that users are granted options to adjust the &#8220;background light&#8221; of the banner image by modifying the <em>Background Color</em> and <em>Image Opacity</em>.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, users may use this banner block anywhere in their site templates, post templates (and page templates), and individual blog posts and pages. The flexibility described above, however, has come with a cost, which is the fact that users have to take care of over 40 parameters. Yet you don&#8217;t worry about the complexity. You can simply start with one of 2 samples, on top of which you can fine tune other parameters. So, we have provided two buttons under <em>Basic Settings</em> panel that read <em>Try Sample 1</em> and <em>Try Sample 2</em>.</p>\n<p>Please be reminded to test your websites for different screen widths ranging from 639px to 1381px. Enjoy building your website!</p>\n",
