This plugin works for <strong>WooCommerce</strong> too.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20featured%20images%3F'>\nWhat are the featured images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Featured images (also sometimes called Post Thumbnails) are images that represent an individual Post, Page, or Custom Post Type. When you create your Theme, you can output the featured image in a number of different ways, on your archive page, in your header, or above a post, for example.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20see%20the%20%22featured%20image%22%20option%20when%20i%20edit%20a%20page%20or%20post.%20why%3F'>\nI do not see the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; option when I edit a page or post. Why?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not see the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; when you edit a WordPress post this is mostly because the support for featured images it is not enabled on your theme. To enable this you need to add this to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file: <strong>add_theme_support( &#8216;post-thumbnails&#8217; );</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20see%20the%20%22featured%20image%22%20option%20when%20i%20edit%20a%20custom%20post%20type.%20why%3F'>\nI do not see the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; option when I edit a custom post type. Why?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not see the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; when you edit a custom post type page it&#8217;s because &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; it is not added in the &#8220;supports&#8221; arguments array.<br />\nSo, when you have added the code to create the custom post type you missed to add &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; in the &#8220;supports&#8221; array. It looks similar to this: <strong>&#8216;supports&#8217; =&gt; array( &#8216;title&#8217;, &#8216;editor&#8217;, &#8216;thumbnail&#8217;, &#8216;comments&#8217;, &#8216;trackbacks&#8217;, &#8216;revisions&#8217;, &#8216;custom-fields&#8217;, &#8216;page-attributes&#8217;, &#8216;post-formats&#8217; )</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zeninvader.com/hide-featured-image-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact Us</a> if you have other questions.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
