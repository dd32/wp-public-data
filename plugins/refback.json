If you enable webmentions for that type, it will also enable refbacks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I need the Semantic Linkbacks Plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This will work independently. However, if you have that plugin, it will parse refbacks for Microformats.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I need the Webmentions Plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This will work independently. However, it will use the options in the webmentions plugin, if enabled, specifically to accept refbacks to different post types and route homepage and other archive page mentions to pages if configured.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
