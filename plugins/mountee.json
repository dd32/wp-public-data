Additional licenses should be purchased for additional sites. <a href=\"https://hellomountee.com/docs/legal/#license_agreement\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View full license agreement</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Mountee run on a 64-bit kernel?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Mountee available for Windows?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We built Mountee to make things easier for our work developing EE and WordPress sites on a Mac and it relies on an OS X specific framework called “MacFuse”.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Mountee work with git?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
