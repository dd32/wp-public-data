Depending on the site, this process usually can take up to 24 hours. If you do not see ads within 24 hours please reach out to our support team.</p>\n<p>Once your ads are showing, revenue will be generated. Please note that every day revenue from the prior day is updated to your dashboard at 5pm EST.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions, please email us at support@insticator.com.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the difference between a pageview and an ad impression?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In digital advertising, the difference between a pageview and an ad impression is commonly confused.</p>\n<p>A pageview counts whenever a web page starts loading onto a visitor’s screen; this triggers a “Page Visit Event” in analytical web tools such as Google Analytics. Pageviews, however, do not necessarily trigger an ad impression since ad impressions are counted whenever an ad unit loads onto a web page.</p>\n<p>For more information, read about the difference <a href=\"http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/understand-web-traffics-hits-pageviews-impressions-unique/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to download and install your widget code from your dashboard?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into your Insticator account, and click the Widgets section.</li>\n<li>Click View Code on the widget which has the code you want.

Please note that you can check your earning metrics from your Insticator.com account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have two widgets on the same page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to our widget’s responsive and content-saavy design, only one widget can be installed per webpage. However, you can create unlimited widgets via your Insticator account that can be installed on multiple pages throughout your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I block specific advertisers or categories from displaying on my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please send an email to support@insticator.com with a list of specific advertisers or ad categories you would like blocked.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add passback tags to the Insticator ad units?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
