        "faq": "\n<dt id='the%20bug%20was%20fixed%3F%20is%20this%20plugin%20still%20useful%3F'>\nThe bug was fixed? Is this plugin still useful?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of WordPress 5.5, this plugin no longer is necessary. They finally fixed the bug reported in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25239\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ticket #25239</a>, mentioned in this post <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-4/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress 5.5 Beta 4</a>. Thank You WordPress devs!</p>\n<p>&#8220;So is the plugin still useful?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yes, HHIF enables you to choose the &#8220;From&#8221;, &#8220;Name&#8221;, and &#8220;Return-Path&#8221; headers for all WP notification emails. And for versions of WordPress less than 5.5, this plugin continues to fix the host-header injection security issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20test%20if%20i%20need%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to test if I need the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For fixing the host-header injection security issue, this plugin is necessary only for WordPress versions less than 5.5 (they fixed the bug in WP 5.5). So if you are running WP 5.5 or better, then you do not need this plugin. Unless you want to customize the headers used in WP notification emails.</p>\n<p>If you are using WordPress less than 5.5, you can find more information on testing <a href=\"https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41963\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20for%20wp%20multisite%3F'>\nDoes this work for WP Multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if activated on an individual per-site basis. I.e., may not work properly with network-wide activation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20provide%20any%20hooks%3F'>\nDoes the plugin provide any hooks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there are numerous hooks available for advanced customization. Refer to the source code for details.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20the%20option%20for%20email%20return%20path%3F'>\nWhat about the option for Email Return Path?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the HHIF option, WP Notifications &gt; &#8220;Use custom address&#8221; is enabled, the plugin toggles open another option called &#8220;Email Return Path&#8221;. There you can check the box to use the &#8220;Email From Address&#8221; as the Return Path for all emails sent by WordPress (e.g., new user notifications, new comment notifications, login related notifications, etc.). So check/enable this option only if you want to use the &#8220;Email From Address&#8221; as the Return Path for <em>all</em> emails sent by WordPress. If in doubt, leave the option unchecked/disabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20any%20other%20security%20plugins%3F'>\nDo you offer any other security plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, three of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-bad-queries/\" rel=\"ugc\">BBQ Firewall</a> for super-fast firewall security</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blackhole-bad-bots/\" rel=\"ugc\">Blackhole for Bad Bots</a> to protect your site against bad bots</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/banhammer/\" rel=\"ugc\">Banhammer</a> to monitor and ban any user or IP address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pro versions with more features available at <a href=\"https://plugin-planet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Planet</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20gutenberg%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with Gutenberg?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, works great does not matter which editor (block or classic) is used.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='got%20a%20question%3F'>\nGot a question?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Send any questions or feedback via my <a href=\"https://plugin-planet.com/support/#contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact form</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
