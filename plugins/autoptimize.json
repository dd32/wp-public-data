It can aggregate, minify and cache scripts and styles, injects CSS in the page head by default but can also inline critical CSS and defer the aggregated full CSS, moves and defers scripts to the footer and minifies HTML. You can optimize and lazy-load images (with support for WebP and AVIF formats), optimize Google Fonts, async non-aggregated JavaScript, remove WordPress core emoji cruft and more. As such it can improve your site&#8217;s performance even when already on HTTP/2! There is extensive API available to enable you to tailor Autoptimize to each and every site&#8217;s specific needs.<br />\nIf you think performance indeed is important, you should at least consider one of the many free page caching plugins (e.g. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speed-booster-pack/\" rel=\"ugc\">Speed Booster pack</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler\" rel=\"ugc\">KeyCDN&#8217;s Cache Enabler</a>) to complement Autoptimize or even <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=aopro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">consider Autoptimize Pro</a> which not only has page caching but also image optimization, CDN, critical CSS and more!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Autoptimize Pro</strong><br />\n  <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=aopro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Autoptimize Pro is a premium Power-Up</a>, adding image optimization, CDN, page caching, automatic critical CSS rules and extra ‚Äúbooster‚Äù options, all in one handy subscription to <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=aopro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">make your site even faster!</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  We provide great <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=autoptimizepro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Premium Support and Web Performance Optimization services</a> with Accelera, check out our offering on <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=autoptimizepro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://accelerawp.com/</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Speed-surfing image under creative commons <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/twistiti/818552808/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">by LL Twistiti</a>)</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20plugin%20do%20to%20help%20speed%20up%20my%20site%3F'>\nWhat does the plugin do to help speed up my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It minifies all scripts and styles and configures your webserver to compresses them with good expires headers. JavaScript be default will be made non-render-blocking and CSS can be too by adding critical CSS. You can configure it to combine (aggregate) CSS &amp; JS-files, in which case styles are moved to the page head, and scripts to the footer. It also minifies the HTML code and can also optimize images and Google Fonts, making your page really lightweight.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='but%20i%27m%20on%20http%2F2%2C%20so%20i%20don%27t%20need%20autoptimize%3F'>\nBut I&#8217;m on HTTP/2, so I don&#8217;t need Autoptimize?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HTTP/2 is a great step forward for sure, reducing the impact of multiple requests from the same server significantly by using the same connection to perform several concurrent requests and for that reason on new installations Autoptimize will not aggregate CSS and JS files any more. That being said, <a href=\"http://engineering.khanacademy.org/posts/js-packaging-http2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">concatenation of CSS/ JS can still make a lot of sense</a>, as described in <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/http2-real-world-performance-test-analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this css-tricks.com article</a> and this <a href=\"http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2015/packaging-for-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blogpost from one of the Ebay engineers</a>. The conclusion; configure, test, reconfigure, retest, tweak and look what works best in your context. Maybe it&#8217;s just HTTP/2, maybe it&#8217;s HTTP/2 + aggregation and minification, maybe it&#8217;s HTTP/2 + minification (which AO can do as well, simply untick the &#8220;aggregate JS-files&#8221; and/ or &#8220;aggregate CSS-files&#8221; options). And Autoptimize can do a lot more then &#8220;just&#8221; optimizing your JS &amp; CSS off course üòâ</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20with%20my%20blog%3F'>\nWill this work with my blog?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although Autoptimize comes without any warranties, it will in general work flawlessly if you configure it correctly. See &#8220;Troubleshooting&#8221; below for info on how to configure in case of problems. If you want you can <a href=\"https://demo.tastewp.com/autoptimize\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">test Autoptimize on a new free dummy site, courtesy of tastewp.com</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20jquery.min.js%20not%20optimized%20when%20aggregating%20javascript%3F'>\nWhy is jquery.min.js not optimized when aggregating JavaScript?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting from AO 2.1 WordPress core&#8217;s jquery.min.js is not optimized for the simple reason a lot of popular plugins inject inline JS that is not aggregated either (due to possible cache size issues with unique code in inline JS) which relies on jquery being available, so excluding jquery.min.js ensures that most sites will work out of the box. If you want optimize jquery as well, you can remove it from the JS optimization exclusion-list (you might have to enable &#8220;also aggregate inline JS&#8221; as well or switch to &#8220;force JS in head&#8221;).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20autoptimized%20js%20render%20blocking%3F'>\nWhy is Autoptimized JS render blocking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This happens when aggregating JavaSCript and ticking the &#8220;force in head&#8221; option or when not aggregating and not deferring. Consider changing settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20autoptimized%20css%20still%20called%20out%20as%20render%20blocking%3F'>\nWhy is the autoptimized CSS still called out as render blocking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With the default Autoptimize configuration the CSS is linked in the head, which is a safe default but has Google PageSpeed Insights complaining. You can look into &#8220;inline all CSS&#8221; (easy) or &#8220;inline and defer CSS&#8221; (better) which are explained in this FAQ as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20use%20of%20%22inline%20and%20defer%20css%22%3F'>\nWhat is the use of &#8220;inline and defer CSS&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CSS in general should go in the head of the document. Recently a.o. Google started promoting deferring non-essential CSS, while inlining those styles needed to build the page above the fold. This is especially important to render pages as quickly as possible on mobile devices. As from Autoptimize 1.9.0 this is easy; select &#8220;inline and defer CSS&#8221;, paste the block of &#8220;above the fold CSS&#8221; in the input field (text area) and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='but%20how%20can%20one%20find%20out%20what%20the%20%22above%20the%20fold%20css%22%20is%3F'>\nBut how can one find out what the &#8220;above the fold CSS&#8221; is?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no easy solution for that as &#8220;above the fold&#8221; depends on where the fold is, which in turn depends on screensize. There are some tools available however, which try to identify just what is &#8220;above the fold&#8221;. <a href=\"https://github.com/addyosmani/above-the-fold-css-tools\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">This list of tools</a> is a great starting point. The <a href=\"https://www.sitelocity.com/critical-path-css-generator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sitelocity critical CSS generator</a> and <a href=\"http://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jonas Ohlsson&#8217;s criticalpathcssgenerator</a> are nice basic solutions and <a href=\"http://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=faq&amp;partner=critcss\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://criticalcss.com/</a> is a premium solution by the same Jonas Ohlsson. Alternatively <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/PaulKinlan/6284142\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this bookmarklet</a> (Chrome-only) can be helpful as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='or%20should%20you%20inline%20all%20css%3F'>\nOr should you inline all CSS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer: probably not. Although inlining all CSS will make the CSS non-render blocking, it will result in your base HTML-page getting significantly bigger thus requiring more &#8220;roundtrip times&#8221;. Moreover when considering multiple pages being requested in a browsing session the inline CSS is sent over each time, whereas when not inlined it would be served from cache. Finally the inlined CSS will push the meta-tags in the HTML down to a position where Facebook or Whatsapp might not look for it any more, breaking e.g. thumbnails when sharing on these platforms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20cache%20is%20getting%20huge%2C%20doesn%27t%20autoptimize%20purge%20the%20cache%3F'>\nMy cache is getting huge, doesn&#8217;t Autoptimize purge the cache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Autoptimize does not have its proper cache purging mechanism, as this could remove optimized CSS/JS which is still referred to in other caches, which would break your site. Moreover a fast growing cache is an indication of <a href=\"http://blog.futtta.be/2016/09/15/autoptimize-cache-size-the-canary-in-the-coal-mine/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">other problems you should avoid</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead you can keep the cache size at an acceptable level by either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>disactivating the &#8220;aggregate inline JS&#8221; and/ or &#8220;aggregate inline CSS&#8221; options</li>\n<li>excluding JS-variables (or sometimes CSS-selectors) that change on a per page (or per pageload) basis. You can read how you can do that <a href=\"http://blog.futtta.be/2014/03/19/how-to-keep-autoptimizes-cache-size-under-control-and-improve-visitor-experience/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">in this blogpost</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite above objections, there are 3rd party solutions to automatically purge the AO cache, e.g. using <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/contribution-autoptimize-cache-size-under-control-by-schedule-auto-cache-purge/\" rel=\"ugc\">this code</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bi-clean-cache/\" rel=\"ugc\">this plugin</a>, but for reasons above these are to be used only if you really know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%22clear%20cache%22%20doesn%27t%20seem%20to%20work%3F'>\n&#8220;Clear cache&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When clicking the &#8220;Delete Cache&#8221; link in the Autoptimize dropdown in the admin toolbar, you might to get a &#8220;Your cache might not have been purged successfully&#8221;. In that case go to Autoptimizes setting page and click the &#8220;Save changes &amp; clear cache&#8221;-button.</p>\n<p>Moreover don&#8217;t worry if your cache never is down to 0 files/ 0KB, as Autoptimize (as from version 2.2) will automatically preload the cache immediately after it has been cleared to speed further minification significantly up.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20site%20looks%20broken%20when%20i%20purge%20autoptimize%27s%20cache%21'>\nMy site looks broken when I purge Autoptimize&#8217;s cache!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When clearing AO&#8217;s cache, no page cache should contain pages (HTML) that refers to the removed optimized CSS/ JS. Although for that purpose there is integration between Autoptimize and some page caches, this integration does not cover 100% of setups so you might need to purge your page cache manually.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20still%20use%20cloudflare%27s%20rocket%20loader%3F'>\nCan I still use Cloudflare&#8217;s Rocket Loader?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cloudflare Rocket Loader is a pretty advanced but invasive way to make JavaScript non-render-blocking, which <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/rocket-loader-breaking-onload-js-on-linked-css/#post-9263738\" rel=\"ugc\">Cloudflare still considers Beta</a>. Sometimes Autoptimize &amp; Rocket Loader work together, sometimes they don&#8217;t. The best approach is to disable Rocket Loader, configure Autoptimize and re-enable Rocket Loader (if you think it can help) after that and test if everything still works.</p>\n<p>At the moment (June 2017) it seems RocketLoader might break AO&#8217;s &#8220;inline &amp; defer CSS&#8221;, which is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Filamentgroup‚Äôs loadCSS</a>, resulting in the deferred CSS not loading.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20tried%20autoptimize%20but%20my%20google%20pagespeed%20scored%20barely%20improved'>\nI tried Autoptimize but my Google Pagespeed Scored barely improved\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Autoptimize is not a simple &#8220;fix my Pagespeed-problems&#8221; plugin; it &#8220;only&#8221; aggregates &amp; minifies (local) JS &amp; CSS and images and allows for some nice extra&#8217;s as removing Google Fonts and deferring the loading of the CSS. As such Autoptimize will allow you to improve your performance (load time measured in seconds) and will probably also help you tackle some specific Pagespeed warnings. If you want to improve further, you will probably also have to look into e.g. page caching and your webserver configuration, which will improve real performance (again, load time as measured by e.g. https://webpagetest.org) and your &#8220;performance best practice&#8221; pagespeed ratings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20do%20with%20the%20api%3F'>\nWhat can I do with the API?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A whole lot; there are filters you can use to conditionally disable Autoptimize per request, to change the CSS- and JS-excludes, to change the limit for CSS background-images to be inlined in the CSS, to define what JS-files are moved behind the aggregated one, to change the defer-attribute on the aggregated JS script-tag, &#8230; There are examples for some filters in autoptimize_helper.php_example and in this FAQ.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20cdn%20work%3F'>\nHow does CDN work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting from version 1.7.0, CDN is activated upon entering the CDN blog root directory (e.g. http://cdn.example.net/wordpress/). If that URL is present, it will used for all Autoptimize-generated files (i.e. aggregated CSS and JS), including background-images in the CSS (when not using data-uri&#8217;s).</p>\n<p>If you want your uploaded images to be on the CDN as well, you can change the upload_url_path in your WordPress configuration (/wp-admin/options.php) to the target CDN upload directory (e.g. http://cdn.example.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/). Do take into consideration this only works for images uploaded from that point onwards, not for images that already were uploaded. Thanks to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/please-don%c2%b4t-remove-cdn?replies=15#post-4720048\" rel=\"ugc\">BeautyPirate for the tip</a>!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20my%20fonts%20put%20on%20the%20cdn%20as%20well%3F'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t my fonts put on the CDN as well?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Autoptimize supports this, but it is not enabled by default because <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/cdn-fonts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">non-local fonts might require some extra configuration</a>. But if you have your cross-origin request policy in order, you can tell Autoptimize to put your fonts on the CDN by hooking into the API, setting <code>autoptimize_filter_css_fonts_cdn</code> to <code>true</code> this way;</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'autoptimize_filter_css_fonts_cdn', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20using%20cloudflare%2C%20what%20should%20i%20enter%20as%20cdn%20root%20directory'>\nI&#8217;m using Cloudflare, what should I enter as CDN root directory\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing, when on Cloudflare your autoptimized CSS/ JS is on the Cloudflare&#8217;s CDN automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20force%20the%20aggregated%20files%20to%20be%20static%20css%20or%20js%20instead%20of%20php%3F'>\nHow can I force the aggregated files to be static CSS or JS instead of PHP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your webserver is properly configured to handle compression (gzip or deflate) and cache expiry (expires and cache-control with sufficient cacheability), you don&#8217;t need Autoptimize to handle that for you. In that case you can check the &#8220;Save aggregated script/css as static files?&#8221;-option, which will force Autoptimize to save the aggregated files as .css and .js-files (meaning no PHP is needed to serve these files). This setting is default as of Autoptimize 1.8.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20%22exclude%20from%20optimizing%22%20work%3F'>\nHow does &#8220;exclude from optimizing&#8221; work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Both CSS and JS optimization can skip code from being aggregated and minimized by adding &#8220;identifiers&#8221; to the comma-separated exclusion list. The exact identifier string to use can be determined this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if you want to exclude a specific file, e.g. wp-content/plugins/funkyplugin/css/style.css, you could simply exclude &#8220;funkyplugin/css/style.css&#8221;</li>\n<li>if you want to exclude all files of a specific plugin, e.g. wp-content/plugins/funkyplugin/js/*, you can exclude for example &#8220;funkyplugin/js/&#8221; or &#8220;plugins/funkyplugin&#8221;</li>\n<li>if you want to exclude inline code, you&#8217;ll have to find a specific, unique string in that block of code and add that to the exclusion list. Example: to exclude <code>&lt;script&gt;funky_data='Won\\'t you take me to, Funky Town'&lt;/script&gt;</code>, the identifier is &#8220;funky_data&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='troubleshooting%20autoptimize'>\nTroubleshooting Autoptimize\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have a look at the troubleshooitng instructions at https://blog.futtta.be/2022/05/05/what-to-do-when-autoptimize-breaks-your-site/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20excluded%20files%20but%20they%20are%20still%20being%20autoptimized%3F'>\nI excluded files but they are still being autoptimized?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AO minifies excluded JS/ CSS if the filename indicates the file is not minified yet.

In order for Autoptimize to be able to aggregate that, you can either disable Nextgen Gallery&#8217;s resourced manage with this code snippet <code>add_filter( 'run_ngg_resource_manager', '__return_false' );</code> or you can tell Autoptimize to initialize earlier, by adding this to your wp-config.php: <code>define(\"AUTOPTIMIZE_INIT_EARLIER\",\"true\");</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20noptimize%3F'>\nWhat is noptimize?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting with version 1.6.6 Autoptimize excludes everything inside noptimize tags, e.g.:<br />\n    &lt;!&#045;&#045;noptimize&#045;&#045;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(&#8216;this will not get autoptimized&#8217;);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;!&#045;&#045;/noptimize&#045;&#045;&gt;</p>\n<p>You can do this in your page/ post content, in widgets and in your theme files (consider creating <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">a child theme</a> to avoid your work being overwritten by theme updates).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20directory%20%26%20filename%20of%20cached%20autoptimize%20files%3F'>\nCan I change the directory &amp; filename of cached autoptimize files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you want to serve files from e.g. /wp-content/resources/aggregated_12345.css instead of the default /wp-content/cache/autoptimize/autoptimize_12345.css, then add this to wp-config.php:</p>\n<pre><code>define('AUTOPTIMIZE_CACHE_CHILD_DIR','/resources/');\ndefine('AUTOPTIMIZE_CACHEFILE_PREFIX','aggregated_');\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20non-default%20wp_content_url%20%3F'>\nDoes this work with non-default WP_CONTENT_URL ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Autoptimize does not support a non-default WP_CONTENT_URL out-of-the-box, but this can be accomplished with a couple of lines of code hooking into Autoptimize&#8217;s API.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20generated%20js%2F%20css%20be%20pre-gzipped%3F'>\nCan the generated JS/ CSS be pre-gzipped?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but this is off by default. You can enable this by passing ¬¥true¬¥ to ¬¥autoptimize_filter_cache_create_static_gzip¬¥. You&#8217;ll obviously still have to configure your webserver to use these files instead of the non-gzipped ones to avoid the overhead of on-the-fly compression.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20%22remove%20emojis%22%20do%3F'>\nWhat does &#8220;remove emojis&#8221; do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This new option in Autoptimize 2.3 removes the inline CSS, inline JS and linked JS-file added by WordPress core.

As such Autoptimize, since version 2.3, allows you to have the query string (or more precisely the &#8220;ver&#8221;-parameter) removed, but ticking &#8220;remove query strings from static resources&#8221; will have little or no impact of on your site&#8217;s performance as measured in (milli-)seconds.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%28how%29%20should%20i%20optimize%20google%20fonts%3F'>\n(How) should I optimize Google Fonts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google Fonts are typically loaded by a &#8220;render blocking&#8221; linked CSS-file. If you have a theme and plugins that use Google Fonts, you might end up with multiple such CSS-files. Autoptimize (since version 2.3) now let&#8217;s you lessen the impact of Google Fonts by either removing them alltogether or by optimizing the way they are loaded. There are two optimization-flavors; the first one is &#8220;combine and link&#8221;, which replaces all requests for Google Fonts into one request, which will still be render-blocking but will allow the fonts to be loaded immediately (meaning you won&#8217;t see fonts change while the page is loading). The alternative is &#8220;combine and load async&#8221; which uses JavaScript to load the fonts in a non-render blocking manner but which might cause a &#8220;flash of unstyled text&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='should%20i%20use%20%22preconnect%22'>\nShould I use &#8220;preconnect&#8221;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Preconnect is a somewhat advanced feature to instruct browsers (<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-rel-preconnect\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">if they support it</a>) to make a connection to specific domains even if the connection is not immediately needed. This can be used e.g. to lessen the impact of 3rd party resources on HTTPS (as DNS-request, TCP-connection and SSL/TLS negotiation are executed early). Use with care, as preconnecting to too many domains can be counter-productive.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20can%28%27t%29%20i%20async%20js%3F'>\nWhen can(&#8216;t) I async JS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>JavaScript files that are not autoptimized (because they were excluded or because they are hosted elsewhere) are typically render-blocking. By adding them in the comma-separated &#8220;async JS&#8221; field, Autoptimize will add the async flag causing the browser to load those files asynchronously (i.e. non-render blocking). This can however break your site (page), e.g. if you async &#8220;js/jquery/jquery.min.js&#8221; you will very likely get &#8220;jQuery is not defined&#8221;-errors. Use with care.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20image%20optimization%20work%3F'>\nHow does image optimization work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When image optimization is on, Autoptimize will look for png, gif, jpeg (.jpg) files in image tags and in your CSS files that are loaded from your own domain and change the src (source) to the ShortPixel CDN for those. Important: this can only work for publicly available images, otherwise the image optimization proxy will not be able to get the image to optimize it, so firewalls or proxies or password protection or even hotlinking-prevention might break image optimization.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20image%20optimization%20for%20my%20intranet%2F%20protected%20site%3F'>\nCan I use image optimization for my intranet/ protected site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No; Image optimization depends on the ability of the external image optimization service to fetch the original image from your site, optimize it and save it on the CDN. If you images cannot be downloaded by anonymous visitors (due to firewall/ proxy/ password protection/ hotlinking-protection), image optimization will not work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20more%20info%20on%20image%20optimization%3F'>\nWhere can I get more info on image optimization?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have a look at <a href=\"https://shortpixel.helpscoutdocs.com/category/60-shortpixel-ai-cdn\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shortpixel&#8217;s FAQ</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20disable%20ao%20listening%20to%20page%20cache%20purges%3F'>\nCan I disable AO listening to page cache purges?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As from AO 2.4 AO &#8220;listens&#8221; to page cache purges to clear its own cache.

Why would I need this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Autoptimize caches aggregated &amp; optimized CSS/ JS and links to those cached files are stored in the HTML, which will be stored in a page cache (which can be a plugin, can be at host level, can be at 3rd party, in the Google cache, in a browser). If there is HTML in a page cache that links to Autoptimized CSS/ JS that has been removed in the mean time (when the cache was cleared) then the page from cache will not look/ work as expected as the CSS or JS were not found (a 404 error).</p>\n<p>This setting aims to prevent things from breaking by serving &#8220;fallback&#8221; CSS or JS. The fallback-files are copies of the first Autoptimized CSS &amp; JS files created after the cache was emptied and as such will based on the homepage. This means that the CSS/ JS migth not apply 100% on other pages, but at least the impact of missing CSS/ JS will be lessened (often significantly).</p>\n<p>When the option is enabled, Autoptimize adds an <code>ErrorDocument 404</code> to the .htaccess (as used by Apache) and will also hook into WordPress core <code>template_redirect</code> to capture 404&#8217;s handled by WordPress. When using NGINX something like below should work (I&#8217;m not an NGINX specialist, but it does work for me);</p>\n<pre><code>location ~* /wp-content/cache/autoptimize/.*\\.(js|css)$ {\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /wp-content/autoptimize_404_handler.php;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this a nice alternative approach (provided by fboylovesyou);</p>\n<pre><code>location ~* /wp-content/cache/autoptimize/.*\\.(css)$ {\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /wp-content/cache/autoptimize/css/autoptimize_fallback.css;\n}\nlocation ~* /wp-content/cache/autoptimize/.*\\.(js)$ {\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /wp-content/cache/autoptimize/js/autoptimize_fallback.js;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20open%20source%20software%2F%20projects%20are%20used%20in%20autoptimize%3F'>\nWhat open source software/ projects are used in Autoptimize?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The following great open source projects are used in Autoptimize in some form or another:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mrclay/minify/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mr Clay&#8217;s Minify</a> for JS &amp; HTML minification</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tubalmartin/YUI-CSS-compressor-PHP-port\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">YUI CSS compressor PHP Port</a> for CSS minification</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lazysizes</a> for lazyload</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/w3guy/persist-admin-notices-dismissal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Persist Admin Notices Dismissal</a> for notices in the administration screens</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Update Checker</a> for automated updates from Github for the beta version</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LoadCSS</a> for deferring full CSS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery cookie</a> to store the &#8220;futtta about&#8221; category selection in a cookie</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/christianbach/tablesorter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery tablesorter</a> for the critical CSS rules/ jobs display</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/idiot/unslider/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery unslider</a> for the mini-slider in the top right corner on the main settings page (repo gone)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JavaScript-md5</a> for critical CSS rules editing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speed-booster-pack/\" rel=\"ugc\">Speed Booster Pack</a> for advanced JS deferring</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-remove-google-fonts/\" rel=\"ugc\">Disable Remove Google Fonts</a> for additional Google Font removal</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20help%3F'>\nWhere can I get help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can get help on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autoptimize\" rel=\"ugc\">wordpress.org support forum</a>.

    "description": "<p>Autoptimize makes optimizing your site really easy. It can aggregate, minify and cache scripts and styles, injects CSS in the page head by default but can also inline critical CSS and defer the aggregated full CSS, moves and defers scripts to the footer and minifies HTML. You can optimize and lazy-load images (with support for WebP and AVIF formats), optimize Google Fonts, async non-aggregated JavaScript, remove WordPress core emoji cruft and more. As such it can improve your site&#8217;s performance even when already on HTTP/2! There is extensive API available to enable you to tailor Autoptimize to each and every site&#8217;s specific needs.<br />\nIf you think performance indeed is important, you should at least consider one of the many free page caching plugins (e.g. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speed-booster-pack/\" rel=\"ugc\">Speed Booster pack</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler\" rel=\"ugc\">KeyCDN&#8217;s Cache Enabler</a>) to complement Autoptimize or even <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=aopro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">consider Autoptimize Pro</a> which not only has page caching but also image optimization, CDN, critical CSS and more!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Autoptimize Pro</strong><br />\n  <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=aopro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Autoptimize Pro is a premium Power-Up</a>, adding image optimization, CDN, page caching, automatic critical CSS rules and extra ‚Äúbooster‚Äù options, all in one handy subscription to <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=aopro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">make your site even faster!</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  We provide great <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=autoptimizepro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Premium Support and Web Performance Optimization services</a> with Accelera, check out our offering on <a href=\"https://misc.optimizingmatters.com/partners/?from=partnertab&amp;partner=autoptimizepro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://accelerawp.com/</a>!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Speed-surfing image under creative commons <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/twistiti/818552808/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">by LL Twistiti</a>)</p>\n",
