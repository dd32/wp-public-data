There are some<br />\nplugins/themes around that have some extra directories in their ZIP<br />\nfiles, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;wp-content/plugins/[plugin-name]/[files]&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;wp-content/themes/[theme-name]/[files]&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;[plugin-name]/[plugin-name]/[files]&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really want to support this stuff since this would lead to some<br />\nextra guess-work.</p>\n<p>I recommend this: if you encounter a &#8220;broken&#8221; plugin/theme just contact<br />\nthe author and politely ask him whether he might fix this. The standard<br />\nlayout of a ZIP file should be &#8220;[plugin/theme-name]/[files&#8230;]&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
