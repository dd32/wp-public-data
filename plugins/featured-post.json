        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was created to for the featured post management. Its easy and any minor wordpress developer or user can use and integrate into his wordpress theme with ease.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I use this plugin to show featured post even when i am not adding &#8220;featured=yes&#8221; before the loop?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is not a common problem, but this occurs when you are have called query_posts(***.&#8221;featured=yes&#8221;); before the normal template loop like in category.php or archive.php or even index.php. So, its a good practice to add a wp_reset_query(); after each custom query you make adding &#8220;featured=yes&#8221;. So why not add the wp_reset_query(); after the loop of featured posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is this plugin exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, this is just a simple featured posts management plugin that adds the post meta data as featured=yes for the particular post marked as featured.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does This Support Custom Post Type?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. To display featured post of any Custom Post Type pass the arguement <code>post_type=YOUR_POST_TYPE</code> along with <code>featured=yes</code>. For example, if I have custom post type &#8220;portfolio&#8221; and I want to show featured posts in post type &#8220;portfolio&#8217; (so called featured portfolio), then I would do, <code>query_posts('post_type=portfolio&amp;featured=yes')</code> before the <code>have_posts()</code> loop.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work with WP_Query() class?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely, it does. you can pass it as string type arguement like <code>$query=new WP_Query('post_type=portfolio&amp;featured=yes&amp;posts_per_page=1')</code> or even in array type arguement like <code>$query=new WP_Query(array('post_type'=&gt;'portfolio','featured'=&gt;'yes'));</code> then use how the regular WP_Query is used.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Does it work exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin actually hooks over <code>pre_get_posts</code> filter and make the WP_Query class to only fetch posts/entries which are marked featured whenever featured=yes query var is passed as query arguement(Hope that makes sense).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
