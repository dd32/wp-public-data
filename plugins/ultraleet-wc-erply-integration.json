However, you can also manually trigger product synchronization by going to the Erply Integration &gt; Synchronization page via admin menu and clicking &#8220;Synchronize now&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Note, that using this feature doesn&#8217;t immediately trigger synchronization, but will instead add the synchronization tasks to background schedule.</p>\n<p>In any case, all synchronization tasks are executed in the background via the WordPress Cron system. By default, WP-Cron executes scheduled tasks when people are visiting your site. If, however, the traffic to your site is low, this can result in quite a bit of a delay in synchronization of your products, especially if you have a large catalog.</p>\n<p>In such cases, it is advisable to hook WP-Cron into your system task scheduler. You can read how to do that <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can read more about WP-Cron <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">in the WordPress plugin handbook</a>.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Features</h3>\n<p>This plugin only synchronizes your product catalog in a single language. We are planning to release more advanced functionality, such as WPML support, product stock synchronization, price lists, orders/invoices, and more, as add-on plugins in the near future. This documentation will be updated as soon as those products become available.</p>\n<p>Our website is currently under development. In the mean time, if you are interested in hearing more about the advanced features, or even would consider hiring us to develop custom solutions for your shop, you can e-mail us directly at the following address: ultraleet [at] gmail.com.</p>\n",
