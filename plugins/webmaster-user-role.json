        "installation": "<p>Install and activate the plugin on your site. Simple Client Dashboard is built with a carefully chosen set of permissions intended for most clients and webmasters. After activation go to your client&#8217;s WordPress user profile and switch them to the new &#8220;Admin&#8221; role. If you&#8217;d like to adjust the permissions, head over to the WordPress Settings &gt; Simple Client Dashboard editor. This will open our interface for editing the settings of the Admin role. We also have a <a href=\"https://simpleclientdashboard.com?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=promo-link&amp;utm_campaign=wordpress-org&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version</a> that offers advanced customization for the Admin role including support for popular third party plugins.</p>\n",

Simple Client Dashboard offers a swift one-click solution so you can switch all your clients over quickly and easily incorporate it into your new client workflow. And in addition, most of these plugins are limited to user capabilities, while Simple Client Dashboard also provides additional capabilities and permissions that aren’t exposed by WordPress by default.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20clients%20know%20they%E2%80%99re%20not%20full%20administrators%3F'>\nWill my clients know they’re not full administrators?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not; they should still be able to perform most of the tasks they’re interested in, like adding content and managing most website functionality. They would also see their User Role set to “Admin”, which in our experience, satisfies even the most controlling clients. We suggest adding something in your project maintenance contracts that suggests that your agency is set as the “Super-Admin,” and that would be the only ones who can make dramatic or fundamental changes to their sites, such as changing themes and installing plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20question%20or%20need%20help%20with%20the%20plugin%2C%20how%20do%20i%20contact%20your%20support%20team%3F'>\nI have a question or need help with the plugin, how do I contact your support team?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To contact our support team, submit your message through our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/webmaster-user-role/#new-topic-0\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress support forum</a>.
