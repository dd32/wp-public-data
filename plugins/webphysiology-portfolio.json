        "description": "<p>The WEBphysiology Portfolio plugin was built to provide a clean, current look in situations where an expanded list-style or grid-style portfolio layout is appropriate. The plugin is implemented via a [shortcode] that supports a variety of filtering options based upon Portfolio Type.  More than one shortcode can be used on a given page, allowing for grouping portfolio records by type.  And the shortcode also supports overriding many overall option settings on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>The plugin utilizes a Custom Post Type as well as a Custom Taxonomy. It provides an Options page for specifying some customizable settings, like the number of entries to display per page. It also allows one to turn off the provided CSS in place of implementing your own.</p>\n<p>The Portfolio entry screen is customized to include just the items that make up a Portfolio entry. Attributes that aren&#8217;t populated will not be displayed on the end user interface as well as custom fields whose display has been turned off. Attaching an image to a Portfolio entry also has been made relatively painless.</p>\n<p>To enhance the design, and also reduce page weight, thumbnails of full-size imported images are generated.  Or, if you prefer, the ability to add automatic web site thumbnails utilizing ShrinkTheWeb.com or PagePeeker.com can be used.</p>\n<p>The end user interface can be adjusted using styling Portfolio Options or via your own CSS. Managing how things work within the end user interface is very customizable. Clicking thumbnail images can result in an image opening in a thickbox or it can take the visitor to the specified website URL&#8230;.  The plugin also supports video media types, such that they can be played within a thickbox.  YouTube and Vimeo URLs will automagically generate thumbnails from the referenced video without the need to provide an image URL.</p>\n<p>A good many hours have been poured into this plugin, so, appreciation in the form of a donation always brightens our day.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>NOTE: SHORTCODE DEPRECATION ALERT: The [portfolio] shortcode was replaced with [webphysiology_portfolio] in version 1.3.0</p>\n<p>NOTE: CSS DEPRECATION ALERT: The &#8220;portfolios&#8221; element ID was be deprecated in version 1.2.7</p>\n<p>I will do my best to correct any reported defects as soon as I can make time, but please understand that this is side work. That said, I also use this plugin and am keen to ensure it provides the intended functionality. As to requests for enhancements, feel free to make these. I&#8217;ll do my best to respond to your requests and, for those requests that I feel would benefit the majority of users, I&#8217;ll get them on the enhancement list. I can&#8217;t say just how quickly these would be implemented but funding the request would definitely move it up in the queue.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the WEBphysiology Portfolio ZIP file and place the <code>webphysiology-portfolio</code> folder into the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Add the necessary Portfolio Types via it&#8217;s menu under the Portfolio section</li>\n<li>Add one or more Portfolios</li>\n<li>Place the [webphysiology_portfolio] shortcode into the content area of your &#8220;portfolio&#8221; page</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Specifying a &#8216;portfolio_type&#8217; in the shortcode is not working. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Double-check that the code you are specifying is the correct one.  For example, if you&#8217;ve used the same Portfolio Type as a Tag, chances are the slug on your portfolio type had a number appended, even though you didn&#8217;t type it in when you added the type.</p>\n<p>Another cause is that sometimes, when you add the shortcode in the Visual editor, it formats the entry, especially if you&#8217;ve copied and pasted. If this happens then the plugin is unable to parse out the various components. The easiest way to see if this is happening is to flip to HTML editor mode and see if there are tags around any of the elements within the shortcode (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;).  While in the HTML editor, remove any open and close formatting tags that are found or remove the formatting while in the Visual editor screen.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get more details on using this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>More detailed information can be found here: http://webphysiology.com/plugins/webphysiology-portfolio-plugin/.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I get support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>My intention, at a minimum, is to maintain this plugin such that it is defect free.  For more detailed documentation and videos visit our <a href=\"http://webphysiology.com/plugins/webphysiology-portfolio-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WEBphysiology Portfolio plugin page</a>.  If you still aren&#8217;t finding the answer you are seeking, use our <a href=\"http://webphysiology.com/helpdesk/\" title=\"WEBphysiology Help Desk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support system</a> to log a ticket.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The thumbnail image isn&#8217;t displaying</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In some instances, when using the built-in thumbnail generator, the standard folder permissions aren&#8217;t enough. After checking that the image URL specified is correct, try upping the caching folder&#8217;s permission using the &#8220;Permission Image Cache to 0777&#8221; button in the options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The website URL I&#8217;ve specified is not being displayed as the ShrinkTheWeb.com generated thumbnail</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are specifying an inside page within your URL, then you must specifically subscribe to that level of service on your ShrinkTheWeb.com account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The styling of my Portfolio is not reflecting the changes I made in the Portfolio options.  Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The styling behavior of the WEBphysiology Portfolio can vary from theme to theme.  The reason for this is that the theme&#8217;s styling can trump the Portfolio&#8217;s styling depending upon where the styling of one or the other falls within the styling hierarchy.  If this is happening you&#8217;ll have to adjust your theme&#8217;s styling or add additional styling to allow for the portfolio&#8217;s styling to work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I close the image pop-up thickbox I still see an animated loading image.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>*** This may not be an issue any longer but has not been tested in quite awhile ***<br />There is a conflict when running WEBphysiology Portfolio and the eCommerce plugin.  This does not appear to be a fault of the WEBphysiology Portfolio plugin as no errors are returned for this plugin but quite a number of errors are being thrown by the eCommerce plugin.  If the image click option does not open the image, but instead navigates to the site URL, then this anomaly will not occur.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting strange error messages within the Portfolio Options page.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try resetting all the options by using the &#8220;Revert to Default Values&#8221; button at the bottom of the form.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
