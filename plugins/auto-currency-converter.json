For example,\n<ul>\n<li>twenty dollars</li>\n<li>few thousand dollars</li>\n<li>a couple of dollars</li>\n<li>numbers bigger than billion are not handled</li>\n<li>billion/trillion are in US style, not UK style (because it can not be supported both notations simultaneously)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I do not want to display auto-converted prices in a specific post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may suppress the conversion by giving &#8220;acc_disable&#8221; tag on the post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are USD/JPY rate correct? How much is it up-to-date?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It uses free currency converter API. However, when the API is down, this plugin uses direct value (110 yen / 1 dollar). This behaviour was changed at the version 1.2.2, I think it might be better than showing nothing converted.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are Japanese zenkaku(full-width) digits handled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All Japanese zenkaku digits are converted, then checked and filtered. Because of that, all digits in the text, even though they are not money related, will be converted with regular ASCII digits.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
