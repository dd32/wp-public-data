You can feature as many Posts and Pages as you want. You can define a picture for every single post/page which will then be automatically cropped to the right resolution (using WordPress build-in thumbnail function). WP-Featured Content Slider comes with a great option set. You can even define sliding effects such as &#8220;fade&#8221; or &#8220;slideRight&#8221; and many more. Furthermore you can adjust timeout and many Layout and Design Options (adjust image size, slider size and more). Inserting Posts/Pages to WP-Featured Content Slider is as easy as one can imagine.
