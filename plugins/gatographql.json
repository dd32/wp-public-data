        "description": "<p>Gato GraphQL is a productivity tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site. It allows you to retrieve, manipulate and store again any piece of data, in any desired way, using the GraphQL language.</p>\n<p>Use Gato GraphQL to create headless WordPress sites (using Nextjs or any other JS framework), power your Gutenberg blocks, fetch data for your theme, plugin or website, or expose an API for other applications.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL supports Persisted Queries out of the box. Persisted queries are similar to WP REST API endpoints, however they are created and published directly within the wp-admin, using the GraphQL language (and no PHP code at all).</p>\n<p>With persisted queries, you can have the great user experience of GraphQL, while having the security from a REST API, limiting clients and visitors to only query the data that you have defined in advance.</p>\n<p>You can also create public and private custom endpoints, exposing each of them for some specific target (whether different applications, clients, teams, or other), and have a private endpoint feed data to your custom Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uabFL_CoEWo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Architectural foundation</h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>optimized for speed:</strong> The query is resolved on linear time complexity, and does not suffer the &#8220;n+1&#8221; problem. The GraphQL schema is generated only the first time, and cached. The response can be cached, using standard HTTP Caching. And installing additional CPTs does not affect the speed of creating the schema.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is also <strong>fully extensible</strong>, so you can create your own extensions and integrations, to extend the GraphQL schema for your own CPTs and plugins.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>super configurable</strong>, to suit your specific needs, even endpoint by endpoint.</p>\n<p>And finally, Gato GraphQL is <strong>forward-looking</strong>, already providing features that have been proposed for the GraphQL spec but not yet released.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL provides <a href=\"https://gatographql.com/features\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">all these features</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> Multiple mechanisms are provided to help protect your data.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Endpoints:</strong> Create and expose multiple custom GraphQL schemas under their own URL, for different users, applications, external services, or other.</li>\n<li><strong>Persisted Queries:</strong> GraphQL queries which are stored in the server and accessed under their own URL, thus emulating a REST endpoint.</li>\n<li><strong>Predefined Persisted Queries:</strong> Tackle admin tasks that are common to WordPress sites, by executing an already-installed persisted query.</li>\n<li><strong>Public, Private &amp;

Use the GitHub template <a href=\"https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GatoGraphQL/ExtensionStarter</a> to create an extension, and follow the documentation there.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20gato%20graphql%20complement%20wp-cli%3F'>\nHow does Gato GraphQL complement WP-CLI?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With Gato GraphQL you can query data from the WordPress database, and then inject the results into a WP-CLI command (either to select a specific resource, or update an option with some value, or other).</p>\n<p>Check out guide <a href=\"https://gatographql.com/guides/code/complementing-wp-cli\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Complementing WP-CLI</a> for a thorough description on how to do it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20gato%20graphql%20to%20build%20headless%20sites%3F'>\nHow do I use Gato GraphQL to build headless sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With Gato GraphQL you can create an endpoint that exposes the data from your WordPress site. Then, within some framework (such as <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Next.js</a> or others) you can query the data and render the HTML.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20fetch%20gutenberg%20block%20data%20with%20gato%20graphql%3F'>\nCan I fetch Gutenberg block data with Gato GraphQL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can.

Each endpoint has its own URL, and its data is pre-defined (for the corresponding resources, such as posts, users, etc).</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL supports &#8220;Persisted Queries&#8221;, which are also endpoints with pre-defined data, however these can be created and published directly within the wp-admin, using GraphQL language (and without any PHP code).</p>\n<p>With Gato GraphQL you can also execute tailored GraphQL queries against an endpoint, indicating what specific data you need, and fetching only that within a single request.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20gato%20graphql%20plugin%20and%20its%20pro%20version%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the difference between the Gato GraphQL plugin and its PRO version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Gato GraphQL plugin maps the WordPress schema, and is enough to use GraphQL as an API, such as for building headless sites.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL PRO is needed for enhanced security for public APIs, adding HTTP caching, sending emails, executing updates in bulk, connecting to external services, and automating tasks (among others).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20gato%20graphql%20support%20wordpress%20multisite%3F'>\nDoes Gato GraphQL support WordPress Multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. Gato GraphQL can be installed on a multisite network.</p>\n<p>In addition, Gato GraphQL provides fields on the GraphQL schema to retrieve multisite network data, allowing to use GraphQL to sync content across the multisite (for instance, to translate posts when using MultilingualPress, as described below).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20gato%20graphql%20with%20polylang%3F'>\nHow to use Gato GraphQL with Polylang?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL PRO provides an integration with Polylang, allowing you to automatically translate a post&#8217;s content using the Google Translate API, and store it on all translation posts, as defined and managed via Polylang.</p>\n<p>You can also synchronize the tags, categories, and featured image, querying the values from the origin post, and setting the corresponding translated values on all the translation posts.</p>\n<p>And you can set it all up via automation, so that whenever a post in the default language is published, it is automatically translated to all languages, and stored in the corresponding translation post by Polylang.</p>\n<p>Both Polylang and Polylang PRO are supported.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://gatographql.com/demos?tag=Polylang\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gato GraphQL with Polylang demos</a> to learn more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20gato%20graphql%20with%20multilingualpress%3F'>\nHow to use Gato GraphQL with MultilingualPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL PRO provides an integration with MultilingualPress, allowing you to translate a post&#8217;s content to all languages defined in a multisite network, and store the translated content (from Google Translate) on the corresponding translation sites.</p>\n<p>And you can set it all up via automation, so that whenever a post is published, it is automatically translated to all languages, and stored in the corresponding sites in the network.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://gatographql.com/demos?tag=MultilingualPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gato GraphQL with MultilingualPress demos</a> to learn more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20gato%20graphql%20different%20than%20wpgraphql%3F'>\nHow is Gato GraphQL different than WPGraphQL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you just need to build a headless WordPress site and deploy it as static, and you&#8217;re currently using WPGraphQL, switching to Gato GraphQL will not make any difference.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, switching to Gato GraphQL provides many benefits:</p>\n<p>The &#8220;n+1&#8221; query problem just doesn&#8217;t happen, by design.</p>\n<p>When using persisted queries to expose predefined data, you can completely disable the GraphQL single endpoint, so that it is not accessible even to authenticated users.</p>\n<p>When caching the GraphQL response using standard HTTP caching, the <code>max-age</code> header is calculated automatically, from all the fields present in the GraphQL query (PRO).</p>\n<p>You can provide multiple custom endpoints, each of them customized to a specific customer or application, protecting them via a password. And you can add custom categories to them, and give them a hierarchy (such as <code>/graphql/customers/some-customer</code> and <code>/graphql/customers/another-customer</code>).</p>\n<p>You can execute updates in bulk. For instance, you can delete all comments on the site, or assign a tag or category to all your posts. And you can search and replace a string, even using a regex, on hundreds of posts (PRO).</p>\n<p>You will have access to novel GraphQL features, proposed for the spec but not yet released, including nested mutations, schema namespacing and the &#8216;oneOf&#8217; Input Object. And also dynamic variables and Multiple Query Execution (PRO).</p>\n<p>You can validate that only logged-in users, or users with a certain role or capability, or visitors from a certain IP range, can access data, on a field-by-field basis (PRO).</p>\n<p>You can compose fields, so that a foundational set of field resolvers can cover an unlimited number of use cases, and compose directives, so that a directive can be applied on an inner property from the field&#8217;s value.</p>\n<p>You can expose private endpoints, accessible only within the wp-admin, to power your Gutenberg blocks. And you can access a private GraphQL server, to fetch data for your application using PHP code, without exposing any public-facing endpoint (PRO).</p>\n<p>You can use GraphQL to retrieve, modify and finally store again the content in your site, all within a single GraphQL document (PRO). For instance, you can fetch all the Gutenberg blocks in a post, extract their properties, translate those strings via Google Translate API, insert those strings back into the block, and store the post again.</p>\n<p>You can use GraphQL to import posts from another WordPress site, from an RSS feed, from a CSV, or from any REST or GraphQL API. And you can export content as JSON and CSV. (PRO)</p>\n<p>You can invoke the API of any external service via an HTTP client (PRO). For instance, you can subscribe your WordPress users to your Mailchimp email list.</p>\n<p>You can receive and process incoming data from any service via a dedicated webhook (PRO). For instance, you can capture the newsletter emails registered in an InstaWP sandbox site and send them automatically to Mailchimp.</p>\n<p>You can use GraphQL to automate tasks and content workflows (PRO). For instance, when a new post is created (event via hook <code>draft_post</code>) you can execute a persisted query that checks if the post does not have a thumbnail and, in that case, generates one by calling the Stable Diffusion API, compresses the image via TinyPng, and finally inserts the image as the post&#8217;s featured image.</p>\n<p>And all of these additional uses cases can be achieved directly within the wp-admin, providing the GraphQL query via a user interface, without having to deploy any PHP code.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20gato%20graphql%20pro%20have%20a%20refund%20policy%3F'>\nDoes Gato GraphQL PRO have a refund policy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does.

If you are able to learn this language, then you are able to use Gato GraphQL.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20want%20to%20use%20gato%20graphql%20to%20manage%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nWhy would I want to use Gato GraphQL to manage my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GraphQL is a super powerful language`, that can achieve a lot more than just building headless sites, and it&#8217;s easy to learn.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is a generic tool that extracts all the power from GraphQL. You provide the GraphQL query directly via the wp-admin, and dozens of use cases (normally provided by dedicated plugins) become available.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is not a duplicator plugin, but you can duplicate posts with it. It is not a translation plugin, but you can translate any content, including the properties inside Gutenberg blocks. It is not an automator plugin, but you can automate your tasks, without any restriction. It is not a backup plugin, but you can import and export posts. It is not a search and replace plugin, but you can modify your posts in bulk, with a single query.

    "short_description": "The most powerful GraphQL server for WordPress. Do headless, APIs, webhooks, import/export, search &amp; replace, Google translate, and more.",
    "description": "<p>Gato GraphQL is a productivity tool for interacting with data in your WordPress site. It allows you to retrieve, manipulate and store again any piece of data, in any desired way, using the GraphQL language.</p>\n<p>Use Gato GraphQL to create headless WordPress sites (using Nextjs or any other JS framework), power your Gutenberg blocks, fetch data for your theme, plugin or website, or expose an API for other applications.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL supports Persisted Queries out of the box. Persisted queries are similar to WP REST API endpoints, however they are created and published directly within the wp-admin, using the GraphQL language (and no PHP code at all).</p>\n<p>With persisted queries, you can have the great user experience of GraphQL, while having the security from a REST API, limiting clients and visitors to only query the data that you have defined in advance.</p>\n<p>You can also create public and private custom endpoints, exposing each of them for some specific target (whether different applications, clients, teams, or other), and have a private endpoint feed data to your custom Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uabFL_CoEWo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Architectural foundation</h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>optimized for speed:</strong> The query is resolved on linear time complexity, and does not suffer the &#8220;n+1&#8221; problem. The GraphQL schema is generated only the first time, and cached. The response can be cached, using standard HTTP Caching. And installing additional CPTs does not affect the speed of creating the schema.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is also <strong>fully extensible</strong>, so you can create your own extensions and integrations, to extend the GraphQL schema for your own CPTs and plugins.</p>\n<p>Gato GraphQL is <strong>super configurable</strong>, to suit your specific needs, even endpoint by endpoint.</p>\n<p>And finally, Gato GraphQL is <strong>forward-looking</strong>, already providing features that have been proposed for the GraphQL spec but not yet released.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Gato GraphQL provides <a href=\"https://gatographql.com/features\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">all these features</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security:</strong> Multiple mechanisms are provided to help protect your data.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Endpoints:</strong> Create and expose multiple custom GraphQL schemas under their own URL, for different users, applications, external services, or other.</li>\n<li><strong>Persisted Queries:</strong> GraphQL queries which are stored in the server and accessed under their own URL, thus emulating a REST endpoint.</li>\n<li><strong>Predefined Persisted Queries:</strong> Tackle admin tasks that are common to WordPress sites, by executing an already-installed persisted query.</li>\n<li><strong>Public, Private &amp; Password-Protected Endpoints:</strong> In addition to creating and exposing public endpoints, create private endpoints, and protect a public endpoint with a password.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal Endpoint for Blocks:</strong> Fetch data for your Gutenberg blocks, via an internal GraphQL endpoint accessible within the wp-admin only.</li>\n<li><strong>API Hierarchy:</strong> Organize endpoints hierarchically, to group and expose related endpoints under a logical structure.</li>\n<li><strong>Endpoint Management:</strong> Organize custom endpoint and persisted queries by assigning them custom categories, similar to posts in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Schema namespacing:</strong> Avoid conflicts in the schema, by having all type names automatically namespaced.</li>\n<li><strong>Nested mutations:</strong> Execute a mutation within a queried entity (similar to accessing a field), and not only on the root type in the GraphQL query.</li>\n<li><strong>“Sensitive” data:</strong> Decide if to expose or not private data in a public API.</li>\n<li><strong>Global Fields:</strong> Common fields added to all types of the GraphQL schema (while being defined only once).</li>\n<li><strong>Composable directives:</strong> Expose directives that augment other directives, modifying their behavior or filling a gap.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Field Directives:</strong> Have directives applied to multiple fields (instead of only one), for performance and extended use cases.</li>\n<li><strong>&#8216;oneOf&#8217;
