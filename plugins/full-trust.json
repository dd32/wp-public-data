That means if a user visits your website and has viewed 5 pages (be it the same page 5 times or 5 different pages) then it is counted as 5 page views. In other words, every time full trust java-script loader is requested it is counted as a one page-view.</p>\n<p><strong>Do Full Trust affect loading speed ?</strong><br />\nAbsolutely not! We have taken care of it. Our developer team keeps optimizing for performance on an ongoing basis.
