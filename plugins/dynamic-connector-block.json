Reusable blocks are still static, while this plugin adds a new layer of logic so inserted blocks change automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20make%20my%20life%20easier%3F'>\nHow does this plugin make my life easier?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin makes advanced user targeting simple by allowing you to insert blocks that dynamically update their content based on the rules you set. Instead of having to update hundreds of posts when you have a new product available, you can use this plugin to make the change automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20block%20match%20my%20website%20out-of-the-box%3F'>\nWill this block match my website out-of-the-box?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The block doesnâ€™t add any styling or new front-end content, so all of your blocks will continue rendering as expected.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20this%20block%20improve%20conversion%20rates%3F'>\nHow can this block improve conversion rates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin makes it easy to display unique content based on the post itâ€™s inserted to, giving you the ability to create targeted opt-ins that match the content your reader is already choosing to consume.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20block%20require%20any%20other%20code%20or%20plugins%3F'>\nDoes this block require any other code or plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there are no dependencies required to make this block work. Other plugins and blocks can be used to insert different types of content, though.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20for%20more%20than%20email%20opt-ins%3F'>\nCan I use this for more than email opt-ins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! While we initially made it for category-specific opt-ins, we quickly realized this plugin would be more powerful and implemented new features to allow you to use it for affiliate products, self promotion, cookbooks, and more!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
