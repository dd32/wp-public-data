So this plugin simple displays a list of all future events.</p>\n<p>To be listed, an event must have its own post or page. To tell the plugin that the page is an event, you add a custom field (if you can&#8217;t see custom fields and you&#8217;re using WordPress 2.7+, you may need to add it by selecting screen options). Add a custom field with the name event_date and the value YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2009-02-03 for 3rd February 2009). Then save the page.</p>\n<p>To ouput the list of events add the text [events_list] to any post or page. You can see a demo at the <a href=\"http://www.emw.org.uk/events/en/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Evangelical Movement of Wales</a>.</p>\n<p>As I said, it&#8217;s very simple. There are no options to tweak, no settings to change. But if it&#8217;s what you need, you won&#8217;t want to change anything!</p>\n",
