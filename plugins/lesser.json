        "faq": "<h4>What is LESS?</h4>\n<p>LESS is a more efficient type of CSS language to use for customizing your themes and plugins. LESS has a lot of advanced features, but the biggest gain is that LESS allows you to nest CSS constructs so your CSS is more efficient and readable.</p>\n<h4>How does Lesser inject CSS?</h4>\n<p>Lesser uses WordPress&#8217;s built-in script management functions. Lesser Pro includes cache-busting techniques for development mode and cache-preserving minified output for production mode.</p>\n<h4>Does it work with the WordPress admin too?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you can include admin stylings too if you desire. However, Lesser PRO makes this a lot easier by providing 3 separate LESS inputs: public, admin, and common.</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m hardcore, I want manage my own LESS files</h4>\n<p>Me too. Your only LESS statement in the WordPress admin should be:</p>\n<pre><code>@import url(/url/to/less/files) </code></pre>\n<h4>Can I do a custom version of Bootstrap using Lesser?</h4>\n<p>Yes. It looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@import url(/path/to/bootstrap.less) </code></pre>\n<h4>Are you available for customizations or custom WordPress programming?</h4>\n<p>Yes, developing custom WordPress applications is my full-time occupation and has been for the last 15 years. Please contact ben at benallfree.com</p>\n",
