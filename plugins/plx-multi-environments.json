Once the environment files have been created the plugin is only used to edit the files and is not needed for the environments to function correctly.<br />\n* Modify the template files found in <code>/wp-content/plugins/plx-multienv/templates</code>, you will also need to edit the version number in <code>/wp-content/plugins/plx-multienv/plx-multienv.php</code> to 999.9.9, this will prevent updates to the plugin that would otherwise overwrite your changes. Please note this method is not recommended as it disables future updates that may fix security vulnerabilities and provide compatibility with future versions of WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
