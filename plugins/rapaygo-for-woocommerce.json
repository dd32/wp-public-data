It uses a payment network of thousands of “nodes” that create payment channels across the world. It uses a payment unit called “SAT”, which is short for “satoshis” which makes it easier to communicate about prices. 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to 100 million satoshis.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20rapaygo.com%20exclusively%20on%20%22the%20lightning%20network%22%20and%20does%20not%20provide%20payment%20services%20for%20other%20crypto%20currency%3F'>\nWhy is rapaygo.com exclusively on &#8220;The Lightning Network&#8221; and does not provide payment services for other crypto currency?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>rapaygo.com exclusively accepts Satoshis on The Lightning network for a few reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Lightning Network doesn’t charge merchants or customers high fees and chargebacks allowing us to pass savings on to our customers.</li>\n<li>The Lightning Network has instantaneous settlement, allowing you to manage your inventory and finances with more agility.</li>\n<li>We want people in the real world to adopt Bitcoin for uses in the real world as an alternative to fiat currency.</li>\n<li>We believe that the Lightning Network is the future of e-commerce.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20regulatory%20requirements%20for%20using%20trading%20bitcoin%20for%20goods%20and%20services%3F'>\nWhat is the regulatory requirements for using trading Bitcoin for goods and services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Rapaygo is not an exchange. No onramps/offramps to fiat, that&#8217;s where the regulatory stuff starts getting meaningful. Essentially rapaygo is just providing merchants a temporary wallet for barter with SATs. Asset law and taxation does apply but for the merchant, not rapaygo.</p>\n<p>Rapaygo allows the merchant to export the required data to work with common accounting applications lile Quickbooks so your accountant can apply the appropriate legal tax codes to your use of crypto as a method of exchange.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20rapaygo%20a%20bank%20or%20exchange%3F'>\nIs rapaygo a Bank or Exchange?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Essentially rapaygo is a custodial Bitcoin wallet with services that make using crypto as a form of exchange easier for small merchants, just like blue wallet or breeze. Our key difference is that we are highly focused on small merchants in real world use cases and providing extended merchant tools.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20kyc%20and%20does%20it%20apply%20to%20rapaygo%3F'>\nWhat is KYC and does it apply to rapaygo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FinCEN</a> has proposed requiring custodial wallets to collect and report KYC information on hosted wallets for transactions up to $3,000. For this reason we do not permit transactions greater than $2,500 USD on the platform.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20rapaygo%20protect%20my%20information%3F'>\nHow does rapaygo protect my information?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your personal information, email address, and all data is encrypted in our database and we NEVER share your email address with anyone.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
