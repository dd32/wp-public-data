Before saving, htaccess file can be tested for syntax errors. It also automatically creates a htaccess backup every time you make a change to the htaccess file. Htaccess backups can be restored directly from the plugin, or via FTP if the errors in htaccess file prevents WP from running normally. Great for fixing htaccess errors. For all questions, including support please use the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-htaccess-editor\" rel=\"ugc\">forum</a>.</p>\n<p>Access WP Htaccess Editor via WP Admin &#8211; Settings menu.</p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;re having problems with SSL or HTTPS try our free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-ssl/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Force SSL</a> plugin. It&#8217;s the easiest way to enable SSL and fix SSL problems.</strong></p>\n<h4>Testing Htaccess Syntax</h4>\n<p>Use the &#8220;test before saving&#8221; button to test htaccess file syntax before saving. Please note that this test does not check the logic of your htaccess file, ie if the redirects work as intended. It only checks for syntax errors. If you need to fix htaccess file we suggest restoring it to the default version and then add custom code line by line.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Htaccess Backups</h4>\n<p>Htaccess Editor makes automatic backups of htaccess file every time you make a change to it. Backups are located in <code>/wp-content/htaccess-editor-backups/</code> and timestamped so you can easily find the latest htaccess backup and restore it.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Network (WPMU) Support</h4>\n<p>WP Htaccess Editor is fully compatible and tested with WP Network (WPMU). It shows up under the Settings menu in network admin. It&#8217;s not available in individual sites as there is only one htaccess file per network.</p>\n<p>The plugin was originally developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lukenzi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lukenzi</a> in March of 2011.</p>\n<h4>GDPR compatibility</h4>\n<p>We are not lawyers. Please do not take any of the following as legal advice.<br />\nWP Htaccess Editor does not track, collect or process any user data. Nothing is logged or pushed to any 3rd parties nor do we use any 3rd party services or CDNs. Based on that, we feel it&#8217;s GDPR compatible, but again, please, don&#8217;t take this as legal advice.</p>\n",
