        "description": "<p>This plugins defines four widgets and various shortcodes to integrate WordPress and PrestaShop release 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7.</p>\n<p>This plugins defines a shortcode that can be used to display products on your blog. Only products list has been defined by using <code>[ps_product_list id_category=X n=C p=P tpl=TPL]</code> where X is the category id of the category you want to display (by default the home category 1 is used), C is the number of product you want to display (by default 10), P is the page number (by default 1) and TPL is the Smarty template to use (by default <code>product-list.tpl</code>). You may replace id_category by id_product list of product ids separated by comma.</p>\n<p>Note that the module will import the current theme of PrestaShop to your blog (both CSS and Javascript) but this is optional since 0.6. Generally you need a WordPress theme that is translated from the PrestaShop theme : it need to have the same XHTML layout and you have to replace PrestaShop HOOK markers by widget area in your blog theme, maybe like this :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"prestashop-sidebar\"&gt;&lt;ul class=\"xoxo\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php dynamic_sidebar( 'hooktop-widget-area' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .prestashop-sidebar --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Furthermore, you may need to replace internal Javascript library by the PrestaShop one to avoid conflicts. For more information about the plugin, please check <a href=\"http://www.aytechnet.fr/blog/plugin-wordpress/prestashop-integration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PrestaShop Integration</a> page in french.</p>\n<p>The available widgets are :</p>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Hook</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to insert one of the main PrestaShop hooks :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top of pages</li>\n<li>Left column block</li>\n<li>Right column block</li>\n<li>Footer</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Module</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to insert a PrestaShop module directly, the module must be attached to one of the main hooks to be displayed.</p>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Products</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to display the product list attached to a WordPress post. If there are no product attached, no output is made. This widget has been obsoleted by the following one.</p>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Template</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to display a tpl file, it may include a product list according to product attached to current post. You may still display the template even if no product have been attached to the current post.</p>\n",

This plugin add support by adding a specific controller for integration with WordPress. It could be possible to add support for PrestaShop 1.3 or older, but it need to be coded. So to get support for PrestaShop Integration, the better is that you upgrade your PrestaShop to at least 1.4 series. You will get furthermore newer functionnalities and bug fixes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20prestashop%201.4%20%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with PrestaShop 1.4 ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it should. But If It doesn&#8217;t work, you may need to update PrestaShop autoload behaviour as indicated below.</p>\n<p>PrestaShop 1.4 is an old version now, and has not been tested with this release.

For example, including a <code>_partials/stylesheet.tpl</code> file will be done like that (do not forget <code>templates</code> leading directory) :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php ps_include( 'templates/_partials/stylesheets.tpl' ); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>A new function <code>ps_body_class</code> is an helper function to automatically adds body classes for PrestaShop (inspired from the <code>body_class</code> function of WordPress). Here is an example for adding the class <code>layout-left-column</code> but removing the class <code>layout-full-width</code> given by PrestaShop :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;body id=\"wordpress\" &lt;?php body_class( ps_body_classes( 'layout-left-column', 'layout-full-width' ) ); ?&gt;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another example for a typical <code>footer.php</code> PHP calls juste before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> line (ps_get_template_vars() has been improved to simplify access to <code>$javascript.bottom</code> smarty expression here) :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php ps_set_template_vars( 'javascript', ps_get_template_vars( 'javascript', 'bottom' ) ); ?&gt;\n&lt;?php ps_include( 'templates/_partials/javascript.tpl' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;?php ps_hook( 'displayBeforeBodyClosingTag' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code is the direct translation of the PrestaShop 1.7 template code :</p>\n<pre><code>{block name='javascript_bottom'}\n  {include file=\"_partials/javascript.tpl\" javascript=$javascript.bottom}\n{/block}\n{block name='hook_before_body_closing_tag'}\n  {hook h='displayBeforeBodyClosingTag'}\n{/block}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20prestashop%208.x%20%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with PrestaShop 8.x ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe, sorry it has been untested yet, as PrestaShop 1.7 may be supported it may work as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20phenixsuite%20%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with PhenixSuite ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, PhenixSuite is a fantastic fork of PrestaShop 1.6 and support PHP 8.X as well as many other bugs fixed.

A new feature was added in version 0.9.8 to &#8220;import&#8221; PrestaShop frontpage for the WordPress frontpage but notice that no links are changed and duplicate content may appear if you do not take care.</p>\n<p>The plugin has been tested with a single PrestaShop shop and WordPress multisite and with both multishop and multisite.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20access%20my%20wordpress%20frontpage%20due%20to%20a%20redirection%20to%20the%20prestashop%20frontpage'>\nI can&#8217;t access my WordPress frontpage due to a redirection to the PrestaShop frontpage\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using PrestaShop 1.5 and you installed WordPress in root of your hosting and PrestaShop in a subdirectory, you will get this error.

    "description": "<p>This plugins defines four widgets and various shortcodes to integrate WordPress and PrestaShop release 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7.</p>\n<p>This plugins defines a shortcode that can be used to display products on your blog. Only products list has been defined by using <code>[ps_product_list id_category=X n=C p=P tpl=TPL]</code> where X is the category id of the category you want to display (by default the home category 1 is used), C is the number of product you want to display (by default 10), P is the page number (by default 1) and TPL is the Smarty template to use (by default <code>product-list.tpl</code>). You may replace id_category by id_product list of product ids separated by comma.</p>\n<p>Note that the module will import the current theme of PrestaShop to your blog (both CSS and Javascript) but this is optional since 0.6. Generally you need a WordPress theme that is translated from the PrestaShop theme : it need to have the same XHTML layout and you have to replace PrestaShop HOOK markers by widget area in your blog theme, maybe like this :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"prestashop-sidebar\"&gt;&lt;ul class=\"xoxo\"&gt;\n  &lt;?php dynamic_sidebar( 'hooktop-widget-area' ); ?&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .prestashop-sidebar --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Furthermore, you may need to replace internal Javascript library by the PrestaShop one to avoid conflicts. For more information about the plugin, please check <a href=\"http://www.aytechnet.fr/blog/plugin-wordpress/prestashop-integration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PrestaShop Integration</a> page in french.</p>\n<p>The available widgets are :</p>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Hook</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to insert one of the main PrestaShop hooks :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top of pages</li>\n<li>Left column block</li>\n<li>Right column block</li>\n<li>Footer</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Module</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to insert a PrestaShop module directly, the module must be attached to one of the main hooks to be displayed.</p>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Products</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to display the product list attached to a WordPress post. If there are no product attached, no output is made. This widget has been obsoleted by the following one.</p>\n<h4>PrestaShop Integration Template</h4>\n<p>This widget is used to display a tpl file, it may include a product list according to product attached to current post. You may still display the template even if no product have been attached to the current post.</p>\n",
