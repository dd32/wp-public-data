Also, if users already exist in WordPress, they will still be able to login, but their<br />\nuser details will might be blank.

Once it&#8217;s in there, you&#8217;ll be able to log in as the administrator.  If you are unable to log in, delete the plugin and access should be restored back to the WordPress administrator.</p>\n<h4>Can I still create accounts within WordPress?</h4>\n<p>No, this is disabled. The only way to create accounts is through your eduTrac installation.</p>\n<h4>Can I update user information within WordPress?</h4>\n<p>No, what ever information is entered on the WordPress profile page will be overwritten or destroyed on the next login. It is best to redirect the user back to eduTrac.</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m locked out!</h4>\n<p>FTP into your server, navigate to the plugins folder and rename the plugin; if it&#8217;s a database connection related error.</p>\n",
