They also need a balance of crypto-currency to purchase the memberships.</p>\n<p>The plugin enables &#8220;full-post&#8221; locking, or just block-level level locking, using the Gutemberg Editor.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses Unlock&#8217;s default checkout UI, which means it lets users who do not have wallet create an Unlock account or even pay using credit card, if your lock supports this.</p>\n<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to add a lock to your site, start by [deploying your first lock]https://app.unlock-protocol.com/locks/create). We <em>strongly</em> recommend starting with a test network such as Goerli.</p>\n<p>While the lock is deploying, you should <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlock-protocol/\" rel=\"ugc\">download this plugin</a> from the WordPress site. Then, from the administration of your WordPress.org website, in the <code>Plugins</code> section, click on the <code>Add New button and then on the</code>Upload Plugin` button to upload the plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: To allow new users to log in using their Ethereum wallet with a single click, make sure that <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Anyone can register</strong> (for single sites) or <strong>Network Settings &gt; Allow new registrations &gt; User accounts</strong> may be registered (for multisites) is enabled. Your existing users can link their wallets to their WordPress accounts regardless of this setting.</p>\n<h3>Writing locked stories</h3>\n<p>You can either choose to lock the whole post, using the post-level settings, or to lock specific Blocks in the UI with the Gutenberg Editor, for posts and pages.</p>\n<p>To add the Unlock Protocol block inside the page/post please follow the below steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on Post -&gt; Add New</li>\n<li>To add a block you just need to click on “+” in the editor.</li>\n<li>Enter Unlock Protocol in the search.</li>\n<li>Unlock Protocol block will be shown. Click on the block, the block gets added.</li>\n<li>You will be able to see block settings on the right side. From block settings, add at least one lock, select the right network and, enter its address.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once your page or post includes the content you need, you can preview its content like any other WordPress post or page. We recommend the use of a web3 wallet which supports multiple accounts so that you can easily toggle between accounts which are already members and accounts which are not members yet!</p>\n<h3>Contributing</h3>\n<p>This plugin is, like all of the Unlock code, <a href=\"https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open source</a>. You&#8217;re encouraged to fork it and make any changes you&#8217;d like! If you believe these changes would be beneficial to others, we encourage you to also open a Pull Request so that we could add these to the main branch released on the wordpress.org website!</p>\n<h4>Local Development</h4>\n<p>To setup local development environment for the plugin using we recommend using <a href=\"https://localwp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Localwp</a>. To get started, simply clone the repo from <a href=\"https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The repo includes a <code>unlock-wordpress-plugin</code> which has the required <code>.php</code> files and in which asset files (javascript, CSS and images) are added at build time.</p>\n<p>You can package the whole plugin by using <code>yarn run release</code> and install it in your local WordPress instance. Alternatively, you can add a symbolic link in the local WordPress&#8217;s <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder that points to the <code>unlock-wordpress-plugin</code>.</p>\n<h4>Publishing the plugin</h4>\n<p>In order to update the plugin, check out the current subversion state with</p>\n<pre><code>svn co  https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/unlock-protocol\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, from the GitHub repo clone, inside the <code>assets</code> folder, write</p>\n<pre><code>yarn run release\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will generate a zip file in dist directory, unzip that file and copy the content to trunk directory in svn repo and commit the changes into svn with</p>\n<pre><code>svn ci -m \"commit message\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, tag the new version (replace X and Y!) to release it:</p>\n<pre><code>svn cp trunk tags/X.Y\nsvn ci -m \"tagging version X.Y\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, please make sure you tag the version on Github:</p>\n<pre><code>git tag -a X.Y -m \"tagging version X.Y\"\ngit push origin X.Y\n</code></pre>\n<p>And finally, create the release on Github&#8217;si UI</p>\n",
