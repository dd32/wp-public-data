How can I find out where it has been leaked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We decided to start with the most simple password/domain/email check and provide only a simple answer (leaked or not leaked) for a start. Your users will be able to purchase a more in-depth report and as our affiliate you can earn commissions for referrals.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%3D%3D%20how%20do%20you%20verify%20that%20only%20authorized%20domain%20administrators%20can%20see%20if%20a%20domain%20has%20been%20leaked%3F'>\n== How do you verify that only authorized domain administrators can see if a domain has been leaked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great question. Once you query a domain, such as example.com, we will send our findings to the <strong>hostmaster</strong> email address associated with the domain (i.e. <em>hostmaster@example.com</em>). This ensures that only authorized domain administrators can view the results.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%3D%3D%20can%20you%20send%20the%20emails%20for%20the%20domain%20findings%20to%20another%20email%3F'>\n== Can you send the emails for the domain findings to another email?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For ease of use, our plugin sends domain findings to the email address <em>hostmaster@yourdomain.com</em>. Unfortunately, we cannot change this through our plugin. However, if you order our <a href=\"https://support.panomity.com/cart/dark-web-scans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dark Web Scan service</a>, we can offer different manual methods of authorization.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%3D%3D%20what%20happens%20when%20i%20search%20if%20an%20email%20address%20has%20been%20traded%20on%20the%20dark%20web%3F'>\n== What happens when I search if an email address has been traded on the dark web?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thank you for your question. To protect your privacy, we will not display our findings on the WordPress website and they will not be revealed to the WordPress webmaster. Instead, we will send an email with a link where only the account holder can review our findings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
