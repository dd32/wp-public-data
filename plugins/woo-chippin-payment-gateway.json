Consumers benefit from a simple solution to share the payments required to purchase a gift or group purchase.</p>\n<h3>New customer acquisition</h3>\n<p>Chippin gives direct contact with previously unseen and/or unknown customers &#8211; i.e. it gives access to those indirectly buying through others (e.g. tickets, gifts, holidays etc.). Whether a contributor accepts or declines the invitation, they are redirected to the merchant&#8217;s website – better than any normal referral.</p>\n<h3>Increase AOV</h3>\n<p>The social reach of Chippin allows customers to target higher price points &#8211; i.e. more people splitting the cost.</p>\n<h3>Boost the brand</h3>\n<p>Increase traffic to and engagement on the website, providing a new, valuable service to consumers. Also, provides other marketing and promotional opportunities &#8211; e.g. special promotions for group purchases and/or the organisers of group purchases.</p>\n<h3>Allays traditional fears</h3>\n<p>Chippin eliminates the anxiety of today&#8217;s manual group paying process &#8211; e.g. people failing to commit, having to chase payment; being paid in cash all at once (e.g. ticket sales); and being left &#8216;out of pocket&#8217;.</p>\n<h3>Saves time and energy</h3>\n<p>simple set-up, invitation and tracking process makes activating and managing a Chippin transaction an easy, fair, and pain-free process. By choosing to guarantee the full amount, the instigator can also ensure a successful transaction.</p>\n<h3>Opportunity to &#8216;buy better&#8217;</h3>\n<p>Chippin helps to make the more aspirational affordable for all &#8211; i.e. a group of friends are more readily able to consider higher priced items in a trouble-free manner.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p>There is no cost for having Chippin as an option in the online checkout. Chippin only deducts a service fee when a customer completes a successful transaction &#8211; i.e. when they successfully reach their monetary target within the allotted timeframe.</p>\n<p>To view the fees for using the Chippin service view our <a href=\"http://docs.chippin.co.uk/costs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pricing structure.</a></p>\n",
