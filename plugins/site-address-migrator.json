If the widget or plugin relies on data stored outside of these normal WordPress database tables, then they could stop working.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this update GUIDs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Updating GUIDs is disabled by default as recommended by WordPress, but you can enable updating GUIDs by un-commenting the corresponding line in the PHP file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
