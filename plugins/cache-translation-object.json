        "faq": "<h4>Which storage is better / faster?</h4>\n<p>The exact performance will depend on your configuration but in my testing APC is a tiny bit faster than shared memory which is a bit faster than plain file storage. Check out the plugin homepage for some graphs.</p>\n<h4>What is APC (Alternative PHP Cache)?</h4>\n<p>&#8220;The Alternative PHP Cache (APC) is a free and open opcode cache for PHP. Its goal is to provide a free, open, and robust framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not usually installed by default.</p>\n<h4>What is SHMOP (Shared Memory)?</h4>\n<p>SHMOP is a PHP interface to handle Unix shared memory segments. It should be available by default on Linux/Unix servers. On Windows it may be possible to enable in PHP.ini.</p>\n<p>On some older systems (and Windows) shared memory may have problems when multiple languages are cached. (If <code>Open slots</code> in the debug storage information keeps decreasing you should choose a different storage type.)</p>\n<h4>How do I make files writable?</h4>\n<pre><code>https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions </code></pre>\n<p>File storage write files to <code>wp-config/cache/l10n-cache/</code>. These directories will be created automatically if <code>wp-config</code> is writable at first use. Once these sub-directories are created <code>wp-config</code> should be kept write protected.</p>\n<h4>I want to change where the files are stored</h4>\n<p>Currently you&#8217;ll have to do it by hand. Find it at the top of wp-content/plugin/cache-translation-object/cache-translation-object-file.php</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>Version 1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Whitelist get_locale calls to filter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewritten to cache multiple locales separately</li>\n<li>Split out admin functions into separate file</li>\n<li>Handle old SHM with questionable delete behaviour by relocating as necessary.</li>\n<li>Add storage debug info link</li>\n<li>Do not default to any specific storage type, make user choose</li>\n<li>Tell admin when something is wrong (also better error handling).</li>\n<li>Added plugin localization</li>\n<li>Added Swedish translation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
