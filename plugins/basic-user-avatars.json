To use this feature, add the shortcode <code>[basic-user-avatars]</code> to any page in your WordPress site. We recommended placing this shortcode on another logged-in account type page, such as the WooCommerce My Account page, the Membership Account page, or any other front-end profile edit form.</p>\n<p>The Avatar Upload form is automatically added to the bbPress User Profile &gt; Edit frontend page.</p>\n<p>If you do not want your users to be able to update their avatar, navigate to Settings &gt; Discussion and locate the &#8220;Local Avatar Permissions&#8221; setting.

This means that you can disable WP User Avatar, activate Basic User Avatars, and have a seamless transition for existing avatars in your site.
