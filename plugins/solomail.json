        "description": "<p>SoloMail is a WordPress plugin designed to email an HTML-formatted copy of a single post to site subscribers or a mailing list. There are quite a few solutions out there designed to send batch digests of recent posts to subscribers on a scheduled basis. SoloMail solves a different problem &#8211; you may want to cherry pick just certain posts to go out via email, and you may want the ability to &#8220;send now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The subscriber list can EITHER be the group of all registered users on a site OR a single address, such as a mailing list. Though you can use SoloMail either way, I recommend sending through a proper mailing list, which provides advantages such as handling and unsubscribing bounced/dead addresses, and metered sending for large lists.</p>\n<p>Please send bug reports / requests via<br />\nhttp://hosting.birdhouse.org/contact/</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload to wp-content/plugins and activate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Move the two provided templates and one provided stylesheet into your current theme directory: solomail.html solomail.txt solomail-styles.css</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Visit the Settings | SoloMail section in your Dashboard. During testing, set it to send to a single address (your own). After testing, change that address to that of a mailing list to which your site administrator&#8217;s address has permission to post (SoloMail emails will be sent FROM the site administrator&#8217;s email address). Or select Registered Users for the Subscription Group Type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit the provided templates and stylesheet as needed. Don&#8217;t forget the .txt version &#8211; you can test it by selecting the &#8220;text only&#8221; view in your mail client (if you use Apple Mail, use Cmd-[  and Cmd-] to cycle through the available multipart formats). SquirrelMail is another good way to test the text version. The following set of template variables are available to both versions:</p>\n<p>{{stylesheet_url}} {{site_url}} {{site_title}} {{post_title}} {{post_author}} {{post_date}} {{post_body}} {{post_permalink}} {{newsletter_title}}</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yes, these are Django-style template variables ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>SoloMail sends multi-part email, with HTML format primary and text as a fallback. The templates are stored in your theme directory rather than in the plugin directory so that A) Your customizations won&#8217;t be overridden by a plugin update and B) you can edit them the same way you edit theme files.</p>\n<p>Feel free to use the provided templates as-is or create your own. Note that SoloMail intentionally does not attempt to use the standard WP template system. That&#8217;s because HTML email has unique needs, and shouldn&#8217;t have all the header crap and extras that appear on your site. If you&#8217;ve never sent HTML email before, see a tutorial such as http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/code-html-email-newsletters</p>\n<p>Note that if you modify a post and send it via SoloMail <em>in the same step</em>, the modifications will not be in the email. I&#8217;m not sure why this is, but you must save your changes first, <em>then</em> send it.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>How do I use SoloMail?</h4>\n<p>Select a post that&#8217;s <em>already been edited and saved</em>, and that you consider finished. At the top right of the sidebar, you&#8217;ll see a SoloMail checkbox. Select the checkbox and click the usual Update button on the post page. The email will be sent immediately to the group chosen in SoloMail options.</p>\n<p>The checkbox will not remain checked &#8211; it&#8217;s safe to edit the post again without risk of sending out mail again accidentally.</p>\n<p>Only site administrators can send email with SoloMail. On multi-author sites, administrators can send other authors&#8217; posts out, as well as their own.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to send either full posts or excerpts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that caused emails to be sent twice. This was because the WordPress post_save action actually runs twice, so needed to wrap our function in a test for presence of a global var.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
