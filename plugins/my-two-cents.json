Your commenters send BTC to the automatically generated addresses, and BlockChain.info forwards the amount to the address that you choose.</p>\n<p>Optionally, you can also use the simpler &#8220;transaction polling&#8221; method. This will add a field to your comment form asking for the commenter&#8217;s BitCoin address.
