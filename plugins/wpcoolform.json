        "faq": "<h4>I have changed my form a little bit, but the resulting form hasn&#8217;t change. Why?</h4>\n<p>If you use the code of your form, your form is always up to date. But if you&#8217;ve<br />\ncreated a wordpress page one time and change something, you have to create a new wordpress page. Also keep in mind to update all links to that page.</p>\n<h4>How can I change the design or content of a form?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First of all use the inbuild form builder, where you can change the input types, labels<br />\nheadlines and column count.</li>\n<li>Under Design Options you can insert your own CSS to change the look of your form.</li>\n<li>Of course you can also add a global CSS file to your Website.</li>\n<li>Under Settings you can generate your defined form. This leeds to a &#8220;normal&#8221; WordPress page, which you can find under pages -&gt; your form name. This page you can change as you please, but please don&#8217;t<br />\nbreak the form and input fields.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What about Captchas?</h4>\n<p>You have two options: * Use our inbuild captcha by selecting the checkbox under Settings. * use reCaptcha. Therefore you need to register at Google. The secret keys you can cut/paste under Settings.</p>\n<p>Our Captcha has two modi. If you have installed a graphical library, every captcha-image is generated on the fly. If you don&#8217;t, we use an existing image which displays a number between 1 and 100.</p>\n<h4>What about confirmation emails?</h4>\n<p>Under Email-Settings you can design your confirmation email and insert a fixed reveiver (e.g. webmaster). You can use your form field names as placeholders in your email content like: Dear [wcf.Lastname] &#8211; for a field &#8220;Lastname&#8221;. If you like to send a confirmation to your customer, you need an input field of type &#8220;Email&#8221;, also you need<br />\nto check the checkbox confirmation email. Then your customer also gets a confirmation email.</p>\n<h4>Is it possible to change the redirection URL?</h4>\n<p>You find the input field for your redirection URL under Settings-&gt;Form Data. There are also two checkboxes to append all input fields to the redirection url. So you can create multilevel input forms.</p>\n<h4>The input field mapping of the data table isn&#8217;t correct, what can I do?</h4>\n<p>WpCoolForm is very flexible, you can allways change the Form Name, also you can change field names, types, you can add and delete fields everytime. Normally this works fine. We suggest not to delete fields if user inputs already exists. You may loose these inputs as well. On the other hand adding new fields is allways possible.</p>\n",
