        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>How do you add/alter input fields on the GM Contact Form?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You don&#8217;t. If you need more or different fields I recommend that you use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" rel=\"ugc\">Contact Form 7</a>.</p>\n<p>The goal of GM Contact Form is to be as simple as possible. If you have a specific need, feel free to contact me.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What about CAPTCHA?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The plugin includes simple security that I think will be appropriate in most cases. An option for reCaptcha may<br />\nbe available in a later version.</p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the gm-contact-email folder and its contents to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
