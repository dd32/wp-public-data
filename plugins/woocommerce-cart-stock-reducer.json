This is an advanced option and should only be used on high<br />\nvolume sites with predictable orders.  The setting to use depends on your stock quantites and how much you expect to<br />\nsell.  If you have a stock of 100 and only expect to sell 10 per hour you could set this to 25 and set the expiration<br />\nto one hour and you should be safe. Always err on the side of caution, you don&#8217;t want to run out of stock when someone<br />\nbelieves they will get an item.  If in doubt, don&#8217;t use this option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20adjustments%20need%20to%20be%20made%20to%20caching%3F'>\nWhat adjustments need to be made to caching?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We recommend turning off page and database caching for pages affected by this plugin. For example, assuming your site<br />\nuses the default Woocommerce &#8220;shop&#8221; page and W3 Total Cache, add &#8220;shop/*&#8221; (without the quotes) to &#8220;Never cache the<br />\nfollowing pages:&#8221; at the page cache and database cache settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20suhosin%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with Suhosin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does, but the default character length (64) for POST/REQUEST variable names is not sufficient. I suggest following<br />\nthe recomendations from WooCommerce and increasing these values.
