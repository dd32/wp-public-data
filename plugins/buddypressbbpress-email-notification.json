I hope to add that in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I install this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using BuddyPress and bbPress together, members currently must check to see when new topics or posts are created in a member group.  This plugin sends them a detailed email about the new post.  This will drive up the activity on your group forums.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
