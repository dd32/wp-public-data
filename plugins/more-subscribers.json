        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I change the password of the subscriber?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Simply go to the subscribers account and change the password there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when a user hits submit after entering an email address?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An alert pops up letting the user know that their email address has been added to the database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about support for WPML?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible for WPML to detect strings in the plugin so these can be translated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about security and strange inputs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are multiple security checks carried out to ensure that strange inputs like php code, and sql injections are not inserted into the database as-is. Instead, such inputs are manipulated by the plugin before being inserted.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get more custom functionality?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, just leave a message behind in the forum as to what you would like to have included in the plugin and I will do my best to make time and implement the new changes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
