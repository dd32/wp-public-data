        "faq": "\n<h4>I have activated the plugin, but gallery doesn&#8217;t load.</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make sure your Flickr API key and Flickr User ID are correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>My Flickr API key and User ID are correct but the gallery doesn&#8217;t load</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make sure you add the shortcode <code>[RFG_gallery]</code> to your post or page where you want to load the gallery.  This code is case-sensitive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>When I click the photo, it doesn&#8217;t open full size photo.</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Responsive Flickr Gallery uses <em>Colorbox</em> to display full size photos.  Most likey you have another plugin enabled, which also uses the colorbox and is overriding the Responsive Flickr Gallery settings. It is recommended to deactivate any other plugins that uses colorbox.</p>\n<p>Also, some themes have built-in settings to display images using lightbox or colorbox etc. If your theme has such an option, turn it off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>I have created separate galleries with different photosets as Gallery Source, but all the galleries are using Photostream as source.</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This typically happens when you are using a plugin for editing your posts/pages. Try to remove the quotes from id parameter of the shortcode and it should work fine. For example, if the shortcode for your gallery is <code>[RFG_gallery id='1']</code>, use <code>[RFG_gallery id=1]</code> instead.</p>\n<p>Also, some themes have built-in settings to display images using lightbox or colorbox etc. If your theme has such an option, turn it off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>I made changes to my Flickr account but they don&#8217;t reflect on my website.</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Responsive Flickr Gallery uses caching to avoid expensive calls to Flickr servers. It intelligently figures out if cache needs to be updated or not. However, sometimes it may not work as expected. You should go to Default Settings and delete all cached data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>I created a gallery with source as a Group. In this gallery, only 500 photos are appearing.</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Flickr Groups have thousands of photos, it becomes very expensive to fetch all the photos from Flickr. Hence, Groups galleries are limited to latest 500 photos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>Pagination does not work as expected. It show only one page of photos but the photoset has more photos.</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check the permissions of the photos. Maybe only some photos were public. So you&#8217;ll see more photo on flickr in the set than the plugin can access.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it scale?</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, this fork was designed to avoid using a filesystem. In a cloud based environmend the filesystem might be not persistent and therefore shoudn&#8217;t be used. This plugin has been designed with the cloud in mind. Tested on heroku.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>How to customize the CSS?</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You&#8217;ll barley want to change the existing CSS because it&#8217;s so generic. But you can do with a CSS editor that lets you customize your site design without modifying your theme as you can find in the Jetpack plugin. Check rfg.css to see existing classes and properties for gallery which you can redefine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n\n",
