You can segment contacts automatically into separate groups to target them effectively.  You can also tag high-value prospects for follow-up, as VIP customers, or really anything else.  Use our super fast search and filtering options to find your contacts quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Chat Button Location:</strong> Easily move the position of the live chat box &amp; button to the bottom left or right of your website with our customization options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple Agents:</strong> Our Premium packages start with two live chat agents, and you can add additional live chat agents to support incoming conversations from your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Offline Chats:</strong> Formilla Live Chat software automatically displays as an offline version of the chat box on your site when you&#8217;re unavailable to livechat.

Most commonly, site owners are looking to chat in real-time with visitors in order to offer better customer service or to generate sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat for Customer Service</strong></p>\n<p>Data from ecommerce platform Shopify shows that “businesses that respond to a customer’s chat within five minutes are 69% more likely to get a sale.” Customers don’t like hunting around for information or waiting for responses, and live chat offers the best possible customer experience. A live chat customer service agent can speak directly to a customer, providing a personal experience leading to increased customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of live chat that businesses often overlook is the ability to learn directly from customers. Speaking to a customer who came to your site looking to solve a problem or answer a question gives you valuable insight into how real people interact with your website. Live chat customer service also helps keep customer interactions on-site, rather than seeing frustrated customers take their complaints to a public forum like social media.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat for Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>Live chat can help in multiple ways throughout the purchase funnel for your business. Talking to real human beings is one of the ways we are all most comfortable learning about new products and services, and a skilled marketer communicating to site visitors via a live chat widget can provide great opportunities to educate and engage potential customers.</p>\n<p>A live chat widget is an effective way to increase your visitor-to-lead conversion rate. By engaging potential customers right away, you’re reducing the number of visitors who “bounce” off your site. And you can also use live chat to pre-qualify leads, determining a visitor’s actual interest level in what you have to offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat for Sales</strong></p>\n<p>Using live chat to help convert site visitors into customers is often referred to as “conversational sales.” Your live chat sales team can help visitors find the products or services they are looking for quickly, can nurture leads brought to the site by marketing programs, and can answer ordering or billing questions as needed to offer a smooth transaction experience.</p>\n<p>Live chat is also a great opportunity for a sales agent to schedule a product demonstration or training session, which can be especially helpful for sites that provide things like business software. And agents can also encourage satisfied customers to share their contact information as part of the chat, in order to continue the personalized interaction in the future.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.formilla.com/blog/how-to-add-live-chat-plugin-app-for-your-site/\" title=\"live chat use cases\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">live chat use cases</a> on our blog.</p>\n<p><strong>How can live chat bots help businesses?</strong></p>\n<p>The uses of live chat bots on business websites are varied, but can be broadly categorized into customer service, marketing, and sales tasks. Automated chat bots can staff the live chat feature on your site when live chat agents aren’t available. The flexibility provided by custom bots makes them an efficient solution for handling common sales and support tasks, while freeing up your team to handle more complex inquiries. For example, you can configure multiple bots across your website based on key landing pages, learn where visitors are at in the sales process by asking them questions and collecting input, and perform specific actions based on visitor selection.</p>\n<p>Some of the popular chat bot use cases include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Triage:</strong> A live chat bot can greet site visitors and ask them to choose from several pre-defined answer buttons to guide them down a given path, similar to an automated phone system.  For example, the bot can show options such as ‘I’m new &amp; want to learn more’, ‘Track my order’, ‘Change my password’, ‘Technical help’, along with ‘Other’ if nothing matches the reason for their visit, along with a multitude of other button options based on your business needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lead Qualification:</strong> To collect contact information from site visitors as a means to generate leads, and ask additional qualifying questions to determine the size of the opportunity, gauge the customer’s interest and where they are at in the buying cycle, or route them right to your sales team or even book a demo on your calendar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scheduling:</strong> With the Calendly scheduling feature, a live chat bot can be configured to display your Calendly calendar directly inside the live chat widget for the visitor to choose from any available dates and times for a demo or phone consultation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong> A custom menu-based bot can be used to preemptively answer frequently asked questions from site visitors.  For example, let’s say you have a conference event coming up and configure a live chat bot with pre-defined buttons where the visitor can quickly choose from topics such as ticket costs, directions to the event, parking tips, event schedule, guest speakers participating, nearby hotels, and more.  This can work for a virtual conference as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Helper Bot:</strong> A Helper Bot dramatically reduces support time by automatically responding to common visitor questions at any time &#8212; day or night &#8212; using the power of Artificial Intelligence. A Helper Bot is different from the other bot types since it allows visitors to enter a free-form question, and replies with the most relevant answer based on how it has been trained over time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Your live chat widget won&#8217;t display on your WordPress website unless you have a Chat ID entered on the settings page.  You will receive this ID via email upon registering with Formilla.com via the <strong>Formilla Chat</strong> link on your WordPress admin panel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20specify%20my%20hours%20of%20operation%20or%20simply%20that%20i%20am%20unavailable%20to%20chat%3F'>\nCan I specify my hours of operation or simply that I am unavailable to chat?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

Chatbots can be configured to display your Calendly calendar directly inside the widget for the visitor to choose from any available dates and times for a demo or phone consultation. Chatbots can first qualify the visitor, and then decide whether to offer them a demo if they&#8217;re a valuable lead.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20followed%20all%20the%20instructions%20but%20i%20still%20appear%20offline%20to%20customers.%20how%20do%20i%20go%20online%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve followed all the instructions but I still appear offline to customers.

Once you&#8217;ve logged in and navigated to the dashboard (<strong>Dashboard</strong> from the main menu), you&#8217;re considered online and ready to accept chats.  Ensure your status indicator says Online in the header bar, of course. If you log off, your chat will go to offline mode.

If you&#8217;re using either of our Premium plans, you can also hide the live chat button and widget from inside your widget settings.  To do this, start by logging in to your Formilla account, then mouse over <strong>Settings</strong> and select <strong>Widgets</strong> from the submenu that appears.  On the next page, click the edit/pencil icon under Actions for your chat widget.  You should now be in the settings area, where you can select the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> tab.

We normally create your first Smart Message when you sign up, however, you can delete (or edit) it and create your own by clicking the <strong>Create Smart Message</strong> button and choosing <strong>Chat Message</strong> to get started.

What can I do to continue testing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default setting for in-app messages is to display <strong>Once</strong> after 5 seconds. With this configuration, the message will not display again.  In this case, you can test with a different browser, or modify the settings from the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> to display the widget more frequently. For instance, we recommend setting the message to display Always and to set the &#8220;Display if user has already interacted with it?&#8221; option to Yes when testing.  This way, you&#8217;ll continuously see the message.  To find the settings mentioned, mouse over <strong>Automation</strong> and click <strong>Smart Messages</strong> from the left menu, then click the edit/pencil icon next to your in-app message to enter the settings area.  Next, choose the 2nd tab called <strong>Message</strong>, and scroll down to the <strong>Edit Advanced Options</strong> accordion.

We typically recommend using a tool such as Google Analytics (free) for website analytics, as they do a good job storing and reporting on this information.  You can view how many live chats and offline submissions you receive in a given period by logging in to your Formilla account, then clicking the dropdown next to your agent picture in the top right corner of your account.

We also store any information collected from the visitor via pre-chat form fields, including name, email, phone, and also their country/region, amongst other information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20delete%20a%20contact%20from%20the%20contacts%20page%20in%20my%20formilla%20account%3F'>\nWhat happens if I delete a Contact from the Contacts page in my Formilla account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When deleting a contact from the Contacts section in your Formilla account, all conversations, including offline chats, will also be queued for deletion.

Most commonly, site owners are looking to chat in real-time with visitors in order to offer better customer service or to generate sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat for Customer Service</strong></p>\n<p>Data from ecommerce platform Shopify shows that “businesses that respond to a customer’s chat within five minutes are 69% more likely to get a sale.” Customers don’t like hunting around for information or waiting for responses, and live chat offers the best possible customer experience. A live chat customer service agent can speak directly to a customer, providing a personal experience leading to increased customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of live chat that businesses often overlook is the ability to learn directly from customers. Speaking to a customer who came to your site looking to solve a problem or answer a question gives you valuable insight into how real people interact with your website. Live chat customer service also helps keep customer interactions on-site, rather than seeing frustrated customers take their complaints to a public forum like social media.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat for Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>Live chat can help in multiple ways throughout the purchase funnel for your business. Talking to real human beings is one of the ways we are all most comfortable learning about new products and services, and a skilled marketer communicating to site visitors via a live chat widget can provide great opportunities to educate and engage potential customers.</p>\n<p>A live chat widget is an effective way to increase your visitor-to-lead conversion rate. By engaging potential customers right away, you’re reducing the number of visitors who “bounce” off your site. And you can also use live chat to pre-qualify leads, determining a visitor’s actual interest level in what you have to offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Chat for Sales</strong></p>\n<p>Using live chat to help convert site visitors into customers is often referred to as “conversational sales.” Your live chat sales team can help visitors find the products or services they are looking for quickly, can nurture leads brought to the site by marketing programs, and can answer ordering or billing questions as needed to offer a smooth transaction experience.</p>\n<p>Live chat is also a great opportunity for a sales agent to schedule a product demonstration or training session, which can be especially helpful for sites that provide things like business software. And agents can also encourage satisfied customers to share their contact information as part of the chat, in order to continue the personalized interaction in the future.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://www.formilla.com/blog/how-to-add-live-chat-plugin-app-for-your-site/\" title=\"live chat use cases\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">live chat use cases</a> on our blog.</p>\n<p><strong>How can live chat bots help businesses?</strong></p>\n<p>The uses of live chat bots on business websites are varied, but can be broadly categorized into customer service, marketing, and sales tasks. Automated chat bots can staff the live chat feature on your site when live chat agents aren’t available. The flexibility provided by custom bots makes them an efficient solution for handling common sales and support tasks, while freeing up your team to handle more complex inquiries. For example, you can configure multiple bots across your website based on key landing pages, learn where visitors are at in the sales process by asking them questions and collecting input, and perform specific actions based on visitor selection.</p>\n<p>Some of the popular chat bot use cases include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Triage:</strong> A live chat bot can greet site visitors and ask them to choose from several pre-defined answer buttons to guide them down a given path, similar to an automated phone system.  For example, the bot can show options such as ‘I’m new &amp; want to learn more’, ‘Track my order’, ‘Change my password’, ‘Technical help’, along with ‘Other’ if nothing matches the reason for their visit, along with a multitude of other button options based on your business needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lead Qualification:</strong> To collect contact information from site visitors as a means to generate leads, and ask additional qualifying questions to determine the size of the opportunity, gauge the customer’s interest and where they are at in the buying cycle, or route them right to your sales team or even book a demo on your calendar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scheduling:</strong> With the Calendly scheduling feature, a live chat bot can be configured to display your Calendly calendar directly inside the live chat widget for the visitor to choose from any available dates and times for a demo or phone consultation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong> A custom menu-based bot can be used to preemptively answer frequently asked questions from site visitors.  For example, let’s say you have a conference event coming up and configure a live chat bot with pre-defined buttons where the visitor can quickly choose from topics such as ticket costs, directions to the event, parking tips, event schedule, guest speakers participating, nearby hotels, and more.  This can work for a virtual conference as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Helper Bot:</strong> A Helper Bot dramatically reduces support time by automatically responding to common visitor questions at any time &#8212; day or night &#8212; using the power of Artificial Intelligence. A Helper Bot is different from the other bot types since it allows visitors to enter a free-form question, and replies with the most relevant answer based on how it has been trained over time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
