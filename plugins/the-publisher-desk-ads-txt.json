Because the administration of a file outside the wordpress directory can pose challenges depending on the WP/Server configuration, the plugin decides on installation whether to use an actual ads.txt file in the root of the domain, or a quasi-ads.txt file built through a WP option and responding to a server request for &#8220;/ads.txt&#8221; by providing the contents of that option (containing both custom lines and those associated with TPD&#8217;s centralalized list).</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting an installation:<br />\nIf you already have an ads.txt file present on your site, the plugin will rename it to ads-txt-original.txt on installation, and re-rename that file back on de-installation. If your site&#8217;s wordpress instance doesn&#8217;t have access to files outside of its installation directory and you already have an ads.txt file, the plugin won&#8217;t be able to dislodge the existing file and allow the management of the one it creates. You can check whether this has happened if you check your site&#8217;s ads.txt file directly (site.com/ads.txt) and there&#8217;s no line reading:<br />\n    &#8220;### END TPD ADS TXT ###&#8221;<br />\na line that is used by the plugin to demarcate custom entries and The Publisher Desk&#8217;s. If this is the case, please deactivate the plugin, rename or remove your existing file, re-activate, and check the file again (you might have to refresh several times depending on caching). If you still don&#8217;t see that line and the file looks the same as before the update, please reach out to TPD for assistance.</p>\n<p>Final Note: it&#8217;s good practice to have a backup of your custom ads.txt lines. We have functionality for retaining your custom lines on plugin updates/re-installs, but it&#8217;s good to make sure since it can be a big pain to recollect entries if you lose them.</p>\n"
