When you click on button the Video is first uploaded to VideoEncrypt servers. Then it is processed for watermarking, it can take time in minutes/hours. Once watermarking completes, you will see a download button in the video. On clicking download the video is downloaded in your WP media panel as a new Video which is watermarked.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can anyone download videos from VideoEncrypt.com ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the uploaded file does not have permissions and as soon as the video is watermarked and downloaded by you, it gets removed from our servers.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How big videos can I watermark ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The size of the video should be less than 1 GB. In future we will also add option to break and encrypt.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much time it takes to Watermark videos ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depending on Video Size and Resolution it can take from few minutes to hours.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to keep the window open when watermarking is going on ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can click on watermark for many videos and check back later on after few hours.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I report a bug?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>info@videoencrypt.com and vibethemes@gmail.com</p>\n</p>\n\n"
