If you are using the Thesis theme, skip this step, and see below.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Suggested templates to add the code to, if your theme has them: <code>author.php</code>, <code>archive.php</code>, <code>date.php</code>, <code>category.php</code>, <code>tag.php</code>, and <code>search.php</code></p>\n<p>You may also add the code to your theme&#8217;s <code>index.php</code> file, in case it is used for any of your archives or for search results.</p>\n<h4>Thesis Users</h4>\n<p>As this plugin has been packaged specifically for the Thesis theme, it&#8217;s appropriate that Thesis users have special instructions. Instead of placing <code>results_count_remix()</code> in various files, Thesis users may do the following.</p>\n<p>Open <code>custom/custom_functions.php</code> in your Thesis theme directory, and add this code:</p>\n<pre><code>if (function_exists('results_count_remix')) {\n    remove_action('thesis_hook_archive_info', 'thesis_default_archive_info');\n    add_action('thesis_hook_archive_info', 'results_count_remix');\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

Appropriate markup has been used accordingly.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
