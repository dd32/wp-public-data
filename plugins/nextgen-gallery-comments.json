Where is it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ehm.. this is my first release of my first plugin, in next versions i will ad an option page with various options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about customizing the comments page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a simple task. This plugin use the template <code>comments-nggallery.php</code> inside <code>plugins/nextgen-gallery-comments/template</code> to show comments list and form.<br />\nIf you want to customize it, copy it and paste in your theme inside <code>nggallery</code> folder (if this not exists, create it. This folder is needed to customize <a href=\"http://nextgen-gallery.com/templates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">NextGEN Gallery templates</a>)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If i click the logout button in gallery comment form, the page is bad redirected. How can i fix it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to use a filter (put it in FUNCTIONS.PHP in your theme) to change the logout url:</p>\n<p>add_filter(&#8216;your_function&#8217;,&#8217;rcwd_comment_form_defaults&#8217;);<br />\nfunction your_function($defaults){<br />\n   global $user_identity, $post_id;<br />\n   if(get_query_var(&#8216;gallery&#8217;) != &#8221;){<br />\n      $logout_url = esc_attr($_SERVER[&#8220;REQUEST_URI&#8221;]);<br />\n   }else{<br />\n      $logout_url = get_permalink($post_id);<br />\n   }<br />\n   $defaults[&#8216;logged_in_as&#8217;] = &#8216;</p>\n<p>&#8216; . sprintf( __( &#8216;Logged in as <a href=\"%1$s\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">%2$s</a>. <a href=\"%3$s\" title=\"Log out of this account\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Log out?</a>&#8216; ), admin_url( &#8216;profile.php&#8217; ), $user_identity, wp_logout_url( apply_filters( &#8216;the_permalink&#8217;, $logout_url ) ) ) . &#8216;</p>\n<p>&#8216;;<br />\n   return $defaults;</p>\n<p>}</p>\n</p>\n\n",
