Read Later Buttons will detect that the Kindle button is available and offer a checkbox for it on the widget configuration form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin uses a lot of CSS to style the buttons. Can I get rid of it and start from scratch?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! In your theme&#8217;s functions.php file, include the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>function disable_read_later_buttons_css($status) {\n    return false;\n}\nadd_filter('read_later_buttons_do_css', 'disable_read_later_buttons_css');\n</code></pre>\n<p>That will remove the CSS from the Instapaper, Pocket, and Readlater buttons whether you&#8217;re using the widget or the shortcode. You&#8217;ll have to find your own way to alter the Kindle button&#8217;s styling.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

        "1.2.1": "<ul>\n<li>Version 1.2 was released prematurely. It shouldn’t have broken anything on your sites, but it wasn’t tested like it should have been. So, I’m releasing version 1.2.1 with some code improvements &amp; optimizations that shouldn’t change anything in your experience or your readers’, but bring the code more in-line with WordPress coding standards in case someone wants to read the source to the plugin &amp; learn from it. Thanks again to Gabriel Vivas for the excellent Spanish &amp; French translations that led to this new version.</li>\n</ul>",
        "1.1": "<ul>\n<li>This release adds Javascript to figure out if a browser can display SVG images and uses them if possible. This means your Instapaper, Pocket, and Readlater buttons get Retina display-ready vector images wherever they&#039;re supported. All other users continue to get the same PNG images used in v1.0, which still weren&#039;t too bad.</li>\n</ul>",
