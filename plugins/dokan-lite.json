However, with the latest update, a significant improvement has been introduced.<br />\nNow, you can conveniently edit and update your store categories directly from the vendor edit page in the admin dashboard.

After a product has been reviewed, an email containing information about the review is sent to the vendor. The email includes details such as the reviewer’s name, product name, review rating, and text.

This was wrong in the context of a marketplace. Because the email sent by WordPress includes some sensitive information, like the admin dashboard URL, customer email address, etc. With these changes, we are making sure that only the marketplace admin gets the new review emails sent by WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Previously, there was an issue where selecting “All,” then “None,” and subsequently “All” again didn’t function as expected.

Now, only the admin can control this setting.</li>\n<li>Removed redundant <code>Store Products Per Page</code> setting under <code>Vendor Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Settings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Store Settings</code>. Since the admin already has this setting under <code>WordPress Admin Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Dokan <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Settings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> General</code>, this setting will be used from now on and only the admin can control this setting.</li>\n<li>Removed redundant <code>Store Page Product Section</code> settings under <code>Vendor Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Settings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Store Page Product Section</code>. Now, only the admin can control these settings under Theme Customizer settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>v3.8.3 ( Sep 26, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added advanced filtering and CSV export feature for vendor withdraws under Admin Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Dokan <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Withdraw menu.<br />\nThe ‘Withdraw’ page on the admin dashboard has been updated with advanced filtering and log exporting features. This allows admins to filter transactions based on payment method and date range, which enhances their ability to analyze and manage withdrawals. The feature to export CSV logs is also included, which makes tracking and record-keeping easier. These integrations aim to empower marketplace owners with comprehensive tools for efficient withdrawal management within the dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [Dokan Invoice] Added PDF invoice links on Sub Order section<br />\nPreviously PDF invoice links  was not visible on Sub Order section under customer order view. After this update customer will be able to view invoice link on sub order section.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added backend validation of phone number used on entire Dokan plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Store category widget list default state set to collapse.<br />\nPreviously, if a store has a product count over 100 or more and the store has many product categories, the store category widget would display those categories and subcategories in an open state rather than collapsed state that the sidebar style gets broken. Now the list has a max height of 500px, which will be visible, and other elements will be visible by scrolling and the parent category that has a submenu will be in collapse mode.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Various style improvements of Dokan frontend including Vendor Dashboard, Single Store Page, Single Product Page etc.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [Refund] Earlier, when refunding an order under the vendor dashboard, the tax amount decimal point rounding precision was inconsistent with WooCommerce. However, it has now been updated to be consistent with WooCommerce.</li>\n<li><strong>fix</strong> Fixed an issue where the order status label was missing on vendor dashboard for draft orders.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.8.2 ( Sep 13, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>new:</strong> Feature: Single-page product creation form.<br />\nBefore this release, vendors had to go through a two-step process to create a product. However, with this release, a single-page product creation form has been introduced. To enable this feature, you need to navigate to the WordPress admin panel <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Dokan <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Settings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Selling Options <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> One Page Product Creation.<br />\nIt’s important to note that in the next version of Dokan, the Add New Product popup and the Add New Product form will be removed. After that, the Single-Page product form will be the default system for creating a product from the vendor dashboard.</li>\n<li><strong>new:</strong> Feature: Ask for product review<br />\nThe Ask for Product Review feature in Dokan allows vendors to set the product status to draft while creating a product using the single-page product creation form. After the vendor is satisfied with the edit, they can either ask for a review or publish the product directly based on the admin settings and vendor capability.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where orders can’t be filtered by vendor under Admin Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> WooCommerce <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Order lists page if HPOS feature is enabled</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where multiple sub-orders has been created for a single parent order.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed and issue while trying to delete all demo products also deleting non-dummy products while calling the API endpoints multiple times</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where Dokan Pro’s Product Status setting were used even though Dokan Pro plugin is deactivated.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where products were visible beyond Simple Products in the product list page under the vendor dashboard when Dokan Pro was deactivated or not installed.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Removed unnecessary product type filter from Vendor Dashboard product list page since there is only one product type available in Dokan Lite</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [VendorRegistration] Improved Compatibility with WooCommerce Password Settings<br />\nIn the past, when vendors registered using the [dokan-vendor-registration] shortcode, the process did not align with WooCommerce&#8217;s automatic password generation settings. However, in the latest update, we&#8217;ve enhanced this process. The vendor registration form presented through the [dokan-vendor-registration] shortcode now seamlessly adheres to WooCommerce&#8217;s automatic password generation settings. This enhancement ensures a more unified and user-friendly registration experience for vendors, in line with WooCommerce&#8217;s standard practices.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added shipping tax fee recipient field setting under admin setup wizard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.8.1 ( Aug 25, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed a console warning under Dokan admin settings for Google Map integration</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [ReverseWithdrawal] Fixed an issue where Vendor/Admin cannot pay for reverse withdrawal balance due to a rule that vendor’s can’t purchase their own products.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.8.0 ( Aug 18, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) support for Dokan Lite.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Resolved an issue where traces of order data were left on the Dokan end even after the order had been deleted from the WordPress admin panel.<br />\nPreviously, deleted orders were still visible under the Dashboard Overview menu, Reports menu, and under Withdraw menu. This issue has been fixed in the current release.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Multiple issues have been fixed after a product of an order has been deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.7.24 ( Jul 25, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Restrictions added for vendors to review and purchase their own products.<br />\nPreviously, vendors could purchase and post reviews for their own product. Which is not logical and could manipulate the search results of a product in a marketplace. With this update, vendors will not be able to purchase or post reviews for their own product.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [ReverseWithdrawal] Now Admin can request payment from vendors using the Reverse Withdrawal feature.<br />\nCurrently, there is no way for Site admins to request payments from vendors. For some use cases, it is essential for admins to request money from vendors. For example: In Stripe 3DS mode, if customers ask for a refund, refund will be given from the admin Stripe account, after that vendor transfer will be reversed. But if the vendor doesn&#8217;t have enough money in their stripe account transfer reversal will fail, in that case, vendor balance will be negative. Another case would be for non-connected vendors, in that case, admin will be responsible for refund and admin needs to request money from vendors.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [AdminSettings] Added a toggle switch for Google ReCaptcha in the appearance settings for better control.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [AdminSettings] Sensitive information like API keys, client secrets, etc., are now displayed as password fields with an unhide button to improve security.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [AdminCommission] Now, &#8220;percentage&#8221; is selected by default if the admin setup wizard is skipped in the commission setting.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Added some missing translations.<br />\nPreviously, the template folder at dokan-lite was missing when the .pot file was generated. With this fix template folder will be respected while generating the pot file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.7.23 ( Jul 14, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where the withdraw request could not be approved from the Admin Dashboard via REST API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.7.22 ( Jul 12, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where multiple withdrawal requests can be placed via API.<br />\nIf a withdrawal request was placed by a vendor until that request was approved or rejected by Admin, making another withdrawal request wasn’t possible via frontend. However, the admin was able to make a withdrawal request via REST API. With this fix, this problem now has been resolved.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed a PHP notice for importing dummy data without providing any data via REST API<br />\nendpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/dummy-data/import</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> While updating the withdrawal request via REST API, the minimum withdrawal amount limit wasn’t considered. For example, if the minimum withdrawal limit was set to 50, for an existing withdrawal request, the admin can set the withdrawal value to less than 50. This issue has been fixed now.<br />\nendpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/withdraw/{withdraw_id}</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where store products API was returning all products instead of published products.<br />\nendpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/stores/{store_id}/products</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed some CSS issues on the vendor store settings page for the store banner image.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [Withdraw] Fixed an issue where PayPal withdraw method status was displaying default but the corresponding vendor didn’t set up the payment method yet. With this fix, we marked the payment method as needing setup instead of the default payment method.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [Withdraw] After connecting to a payment method, the button text changes from <code>Setup</code> to <code>Make default</code> or <code>default</code> if selected. But after disconnecting that method button text doesn&#8217;t change back to <code>Setup</code>. Now this issue has been fixed.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Updated vendor store API to support profile picture and banner delete feature. To delete one of these fields, one needs to set a 0 (zero) value while making the API request.<br />\nendpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/{{version}}/stores/{store_Id}</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added various html tag support for rich text editors on various places of vendor dashboard.<br />\nPreviously, the product editor on the vendor&#8217;s side was a lot more limited than the one available on the admin side. With this update, we’ve included various tags, like heading elements, paragraphs, etc support for rich text editors.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added random ordering for store REST API endpoint,<br />\nPreviously, random ordering for stores wasn’t available for store API. With this update, we’ve added this feature.<br />\nendpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/stores/</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added phone number validation for vendor dashboard store settings page and vendor registration form.<br />\nPreviously, for phone numbers only numeric values were accepted, now a valid phone number including spaces, -, _, (, ), etc also supports phone number fields.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [Withdraw] Fixed an issue where withdraw payment method wasn&#8217;t enabled but can be used for both manual withdrawal and auto withdraw disbursement schedules from the vendor dashboard payment settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.7.21 ( Jun 23, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed an issue where gateway fees from WooCommerce PayPal Payments were not being deducted from vendors’ earnings.<br />\nPreviously, Dokan deducted PayPal Checkout fees from vendors’ earnings but did not deduct PayPal Payments fees. This was due to the fact that PayPal Payments did not set transaction fee metadata at the time. With this fix, Dokan now correctly deducts PayPal Payments fees from vendors’ earnings.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [VendorDashboard] Fixed some CSS issues under the vendor dashboard.<br />\nPreviously, the positioning of the mobile navigation icon on the vendor dashboard was problematic on mobile screens. Additionally, there were inconsistencies in some table columns, including the order ID column, causing visual issues. These issues have now been fixed.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [DokanVendorRegistration] Registration page&#8217;s user selection modal is not working properly when any theme tries to use the modal for the vendor registration form.<br />\nIn earlier versions, there was a lack of synchronization between the user registration form on the &#8220;My Account&#8221; page and the user registration forms inside the modal implemented within the theme. This inconsistency created confusion and hindered the seamless registration process. However, with the latest update, significant improvements have been made to address this issue.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added <code>Become A Vendor</code> feature to Dokan Lite.<br />\nPreviously, this option was only available in Dokan Pro. This enhancement ensures that even customers of the Lite version can easily become vendors and start selling their products through the platform.</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> [SellerSetupWizard] Added store location map on the seller setup wizard<br />\nIntroducing a new enhancement in the seller setup wizard: seamless integration of a store location map. This enhancement allows sellers to effortlessly navigate and locate their store&#8217;s position within the wizard interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.7.20 ( Jun 8, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>new:</strong> Added two new filter hooks named <code>dokan_get_vendor_orders_args</code> and <code>dokan_get_vendor_orders</code> to filter vendor’s order data.<br />\nYou can now filter orders returned by the <code>dokan()-&gt;order-&gt;all()</code> method using the dokan_get_vendor_orders hook.</li>\n<li><strong>new:</strong> Added a new filter named <code>dokan_get_new_post_status</code> for the function dokan_get_new_post_status()<br />\nNow you’ll be able to use your desired status for new products created by vendors using this filter.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Fixed a security issue related to insecure deserialization in the Dummy Data importer API endpoint.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Resolved an issue where the dokan_is_seller_dashboard() method was returning false when called from a WP Post Query Loop.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Ensured that the correct order status is displayed for vendors after updating an order.<br />\nPreviously, in some cases, plugin or theme authors would hook into actions like woocommerce_order_status_changed and change the order status after it had been updated by the vendor. This update ensures that the correct order status is displayed to vendors after they update an order. Thanks to https://github.com/rmilesson for your contribution to fixing this issue.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Resolved an issue where store categories filtering was not showing proper results due to nonce validation fails.<br />\nPreviously, when using store categories as a direct link to filter vendors with no valid nonce key attached to it, the filtering was not working correctly and vendors were not being displayed under their assigned store category. This issue has been addressed and store categories filtering now shows the correct results.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Resolved inconsistent behavior of pagination on the Single Store Page.<br />\nPreviously, there were several issues with the pagination on the Single Store Page, including the “Previous” text displaying like the “Next” icon, the Last Page Menu icon not showing when all menus were visible, and the Active Page Menu background color not changing from the 4th page. These issues have been addressed and the pagination behavior is now consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> Resolved an issue where the discounted price field was not displayed correctly according to the theme used.<br />\nPreviously, when viewing the “Add/Edit a product” page on the Vendor Dashboard, the discounted price field was not displayed in the same way as the price field box when using certain themes. This issue has been addressed and the discounted price field now displays correctly according to the theme used.</li>\n<li><strong>fix:</strong> [AdminSetupWizard] The custom withdrawal method is now conditionally displayed in the admin setup wizard.<br />\nPreviously, the custom withdrawal method could not be enabled in the wizard because it required the method name and type to be populated. Now, if the admin has previously saved these values, the custom withdrawal method will be displayed and can be activated in the wizard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v3.7.19 ( May 24, 2023 )</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Separated shipping tax fee recipient from the product tax fee recipient</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Added support for multiple shipping line items for suborders</li>\n<li><strong>update:</strong> Moved shipping splitting functionality to Dokan Lite from Dokan Pro.Previously, this feature was only available on Dokan
