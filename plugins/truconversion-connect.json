With this information you&#8217;ll be able to make better design decisions by identifying where your visitor is having trouble (or is downright frustrated).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what TruConversion can do for you. Say you have an amazing product but nobody is adding it to their cart. You&#8217;ve tested your price point, new colors, better headlines, new photos&#8230;well you&#8217;ve tried just about everything and nothing has helped. Want to know why? You&#8217;re testing what YOU think is wrong and not what the visitor thinks is confusing. With TruConversion you can monitor the page to see how your user interacts. In a heatmap report (this tells you where they scroll and click), you notice that your main CTA is in an area where only 25% of your audience scrolls to. Well you know the old adage &#8220;You can&#8217;t get what you don&#8217;t ask for?&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s your page!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>So how do you use this information?
