But they don&#8217;t like WordPress messing with their quotes and dashes,<br />\nso this plug-in makes sure no one touches one of their lovingly crafted lines of code.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also very minimalistic &#8211; less than 10k, not counting the GeSHi syntax highlighting library which is also included.</p>\n<p>In addition, it&#8217;s also lazy. It will try to avoid doing as much work as possible.<br />\nThat is good, because it will not eat resources like other plug-ins out there.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Whenever you want to post some syntax highlighted code, surround it with <code>&lt;code lang=\"language\"&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code>. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;code lang=\"php\"&gt;\nclass HelloWorld()\n{\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        echo \"This is an unnecessarily long version of Hello World\";\n    }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The &#8216;lang&#8217; attribute can be entirely omitted.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Which languages are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plug-in can beautify snippets in pretty much every programming language you can think of, thanks to the huge language support provided by GeSHi (the highlighting library).</p>\n<p>These are the available languages: 4cs, 6502acme, 6502kickass, 6502tasm, 68000devpac, abap, actionscript, actionscript3, ada, algol68, apache, applescript, apt sources, asm, asp, autoconf, autohotkey, autoit, avisynth, awk, bash, basic4gl, bf, bibtex, blitzbasic, bnf, boo, c, caddcl, cadlisp, cfdg, cfm, chaiscript, cil, clojure, c_mac, cmake, cobol, cpp, cpp-qt, csharp, css, cuesheet, d, dcs, delphi, diff, div, dos, dot, e, eiffel, email, erlang, f1, fo, fortran, freebasic, fsharp, gambas, gdb, genero, genie, gettext, glsl, gml, gnuplot, go, groovy, gwbasic, haskell, hicest, hq9plus, html4strict, icon, idl, ini, inno, intercal, io, j, java, java5, javascript, kixtart, klonec, klonecpp, latex, lb, lisp, locobasic, logtalk, lolcode, lotusformulas, lotusscript, lscript, lsl2, lua, m68k, magiksf, make, mapbasic, matlab, mirc, mmix, modula2, modula3, mpasm, mxml, mysql, newlisp, nsis, oberon2, objc, objeck, ocaml, ocaml-brief, oobas, oracle8, oracle11, oxygene, oz, pascal, pcre, per, perl, perl6, pf, php, php-brief, pic16, pike, pixelbender, plsql, postgresql, povray, powerbuilder, powershell, progress, prolog, properties, providex, purebasic, python, q, qbasic, rails, rebol, reg, robots, rpmspec, rsplus, ruby, sas, scala, scheme, scilab, sdlbasic, smalltalk, smarty, sql, systemverilog, tcl, teraterm, text, thinbasic, tsql, typoscript, unicon, vala, vb, vbnet, verilog, vhdl, vim, visualfoxpro, visualprolog, whitespace, whois, winbatch, xbasic, xml, xorg_conf, xpp, z80, zxbasic.</p>\n<p>When entering the <code>lang</code> attribute in the code blocks, make sure the value you enter is exactly one of the languages in the list, or the highlighting will resort to a simple preformatted text.</p>\n<p>If you still require syntax highlighting for a language which is not in this list, you&#8217;ll have to develop your own language file.

However, don&#8217;t expect to be able to modify tons of settings. This is all about minimalism!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the Visual Editor to enter code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>My tests prove otherwise. You&#8217;ll need to use the HTML view.
