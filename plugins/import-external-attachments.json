It was developed and built (and is used everyday) at PhotographyBlogSites.com &#8211; a multisite install.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if i don&#8217;t want to import images from a third party image hosting site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can make it ignore any domain you want on the settings page, in case you work with a CDN or photo hosting site and want to keep those images where they are.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
