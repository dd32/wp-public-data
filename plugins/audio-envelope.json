        "description": "<p>This plugin renders an audio player and playlist for all audio elements within a page.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20would%20you%20want%20to%20use%20this%3F'>\nWhy would you want to use this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was designed for podcasters who might want to show their episodes from one season within one player. By creating individual posts for each episode and then adding the audio to the displayed text (ie. excerpt), a central player is rendered, pulling together all the audio into a playlist and single player. It hides the individual audio players and replaces it with a simple play button that is connected to the player.</p>\n<p>Use Audio Envelope as a way to feature a collection of audio on a single page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20the%20audio%20stop%20playing%20when%20i%20navigate%20through%20the%20site%3F'>\nWhy does the audio stop playing when I navigate through the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a &#8216;feature&#8217; of how your site is working. In order to support audio continuing to play, the content of your site needs to load dynamically, using something like React. If this is important to your site consider looking for a REACT-based theme, or seek out a developer who can build this functionality for you. It is possible, but beyond the scope of this plugin.</p>\n<p>Audio Envelope does however, support continuous play if the same audio remains on all pages that you navigate to.</p>\n<p>We are also exploring ways to &#8216;carry&#8217; the audio around with you, however the audio will pause because as the page changes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
