It is fairly simple to change this length – it only requires you to add a short piece of code to your functions.php file. However, once you add that code, it changes the length of <strong>ALL</strong> the excerpts present on your site, and you may not want that.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to shorten the length of the excerpts on your Front Page where you have 3 recent blog posts displayed horizontally in columns but you might not want to change the length of the excerpts on your Blog Page (which may be displaying 10 of your recent posts).</p>\n<p>With this plugin, you’ll be able to change the length of excerpts present at various different locations throughout your site. By default, the plugin will keep the excerpts at 55 words. If you wish to change the length for a given page/template, you can do so by specifying a number for the appropriate page/template.</p>\n",
