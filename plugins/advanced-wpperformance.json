In contrst to other performance Plugins, this one sets focus on HTTP\\2 Standards (like Server Push and SPDY).</p>\n<h4>minify assets</h4>\n<p>This plugin minifies all CSS and JS Files and caches them. It will <strong>not</strong> merge them into on file. This way you are still able to use conditional assets and if you are using HTTP/2, which I highly recommend, it&#8217;s not necessary to do so.</p>\n<h4>Optimizes JS Delivery</h4>\n<p>It moves all scripts to the footer and adds a <code>defer</code> attribute. This makes sure the scripts won&#8217;t block the page render process but will still be executed in the right order.<br />\nIn some cases, this could break inline JavaScript</p>\n<h4>Optimizes CSS Delivery</h4>\n<p>All CSS Files will be removed from the head and loaded asynchronously. This makes sure your CSS Files won&#8217;t delay the page rendering. To reduce the flash of unstyled content (FOUT) I recommend adding a Critical CSS.</p>\n<p><strong>conditonal Critical CSS</strong></p>\n<p>By default this plugin provides a textarea where you can put your critical CSS.<br />\nRead more about <a href=\"https://github.com/nico-martin/Advanced-WPPerformance#conditonal-critical-css\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Conditional critical CSS</a></p>\n<p><strong>Critical CSS API</strong></p>\n<p>We implemented an awesome new feature!<br />\nRead more about the <a href=\"https://github.com/nico-martin/Advanced-WPPerformance#critical-css-api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Critical CSS API</a>.</p>\n<h4>HTTP/2 Server Push</h4>\n<p>Server push is a HTTP/2 feature that allows you to send site assets to the user before they’ve even asked for them.<br />\nThere are two ways to achieve this. Both have their pros and cons. So this plugin supports both, the decision is up to you.</p>\n<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>\n<p>While WordPress builds your site, this plugin gets all enqueued scripts and styles and adds them as a link attribute to the response headers. That way you can be certain only files are being pushed, that are actually needed.</p>\n<p>But: Since they are set while the server builds your site, this won&#8217;t work if you&#8217;re using a server caching (which I highly recommend).</p>\n<p><strong>.htaccess</strong></p>\n<p>The second option puts all files to push inside you .htaccess. This way they are being pushed also if you&#8217;re using server caching.</p>\n<p>But: If your assets change (new versions / depreciated scripts), don&#8217;t forget to update the .htaccess. This can be done with one click while saving the settings.</p>\n<h3>Contribute</h3>\n<p>A development version of this plugin is hosted on github.
