Otherwise, you can hire me to do it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It dont work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I fixed it, sorry bout that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Whatcha got in the trunk?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Oh&#8230; You don&#8217;t wanna look in there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Lobotomy? Isn&#8217;t that for loonies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all. Friend of mine had one. Designer of the neutron bomb. You ever hear of the neutron bomb? Destroys people &#8211; leaves buildings standing. Fits in a suitcase. It&#8217;s so small, no one knows it&#8217;s there until &#8211; BLAMMO. Eyes melt, skin explodes, everybody dead. So immoral, working on the thing can drive you mad. That&#8217;s what happened to this friend of mine. So he had a lobotomy.
