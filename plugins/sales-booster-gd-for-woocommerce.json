We dare to call it &#8220;the most beneficial tool you will ever install in your online store!&#8221; Maybe our view is a little subjective but we have good reason to believe what we say.  If you are looking for an effective tool for your store, one that will gain your customers` trust and boost your sales you arrived in the right place.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do we say that?? What is Sales Booster GD?</strong></p>\n<p>It is an amazing tool that runs the recent sales from the website in popups, works seamlessly, and has an  eye catching interference. Doing a simple thing, like automatically display pop-ups of the recently bought items, will turn your hesitant visitors into buyers. Just think about it: a client enters for the first time on your online store and he doesn&#8217;t know if he can trust it or not. But then he sees these nice popup-ups with other people and their items purchased from your website.</p>\n<p>And the magic happens! &#8220;Social Proof&#8221;  is call!  These notifications will have a positive impact on the purchase decision by making your potential clients  more confident and increasing their intention to buy from you.</p>\n<p>The idea is that people trust other users reviews or actions because they have experienced it, unlike themselves. It is a psychological and social phenomenon to count on others&#8217; ratings and actions. It demonstrates a simple thing: someone else bought it from there and it`s ok to do the same. It&#8217;s not something you would do too???</p>\n<p>Even in every-day life, we all do it, we all read reviews to make up our mind on a product!</p>\n<p>Now you understand why we say it?? With just a few clicks, you will make your online store lively and gain your customers` trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Sales Booster GD to earn more sales with the same website traffic! </strong></p>\n<li>A simple plugin that displays Recent Sales Notifications</li>\n<li>Increase the trust level in your online store</li>\n<li>Shows social proof &amp; drive sales from online visitors.</li>\n<li>Help your visitors make a decision</li>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong></p>\n<li>The plugin is based on WooCommerce. Working on WooCommerce version 4.x or higher</li>\n<li>The pop-up notification will display the orders only from the last 30 days</li>\n<li>The free version will be active until you get 1000 unique visitors ( devices) per month. If this number of visitors is exceeded, the free version and its functionality will be suspended.</li>\n<li>The unique visitors counter will reset every 30 days. If you reach your traffic limit within this interval the pop-up will stop showing and you need to wait for the 30 days reset. </li>\n<li>The counting of unique visitors starts from the moment you install the plugin on your website.</li>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce Sales Booster&#8217;s Features</strong></p>\n<li>Once a customer purchased a product/service from your website the plugin will display a notification with the essential information( including the customer&#8217;s name, town/country, the details of the product and also the time when the purchased was made)</li>\n<li>The plugin has a Friendly Layout so it&#8217;s easy to use even for a non-technical person</li>\n<li>No HTML / CSS / PHP / JavaScript skills needed</li>\n<li>User-friendly notifications that will not annoy your potential clients</li>\n<li>The notifications are well placed, automated and subtle so create the illusion they are part of your website.
