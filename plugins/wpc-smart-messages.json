Basically, users can process 3 types of messages: general notices, marketing messages &amp; transactional notices.</p>\n<h4>General notices</h4>\n<p>General notices can be placed across the store, on all pages or custom selected pages. It’s often about the recent changes or important pieces of information that customers should know before adding any products to the cart or placing their order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Holiday break or vacation leave notices</li>\n<li>Changes in business hours of the store</li>\n<li>Special management amid crisis, illness, covid, etc.</li>\n<li>General policy notices</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Marketing Messages</h4>\n<p>As a marketing strategy, showing on-site messages is one of the most proficient but still simple ways to inform and educate visitors about what they need to pay attention to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce limited-time offers, give away, or sales events</li>\n<li>Cross-sell &amp; up-sell product suggestion</li>\n<li>Remind when the product is on sale or ready for preorder</li>\n<li>Urge customers with the low-threshold notice</li>\n<li>Notify when a product is nearly out of stock or will be restocked</li>\n<li>Remind customers of checking out valid discounts, gifts, or coupons</li>\n<li>Personalized message: related products that buyers might be interested in</li>\n<li>Encourage social sharing and referral for products</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Transactional Notices</h4>\n<p>Transactional notices are reminders of the buyer&#8217;s account, the special points that customers need to pay attention to during the payment process or delivery time. Any delays or special notes can be informed to customers promptly right on the cart and checkout pages to make sure they have acknowledged everything they need to know. This will avoid misunderstandings and reduce the refund/ return rate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notify the order processing time or purchase limit</li>\n<li>Encourage order value increase for free shipping or gifts</li>\n<li>Introduce available payment methods, installment or quote</li>\n<li>Inform the estimated packing and delivery time</li>\n<li>Custom cart and checkout messages</li>\n<li>Guide customers in filling out billing details &amp; addresses</li>\n<li>Encourage buyers to subscribe or log in when purchasing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Real-time Automatic Messages</h4>\n<p>Users can combine a number of date and time conditions to configure how and when the messages are visible on the site. When users insert the built-in shortcode into the message text, the displayed date and time will be calculated in real time. To strengthen the effectiveness and emphasize the urgency of the time-sensitive content, they can also use the shortcode from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-countdown-timer/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Countdown Timer</a> plugin to show a beautiful real-time countdown clock.</p>\n<p>The conditions can be complex or simple based on users’ preferences and configurations: date &amp; time, user role, product categories, tags, brands, types, attributes, etc. It’s even possible to filter special product types such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-product-bundle/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Bundles</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-composite-products/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Composite</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-grouped-product/\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart Grouped Products</a> to display customized messages on them.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-brands/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Brands</a> is a free plugin from WPClever that allows users to create and manage products by brand. Combining these two plugins, users can process and display messages on branded products with ease.</p>\n<p>WPC Smart Messages will automatically provide the precise display based on the real-time calculation of the date-time, stock, item count, cart count, cart total, discount amount or percentage, product price’s configurations.</p>\n<p>Sample messages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Black Friday event will start in 2 days 10 hours.</li>\n<li>There are 1000 people interested in this product. 200 customers have pre-ordered this.</li>\n<li>Preorder for this product will be closed on June 06.
