        "installation": "<h4>Simple Installation</h4>\n<p>The simplest way to start is to install and activate this plugin, which will enable a &#8220;View Discussions on Twitter&#8221; button as a template tag.</p>\n<p>Include the following template code where you would like the &#8220;View Discussions on Twitter&#8221; button to appear (single.php or similar):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if (function_exists('discuss_on_twitter_button')) { discuss_on_twitter_button(); } ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inserting this button tag will link to a Twitter search looking for the URL of your post.</p>\n<p>Note: the Simple installation does not enable auto-tweeting of new posts, or the prompting of direct replies to a tweet about the post.  But it is the easiest way to get started.</p>\n<h4>Advanced Installation</h4>\n<p>The advanced installation enables auto-tweeting of new posts from your account and direct connection between the &#8220;Discuss on Twitter&#8221; button and the tweet about the post.</p>\n<p>The advanced installation builds upon the awesome <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-to-twitter/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP to Twitter</a> plugin by <a href=\"http://www.joedolson.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Joseph C. Dolson</a>.</p>\n<p>After completing the steps for Simple Installation, above, do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-to-twitter/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP to Twitter</a> plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set up your <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter Developer account</a> and create a new app for your site.  This may require waiting for approval from Twitter if you are setting up your developer account for the first time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the WP to Twitter settings under &#8220;Twitter Connection&#8221; configure your API keys and secrets, as per the WP to Twitter documentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the WP to Twitter settings under &#8220;Basic Settings&#8221;, ensure that &#8220;Update when Posts are published&#8221; is checked.  This will ensure that a new tweet is posted to your timeline when you publish a post. (see screenshots)</p>\n<p>In the WordPress create/edit post screen, you&#8217;ll notice a new sidebar menu called &#8220;WP to Twitter&#8221;.  This includes an option to &#8220;Tweet&#8221; or &#8220;Don&#8217;t Tweet&#8221; when a new post is published. (see screenshots)</p>\n<p>For new posts, where tweets are created upon publishing, the &#8220;Discuss on Twitter&#8221; button will tee-up a reply to the original tweet and the &#8220;View Discussions&#8221; button will link to the tweet and its replies.</p>\n<p>For older posts which do not have a tweet associated with them, the &#8220;Discuss on Twitter&#8221; button will @mention your account, including the link to the post, and the &#8220;View Discussions&#8221; button will link to a search for mentions of your post by URL.</p>\n",
