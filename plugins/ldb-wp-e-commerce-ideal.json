(Hash Key for testing has to differ from the key used for production)</li>\n<li>iDeal URL : The address of your account&#8217;s iDeal site. Most banks require a test sequence before going live which can be done through the test URLs.</li>\n<li>iDeal PSPID URL : The address of your account&#8217;s iDeal site.</li>\n<li>iDeal urlSuccess : The URL iDeal should return your customer to after a successful payment, it would be wise to include <code>?wpsc_ajax_action=empty_cart</code> at the end of the URL to automatically empty the shopping cart.</li>\n<li>iDeal urlCancel : The URL iDeal should return your customer to after a cancelled payment.</li>\n<li>iDeal urlError : The URL iDeal should return your customer to after a failed payment.</li>\n<li>iDeal Currency : The currency used for your iDeal transactions.</li>\n<li>iDeal Language : The language version of iDeal your customers should be directed to.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>List of iDeal URLs</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Below you will find a list of iDeal URLs for several banks.
