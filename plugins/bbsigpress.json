I bet that most of you also have their blog linked in a forum signature &#8211; &#8220;Visit my great blog&#8221;.<br />\nYeah, great catch phrase.. but no matter how great your link-text is, people will get used to it. As soon as they are used to your link they won&#8217;t click it anymore &#8211; so what to do? Try out a new catch phrase every week?<br />\nWhat about this: Apart from the default link to your blog you could also give them a link to your most recent entry &#8211; together with it&#8217;s title, category, publishing date, comment count..<br />\nAnd you don&#8217;t have to do anything, even with multiple forums.<br />\nbbSigPress automatically updates your signatures when you publish a new post.</p>\n<p>Warning: This plugin is still in a very early beta state! It mostly works, but problems may occur! Use with caution!</p>\n<h4>Multiple Forums</h4>\n<p>You can define as many forums to be updated in the settings as you want!<br />\nPlease be aware that bbSigPress does basically the same as you would do &#8211; so it may take some seconds per forum.<br />\nYou simply need to enter your login details, the URL to the forum and its&#8217; type &#8211; and of course the signature.</p>\n<h4>Templates</h4>\n<p>bbSigPress not only put&#8217;s a boring link in your signature &#8211; you still have full control over the layout!<br />\nJust design and style your signature in the forum of your choice and afterwards copy the &#8220;BB-Code&#8221; to the template field of that forum.<br />\nThen put in the placeholders you want to use and you&#8217;re done!

So if you just fix some typos in your most recent posting, the plugin won&#8217;t do any useless operations. If you update the title, it will of course be updated in your signatures as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Version 0.4.3</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Various little bugfixes for problems in rare cases. (Same title but different posting, e.g.)</li>\n<li>Moved the settings to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221;-Category in dashboard. Feels better there since 2.7, i think.</li>\n<li>Added a direct link to the settings from the plugins page in dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Version 0.4.4</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now choose whether you want bbSigPress only to keep your LATEST post in your signatures or if it should put an older post back into the signatures when you save it. (Reason: When I corrected some typos in an older article, bbSigPress would always have put them into my signatures, which I didn&#8217;t want to happen.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Version 0.4.5</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes a problem with a recent phpBB update.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Version 0.4.6</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just some typos and higher vBulletin compability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Version 0.4.7</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discovered a rarely occuring bug while working on the engine for IPB, which will be added in 0.5</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Version 0.4.8</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated to WP 2.7.1 and fixed a WPMU bug</li>\n</ul>\n"
