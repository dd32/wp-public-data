        "faq": "\n<h4>\nIs this plugin compatible with PHP 5.6, 7, 7.1, 7.2, HHVM, et cetera, et cetera?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Short answer: probably. Long answer: I honestly don&#8217;t know for sure. As far as I know I didn&#8217;t use specific PHP 7 features. I made a simple plugin. That&#8217;s why I recommend a minimum of PHP 5.6. Also I do specific tests to ensure that I stay compatible with PHP 5.6</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nThis plugin breaks my site! How do I fix it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Deactivate the plugin and report this on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jquery-manager/\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin support forum</a> or report it on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Remzi1993/jquery-manager/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub project page</a>, so that I could take a look into the matter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this plugin modify my WP installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>No</strong> modification to the WordPress installation is made, therefore deactivation and/or uninstallation of this plugin returns your site to it`s original state.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhich jQuery (Migrate) version do you support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin supports the 3 jQuery branches/versions and 2 versions of jQuery Migrate. You&#8217;re able to select/activate a specific version or to disable it/turn it off completely</p>\n<p>There are two versions of jQuery Migrate. jQuery Migrate 1.x will help you update your pre-1.9 jQuery code to jQuery 1.9 up to 3.0.</p>\n<p>jQuery Migrate 3.x helps you update code to run on jQuery 3.0 or higher. Most websites need jQuery Migrate 3.x, but if you have a modern/well supported WP theme and/or plugin(s) than you could give it a try to disable it. Check your browser dev tools if you see any errors.</p>\n<p><strong>jQuery versions</strong><br />\njQuery 3.x (default is compressed/minified production)<br />\njQuery 2.x<br />\njQuery 1.x</p>\n<p><strong>jQuery Migrate versions</strong><br />\njQuery Migrate 3.x (default is compressed/minified production)<br />\njQuery Migrate 1.x</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs it possible to disable jQuery Migrate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this is possible and done in the plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs it possible to enable a specific version of jQuery (Migrate)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this is possible and done in the plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is jQuery Migrate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The jQuery Migrate plugin was created to simplify the transition from older versions of jQuery. The plugin restores deprecated features and behaviors so that older code will still run properly on newer versions of jQuery.</p>\n<p>Use the uncompressed development version to diagnose compatibility issues, it will generate warnings on the console that you can use to identify and fix problems. Use the compressed production version to simply fix compatibility issues without generating console warnings.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of jQuery Migrate. jQuery Migrate 1.x will help you update your pre-1.9 jQuery code to jQuery 1.9 up to 3.0.</p>\n<p>jQuery Migrate 3.x helps you update code to run on jQuery 3.0 or higher.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow does the jQuery Updater work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We update the plugin if a new version of jQuery is released. If you update the plugin, all jQuery versions will be updated.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
