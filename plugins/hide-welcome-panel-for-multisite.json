WordPress uses the following rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On site creation, a flag is set for the user to show the welcome panel the next time they visit a site they own, as long as they&#8217;ve never seen the welcome panel before.</li>\n<li>Once the user dismisses the panel on one site, it is dismissed on all sites they own, and they will not see it on new sites.</li>\n<li>An owner is determined by comparing the site&#8217;s admin email to the user&#8217;s email.</li>\n<li>The panel is still accessible via the Screen Options tab.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this retroactively hide the welcome panel for sites created before the plugin was installed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It is assumed that if you&#8217;re installing this plugin, you don&#8217;t want any site owners to be presented with the welcome panel, regardless when the site was created.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
