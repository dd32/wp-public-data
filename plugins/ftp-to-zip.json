Point towards &#8216;http://example.com/run.php&#8217;</li>\n<li>Simply follow the on screen instruction, it absolutely looks like the default WordPress installation screen.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>No WordPress Installation ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the first version of the Plugin. Definitely there will be lot of features like premium plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I heard that these Backup Plugins are mostly paid software ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes they are. But as you can see, this is a fully free plugin, aditionally many features will be added like uploading to Rackspace Cloud Files with cURL, Amazon S3, auto upload to almost all Free Cloud Storages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the major difference between this WordPress FTP Full Backup Plugin and Others ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This Plugin uses the PHP memory from outside WordPress. This is important for servers with low config. In future, there will be API based integration with WordPress Admin panel, but unlike other plugins it will never put stress on the working WordPress installation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the recomanded settings for .htaccess ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Set your PHP memory limit beyond 512 MB for smooth function. Simply add this line at the begining of your .htaccess file of the root :</p>\n<p>php_value memory_limit 1024M</p>\n<p>Ask your web host, the limit on PHP. If you can set PHP memory to higher yourself, doing alone will suffice.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to Donate ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thanks. Not needed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
