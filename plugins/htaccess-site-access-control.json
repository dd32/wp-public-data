        "installation": "<p>The installation and use is very straightforward. You should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder <code>htaccess-site-access-control</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>From the &#8216;Settings&#8217; menu, there will be a new option, called &#8216;.htaccess Site Access Control&#8217;</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Which options do you modify?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0, you can choose between the following options:<br />\n1. Enabling/disabling the password protection to wp-login.php, WordPress admin pages, and/or the whole site. Note that you&#8217;ll be asked to re-type the .htaccess username/password you created before enabling any of the settings &#8211; to ensure that you wouldn&#8217;t enable the password protection without even knowing the password yourself!<br />\n2. Modifying the existing users: you can change any .htaccess user&#8217;s password and remove the users.<br />\n3. Adding a new .htaccess user.</p>\n<p>Note that you have to have at least one user to be able to enable any of the options: otherwise you would be locked out!</p>\n<p>For more information and support, check out: http://www.wpsos.io/wordpress-plugin-htaccess-site-access-control/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin is giving a warning that some of the files need to be writable for it to work, what does this mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the plugin is protecting your site via modifying .htaccess and .htpasswd files, it works only if these files are writable by WordPress. If the files don&#8217;t exist, you can just create empty writable files to the location brought out in the plugin&#8217;s warning. You can also see from there which files are already writable and which not.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I forgot my password, and got locked out from the site! What can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For accessing your site again, you have to modify two files:<br />\n1. .htaccess file in your WordPress root directory (the directory where the file wp-config.php is located);<br />\n2. .htaccess file in your WordPress wp-admin folder</p>\n<p>From both files, delete everything BETWEEN these two lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li># BEGIN WPSOS htaccess plugin</li>\n<li># END WPSOS htaccess plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT: Before modifying either of the files, make a copy of them!</p>\n<p>For accessing the files, either use FTP or log in to your web hosting service provider, usually they also enable direct file modification.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get some support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out our site, at: http://www.wpsos.io/wordpress-plugin-htaccess-site-access-control/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have some suggestions for other options I want edited</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Let us know, via: http://www.wpsos.io/wordpress-plugin-htaccess-site-access-control/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
