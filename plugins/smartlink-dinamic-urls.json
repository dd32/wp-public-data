When that happens, odds of seeing the same page are higher if less URLs are used.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%26iquest%3Bhow%20does%20smartlink%20du%20works%3F'>\n&iquest;How does SmartLink DU works?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When entering two or more URLs in meta box, the plugin generates a shortcode that must be inserted manually by webmaster.<br />\nThe shortcode looks like this:  <code>[smartlink]anchor text[/smartlink]</code> enclosing the anchor text just like a normal link.<br />\nShortcode is not shown in frontend, even you can see it in visual editor it won&#8217;t be seen when anybody access the page.<br />\nYou can also insert shortcode manually without using the button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%26iquest%3Bhow%20does%20geotargeting%20feature%20work%3F'>\n&iquest;How does GeoTargeting feature work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GT feature uses Geo-localization API to know were user is located.<br />\nThis way it is possible to choose which URLs will be used in smartlink depending on users country location.<br />\nGT feature supports a limited list of countries.<br />\nCurrent list of countries available: Argentina, Australia, Brasil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, France, Mexico, EEUU, India, Israel, Italy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%26iquest%3Bwhat%20about%20seo%3F'>\n&iquest;What about SEO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A link created with this plugin looks exactly the same to eyes of spider bots. So they are crawled just as a normal link.<br />\nAnyway, URL in link will change each time bots index it. So it will assume that link has been edited changing URL. That&#8217;s nothing bad at all, also can be a good thing as Search engines bots adress edits as updates of content, and that is something good for SEO.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%26iquest%3Bwhat%20is%20this%20plugin%20useful%20for%3F'>\n&iquest;What is this plugin useful for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can atach up to 5 URLs to a link, so if you have one single link and you want to insert more than one<br />\nurl to it, this is the right plugin for that. Specially recommended for internal linking, if you have several posts you have to link in one single anchor text.<br />\nThis plugin it&#8217;s perfect to improve your linking strategy with a more agressive kind of link.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
