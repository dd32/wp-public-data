With Kicklander, users can easily create eye-catching and attention-grabbing notifications that encourage visitors to take specific actions on their website.</p>\n<p>These notifications can be customized with text, images, and calls-to-action, and can be triggered based on specific user actions such as scrolling, clicking, or hovering. For example, a notification could be triggered when a visitor adds a product to their cart or when they are about to leave the website without making a purchase.</p>\n<p>By leveraging FOMO (fear of missing out), Kicklander notifications create a sense of urgency and scarcity that encourages visitors to take immediate action, leading to increased conversions and ultimately, a higher ROI for website owners.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Kicklander is a no-code platform, meaning that users do not need any programming skills to create and implement these notifications on their website. This makes it easy for website owners of all skill levels to quickly and effectively monetize their website traffic and improve their ROI.</p>\n<p>Kicklander is a WordPress plugin that allows you to track end users and show them popups/notifications on your website. To provide this functionality, the plugin relies on a third-party service, Kicklander, which provides the necessary tracking and notification capabilities.</p>\n<p>When you install and activate Kicklander, you will be prompted to enter an API key that you received from Kicklander. This API key is used to authenticate your website with the Kicklander servers and enables the plugin to communicate with them.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is connected to the Kicklander servers, it adds a script tag to the body of your website&#8217;s HTML code. This script tag loads an external JavaScript file from Kicklander&#8217;s servers, which provides the tracking and notification functionality.</p>\n<p>Please note that by using Kicklander, you are agreeing to Kicklander&#8217;s terms of use and privacy policy, which can be found at the following links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kicklander.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Register here</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.kicklander.com/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy policy</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.kicklander.com/terms-of-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of use</a><br />\nWe encourage you to review these policies carefully before using Kicklander.
