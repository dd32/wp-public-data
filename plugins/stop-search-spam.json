And in many cases, the words you search for will be output on the site’s search results page. That means anyone can write an advert for illicit goods or services, like &#8220;https://example.com/?s=buy my fake goog from www.my-fake-site.com, and ‘create’ a page on your website that features their ‘advert’.</p>\n<p>This plugin blocks internal site search spam (what lowers your site&#8217;s ranking in the Google). It can limit search query size, disallow emojis, chinese and cyrillic (russian) characters in the search query.</p>\n",
