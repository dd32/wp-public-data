From there, click &#8220;upload.&#8221; That will allow you to browse your harddrive for the zipped folder and allow you to upload it.</p>\n<p>Once uploaded, you&#8217;ll have to activate the plugin and refresh the dashboard.</p>\n<p>When activated, you&#8217;ll notice the writing tips will start populating at the top of the admin pages.  For more information, see the &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; plugin by MA.TT, which this plugin is based on and owes all credit to. I just came up with the writing tips, which I&#8217;ll continue to expand on once I know it&#8217;s functioning properly.</p>\n",
