        "changelog": "<h4>1.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Added a new feature that combines the two fields (recorder and uploader) and instead shows single embedding only. This allows for better experience on mobile devices while it respects the design decisions you might have had before by keeping it recommended yet turned off by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: The update file was using from version info, causing the error to appear for those that do not have Ziggeo Core plugin installed and activated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Using v2 API calls.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Added a check for submenu creation to know that we have the core plugin present, helping us avoiding errors if it is not.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Added a check if core plugin is installed and available. Instead of silent continuation if it is not, it will now report that it is missing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for custom tags based on different form fields.</li>\n<li>Added the option to allow you to change the format of the data you receive. We still recommend the default unless you have some specific setup where other formats work better for you ðŸ™‚</li>\n<li>Added better options handling</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Using new way of creating sub page in menu</li>\n<li>Changed the way the addon info is made available supporting the Ziggeo core plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Admin settings text update</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added link to settings in plugins section</li>\n<li>Fixing the plugin in repo missing files</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resume Manager plugin, completely revamped, with support for latest versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial commit</li>\n</ul>\n",
