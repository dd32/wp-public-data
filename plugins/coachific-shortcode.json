You can already copy and paste JavaScript code to embed Coachific onto a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the &#8220;HTML&#8221; tab of the writing area. If a user is in the &#8220;Visual&#8221; (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes will work either way and the shortcode supports multiple users, thereby allowing seamless integration of Coachific with WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='online%20documentation'>\nOnline Documentation\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"http://coachific.com/support/coachific-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Online Documentation</a> provides details of setting up the Coachific WordPress plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
