Nevertheless, it has already some good arguments over PayPal and alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>API for eCommerce</li>\n<li>No funding/withdrawal limits for corporate accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get your Worldcore account for free on <a href=\"https://worldcore.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">worldcore.eu</a>.</p>\n<p>An answer to that question.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Terms of use</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use this plugin at your own risk.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
