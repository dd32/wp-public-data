        "faq": "<p>More FAQs can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.paloose.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Paloose Site</a>..</p>\n\n<h4>What facilities do you intend to add to Paloose?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is quite a difficult question as I have limited time and am not trying to do a complete Cocoon<br />\nimplementation in PHP5 &#x2014; a pointless exercise anyway. Now that I have added a simple (limited) data caching scheme to the<br />\npipeline all of what I intended to add is complete. I am gradually refining the code and improving the documentation and<br />\ncomments. I am happy to look at anything that users suggest &mdash;<br />\njust EMAIL me at <a href=\"mailto:&#104;&#115;&#x66;&#x72;&#064;&#104;&#x73;f&#114;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#114;&#103;&#x2e;&#x75;&#107;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#104;&#115;&#x66;&#x72;&#064;&#104;&#x73;f&#114;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#114;&#103;&#x2e;&#x75;&#107;</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the Paloose logo on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes please. I suggest the following &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.paloose.org/poweredByPaloose.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Powered by Paloose</a>&#8221;<br />\nlogo or the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.paloose.org/poweredByPaloose-small.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Powered by Paloose (small)</a>&#8221; small logo.<br />\nScale it as you feel fit.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What systems will it run on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically any system that will run PHP5. Currently the list is Mac OS-X, Linux, and other similar Unix systems. I also know of<br />\na system based on Apache 2.0/PHP5 on Windows Server 2003.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I improve the performance of Paloose?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Assuming that you are already using the caching system and want more speed, it is possible, but at the expense of a little<br />\neffort (and possible obscurity), to tailor the Paloose code and your own sitemaps and XSL. The implications and method are<br />\ndescribed <a href=\"http://www.paloose.org/documentation/performance-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> in more detail.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about caching in Paloose?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have done considerable work on various ways of caching within Paloose and versions after 1.3.0 use pipeline data caching on<br />\ncertain generators and transformers. I confess that I am in a quandry over this as the gains from using a cache seem to be<br />\nminimal and not really worth the effort except in some key cases &mdash;<br />\nsee <a href=\"http://www.paloose.org/documentation/caching.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my caching discussion</a> for more on this. It is not the end of the story, but more<br />\nperformance increases will probably come from elsewhere.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help! Why am I getting &#8220;Class &#8216;XsltProcessor&#8217; not found&#8221; errors</h4>\n<p>\n<p>99% of the time this shows that you are running PHP5 without the XML/XSL support that there should be. Try recompiling PHP5<br />\nwith the following configuration parameters included:</p>\n<pre><code>--with-xml --with-libxml-dir=&amp;lt;dir path&amp;gt; --with-xsl\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Help! Why am I getting &#8220;Parse error: syntax error, unexpected &#8216;=&#8217;, expecting &#8216;(&#8216; in</h4>\n<p>\n<p>/../../paloose/lib/Paloose.php on line xx&#8221; errors</p>\n<p>This means you are still running PHP4. You need to run PHP5. Speak to your ISP to provide PHP5. The other reason may be that<br />\nyour .htaccess file has not been set properly to use PHP5.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
