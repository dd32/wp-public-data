        "description": "<p>I have used Plot Over Time for a long time when found that I needed to put multiple charts on one page and category restrictions. The plugin did not allow it. I am insistent on not needing a new plugin &#8211; as this one has worked just fine for meâ€¦ So, I made changes.</p>\n<p>My first change is small in user effort, but large in execution&#8230; I added an optional parameter for chart_num. This optional parameter is not needed if you are using the plugin for a single chart page. It is only needed to identify what chart you are making on a multi-chart page&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Single chart on a page&#8230;</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Multi-Chart page&#8230;</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" chart_num=\"1\"]\n[plot_ext field1=\"Blood Pressure\" chart_num=\"2\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Want to see it in action?  http://www.ourroadtohealth.com/index.php/data-collection/total-blood-pressure/</p>\n<p>My second change&#8230; I added an optional parameter for post category restriction. This optional parameter is not needed if you are pulling from all post categories. It is only needed to identify what 1 post category you want to limit the data to&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Single chart on a page with category selection&#8230;</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" post_cat=\"8\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s Get Started: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>To get it up and running: first, you&#8217;ll need to put data in your posts.  So, in a post, go to the section under your post called &#8220;Custom Fields&#8221;. Create a field you want to track (for instance, &#8220;Heart Rate&#8221;) and give it a value.</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>You&#8217;ll need at lest two posts with data in them before the plugin can do it&#8217;s thing &#8211; so add data to another post.</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Now that you have at least two posts with data, you can create a post that creates a graph.  For this example, you could simply use:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will go through all posts that have a custom field called &#8220;Heart Rate&#8221; and plot them on a nice Google Chart Tools LineChart. Plot Over Time &#8211; Extended supports up to 10 fields per graph.  If you wanted to work with more points of data (again, up to 10), simply add more Custom Fields:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" field2=\"Weight\" field3=\"Workout Time\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The legend is automatically added, and each datapoint is able to be clicked to get a callout about it&#8217;s datapoint. Or you can move the legend around with legend=&#8221;left&#8221; or legend=&#8221;right&#8221;. If you want to get rid of the legend:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" legend=\"none\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Types: </strong>Valid types chart types for Plot Over Time are:  AreaChart, LineChart, PieChart (not particularly useful in this implementation), BarChart, and ColumnChart. To use other types of graphs:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" type=\"BarChart\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Height / Width: </strong>You can set your own width and height for the chart with Width and Height (default: 400 X 300). Don&#8217;t change the height or width using the options=&#8221;height: &#8220;, instead use height=&#8221;300&#8221; or similar.  Changing it in the options that are passed to the graph won&#8217;t change the size of the div it exists in.</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\"] \n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Data Limits: </strong>By default, Plot Over Time uses ALL data from all posts and pops it onto a graph.  You can limit it with two options:</p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>You can determine the maximum number of days worth of data (starting from now and going backward) with maxdays. This would show a one month span of data:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" maxdays=\"30\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>You can attach a graph to that post&#8217;s published date with usepostdate:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" usepostdate=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>So if the post was 3 weeks old, it would only show data from it&#8217;s publication date of three weeks ago and older &#8211; <strong>this allows you to see changes post by post</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>Dates: </strong>The date format defaults to m/d/y &#8211; IE, 12/31/11.  You can change it with dateformat. This would instead put 2011-12-31 on the graph:</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" dateformat=\"Y-m-d\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Titles: </strong>This would add a title above your graph that reads &#8220;My Graph!&#8221;.</p>\n<pre><code>[plot_ext field1=\"Heart Rate\" options=\"'title': 'My Graph!'\" chart_num=\"1\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Wrapping Up: </strong>Don&#8217;t like the colors of the graph, or want to add a few new options?  No problem &#8211; any Google Visualization Tools options is available using the option parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>More Info: </strong>For more information on the options available visit the Google Chart Tools homepage: http://code.google.com/apis/chart/index.html</p>\n<p><strong>Rules: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. </strong>If you define 5 fields you want to read from, and a post only had four fields?  It&#8217;s going to ignore you.</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>It doesn&#8217;t do data interpolation.  If there&#8217;s a gap in your data, it simply ignores it &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t give it a &#8220;0&#8221;, it just plain doesn&#8217;t plot it.  (That&#8217;s how he wanted it.  Other opinions may differ &#8211; mine does not.)</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>f you tell it you want to see 30 days of data, and you&#8217;ve only got three days of data in your posts?  It&#8217;s only going to show a graph that spans three days.</p>\n<p><strong>All data integrity is up to you.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you download, please rate the plugin. This is one of the few feedback methods available. If you have a low opinion, please allow me to try to fix it first before leaving a bad review.</strong></p>\n",
