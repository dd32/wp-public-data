If not, the plugin adds as permissions (roles).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will need set the default time  (in days) that users will have access to purchased content in plugin seetings (will be created a new menu icon called User Role Manegement)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nDo I need another plugin to help User Role Management to control user roles?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on what you want.<br />\nIf you want private posts to be read by all customers who purchase any virtual products, the plugin will serve without the help of another plugin.<br />\nHowever if you want the plugin to show only the private post that corresponds to the product purchased by the customer another plugin will be needed. In our tests, the easiest to deal with is the MEMBERS plugin that allows you to configure directly from posts which roles can see the post.</p>\n<p>Like you know, this plugin make exclusive the posts to users that bougth it (subscriber-**** roles).<br />\nIf you have more than 1 virtual product in more than 1 post, all users that have a subscriber role will can see the private posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI wish give post read permission only to users who purchase that product. How do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you wish to give permission only to users who purchase their product so that other users cannot access the private posts, we recommend installing the Members<br />\nplugin which enables the desired configuration. Just indicate who can access private posts (the roles) while they are being created.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
