The administrator can toggle between allowing and disallowing this benefit with a single click. The change is instant and does not require a page reload, making the moderation of external links a breeze.</p>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>When logged in as an administrator, green “tick” and red “stop” icons appear next to all external links in a post indicating whether <code>rel=\"nofollow\"</code> is currently applied to them. Simply click an icon to toggle between these two states and alter the link&#8217;s nofollow status. This change is applied to your database remotely, without requiring a page reload.</p>\n<h3>Why is this plugin useful?</h3>\n<p>The whole question of <a href=\"http://www.seowizz.net/2009/04/relnofollow-debate-lets-try-and-get-to.html\" title=\"The rel=nofollow debate: Let’s Try and Get To Grips With It\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">whether to use <code>rel=\"nofollow\"</code></a> is a hotly debated one, and applying it (or not) across the board is not a good solution.

        "installation": "<p>The easiest way to install NoFollowr is to do so from within your site&#8217;s admin area:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for it from your admin plugin page and click “Install Now”</li>\n<li>From the resulting installation page, wait until you see the “Activate Plugin” link, then click it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Otherwise, the installation process is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download NoFollowr</li>\n<li>Expand the zip archive and copy the entire folder named &#8220;nofollowr&#8221; to the /wp-content/plugins/ folder within your WordPress installation</li>\n<li>Login to the admin area of your site and go to the plugins section</li>\n<li>Find NoFollowr in the list and click its “Activate” link.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NoFollowr is now fully operational and requires no further setup.
