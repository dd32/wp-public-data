This means that if you&#8217;re creating a Seed Exchange post for a given vegetable, but the only place the name of this vegetable appears is in the plugin&#8217;s custom &#8220;Common Name&#8221; field (and not in the post&#8217;s title or content), then WordPress can&#8217;t find that posting based on a simple keyword search. If you&#8217;d like to make the WP-SeedBank&#8217;s taxonomies searchable, too, we recommend the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-everything/\" rel=\"ugc\">Search Everything plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
