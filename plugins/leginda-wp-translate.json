In just a few clicks, your whole website can be translated into any language. If you don’t have to do WPML, the plugin will import the translated content to a new post, but you will have to manage the translations manually.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I translate my website content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In case you want your content to be read in any part of the world, translations are a must-have. „Localization“ is the buzzword – import translated content with the Leginda WP Plugin and improve the user experience of your website.
