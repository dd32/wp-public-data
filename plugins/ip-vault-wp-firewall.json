IP Vault unlocks user&#8217;s IP addresses using a key<br />\nthat is emailed for authentication. Once users verify their account, they can access all restricted areas. Users are automatically verified on registration.</p>\n<h3>What is protected ?</h3>\n<p>Out-of-the box, IP Vault restricts access to <code>.php</code> and <code>.phtml</code> files, as well as <code>wp-admin</code> folder, which are frequently exploited by bad bots and hackers.<br />\nYou can choose which part of your site to protect. Need to make the whole website private ? No problem, just restrict access to <code>/</code>.</p>\n<h3>The story behind this plugin</h3>\n<p>In the past 20 years, I have been monitoring a few dozen client sites to prevent malicious access. I have also helped a great number of people to clean their website from malware.<br />\nI noticed that even marginal WordPress sites or non-wordpress PHP based sites are constantly exposed to hacking attempts.</p>\n<p>Almost all exploits I have seen work by either calling a vulnerable PHP script already on the server, by adding such a script or by injecting their own code into an existing script.</p>\n<p>I have tried and tested quite a few security plugins. They can be quite complex to set up and to maintain. Some security plugins try to block access to vulnerable files by comparing requests to a blacklist.<br />\nThese tend to become quite large and need frequent updates to be efficient. Others use geo-blocking services to block requests from certain countries. However in my experience, hacking attempts can come from just about any location.</p>\n<p>I thought there must be a better way using whitelists for verified users instead. And that&#8217;s how the idea for IP Vault was born.</p>\n<h3>To Dos</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>add option to get auth code by SMS (requires users to register phone number)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>I love this plugin.
