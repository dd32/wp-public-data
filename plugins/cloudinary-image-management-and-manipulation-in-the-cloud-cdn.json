For free accounts, you will not be able to deliver PDF or ZIP files by default for security reasons. If this is a requirement, please contact our support team who can help activate this for you.</p>\n<p>To deliver additional file types via Cloudinary, you can extend the functionality of the plugin using the <a href=\"https://cloudinary.com/documentation/wordpress_integration#actions_and_filters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">actions and filters</a> the plugin exposes for developers</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20cloudinary%20plugin%20require%20an%20active%20wordpress%20rest%20api%20connection%3F'>\nDoes the Cloudinary plugin require an active WordPress REST API connection?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To function correctly, the Cloudinary plugin requires an active WordPress REST API connection. Ensure your WordPress setup, including multisite or headless configurations, has the REST API enabled and active for seamless plugin operation.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress’s REST API Handbook</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20having%20an%20incompatibility%20issue%20with%20a%20theme%2C%20plugin%2C%20or%20hosting%20environment%2C%20what%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nI&#8217;m having an incompatibility issue with a theme, plugin, or hosting environment, what can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’re compatible with most other plugins so we expect it to work absolutely fine.
