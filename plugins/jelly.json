        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20my%20jelly%20slideshow%20loading%20slow%3F'>\nWhy is my Jelly Slideshow loading slow?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may experience slowness in Jelly for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too many images? &#8211; While Jelly Slideshow doesn&#8217;t limit the number of images in a slideshow, you should be respectful of your visitors&#8217; internet connections. You may think you need to display 50 images, but your visitors may not wait until all those images load. This applies to the entire page, not just your Lumne Slideshow. More images means more time a visitor has to wait before being able to view your web site.</li>\n<li>Slow internet connection? &#8211; Like the previous point, please be cognizant of your users&#8217; internet connections. If your site is primarily viewed by users on desert islands, in rural areas, or using dial-up connections, you need to keep that in mind when adding dozens of images on a single page.</li>\n<li>Old computer? &#8211; Our plugin, as with many other plugins, relies on Javascript. Older computers may have speed issues when processing everything needed to make Jelly Slideshow work. If you run into speed issues, try temporarily disabling one plugin at a time until the issue goes away. If it turns out to be Jelly Slideshow causing the issue, please let us know. We strive to make Jelly Slideshow work on a wide variety of devices, but we haven&#8217;t tested it on your web site! Who knows, you may discover a bug and get your name in the next release!</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20questions%20do%20you%20have%3F'>\nWhat questions do you have?\n</h4>\n<p></p>\n\n",
