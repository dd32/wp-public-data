The plugin is ready to go once you install it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you give me some examples for why this plugin may be beneficial to me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure!</p>\n<p>Example #1: If you acquire a pre-owned domain (that you intend to run WordPress with), you might not want to recreate every page that was part of the original site. Alternatively, you might not want to build an exhaustive list of 301&#8217;s either. Enter the 404 Redirection plugin. Now, you&#8217;ll never have to worry about not salvaging every drip of link-juice.</p>\n<p>Example #2: Let&#8217;s face it, having an exuberant amount of 404&#8217;s is bad form. Search engines might consider your site &#8220;broken&#8221;, and drop your rankings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
