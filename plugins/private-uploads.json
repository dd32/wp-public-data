One way of creating such a folder and moving the private files is by means of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-organiser/\" rel=\"ugc\">Media Organiser</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>Then configure your web server as follows:</p>\n<h4>Nginx</h4>\n<p>Include a line like this in the server section of the Nginx configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>rewrite ^/wp-content/uploads/(private)/(.*)$ /?pucd-folder=$1&amp;pucd-file=$2 break;  \n</code></pre>\n<p>The folder name &#8216;private&#8217; can be anything you like &#8212; it just has to match the name of the folder where your private files are kept, and be enclosed in parentheses in the rewrite statement.</p>\n<p>More than one private folder can be configured by adding more lines of the same form, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>rewrite ^/wp-content/uploads/(2017/secure)/(.*)$ /?pucd-folder=$1&amp;pucd-file=$2 break;  \n</code></pre>\n<h4>Apache</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/enchiridion/\" rel=\"ugc\">Enchiridion</a> has supplied the following configuration for Apache.  Thank you.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an equivalent rule for Apache to add to your existing rules:</p>\n<pre><code>RewriteRule ^wp-content/uploads/(private)/(.*)$ /?pucd-folder=$1&amp;pucd-file=$2 [L]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can copy/paste this entire block into your <code>.htaccess</code> file. Add before the <code># BEGIN WordPress</code> block:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\n# Block unauthenticated user access to the /private/ uploads folder\nRewriteRule ^wp-content/uploads/(private)/(.*)$ /?pucd-folder=$1&amp;pucd-file=$2 [L]\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Other web servers</h4>\n<p>are left as an exercise for the reader.</p>\n",
