This updates the Bible index for all of your current posts. While Biblefox is active, new posts will automatically be indexed.</p>\n<p>For BuddyPress sites, you should also add support to your menus for the Bible Directory by adding a link.

Biblefox creates tables for storing the Bible references in each post. For a blog, the table is usually &#8216;wp_posts_bfox_refs&#8217; (ie. &#8220;{$wpdb-&gt;posts}_bfox_refs&#8221;) and for BuddyPress activities it is &#8216;wp_bp_activity_bfox_refs&#8217;. These tables have a column for a post_id, and 2 columns to store the start and end verses for any Bible reference in the post.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
