However, you cannot &#8220;network-activate&#8221; the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the subsites on which you need a directory.  This can be done under Plugins-&gt;Add New as the Administrator user.  Do not &#8220;network activate&#8221; PDL as the &#8220;super admin&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
