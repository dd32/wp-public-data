The Pro version also has an index for <code>post_excerpt</code>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re running a multisite installation, then this is created for each of the blogs on activation. All these indices occupy space in your mySQL database but are essential for the plugin to run.</p>\n<p>You have two sets of options in the settings page which allows you to remove these indices when you deactivate or delete the plugin. The latter is true by default.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to use these indices, you can disable contextual matching in the settings page. You will need to turn on related posts by category, tags and/or custom taxonomies.</p>\n<h4>GDPR</h4>\n<p>Contextual Related Posts is GDPR compliant as it doesn&#8217;t collect any personal data about your visitors when installed out of the box.
