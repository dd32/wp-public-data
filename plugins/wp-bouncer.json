        "description": "<p>WP Bouncer restricts the number of simultaneous logins for the same WordPress user account. The plugin&#8217;s goal is to deter people from sharing their login credentials for your site, which is especially important for a paid membership, premium content, or eLearning site.</p>\n<h3>How WP Bouncer Protects Shared User Logins</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin stores a random <code>FAKESESSID</code> for each user when they log in.</li>\n<li>If a user is logged in, on each page load (init hook), WP Bouncer checks if the <code>FAKESESSID</code> stored in the userâ€™s cookies is the same as the last login stored in a transient (<code>fakesessid_user_login</code>).</li>\n<li>If the two values do no match, WP Bouncer logs the user out and redirects them to the WordPress login page or a custom page using the wp_bouncer_redirect_url filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the WP_BOUNCER_HEARTBEAT_CHECK is defined to true, JavaScript will be loaded to bounce users when a new user logs in with the same login. This is useful for sites with page caching.</p>\n<p>Admininstrator accounts or any users with the &#8220;manage_options&#8221; capability are excluded from bounces.</p>\n<h3>Or, Allow a Specific Number of Active Sessions</h3>\n<p>By default, WP Bouncer only allows one session per user.</p>\n<p>You can use this plugin to offer bulk memberships to corporate, education, or other group-type customers via a shared login.</p>\n<p>Use the <code>wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins</code> filter to allow a defined number of active &#8220;sessions&#8221;.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/limit-user-active-sessions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View the Recipe</a></p>\n<h3>Example Use Cases for WP Bouncer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>User A logs in as &#8220;user&#8221;. Their <code>FAKESESSID</code>, say &#8220;SESSION_A&#8221; is stored in a WordPress option.</li>\n<li>User B logs in as &#8220;user&#8221;. Their <code>FAKESESSID</code>, say &#8220;SESSION_B&#8221; is overwrites the stored WordPress option.</li>\n<li>User A tries to load a page on your site, WP Bouncer catches them and logs them out, redirecting them to the warning message.</li>\n<li>User B can browse around the site as normal&#8230; unless&#8230;</li>\n<li>User A logs in again as &#8220;user&#8221;. Their <code>FAKESESSID</code>, &#8220;SESSION_A_v2&#8221; is stored in the WordPress option.</li>\n<li>Now user B would be logged out if they load another page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Hooks and Filters</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wp_bouncer_ignore_admins</code> filter: if returning false even admins will be bounced.</li>\n<li><code>wp_bouncer_redirect_url</code> filter: can be used to change the URL redirected to after being bounced.</li>\n<li><code>wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins</code> filter: can be set to limit logins to a number other than 1. 0 means unlimited logins.</li>\n<li><code>wp_bouncer_login_flag</code>: runs right before bouncing (can be used to potentially stop the bouncing).</li>\n<li><code>wp_bouncer_session_ids</code> hook: used to filter session ids when saving them. Passes $session_ids, $old_session_ids (before any were removed/bounced), and the current user&#8217;s ID as parameters.</li>\n<li><code>wp_bouncer_session_length</code> hook: used to filter how long the session ids transients are set. This way, you can time the transients to expire at a specific time of day. Note that the transient is saved on every page load, so if you set it to 5 minutes, it&#8217;s going to push it out 5 minutes on every page load. You should try to set it to (the number of seconds until midnight) or something like that.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support the Plugin Authors</h3>\n<p>If you like this plugin, please check out Jason&#8217;s work with <a href=\"https://www.strangerstudios.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stranger Studios</a> and <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Paid Memberships Pro</a> and <a href=\"http://andrewnorcross.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Andrew&#8217;s work at his personal site</a>.</p>\n",

        "changelog": "<h4>1.5.1 &#8211; 2023-01-30</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added filter <code>wp_bouncer_ajax_timeout</code> to adjust timeout (default 5000).</li>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Added support for translations.</li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Removed unused login warning file and screenshot from the SVN repository that is not used in this plugin.</li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed misspelled constant for plugin version and usage in JS file load.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5 &#8211; 2021-06-02</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>ENHANCEMENT: Removed the login-warning.php file. Instead, we redirect to the wp-login.php page and show a message.</li>\n<li>BUG FIX: Adjusted URLs to be https and adjusted meta tags to be be noindex/nofollow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1 &#8211; 2020-01-01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue where users were not redirected to the warning page when logged out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4 &#8211; 2019-01-16</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BUG FIX: Fixed issue with how things were stored in transients. (Thanks, zackdn on GitHub)</li>\n<li>FEATURE: Added JavaScript to bounce users in case the PHP bouncer is not running (e.g. when using page caching). To enable this, add <code>define( 'WP_BOUNCER_HEARTBEAT_CHECK', true );</code> to your wp-config.php (without the backticks).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a typo.</li>\n<li>Tested up to WP 4.8</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a user action link (hover over a user on the users.php page in the dashboard) to reset all sessions for a user.</li>\n<li>Added wp_bouncer_session_ids hook to filter session ids when saving them. Passes $session_ids, $old_session_ids (before any were removed/bounced), and the current user&#8217;s ID as parameters.</li>\n<li>Added wp_bouncer_session_length hook to filter how long the session ids transients are set. This way, you can time the transients to expire at a specific time of day. Note that the transient is saved on every page load, so if you set it to 5 minutes, it&#8217;s going to push it out 5 minutes on every page load.

This allowed for multiple (but limited) sessions per user if wanted.</li>\n<li>Added wp_bouncer_ignore_admins filter, if returning false even admins will be bounced.</li>\n<li>Added wp_bouncer_redirect_url filter, which can be used to change the URL redirected to after being bounced.</li>\n<li>Added wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins filter, which can be set to limit logins to a number other than 1. 0 means unlimited logins.</li>\n<li>Added wp_bouncer_login_flag in case you want to hook in and do something right before bouncing (or potentially stop the bouncing).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Admin accounts (specifically users with &#8220;manage_options&#8221; capability) are excluded from bounces. This will eventually be a setting once we setup a settings page.</li>\n<li>Readme changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with how transients were being set and get.</li>\n<li>Removed code in track_login that made sure you were logging in from login page.
