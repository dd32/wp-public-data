I highly recommend using this plugin no matter what type of site you<br />\n  have.</code><br />\n  Neils Maden </p>\n<p><code>Awesome plugin that's super easy to set up and use. Nice features and I love the referrals to my site!</code><br />\n  Sherry Fields </p>\n<p><code>This plugin works great and the ability to get my website content out there more efficiently and through means I would otherwise not have access to is a HUGE asset. &gt;</code><br />\n  Johnes Heythar</p>\n<p><code>What else is there to say, I acquired 250 shares in 3 days for free. This is truly a great product to pump up your site's appearance in count index.</code><br />\n  Stacey Mitchell</p>\n<p><code>What a concept. Easy to use. Great straight forward way to get social proof.</code><br />\n  Mario Yannik</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p>You can check how many shares any website has here: <a href=\"http://moresharesforyou.com/URL/\" title=\"Check How Many Points I  \nHave On A Specific Page\">CHECK HOW MANY SHARES http://moresharesforyou.com/URL/</a>. You can use this for any site, yours or your competitors, even if they don&#8217;t run WordPress.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: USE SOCIAL BUTTONS. You should <em>display the Facebook LIKES button on your posts and pages</em> so your audience can see on your website the number of Likes.<br />\n(Facebook adds the likes and the shares into 1 single metric). This is an important social proof indicator for your readers.</p>\n<p>EQUALLY IMPORTANT: USE PRETTY PERMALINKS. Facebook and the other social networks &#8220;count&#8221; your likes/shares in relation to a certain URL. Please make sure you <em>have the final URL Pretty Permalink in place</em> before starting a campaign. Otherwise, if you change the URL later, Facebook will not display your previous like numbers.</p>\n<p>The most easy way to SEE HOW IT WORKS is to press play button for your homepage.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME to have a good website/blog that nobody is seeing or reading.</p>\n",
