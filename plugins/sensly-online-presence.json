Either in the footer or through the Widget-system. Ensure you got at least WordPress 2.2 or later to use the Widget System.

In the WordPress context, this means: If you&#8217;re logged in and active on your blog, you&#8217;re most probably online.</p>\n<p>Sensly supports a wide variety of modules including Firefox, Thunderbird, Pidgin, It&#8217;s own Windows Tray Client etc. Over time, the development-team will roll out more modules as they&#8217;re ready. You&#8217;re also encourage to take an active part in the network to create your own modules. Check out <a href=\"Sensly.net\" title=\"Sensly.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sensly.net</a> for more info and more modules!</p>\n<h4>What is Sensly.com, what&#8217;s its role in all this?</h4>\n<p>Sensly.com is the community-site where you can attach your Sensly Network Presence to an account. Doing so, it allows you to track the presence of your friend etc. Though notice that Sensly.com is still in closed beta, but you can use this access-code 4tpE4Kg1 to create and account and poke around.</p>\n",

        "faq": "<h4>Where will it show my presence?</h4>\n<p>The plugin will automatically put your presence at the end of your blog, in the footer.</p>\n<h4>Where it log what i do?</h4>\n<p>No, nein, nej, non, ne, ei etc. Sensly will NEVER log any personal information nor track what you&#8217;re doing. The only thing it tracks is that you did SOMETHING online and marks you as online.</p>\n<h4>Can i put the presence anywhere i want?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you can either use the WordPress Widget-system or it will automatically be placed in the footer.</p>\n"
