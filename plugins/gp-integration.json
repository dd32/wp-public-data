You can find it in your GlotPress install under &#8220;img/glotpress-logo.png&#8221;, use your faviorite image editor and remove the background with the magic wand!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20shortcode%20name%3F'>\nWhat is the shortcode name?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[gp-integration] will embed GlotPress.<br />\n[gp-integration-link] will create a link to your GlotPress install.<br />\n[gp-integration-translator-list] will create a formated table of your translators.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20shortcode%20work%3F'>\nHow does the shortcode work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The shortcode creats an iFrame along with a bit of JavaScript.  The JavaScript will resize the iFrame to match the height of the GlotPress page being displayed.
