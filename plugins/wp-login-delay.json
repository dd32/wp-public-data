You will test all of them until the correct one works, right? This means that for each attempt, you will have to wait for the result to know if it is the correct key or not. Each result being delayed, it will take a lot more time to find out which key is the correct one. It is the same principle that is used here, one second delay is ok for a human, but looks like eternity for a bot.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20plugin%20settings%3F'>\nWhere are the plugin settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to <code>Settings</code> &gt; <code>WP Login Delay</code></p>\n</p>\n\n",
