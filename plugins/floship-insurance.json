        "description": "<p>Floship Insurance is a WordPress plugin that enables customers to select and pay for insurance at checkout. With this plugin, brands using Floship fulfillment can provide insurance rates to your customers using the Floship API. Once you’ve created a REST API in WooCommerce, the plugin will automatically connect to the Floship API and activate. Please note that you should already have a Floship Account and Integration with woocommerce activated in Floship Portal. You have the option to display or hide the insurance rate on the checkout page. Customers will be able to select insurance based on their country of origin, and the insurance rate will be calculated and displayed in the total cost. The insurance status, which starts as “Planned”, can be tracked from the Dashboard -&gt; Order section. Once the order is complete, the insurance status will change to “Insured” and the customer will receive a certificate claim link from the API in the Dashboard -&gt; Order section.</p>\n",
