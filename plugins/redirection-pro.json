        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>redirection-pro</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin settings from the &#8216;Redirection PRO&#8217; menu in the WordPress admin area.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Q: Is replacing external links bad for SEO?<br />\nA: While robots check pages for valuable content, if the destination site changes (resulting in broken links), it can lead to a reduction in rank. Therefore, it is advisable to use other SEO practices to improve site SEO instead of solely relying on external links. Additionally, the plugin provides a URL filter to exclude trusted domains from the URL replacement process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Q: Does this plugin increase page load time?<br />\nA: No, Redirection PRO implements a powerful cache system. The cache system stores loaded data from the destination URL for a certain period of time, reducing the need for repeated requests and enhancing performance. Furthermore, the plugin optimizes load timeouts on the server-side to minimize waiting times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Q: Why do I need this plugin?<br />\nA: This plugin is particularly useful when dealing with external links to unknown or personal blogs. It helps ensure your website remains unaffected by unpredictable changes in destination URLs. Furthermore, you can utilize this plugin to prioritize client safety and protect them from reaching unwanted destinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Q: What should I consider while using this plugin?<br />\nA: It&#8217;s important to note that this plugin can have an impact on your website&#8217;s SEO ranking. As such, consider using other practices to optimize your SEO instead of relying solely on external links. The plugin allows you to exclude trusted websites from the link replacement process, enabling you to strike a balance between SEO optimization and link management.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
