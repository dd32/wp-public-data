Now Events are triggered when a user invokes the action rather than after the action is completed. Because of the change, Twitter generates the event as soon as user clicks tweeter button which open the locker without waiting for the tweet action by the user. In other words, it is not possible to use twitter with locker anymore. So, by default, Twitter is disabled in Basic Locker.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20twitter%20button%20is%20smaller%20than%20facebook%20icon'>\nWhy twitter button is smaller than Facebook icon\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike Facebook, Twitter share API doesn&#8217;t allow us to change the icon.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
