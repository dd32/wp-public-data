Also SpectroCoin payment option will be visible only for admin user.</p>\n<p>Added Messages related with order processing to order notes.</p>\n<p>Fixed &#8220;Failed&#8221; status with failed and expired orders.</p>\n<h3>1.4.1 (01/26/2024)</h3>\n<p>Removed Plugin dependency from plugin directory names</p>\n<p>Fixed Fatal error for new installations</p>\n<h3>1.4.0 (01/03/2024)</h3>\n<p>This update is significant to plugin&#8217;s security and stability. The posibility of errors during checkout is minimized, reduced posibility of XSS and SQL injection attacks.</p>\n<p>Migrated to GuzzleHttp since HTTPful is no longer maintained. In this case /vendor directory was added which contains GuzzleHttp dependencies.</p>\n<p>Added Settings field sanitization.</p>\n<p>Added Settings field validation. In this case we minimized possible error count during checkout, SpectroCoin won&#8217;t appear in checkout until settings validation is passed.</p>\n<p>Added Admin notice in admin plugin settings for all fields validation.</p>\n<p>Added Escaping all output variables with appropriate functions.</p>\n<p>Added &#8220;spectrocoin&#095;&#8221; prefix to functiton names.</p>\n<p>Added &#8220;SpectroCoin&#095;&#8221; prefix to class names.</p>\n<p>Added validation and sanitization when request payload is created.</p>\n<p>Added validation and sanitization when callback is received.</p>\n<p>Added components class &#8220;SpectroCoin_ValidationUtil&#8221; for specific validation functions.</p>\n<p>Added logging to WordPress log when errors occur.</p>\n<p>Added logging to WooCommerce status log when errors occur.</p>\n<p>Fixed is_available() function behaviour, when sometimes it returned false, even if all settings were correct.</p>\n<p>Optimised the The whole $&#095;POST stack processing.

Also the notice will be displayed once and won&#8217;t be displayed in other admin screens except SpectroCoin settings.</p>\n<h3>1.3.0 (10/04/2023)</h3>\n<p>Fixed hardcoded order statuses in plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Added Custom order statuses created manually or using plugins will appear in SpectroCoin settings menu.</p>\n<p>Added a new function, when during checkout, if error is occured, now client will see the error code and message instead of generic error message.</p>\n<p>Added plugin checks the FIAT currency, if it is not supported by SpectroCoin, payment will not be available.</p>\n<p>Added admin notice in admin plugin settings to notify that shop currency is not supported by SpectroCoin.</p>\n<h3>1.2.0 (09/10/2023)</h3>\n<p>Added plugin string internationalization, for plugin translation to various languages.</p>\n<p>Added two additional links within admin window connecting to official wordpress.org website to easily rate, leave feedback and report bugs.</p>\n<p>Updated style changes in settings window</p>\n<p>For Developers Added documentation with parameters and return variables before every function</p>\n<h3>1.1.0 (07/31/2023)</h3>\n<p>Added a new option in admin menu, to display or not the SpectroCoin logo during checkout.</p>\n<h3>1.0.0 (07/31/2023)</h3>\n<p>Added a link to access SpectroCoin plugin settings directly from the plugin page. This enhancement provides users with easier access to the configuration options.</p>\n<p>Implemented an &#8220;if&#8221; statement to handle compatibility with older PHP versions (PHP 8 and below) for the function openssl_free_key($public_key_pem). This change is necessary as PHP 8<br />\ndeprecates openssl_free_key and now automatically destroys the key instance when it goes out of scope. (Source https//stackoverflow.com/questions/69559775/php-openssl-free-key-deprecated)</p>\n<p>Improved the WC_Gateway_Spectrocoin class, made changes to prevent deprecated messages related to the creation of dynamic properties. The properties (merchant_id, protected_id, private_key, and order_status) are now explicitly declared as protected, and getter functions are added to ensure better encapsulation. This update is particularly important for PHP version 8.2 and above.</p>\n<p>Added a dependency on the WooCommerce plugin for the SpectroCoin plugin. The SpectroCoin plugin now requires WooCommerce to be installed and active on the site. If the user deletes or deactivates WooCommerce, a notice will be displayed, and the SpectroCoin plugin will be deactivated automatically.</p>\n<p>Enhanced the style of the admin&#8217;s payment settings window to match the design of SpectroCoin.com, providing a more cohesive user experience.</p>\n<p>Added an informative message on the admin page, guiding users on how to obtain the mandatory credentials required for using the SpectroCoin plugin effectively. This addition helps users easily find the necessary information for setup and configuration.</p>\n"
