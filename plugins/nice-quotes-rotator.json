        "description": "<p>This plugin provides the ability to have randomly selected quotes displayed on the admin page, by using a<br />\nshortcode or by using a sidebar widget. The quotes include user-entered quotes, and can optionally include<br />\nexcerpts from a user-chosen category and can also optionally include links from a user-chosen links category<br />\nThere also is an option for including the lyrics from &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221;. The plugin can be used for random<br />\nquotes, rotating testimonials, rotating random affiliate links, or random featured posts. It was inspired by<br />\nthe Hello Dolly plugin (hello.php) that comes bundled with WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Technical support for this plugin will be provided via the WordPress plugin forum.  Additional support may be<br />\navailable at <a href=\"http://www.codeandreload.com/wp-plugins/nicequotes/\" title=\"Nice Quotes at Code\nand Reload\">plugin&#8217;s homepage</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Installation is simple and straight-forward:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip <code>nice-quotes.zip</code> into to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin options under the &#8216;Plugins-&gt;Nice Quotes Options&#8217; menu in WordPress. Don&#8217;t forget to Save Changes!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I have set the category on the option page but no posts are ever quoted.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure at least one of those posts in that category has an excerpt defined.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the ratio of quotes, links and excerpts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ratio is split evenly between the types of quotes enabled to be displayed. To determine the<br />\nprobability of a quote type (links, excerpts, and custom quotes)  being displayed count the number<br />\nof types enabled. The probability is one in however many types are being displayed.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have links, excerpts and quotes all enabled then the chances of getting an<br />\nexcerpt is 1 in 3, the chance of getting a quote is 1 in 3 and the chance of getting a quote is 1<br />\nin 3.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can the plugin be used to list only a random excerpt from a category?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it can, just don&#8217;t set any custom quotes or check the option to include Hello Dolly lyrics.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can the plugin be used to list only a random link from a link-category (like Blogroll for example)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it can, just don&#8217;t set any custom quotes or check the option to include Hello Dolly lyrics.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can HTML be used in custom quotes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it can. Using a break tag (<code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>) is recommended for multi-line quotes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can smilies or shortcodes be used in custom quotes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes they can. Smilies are only included if they are enabled under Settings-&gt;Writing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can the quotes be styled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Quotes have a class of &#8216;niceQuote&#8217; set on them. To style them add to your stylesheet:</p>\n<pre><code>    .niceQuote {  \n            // css properties here;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How can the quotes be used on a post or page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just use <code>[nicequote]</code> as a shortcode and a randomly chosen quote will be displayed on the page.<br />\nThe quote is randomly chosen each time the post or page is loaded.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are the quotes random?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes they are. Each time the quote is loaded (whether on the admin page, a sidebar widget or via<br />\nshortcode) the quote will be random with the ratios listed above.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can other plugins add quotes to be be displayed? I&#8217;d like to create a package of quotes.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! See pluggable_example.php for sample code to get started.<br />\nIn order for these quotes to be displayed, it is necessary to check the option to allow plugins to add quotes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is there an option to include Hello Dolly lyrics?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The inspiration for this plugin comes from the Hello Dolly plugin (hello.php) bundled with<br />\nWordpress. I wanted to have the option to have user-defined custom quotes <em>and</em> to have those<br />\nquotes appear on the WordPress front-end. I also wanted to optionally highlight a featured<br />\npost or be able to show an affiliated link.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
