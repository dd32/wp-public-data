Wondering how would you trigger a deploy in <a href=\"https://netlify.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Netlify</a> everytime someone updates a post in WordPress? Forget going inside everytime an update is made and triggering a build manually, install <strong>Deploy with NetlifyPress</strong> and let it run a deploy for you automatically on each update.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a real-life example, I&#8217;ve build my personal site <a href=\"https://nahid.dev\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">nahid.dev</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/nfmohit/nahid.dev\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>) using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GatsbyJS</a> with its source as WordPress and am hosting it on <a href=\"https://netlify.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Netlify</a>. I use <strong>Deploy with NetlifyPress</strong> to automate deploys when I update pages and posts.</p>\n<h3>Core Features</h3>\n<p>The core features of the plugin include the abilities to:<br />\n* Automatically trigger deploys on post publish<br />\n* Automatically trigger deploys on post update<br />\n* Automatically trigger deploys on post trash<br />\n* Filter the post types for which you want automatic deploys to run<br />\n* Add a button for manual deployments on the top admin toolbar.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>This plugin requires you have a site hosted on Netlify and a Build Webhook URL set up. Here&#8217;s how you can get a Build Hook URL:<br />\n1. Log into <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Netlify</a>.<br />\n2. From the list of sites, enter the site you want to set up <strong>Deploy with NetlifyPress</strong> for.<br />\n3. Go to <em>Site settings</em>.<br />\n4. From the left sidebar, go to <em>Build and deploy<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span>Continuous Deployment</em>.<br />\n5. Scroll down to the &#8220;<em>Build hooks</em>&#8221; section.<br />\n6. Click the &#8220;<em>Add build hook</em>&#8221; button, enter a preferred name for the webhook (e.g. &#8220;Deploy from WordPress&#8221;), choose the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Git</a> branch to build and hit <em>Save</em>.<br />\n7. You&#8217;ll be given a Build Hook URL that can be used in <strong>Deploy with NetlifyPress</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Installation of the <strong>Deploy with NetlifyPress</strong> plugin is very simple. Follow along with the installation procedure in the dedicated <a href=\"#installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Installation</strong> tab</a>.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Install</a> and activate the plugin</li>\n<li>Go to your <em>WordPress Dashboard<span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span>NetlifyPress</em></li>\n<li>On the &#8220;<em>Connect with Netlify</em>&#8221; tab, enter your Netlify Build Hook URL.</li>\n<li>On the &#8220;<em>Automatic Deployment</em>&#8221; tab, choose if you want to use Automatic Deployment, on which actions should it trigger and which post types the actions should apply to.</li>\n<li>On the &#8220;<em>Manual Deployment</em>&#8221; tab, choose if you want to add a &#8220;Trigger Netlify Deploy&#8221; manual trigger button in the top admin toolbar.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If the above usage steps don&#8217;t answer your question(s), if you want to report an issue or if something is not working as expected, please create a topic in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/deploy-netlifypress/\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Forum</a>.</p>\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\n<p>I have plans for the following features/improvements in the coming days (subject to user feedback and usage):<br />\n1. Admin options migration to Settings API with Ajax support.<br />\n2. Success/failure message on auto deploy trigger.<br />\n3. Success/failure message on auto deploy status (after completion).<br />\n4. Scheduled deployments.<br />\n5. Deployment logs.</p>\n<h3>Contribute</h3>\n<p>If you want to contribute to the plugin by reporting issues, implementing new features and so on, <a href=\"https://github.com/nfmohit/deploy-netlifypress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here&#8217;s its development repository on Github</a>.</p>\n<h3>Sponsor</h3>\n<p>You can sponsor this project and support my open-source development by <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/nfmohit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">becoming a Patron</a>!</p>\n",
