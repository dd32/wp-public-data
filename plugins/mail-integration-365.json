Note, unlike other free SMTP plugins, this one authenticates with the Microsoft Graph API rather than SMTP using OAuth2. This addresses the recent change by Microsoft to disable basic authentication over SMTP (i.e. username and password), preventing other free SMTP plugins from working with Microsoft Accounts. <strong>Unfortunately, Microsoft has yet to enable their Graph API to work with the free versions of Outlook, Live, Hotmail etc. The plugin should however work with the paid for personal and business versions of Office 365, Outlook and Microsoft Exchange.</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvNajsDenZM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>WPO365 | Mail Integration for Office 365 / Outlook</h3>\n<p>Contributors: wpo365<br />\nTags: smtp, outlook smtp, 365 smtp, live smtp, oauth<br />\nRequires at least: 5.5.3<br />\nTested up to: 6.1<br />\nStable tag: 1.9.2<br />\nRequires PHP: 7.1.1<br />\nLicense: GPLv2 or later<br />\nLicense URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT &#8211; Please choose the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpo365-msgraphmailer/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPO365 | MICROSOFT 365 GRAPH MAILER</a> plugin instead.

        "faq": "<p><em>What does it do?</em></p>\n<p>Put simply, the plugin relays all emails sent from WordPress through your Microsoft email account (or an account of your choosing, for example a shared mailbox).

Azure Active Directory comes in several flavours (paid and free), but it is possible to use the free tier for the purpose of this plugin.
