        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%3F'>\nHow to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Widget page in the WordPress backend. Every widget is enhanced by easy-to-use fields for time data.</li>\n<li>Set comfortably the start point of time, the end point of time and the weekdays when to display or to hide the widget. With the &#8220;unlimited&#8221; option the widget is displayed &#8220;forever&#8221; in the future. If you want to hide the widget during schedule, activate the Hide option.</li>\n<li>After you have defined the time data just save the widget settings. Done!</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20an%20option%20page%3F'>\nIs there an option page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. That is not necessary. You set the visibility in each widget on the Widgets&#8217; page in the backend.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20the%20scheduler%20settings%20effect%20cached%20pages%3F'>\nDo the scheduler settings effect cached pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin has no site effects to cache plugins. So it can happen that a cached page shows a widget although the scheduler settings says to hide it, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>It is up to your cache settings how the visibility of a widget is considered. Maybe it is helpful to empty the cache automatically once a day.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20set%20the%20daytime%20for%20each%20weekday%3F'>\nHow can I set the daytime for each weekday?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a feature which comes with the Pro version. The Pro version is identical with the free plugin version, enhanced with the ability to schedule the visibility based on the time of each weekday. The Pro version is also available in german, spanish, brazilian portuguese, persian, hungarian and arabic. Please contact the author at support@kybernetik.com.de for more information about the Pro version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20remove%20the%20plugin%20delete%20the%20settings%20in%20the%20database%3F'>\nDoes remove the plugin delete the settings in the database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Up to now: no. But you can remove the settings in the database easily with two possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either deactivate (uncheck) the visibility time scheduler in each widget and save the widget settings.</li>\n<li>Or remove the widget out of the widget area.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20works%20with%20jetpack%27s%20widget%20visibility%20module%3F'>\nDoes the plugin works with Jetpack&#8217;s Widget Visibility module?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Both plugins work together perfectly and enhance each other to give you great control about when and where to display which widget.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20highest%20year%20number%202037%3F'>\nWhy is the highest year number 2037?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most servers are 32-bit systems, either the hardware or the software WordPress uses: Apache, PHP, MySQL. The technical maximum time a 32-bit system can handle is 03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038. If a user would type in a date after 19 January 2038 a strange behaviour would occur.</p>\n<p>So to have safe values I have set deliberately the maximum valid year value to 2037. That allowed the latest point of time at 23:59:00 on December 31, 2037. And that avoids a more complicated, unsafe check for a date like “January 19, 2039 03:14:07″.</p>\n<p>You can find a detailed and understandable explanation at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia: Year 2038 problem</a>. That text also explains why the lowest year number is 1970.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20%2A.pot%20file%20for%20translating%20the%20plugin%20in%20any%20language%3F'>\nWhere is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is ready for right-to-left languages like Arabic or Hebrew.</p>\n<p>Further translations are welcome. If you want to give in your translation please leave a notice in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/widget-visibility-time-scheduler\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin&#8217;s support forum</a>. A translation of the plugin in your language would be great!</p>\n<p>All texts of the plugin are in the *.pot file. You would find the *.pot file in the &#8216;languages&#8217; directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
