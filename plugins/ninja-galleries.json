If you are looking to simply tag your images, then Media Tags is the plugin you need.<br />\nBecause Media Tags 3.0 is the tagging system used by this plugin, we strongly recommend that you do not use Media Tags and Ninja Galleries at the same time. Although we have gone<br />\nthrough great lengths to prevent any possible conflicts, it would be best to use one or the other.</p>\n<p>Ninja Galleries is designed to work with the Lighbox Plus plugin (v. 2.2.2). If you have this plugin installed, then Ninja Galleries will open all clicked images in a Lightbox Popup.<br />\nIf you do not have this plugin installed, Ninja Announcements will simply link to the image.</p>\n<p>Features:<br />\n    *Create image galleries featuring as many images as you would like.<br />\n    *Once a gallery is created and tags are selected, new tagged images show up automatically.<br />\n    *Outputs each gallery as a set of</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>dl&gt;</p>\n<dt> HTML elements for easy styling.<br />\n    *Assign categories to each gallery for easy organization.<br />\n    *Each gallery has its own url that you can to link from anywhere on your site.<br />\n    *List your galleries by category using a simple shortcode.</dt>\n</p>\n<p>Ninja Galleries uses http://www.yoursite.com/gallery/gallery-name as the url for gallery pages. This means that you can&#8217;t have any custom post types with this url. Unfortunately, this is<br />\nfairly set in stone at this release. Future versions will allow a custom url.</p>\n<p>There are more screenshots and tutorials for Ninja Galleries at http://plugins.wpninjas.net.</p>\n<h3>Use</h3>\n<p>There are a few shortcodes included to make linking to your gallery or galleries easier.<br />\n    *If you would like to list all the galleries within a given category: [wpnj_gal_list cat=&#8221;Category1&#8243;]<br />\n        *You can list multiple categories by putting in a comma-separated list: [wpnj_gal_list cat=&#8221;Category1,Category2,Category3&#8243;]<br />\n    *If you want to put in a link to a specific gallery (which will use the featured image as the link): [wpnj_gal_list gallery=&#8221;Gallery Name Here&#8221;]<br />\n    *If you want to list all of the galleries: [wpnj_gal_list]</p>\n<h3>Advanced Styling</h3>\n<p>To get the gallery images to look the way you want, style</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>dl&gt;</p>\n<dt> and </p>\n<dd> elements.</dd>\n</dt>\n<h3>Requested Features</h3>\n<p>*Ability to create a custom url.
