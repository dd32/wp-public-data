        "installation": "<h4>Ungallery</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Download to ./wp-content/plugins/ and activate via the Plugins menu.</li>\n<li>Create a blank WordPress Page, for example one called &#8220;Gallery&#8221;.  (Optionally update permalinks format)</li>\n<li>On the UnGallery admin page, enter the permalink from above and the path to your images. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The UnGallery steps above are simple and the install is generally quick.  However because the plugin works outside the WordPress environment and communicates with the web server file system, there are sometimes challenges troubleshooting the install.  It helps to have a bit of familiarity with Linux commands and paths.  If you encounter any problems, feel free to leverage the support resources.  Several tips and tools to help you install are built into UnGallery&#8217;s plugin settings page.</p>\n<p>Introduction and Installation Screencast:</p>\n<p>[video  src=&#8221;http://markpreynolds.com/UnGallery2.mp4&#8243; /]</p>\n<h4>FancyBox</h4>\n<p>FancyBox is a very polished image lightbox application.  UnGallery has been updated to integrate with fancyBox, which changes the plugin from being an efficient way to manage a high volume of photos to also having the look and feel of the most professional WordPress galleries.  I highly recommend activating this feature.</p>\n<p>There are just a few additional steps to use fancyBox.  They only need to be performed once.  Automatic updates to UnGallery will not require the steps below to be rerun.  Details are the UnGallery settings page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Paste the fancyBox calls from the settings page.</li>\n<li>Download and unzip fancyBox from the link provided.</li>\n<li>Check the box to activate fancyBox.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What do I have to set up?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and activate the plugin.</li>\n<li>Create a blank WordPress page.</li>\n<li>On the UnGallery settings menu enter page name and path to images.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.  You can install UnGallery and publish a thousand photos to your WordPress site in just a few minutes. While the default configuration is simple, there are many customizable options available in the advanced options of UnGallery, including layout, gallery names, hidden galleries, etc.  UnGallery faces a few unique challenges in leaving the WordPress environment and connecting to external image directories.  To help, tips and the WordPress plugin forum are available to answer questions or issues that arise.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are the images are not displaying?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The path to the image directory is the most common issue.  It must be an absolute path from the file system root like: &#8220;/home/username/your/images/&#8221; and not a relative path like:  &#8220;../your/images/&#8221;.  The trailing slash/ is required.  UnGallery will try to display the path to your WordPress install on the admin page as a suggestion.  If you have shell access to your WordPress installation, you can type: &#8220;pwd&#8221; from the command line in your images directory to display the path.</p>\n<p>Another common issue is the UnGallery permalink does not match the permalink of the gallery page.  Please see installation step 3.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does does the admin page say it cannot create the cache directory?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Permissions on the file system or security on the web server may prevent the plugin from creating the directory automatically.  It can be created manually by typing the following commands from the WordPress installation directory:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir wp-content/cache/\nchmod 777 wp-content/cache/\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are the images sorted?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images are sorted alphabetically.  Alphabetical sorting actually provides ability to include some chronological sorting.  For example pictures taken on digital cameras tend to use formats like:</p>\n<pre><code>-rwxrwxrwx   1.3M Dec 24 08:20 IMG_9558.JPG\n-rwxrwxrwx   1.3M Dec 24 08:24 IMG_9559.JPG\n-rwxrwxrwx   1.4M Dec 24 08:24 IMG_9560.JPG\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the default naming convention for many already does sort by time.  And if the time stamps are ever lost like some archiving or file transfer actions can do, they&#8217;ll still remain in time order:</p>\n<pre><code>-rw-rw-r--   47K 2010-08-30 17:59 DSCF0061.JPG\n-rw-rw-r--   40K 2010-08-30 17:59 DSCF0063.JPG\n-rw-rw-r--   68K 2010-08-30 17:59 DSCF0064.JPG\n</code></pre>\n<p>And they can be modified to suit a custom ordering scheme:</p>\n<pre><code>-rw-rw-r-- 1 pg1720424  72K 2010-08-30 17:58 1.jpg\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 pg1720424  49K 2010-08-30 17:58 2.jpg\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 pg1720424  56K 2010-08-30 17:58 3.jpg\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
