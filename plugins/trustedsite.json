        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20are%20trustmarks%3F'>\nWhat are trustmarks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our trustmarks, or trust badges, are designed to build trust in a merchant&#8217;s reliability and the safety of personal data. The suite of trustmarks are designed to increase confidence when it matters most. The trustmarks let website visitors know that a website has been tested and certified to meet our security standards. When a website is certified, it can display our trustmark. When it no longer meets our standards, they will vanish until the certifications are earned again.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20included%20in%20the%20free%20version%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s included in the free version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once your site earns the Certified Secure certification, the TrustedSite floating trustmark will display on your website for the first 500 visits each month. After your site reaches the 500 visit limit, the trustmark will not be displayed for the remainder of the month. The trustmark will reappear at the beginning of the following month and your visit count will start over at zero.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20define%20500%20visits%3F'>\nHow do you define 500 visits?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We define “visits” as anyone who engages in a session on your site at some point during the month. The session cookie is set for 24 hours. This means that the visitor needs to be idle for more than 24 hours to be counted as a “visitor” for a second time. At the beginning of each month, the visit count will start back at 0. Each time you login to your account at trustedsite.com, you’ll be able to see how many visitors have seen the trustmark so far for the given month.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20upgrade%20to%20a%20pro%20plan%3F'>\nHow do I upgrade to a Pro plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Upgrading is easy! When you upgrade, your trustmark code stays exactly the same. Login to your account and you’ll have to option to upgrade to Pro. Once you select this option, you can make your first payment and set everything up in just a few minutes. (Note: you will need to add additional snippets of code to your site in order to install the additional trustmarks. Don’t worry: there are easy-to-follow directions on how to do this once you have completed the upgrade.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20pricing%20for%20trustedsite%20certification%20pro%20work%3F'>\nHow does pricing for TrustedSite Certification Pro work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>TrustedSite Certification Pro pricing is based on usage and how many visits your site gets each month.
