That information comes from ipinfo.io, an external service which provides available information on user&#8217;s IP address and does not in any way compromise WordPress security. Once the country of attempted login is identified, the plugin compares current locations with that of the previous successful CMS login within the last 2 hours. If country is different, the plugin flags it as unauthorized login attempt and sends notification to OWASP manager, with recommendation to change CMS password.
