If you&#8217;re having a problem it is highly likely that it is one of the common issues below. Please take the time to read these FAQs and try the steps suggested. If you&#8217;re still having problems you can get support in the forum. Be nice, and explain your issue properly so I can try to help you. Thank you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I sell my music using this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[Easy Digital Downloads integration tutorial] (http://enigmaplugins.com/selling-your-music/)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.enigmaweb.com.au/fetchapp-integration-tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FetchApp integration tutorial</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>jQuery Conflict (It&#8217;s breaking my site)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most common problem is a jQuery conflict. In short, if your theme loads jQuery library, then other plugin/s (like this one) also load jQuery then it can cause serious grief on the site and things start breaking. The solution is for all plugin developers and WordPress theme creators to use the copy of jQuery which is included in the WordPress core or load it from Google AJAX libraries, and to consider also using the noConflict jQuery mode (this plugin does all that). If you&#8217;re having jQuery conflict problems on your site then the most likely culprit it your theme. <a href=\"http://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read this article</a> by Chris Coyier which explains the issue in more detail and outlines how you can fix it. You might also like to check out suggestions from <a href=\"http://www.ericmmartin.com/5-tips-for-using-jquery-with-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Eric Martin</a> on the topic.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m having problems adding mp3 files &#8211; they won&#8217;t play.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin supports mp3 and ogg files. You need to upload both an mp3 and ogg version of each track in the playlist. Please also check your files are encoded correctly, and confirm that your file paths are correct. jPlayer sometimes has problems with relative urls so make sure you&#8217;re using the absolute paths.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I convert my files to mp3 and ogg?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are heaps of free conversion tools available &#8211; run a search. Personally, I use <a href=\"http://www.goldwave.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Goldwave.</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>I need ogg? Waaaa!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yeah you really do. Having both the ogg and mp3 is what enables this plugin to work on all the different browsers and devices. You can use a converter to make an ogg copy of your files fast and free and you can batch process with most tools so please don&#8217;t complain about needing ogg. <a href=\"http://enigmaplugins.com/mp3-and-ogg/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More information here in the documentation.</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>The songs won&#8217;t play</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Are you in firefox? If the play button flashes then goes back to pause then this is likely a Mime type issue. Particularly affects Firefox. It can be solved by adding the following lines to your htaccess file:<br />\n    AddType audio/ogg ogg<br />\n    AddType audio/ogg oga<br />\n    AddType video/ogg ogv<br />\n    AddType video/mp4 m4v</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s not working in browser xyz &#8211; can you help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin works on IE9+, Safari, Opera, Firefox and Chrome, on both PC &amp; Mac, and on mobile devices including iPhone/iPad and Android phones. If it&#8217;s not working for you, try adding the Mime types above to your htaccess file. If it&#8217;s still not working, the most common problem is jQuery conflict with your theme or another plugin &#8211; see above. Note that it has limited functionality in earlier version of IE where the html5  tag is not supported. <a href=\"http://enigmaplugins.com/mp3-and-ogg/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More information here in the documentation.</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use it in a widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pro Version has a nice widget function &#8211; go to Appearance &gt; Widgets and if the plugin is activated you will see a custom widget which you can drag into your sidebar. Be aware that you can&#8217;t run two instances of the player on the same page, so if you&#8217;re using it in the sidebar make sure you don&#8217;t also add a different player to a page where the sidebar shows.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happened to the description field?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Description field has been deprecated as of version 2.2  This is because it was causing too many support problems (it broke whenever unusual characters/symbols were used) and I could find no viable workaround.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a way to easliy replace the &#8216;Buy&#8217; button with &#8216;Download&#8217; button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Set the buy text option to Download, leave currency field &amp; song price field blank, and set the buy link option on each song to the url of the mp3 or the script that initiates the download.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this on a non-WordPress site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep, sure can. This plugin is just a WordPress version of HTML5 Music Player by Saleem over at <a href=\"http://www.codebasehero.com/2011/06/html-music-player/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Codebase Hero</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve tried all the obvious stuff and it&#8217;s still not working please request support via the forum. Remember to include a link to your site where the player is embedded, and a full description of the issue plus the steps you&#8217;ve already taken to try to solve it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
