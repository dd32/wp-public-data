        "installation": "<p>Before proceeding please make sure that you are running WordPress 3.5 or above.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the WordPress documentation on how to get the plugin to appear in your installation admin section.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin appears in your installation, you must activate it. Navigate to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; section and locate the &#8220;Wigzo&#8221; plugin. The activation is done simply by clicking the &#8220;Activate&#8221; link next to the plugin name in the list.</p>\n<p>Once you have activated the plugin and added the necessary actions, you need to configure the plugin. The plugins configuration page can be found under the &#8220;Settings &gt; Wigzo&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is activated campaigns and there respective reports can be managed via http://app.wigzo.com/</p>\n<p>The configuration page consists of two settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser Push\n<ul>\n<li>Http / Https (choose https if your website have a valid SSL certificate running on HTTPS. If you don&#8217;t own any certificate, you can select HTTP.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On-Site Push Notification : Enable or disable to activate the same</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the above settings are needed for the plugin to work. You do not need to add Wigzo javascript manually to your store.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses the WordPress Action API to add content to the website. However, there are a few actions that will have to be added to the wordpress theme in order for the plugin to function to its full extent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tracking/sending event can be done using our API\n<ul>\n<li>wigzo.track(eventName, eventValue);</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Users can be mapped using our API\n<ul>\n<li>wigzo.identify(userInfo, force, callback);</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Indexing product using our API. It&#8217;s recommended to use this API only if you are following SPA(Single page architecture).\n<ul>\n<li>wigzo.index(productInfo);</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For brief info do visit Wigzo Integrations Page i.e https://app.wigzo.com/integration/apicodeintegration</p>\n",
