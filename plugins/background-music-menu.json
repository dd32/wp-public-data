        "faq": "\n<h4>Q: What music formats does it support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A:  Format  MIME-type<br />\n    MP3 audio/mpeg<br />\n    Ogg audio/ogg<br />\n    Wav audio/wav</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Why can not I upload a song file to my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This is due to two reasons:<br />\n1. The ability to upload a file to your service is a big threat.<br />\n2. Because of the optimization of your resource. Any video and audio create a high load on your resource.</p>\n<p>If you want to still use the file from your server, you can upload it via ftp. After that, insert the direct path to your file in the plugin&#8217;s settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: How to upgrade?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A:  1. Go to page: you-website//wp-admin/nav-menus.php<br />\n2. Remove &#8220;Background Music Menu&#8221; in menu<br />\n3. Re-add to the menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Why doesn&#8217;t it work in Google Chrome?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A:  Read<br />\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes<br />\nUnfortunately, the &#8220;evil company&#8221;(Only my personal opinion) thinks only of big companies. Without giving you any chance.<br />\nWe can get around this, but it will jeopardize your website. Therefore, we disable this feature for these browsers.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
