The galleries/images are fully managed by WordPress, Story Show Gallery just displays them in full size in a <strong>full screen lightbox</strong> (WP doesn&#8217;t have a default lightbox).</p>\n<p>Story Show Gallery is already set up for standard functionality. But you can customise it with <strong>over 50 options</strong> &#8211; set a watermark, colour theme, borders, social sharing and much more.</p>\n<p>You can activate/deactivate Story Show Gallery whenever you want, it doesn&#8217;t make any changes to the WordPress galleries.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEG4VWDFJ5k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>To enable</strong> the Story Show Gallery lightbox, set the option <strong>Link to</strong> to <strong>Media File</strong> in the WordPress gallery settings. For an image block, select Add Link from the toolbar, then select Media File option.</p>\n<p>For developers: SSG only depends on jQuery library (which is part of the WordPress). Optionally, it loads Exifr if you want to display camera info next to your photos.</p>\n<h3>Your photos in the main role</h3>\n<p>Story Show Gallery aims to display your photos as if they were hanging in a gallery &#8211; you can configure the <strong>photo frame</strong>, choose background and there are no big, distracting arrows next to or over a photo.</p>\n<p>On smartphones, Story Show Gallery can use the <strong>entire display</strong> (including the notch area), there are no white sidebars like in other galleries.</p>\n<p>Full screen mode works <strong>like on You¬≠Tube</strong>. It activa¬≠tes after rotating a phone into landscape mode. Also is possible to start the gallery in full screen portrait or forced landscape mode.</p>\n<h3>Browsing without clicking and thinking</h3>\n<p>Scrolling is the most natural way to interact with a website. Story Show Gallery <strong>works like Facebook</strong> &#8211; as a visitor scrolls down, new images are constantly loaded.</p>\n<p>Story Show Gallery is <strong>vertical</strong>, making it ideal for use on mobile phones. In portrait mode, visitors typically see part of the next image and scroll to see the whole image.</p>\n<h3>Brand building and social sharing</h3>\n<p>Story Show Gallery can display <strong>your logo</strong> or some text (emoji) over images. You can configure it in the SSG settings.</p>\n<p>Social sharing icon is not put aside, it is part of the content, but subtle. A spectator&#8217;s eyes will literally crash into <strong>the sharing icon</strong> at the end of a caption or in the corner of a photo. This can be disabled in the settings.</p>\n<p>You can <strong>deep link</strong> into the gallery to show a specific image. Just use the URL address + image name in the hashtag -&gt; <a href=\"https://ssg.flor.cz/#on-the-hook\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ssg.Flor.cz/#On-the-hOOk</a></p>\n<h3>Complete your photos with captions</h3>\n<p>With captions you can tell <strong>the whole story</strong> behind photos or amuse a spectator with some fun fact. Exif information can be included in captions.</p>\n<p>Google treats captions like textual content. Especially if you don&#8217;t have a lot of text on your page, captions will help your page rank higher in Google searches.</p>\n<p>SSG is probably <strong>the only gallery</strong> that can place each caption individually according to image size vs. screen size. It is especially important on smartphones to use the whole screen.</p>\n<h3>Some more features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optional <strong>3D animation</strong> of image thumbnails.</li>\n<li><strong>EXIF</strong> info in captions and EXIF listing on click</li>\n<li>Support for <strong>Google analytics</strong>. Find out, how long site visitors view each photo and how many times.</li>\n<li><strong>4 visual themes</strong></li>\n<li>Optional animated transition when scrolling.
