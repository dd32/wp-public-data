We’ve seen on average 42 percent of leads converted via live chat take place after the typical business hours of 9 a.m to 5 p.m. Without around-the-clock coverage you may be missing nearly half the leads you could be getting from your Live Chat provider.</p>\n<p>ApexChat charges only for actual qualified leads that are sent to you.
