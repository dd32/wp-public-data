        "description": "<h4>Create, organize and display your projects. Ideal to publish your portfolio online.</h4>\n<p>This plugin was created to help you publish your projects portfolio. Unlike some other plugins out there, this &#8220;Projects&#8221; plugin is designed to be as lightweight as possible while staying complete and flexible in order to make your publishing process as easy as one can imagine.</p>\n<h4>Easy to use</h4>\n<p>All you have to do is just to install and activate the plugin, decide the URL structure for your projects (&#8220;projects&#8221; by default) and save plugin settings. You are ready to publish your portfolio &#8211; just fill in the form to describe the project and hit the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button!</p>\n<h4>Detailed project information</h4>\n<p>Project publishing form stays as simple as possible and allows you edit the project summary and full description containing any information you might need: images, galleries, subtitles, lists, links, shortcodes, project classification criterias, author etc.</p>\n<h4>Fully integrated with WordPress</h4>\n<p>This plugin fully relies on native WordPress structure and uses its user friendly interface to create singular project pages (each project has its own URL) and project archives (portfolios).</p>\n<p>Out of the box, you can organize your projets by category, type, collection and client. If you are a team &#8211; you can assign each project to a member of your team and have multiple portfolios published at the same time. A very easy user interface allows you to control the display of the projects archive links (portfolio links) on the front end of the site.</p>\n<p>Some custom coding also allows you to add any other classification criterias you might need without any problems (see <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy\" title=\"Function Reference/register taxonomy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">taxonomy registration function</a> on WordPress codex).</p>\n<h4>Fully integrated with your theme</h4>\n<p>This plugin was designed to stay as lightweight as possible and does not try to reinvent the weel: it fully relies on your theme and WordPress functionality to display projects while leaving the door open for any kind of customization you can imagine or your theme allows (via native WordPress template system, hooks, filters, scripts and stylesheets). All of the above makes this plugin extremely flexible and compatible with any theme that follows WordPress standards.</p>\n<h4>User friendly interface</h4>\n<p>This plugin has easy to understand user interface that allows you to control the project permalinks and project display options.</p>\n<h4>Separate portfolios for each team members</h4>\n<p>This plugin is ready to be used on complex websites that need to handle separate portfolios for all team members. Author portfolio links are generated on the fly and can be configured via the display and permalink options. Example URL <em>http://domain.com/portfolios/author-name/</em> will generate a portfolio page for a member of your team that will be fully integrated into your theme.</p>\n<h4>After project widget area</h4>\n<p>This plugin creates a special widget area right after the content on singular project pages &#8211; ideal place to display a widget with an inquiry form for better conversions. You can also disable this widget area on any specific project page (or globally if you decide to do so).</p>\n<h4>Mobile friendly</h4>\n<p>This &#8220;Projects&#8221; plugin deals with managing your protfolios and does not try to do the theme&#8217;s job. If your theme is mobile friendly, this plugin will be as well.</p>\n<h4>Created for real businesses</h4>\n<p>This plugin was created to be used on business websites and even if it is free, the main idea is to use it in a real business that brings real money.</p>\n<h4>Translation ready</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses WordPress standards to output any text strings on the front end and in the admin area and is ready to be translated to any language.</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p>Even if this plugin is extremely easy to use you might have some questions and / or suggestions. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/projects-by-serge-liatko\" title=\"Projects by Serge Liatko - Support section\" rel=\"ugc\">support section</a> to have them answered.</p>\n<h3>Future Development and Support</h3>\n<p>For the plugin support and/or feature requests please visit <a href=\"https://sergeliatko.com/?utm_source=projects-by-serge-liatko&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_content=readmelink&amp;utm_campaign=wpplugins\" title=\"Serge Liatko - Web solutions for your business\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://sergeliatko.com</a>.</p>\n<h4>Features to expect in Projects plugin:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Project details button / URL</li>\n<li>Project ratings and questions / answers</li>\n<li>Portfolio aggregate ratings</li>\n<li>&#8220;Grid&#8221; portfolio display under Genesis framework</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features already included from the list above:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Project archive links</li>\n<li>Author portfolios</li>\n<li>After project widget area</li>\n</ul>\n",

When someone tries to access this page on the front end &#8211; WordPress will automatically display the index of your projects. You may easily add this page to the navigation menus and sitemaps.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I have a &#8220;Grid Display&#8221; of my projects?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please, note that while this plugin provides you with a handy interface in the backend to manage your portfolio, it does not help you to have any specific type of layout on the front end&#8230; It is your website theme&#8217;s job. By default the project archives have the same layout as your blog posts, but you can customize them via theme&#8217;s templates and/or hooks/filters. Each theme is different, so please, refer to your theme&#8217;s developer for help with specific layouts.</li>\n<li>Some of the most popular themes however will be supported in the future.
