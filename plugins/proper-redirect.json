        "faq": "\n<h4>So why would I ever want to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well Charlie, that is an excellent question. Thanks very much for asking me this. It gives me the opportunity to elaborate more on the subject. Which I of course like. Because I can sell you more stuff. Oh no, wait, just read on.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It prevents that your website is accessible on multiple domains. It will give your visitors a more consistent experience, the url is in the address bar is always similar. It doesn&#8217;t matter if they use www. or not in the request, it will work (which is good of course) and will redirect to the proper url.</li>\n<li>I expect it is better for the search engines as well. It prevents duplicate content. But more important, if someone makes a link to an alias of your domain name it might not be counted as a link to your actual website. Which is negative for your ranking, it will be divided over two urls. Correct me if I am wronk. That is how Brian Cox would say it, right?</li>\n<li>For me personally it is handy because I develop on an alias. For example at clientname.mrwebsite.nl. When the website is finished and should go live I want to make the switch to clientname.nl instead of the clientname.mrwebsite.nl. All I have to do now is change the URL in WordPress and the &#8216;subdomain alias&#8217; stops working. Which is nice because WordPress is awesome and the website will be indexed by Google on the temorary address and clients b*tch about that.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
