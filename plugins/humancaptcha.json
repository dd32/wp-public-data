By using a CAPTCHA, only humans can enter comments on your blog, and people do not need to sign up before they enter a comment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting Email Addresses From Scrapers<br />\nSpammers crawl the web looking for e-mail addresses rendered in text. CAPTCHAs can hide your e-mail address from web scrapers, by requiring users to solve a CAPTCHA before revealing your e-mail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deterring Viruses, Worms and Spam<br />\nCAPTCHAs may reduce the likelihood of e-mailed viruses, worms and spam, by only accepting an e-mail if it has been established that there is a human behind the sending computer.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>Many thanks to:<br />\nTH90 (https://wordpress.org/support/profile/th90) of MPW D&amp;D for the Persian translation files (fa_IR).
