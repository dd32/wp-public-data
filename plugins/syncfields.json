You can map these fields and choose to automatically sync these with other usermeta fields, or with the WordPress regular user fields.<br />\nFor example, you can choose to Sync WooCommerce billing_country usermeta field with the WordPress main Country user field. And lot&#8217;s of other ways to sync data within WordPress, and keep it synced automatically.</p>\n<h4>Does it work with plugin xyz&#8230;?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it works with ANY plugin which creates usermeta fields. The plugin automatically finds new fields every time you install a new plugin.</p>\n<h4>To create a new Sync between two database fields:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Add new mapping&#8217;. A list of available fields are collected. (This can take some time).</li>\n<li>Choose the Primary Field.</li>\n<li>Choose a field the primary field will sync with.</li>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Create New Field&#8217;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you created a mapping between two fields, the data will remain synced for all users. (The way it works is that every time data is changed in a field the sync will trigger automatically).</p>\n<h4>To delete a field mapping:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Click the &#8216;delete&#8217; button in the applicable mapping row.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>To edit a field mapping:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Click the &#8216;edit&#8217; button in the applicable mapping row.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Caution:</h4>\n<p>Make sure database fields which you intend to sync are of the same type. So for example do not sync an email field with a Country field, this will result in invalid data in the synced fields.<br />\nIf in doubt do NOT sync fields with each other, it may break your site in extreme cases.</p>\n<h4>Tested at plugintests.com</h4>\n<p>Wonder if it will slow down your site? Wonder it creates PHP errors?<br />\nIt doesn&#8217;t. Check this out: https://plugintests.com/plugins/wporg/syncfields/latest</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>For an automatic installation through WordPress:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the &#8216;Add New&#8217; plugins screen in your WordPress admin area</li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;SyncFields&#8217;</li>\n<li>Click &#8216;Install Now&#8217; and activate the plugin</li>\n<li>Go the &#8216;Export User Data&#8217; menu, under &#8216;Users&#8217;</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>For a manual installation via FTP:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the synfields directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in your WordPress admin area</li>\n<li>Go the &#8216;SyncFields&#8217; menu</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the downloaded zip file on the &#8216;Add New&#8217; plugins screen (see the &#8216;Upload&#8217; tab) in your WordPress admin area and activate.</li>\n<li>Go the &#8216;SyncFields&#8217; menu</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='i%27m%20missing%20usermeta%20fields'>\nI&#8217;m missing usermeta fields\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>So you  activated a new plugin, and expected new usermeta fields to appear in SyncFields. But they didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Why does this happen:<br />\nMost usermeta fields only get created in the WordPress database once they are needed for the first time. This typically is when a user first populates a field, and not once a plugin gets activated!</p>\n<p>What can you do about it:<br />\nIf you miss a specific usermeta field, create a test customer and use the field you want to appear.<br />\nFor example: to make WooCommerce billing_country usermeta field appear, create a testcustomer and purchase a test product whilst populating the checkout fields including the billing country for the test customer. At that moment new usermeta fields for WooCommerce are created for the first time in the WordPress database (Tip: use the &#8216;Cash on Delivery&#8217; payment method so you don&#8217;t have to set up any real payment methods yet to place the test order). After this, these usermeta fields are created, and therefore available to SyncFields.</p>\n<p>For details please check this:<br />\nhttps://wordpress.org/support/topic/adding-fields-6</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20headless%20%2Fjamstack%20wordpress%20sites%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with Headless /JamStack WordPress sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it works.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20cron%20scheduling%3F'>\nWhat is Cron Scheduling?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to run a regular Sync on a Cron schedule, please use this option.<br />\nIt normally should not be necessary because syncs are saved upon every commit.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20the%20documentation'>\nWhere can I find the documentation\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is documented in the backend.
