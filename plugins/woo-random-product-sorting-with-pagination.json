Activate adds the option.  Deactivate removes it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20a%20wp%20engine%20user%20and%20my%20products%20are%20not%20being%20randomly%20sorted.%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI am a WP Engine user and my products are not being randomly sorted. What&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, WP Engine disallows ORDER BY RAND() due to performance concerns about careless use.  This default setting causes the WooCommerce Random Product Sorting with Pagination plugin not to work.  You can manually enable ORDER BY RAND() from the admin area of your WP Engine WordPress site.  Go to WP Engine &gt; General Settings &gt; Advanced Configuration and set &#8216;Allow ORDER BY RAND()&#8217; to &#8216;Enabled.&#8217;  The plugin should now work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20do%20if%20i%20have%20problems%20or%20other%20questions%3F'>\nWhat can I do if I have problems or other questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can try emailing me at william@trainedlizard.com.  This is a free, use-at-your-own-risk plugin with no guarantee of support, but I am generally happy to answer questions or make tweaks if anyone needs that.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
