        "description": "<p>And The Winner Is&#8230; is a WordPress plugin that helps you manage product giveaways by allowing you to mark posts as &#8220;contests&#8221;. Each contest has a user-specified number of winners that can be selected at random from comments for that giveaway post.</p>\n<p>The problem is a simple one. Many site owners run contests that allow entries as comments on a blog post, but managing entries and randomly selecting winners is a chore. And The Winner Is&#8230; helps to solve this problem by managing the comment entries and winners by selecting those winners at the click of a button.</p>\n<h3>Future Releases</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Contest pagination</li>\n<li>Contest filtering (AJAX) &amp; sorting</li>\n<li>Automatic notification to a confirmed winner</li>\n<li>Alternate randomization options</li>\n<li>Ignore certain email addresses</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the contents of the plugin to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I setup a contest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply edit a post and check the box in the &#8220;And The Winner Is&#8230;&#8221; meta box to indicate that you want<br />\nthat specific post to be considered a contest and the number of winners that are possible for this contest.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I find a winner?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the WordPress admin area, you&#8217;ll find a menu option, &#8220;And The Winner Is&#8230;&#8221;, which can be expanded.<br />\nSelect the &#8220;Contests&#8221; option and a list of posts you&#8217;ve marked as contests will appear.  You can only<br />\nhave the plugin find a winner if comment on that contest are closed. You can, however, close the comments<br />\nfor a post from this screen.  Once comments are closed, click the &#8220;And The Winner Is&#8230;&#8221; button for your<br />\ncorresponding contest.  The plugin will randomly select a comment from that contest and mark it as an<br />\nunconfirmed winner.  Unconfirmed winners appear under your contest description with a background color<br />\nof yellow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I confirm a winner for a contest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the comment meets your criteria for winning the contest, you can click the &#8220;Confirm Winner&#8221; button<br />\non a contest where a winner has been selected, but not confirmed. Once you&#8217;ve confirmed the winner, they<br />\ncannot be rejected, nor can another winner be selected.  Confirmed winners appear under your contest<br />\ndescription with a background color of yellow and with the text &#8220;(confirmed)&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I reject a winner, or select a different winner for a contest</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the contest winner has not been marked as confirmed by the plugin (i.e. it appears in yellow below your<br />\ncontest description), you can select &#8220;Reject Winner&#8221; and that winner will be forgotten and you can find a<br />\nnew random winner by clicking the &#8220;And The Winner Is&#8230;&#8221; button again.</p>\n<p>A comment that has been rejected as a winner will not be selected again as a possible winner, so be<br />\ncareful when rejecting winners.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I completely uninstall the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the WordPress admin area, you&#8217;ll find a menu option, &#8220;And The Winner Is&#8230;&#8221;, which can be expanded.<br />\nSelect the Uninstall option and click the button that indicates all contest data will be removed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I deactivate the plugin, will I lose all of my contest data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, deactivating the plugin will not remove your contest data.  You will have to run the uninstall<br />\nprocedure to remove all of your contest data.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
