Cron Timeslots are in gmt time</li>\n<li>Jobs with arguments that are arrays of numeric parameters were difficult to delete since the form passes them as string and wp uses a serialised md has to  make a key for the deletion.<br />\nPlugin now checks for numeric arguments and converts to int and tries again.</li>\n<li>Help and explanations added.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Began with all the various cron plugins out there.  None addressed all requirements, so I rewrite the whole lot and made a compilation plugin of possible cron features.</li>\n</ul>\n"
