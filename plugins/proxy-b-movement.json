        "faq": "\n<h4>Is it safe to add this code to my blog/ website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course. As safe as the Hepatitis B vaccine. This code works only when someone is accessing your blog/ website through a web proxy, and the message is displayed only once. So, it&#8217;s not annoying at all.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Coding is all greek for me. Still, if you can help me understand how it works?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple. All it does is check if the domain name of the blog/ website being visited matches to the actual domain or not. A negative means current visitor is accessing the blog/ website using a web proxy, and it passes a message to the visitor that he needs one more proxy i.e. Hepatitis B vaccination. When the user clicks ok to know more, it leads him to google search results. Using cookies, the code achieves displaying the message to the user only once.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t have a blog/ website. How can I help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Above all, help yourself. Get tested and vaccinated for Hepatitis B. Now, if you are a blogger/ webmaster, you can help us by adding the code on your site. If you don&#8217;t have a blog, still you can help spread the words by sharing this movement with your friends. You tell your friends. They tell their friends. Soon, it becomes a movement. Also, we plan to come up with simple one-click-install plugins for more blogging platforms. If you are a developer and willing to volunteer, please contact at rupeshmandal@gmail.com</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have my doubts about how effective it is to promote Hepatitis B awareness?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just the beginning. The frequency by which Indian authorities are blocking freedom of speech, imagine if all the websites/ blogs have the code added. Moreover, due to company policies many websites and blogs, especially with adult content are blocked in offices by firewall. In that case too, this code promotes awareness about Hepatitis B when an employee bypasses company policies using a proxy; given the site being part of this movement.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
