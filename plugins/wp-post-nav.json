The best way to make WP Post Nav work, is to ensure that all posts and custom posts types have categories assigned, OR by turning off the &#8216;show posts from the same category&#8217; option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20suggestion%20%2F%20want%20a%20custom%20hook%20or%20modification'>\nI have a suggestion / want a custom hook or modification\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Drop a question in the plugin support option above or email me @ contact@wppostnav.com.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
