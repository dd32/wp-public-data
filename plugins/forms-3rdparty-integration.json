Multiple configurable services, custom field mapping.  Provides hooks and filters for pre/post processing of results.  Allows you to send separate emails, or attach additional results to existing emails.  Comes with a couple examples of hooks for common CRMs (listrak, mailchimp, salesforce).

See plugin folder <code>/3rd-parties</code> for example code for some common CRMs, which you can either directly include or copy to your code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I need to submit multiple values as&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, if more than one value appears in the post request for the same field/key, they will be joined by the &#8216;separator&#8217; value like <code>&amp;post-values=a,b,c</code>.</li>\n<li>However, if you use <code>[]</code> as the separator it will instead create multiple keys like <code>&amp;post-values[]=a&amp;post-values[]=b&amp;...</code>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>[#]</code> to retain the numerical index:  <code>&amp;post-values[0]=a&amp;post-values[1]=b&amp;...</code></li>\n<li>Use <code>[%]</code> to place the numerical index at desired location; specifically useful with nested fields via Xpost below (and issues <a href=\"https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-xpost/issues/11\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#11</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-xpost/issues/7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#7</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you instead need to combine/nest fields, check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rd-party-xpost/\" rel=\"ugc\">Forms: 3rdparty Xpost</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make a GET request instead of POST?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since v1.7.6, it&#8217;s an admin setting for GET and POST, but for anything other than those two that you&#8217;d write a hook.</p>\n<p><em>from https://wordpress.org/support/topic/method-get?replies=2#post-5996489</em></p>\n<p>See &#8216;Hooks&#8217; section, #5 of https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rdparty-integration/other_notes/ and the <a href=\"https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-integration/blob/master/forms-3rdparty-integration.php#L478\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source code</a>.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to perform <code>wp_remote_get</code> inside that filter and set <code>$post_args['response_bypass']</code> with the response, something like:</p>\n<pre><code>function my_3rdparty_get_override($post_args, $service, $form) {\n    $post_args['response_bypass'] = wp_remote_get($service['url'], $post_args);\n    return $post_args;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I dynamically change the URL?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the hook <code>Forms3rdPartyIntegration_service_filter_url</code>.  (see &#8220;Hooks&#8221; section)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about Hidden Fields?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using hidden fields can provide an easier way to include arbitrary values on a per-form basis, rather than a single &#8220;Is Value?&#8221; in the Service mapping, as you can then put your form-specific value in the hidden field, and map the hidden field name generically.</p>\n<p>For convenience, you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7-modules/\" title=\"Hidden Fields from CF7 Modules\" rel=\"ugc\">Contact Form 7 Modules: Hidden Fields</a>.  This plugin originally included the relevant code, but it was causing issues on install, so is no longer bundled with it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I export/import settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the &#8220;Forms 3rdparty Migration&#8221; plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rdparty-migrate/, which lets you export and import the raw settings as JSON.<br />\nYou can also export settings from the original plugin [Contact Form 7: 3rdparty Integration][] and &#8220;upgrade&#8221; them for this plugin (although &gt; 1.6.1 you will need to reselect forms).<br />\nAlso at https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-migrate</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I map url parameters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the &#8220;Dynamic Fields&#8221; plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rdparty-dynamic-fields/<br />\nAlso at https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-dynamicfields</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I send XML/submit to SOAP?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For simple xml containers try the &#8220;Forms 3rdparty Xpost&#8221; plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rd-party-xpost/<br />\nAlso at https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-xpost</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set headers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can also set headers with &#8220;Forms 3rdparty Xpost&#8221; plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/forms-3rd-party-xpost/<br />\nAlso at https://github.com/zaus/forms-3rdparty-xpost</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I show a custom message on the confirmation screen?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The failure message is shown by default if the 3rdparty post did not succeed.  You can add custom messaging to the plugin&#8217;s (GF, CF7, Ninja) email or success screen response with something like:</p>\n<pre><code>class MyPlugin {\n    public function MyPlugin() {\n        add_filter('Forms3rdPartyIntegration_service', array(&amp;$this, 'adjust_response'), 10, 2);\n    }\n\n    public function adjust_response($body, $refs) {\n        // use 'attach' to inject to regular email\n        // use 'message' to inject to page\n        $refs['attach'] = 'custom message in email';\n        $refs['message'] = 'custom message on page';\n    }\n}\nnew MyPlugin(); // attach hook\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I conditionally submit?
