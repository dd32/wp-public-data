        "description": "<p>Easy Optimizer is a simple and lightweight plugin that allows you to improve the performance of your WordPress website by lazy-loading images, videos and iframes. Converting images to webp, avif with the help of shortpixel cdn. This can help to reduce the time it takes for your website to load, which can lead to improved FCP (First Contentful Paint) and LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) scores, as well as overall performance.</p>\n<p>To use the plugin, simply enable lazyload in the plugin&#8217;s settings, and the plugin will take care of the rest.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<h4>1. Serve images in next-gen formats</h4>\n<p>The plugin has an option to convert images to Avif or webp autmatically via shortpixel cdn when the browser is supported. You need to signup <a href=\"https://easywpstuff.com/shortpixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ShortPixel Here</a> then just associate your domain. That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;re all set to enjoy up to 500MB of free usage per month.</p>\n<h4>2. Image elements do not have explicit width and height</h4>\n<p>The plugin automatically adds width and height to the images when lazyloading is enabled</p>\n<h4>3. Lazy Load Images</h4>\n<p>Lazy loading images is a technique that significantly improves your website&#8217;s loading times. Instead of loading all images at once when a user visits a page, the plugin ensures that images are loaded only when they come into the user&#8217;s viewport. This results in faster initial page loading and reduces unnecessary data consumption, leading to improved FCP and LCP scores.</p>\n<h4>4. Lazy Load Iframes and HTML video</h4>\n<p>The Easy Optimizer plugin extends its lazy loading capabilities to iframes and autoplaying html5 videos.</p>\n<h4>5. Page Preloading</h4>\n<p>Preloading pages is another essential feature of Easy Optimizer. By intelligently preloading linked pages in the background while users navigate your site, subsequent page loads become faster and smoother. Preloading reduces the perceived loading time, making your website feel more responsive and enjoyable for visitors.</p>\n<h3>Why Choose Easy Optimizer</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Elementor Integration</strong>: Easy Optimizer is fully compatible with Elementor, ensuring seamless integration and effortless optimization of your Elementor-powered website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Performance Enhancement</strong>: By employing lazy loading for images and iframes and enabling page preloading, you can significantly boost your website&#8217;s performance and enhance core web vitals metrics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Experience Improvement</strong>: Faster loading times and smoother navigation lead to an improved user experience, reducing bounce rates and increasing user engagement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Core Web Vitals Optimization</strong>: Easy Optimizer focuses on optimizing core web vitals metrics, which are crucial factors for search engine ranking and user satisfaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lightweight and Efficient</strong>: The plugin is designed to be lightweight, ensuring that it doesn&#8217;t add unnecessary bloat to your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simple Setup</strong>: Easy Optimizer offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy to configure and get your website optimized in no time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
