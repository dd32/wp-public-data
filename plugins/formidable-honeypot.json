        "faq": "\n<h4>Can SPAM still sneak through somehow?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, it&#8217;s possible. There&#8217;s no way to know exactly how every spam bot works. Or in some cases, SPAM messages can be filled in by real people.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it ever block real people by accident?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Again, it&#8217;s possible. One way it could happen is if the user has an &#8220;auto-fill&#8221; feature on their browser. We will be doing our best to prevent this from happening, but there&#8217;s never a guarantee. There is a message that tells people their response was not successful, so at least they know it happened and can contact you directly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work with both Free and Pro versions of Formidable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it adds a honeypot to all forms, regardless of whether you have the <a href=\"http://www.wpbiz.co/go/forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro</a> or Free versions of Formidable.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
