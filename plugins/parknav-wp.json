        "description": "<p>Parknav WP is a lightweight plugin for adding the Parknav Map to your site. It presents a map with your office location together with information on where to park nearby. Parknav information includes nearby on-street real-time available parking, on-street restrictions, and off-street parking lots.</p>\n<p>Your Parknav WP provides information about available parking near you right now in realtime. Parking on street is lit with GREEN color when there is at least one spot there. Parking on street is lit with BROWN color when there is 50% chance for at least one spot there right now. Parking lots nearby are shown.</p>\n<p>On-street data is available in all major metro areas in the North America and Europe (if not available in your city, email contact@parknav.com for service).</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>You use the plugin to place a map with parking information in your website. One of two ways available now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Place shortcode [parknav lat=37.78 lon=-122.4 zoom=15  height=300], replacing the lat and lon coordinates with your location (for example, if your address is &#8220;44 Montgomery street, San Francisco, CA&#8221;, find the lat/lon for your address (e.g. at https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html)) and your shortcode is [parknav lat=37.789920 lon=-122.401790]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use Elementor, use the widget in Elementor for Parknav. Place the widget on your web page as desired, and change parameters such as zoom, lat/lon coordinates, and more.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit the Plugins page on www.parknav.com to signup and stay in touch with new features and locations.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<p>The plugin requires no activation license, and provides shortcode as well as widget for Elementor.</p>\n<h4>Documentation</h4>\n<p>Documentation for the core plugin and add-ons can be found <a href=\"https://www.parknav.com/plugins/wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on the Parknav site here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p>For technical support, please visit <a href=\"https://www.parknav.com/plugins/wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Parknav</a> or contact contact@parknav.com.</p>\n",
