It should work in yours too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does my theme need to be &#8216;responsive&#8217; in order to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at all. You can use it with any theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the way it looks?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, you can easily override the slider CSS in your theme. The easiest approach is to use a tool like Firebug to find the snippet you need to override. Then copy it to your theme CSS file (usually <code>style.css</code>) and edit it there, using a CSS selector with higher priority.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I create more than one slider?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently the plugin can maintain only one slider.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
