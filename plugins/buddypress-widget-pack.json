        "faq": "\n<h4>How might I use this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Besides just dragging-and-dropping into your sidebar, I highly recommend using the Tabbed Widgets plugin to consolidate all of the Buddypress Widget Pack&#8217;s widgets into a consolidated interface.  For example, create an accordion or tabbed widget that has the Newest Members Widget, Popular Members Widget, and Random Members Widget all in one.  Check out Kaspars Dambis Tabbed Widgets plugin: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tabbed-widgets/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
