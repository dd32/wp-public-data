        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need to sign up for an account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the plugin does not contact an external server so you don&#8217;t need an account. It just sits on your server like a personal bodyguard that never gets tired.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will my users see?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No captcha or other visible item is added to your blog so nothing will look different. A hidden element is added to the comment form but this doesn&#8217;t affect what the user sees. It also won&#8217;t affect your existing WordPress comment settings such as whether administrator approval is required, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it really work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not perfect so you may still get some spam comments coming through but these should be very few. It&#8217;s designed to look for obvious signs of spam and it&#8217;s pretty good at it (although I&#8217;m biased!) but it&#8217;s also designed not to be too aggressive so it shouldn&#8217;t block genuine comments.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about foreign language blogs or comments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No-captcha Spam Block is multi-talented and can block spam comments in any language, whatever language your website is in.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
