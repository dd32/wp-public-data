Supports BuddyPress or websites where the users date of birth is stored as a custom user meta.</p>\n<p>To prevent abuse, users can only get birthday points once each year. This means your users can change their date of birth if they want but it will not trigger new points.</p>\n<p>The hook will check for birthdays on the first page request each morning. If you think the hook has missed a day, you can always trigger a new check by saving the hooks settings. Clicking on the Save button will force the hook to check for birthdays on the next page load.</p>\n<h4>BuddyPress Setup</h4>\n<p>If you use BuddyPress profiles, you can create a custom profile field where users enter their date of birth. You can name the field anything you like and use any format. The only requirement is that the field type is set to “Date selector”. This will ensure all fields are properly formatted.</p>\n<h4>WordPress User Meta Setup</h4>\n<p>WordPress and a vast majority of plugins store user details as custom user meta in your database. If you have a field setup or your plugin provides a field, enter the meta key’s id. The dates must be stores formatted using Year Month Day Y-m-d. You can select to store times as well but this will be ignored.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mycred/\" rel=\"ugc\">myCred 1.8+</a></li>\n<li>WordPress 5.0+</li>\n<li>PHP 5.3+</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>More myCred Freebies Integrations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-h5p\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred H5P</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-credly\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred Credly</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-learndash/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred &#8211; Learndash</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-lifterlms-integration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LifterLMS Plugin Integration with myCred </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-bp-group-leaderboards\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred BP Group Leaderboards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-event-espresso-4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for Event Espresso 4.6+</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-for-wp-pro-quiz/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for Wp-Pro-Quiz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-rating-form\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for Rating Form</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-wp-postviews\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for WP-PostViews</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-for-totalpoll\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for TotalPoll</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-gutenberg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred Gutenberg</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-events-manager-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for Events Manager Pro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-buddypress-compliments\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for BuddyPress Compliments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-retro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred Retro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-courseware\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for Courseware</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-for-gd-star-rating\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for GD Star Rating</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-for-buddypress-links\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for BuddyPress Links</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-for-bp-album-bp-gallery\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred for BP Album and BP Gallery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mycred.me/store/mycred-elementor/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myCred Elementor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>DOCUMENTATION AND SUPPORT</h4>\n<p>For more information visit our <strong><a href=\"https://www.mycred.me/store/mycred-birthdays/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation Page</a></strong>.</p>\n",
