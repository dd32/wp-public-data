        "description": "<p>The &#8220;Shipping Rate By Cities&#8221; allows you to set custom shipping rates based on cities in your WordPress WooCommerce store. It provides a flexible solution for configuring shipping costs specific to different cities, giving you greater control over your shipping options.</p>\n<p>Main features of this plugin include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Custom Shipping Rates: Set different shipping rates for individual cities you choose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Export/Import Shiprate Table: Easily export and import your custom shiprate table using CSV files. This feature allows you to manage and update shipping rates in bulk, saving you time and effort.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Default Shipping Rate: Define a default shipping rate for cities that are not included in your custom shiprate table. This ensures consistent shipping costs for areas not explicitly configured.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sample CSV File: The plugin provides a download button to get a sample CSV file that you can use as a template for importing your shiprate table. This makes it easier to format and structure your shipping data correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Quantity Multiplier: The plugin includes a checkbox that allows you to multiply the shipping rate by the product quantity. This is useful if you want to offer discounted shipping for larger orders or charge extra for multiple quantities.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://tridenttechnolabs.com/shipping-rate-by-cities/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SHIPPING RATE BY CITIES DEMO </a></p>\n<p>Please view the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shipping-rate-by-cities/faq/\" rel=\"ugc\">FAQ Page</a> for information on how to use <code>Shipping Rate By Cities</code>.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>For support or feature requests related to the &#8220;Shipping Rate by Zipcode&#8221; plugin, please contact <a href=\"mailto:&#x68;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x6f;&#x40;&#x74;&#114;&#105;&#100;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#116;&#101;&#099;&#104;&#110;&#111;&#108;&#097;&#098;&#115;.co&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hello@tridenttechnolabs.com</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need assistance with creating a custom plugin for your website or company, our team at <a href=\"https://tridenttechnolabs.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Trident Technolabs</a> offers professional plugin development services.
