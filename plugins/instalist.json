This simple yet powerful tool is a game-changer, especially for developers who find themselves repeatedly installing the same set of plugins across multiple projects.<br />\nWhy Instalist?</p>\n<p>Imagine this scenario: You’re setting up a new WordPress site, and as always, there are certain plugins you can’t do without—think WPForms, WP Mail SMTP, Yoast SEO, Google Site Kit, and a few others. Normally, you’d have to install each of these plugins individually, a process that can become tedious, especially if you manage several sites.</p>\n<p>Instalist changes all that. With this plugin, you can create a list of your go-to plugins, save it, and use it to quickly set up new sites. No more searching for each plugin, no more repetitive clicks—just a streamlined process that gets you up and running faster than ever.<br />\nCreating and Saving Plugin Lists</p>\n<p>The magic of Instalist lies in its ability to create and save plugin lists. Here’s how it works: Once you’ve installed Instalist, you simply start typing the name of a plugin you want to add to your list. Instalist will automatically suggest matching plugins based on your input, allowing you to quickly find and select the one you need. After selecting the desired plugin, you just click “Add plugin,” and it’s added to your list along with its exact name, slug, and icon.</p>\n<p>Once you have saved your list you can export it to a csv file and this is the game-changer feature of Instalist: in any new website you&#8217;ll build you&#8217;ll be able to import that file and install and activate all of your plugins with just a click!</p>\n<p>In the ree version, you can create and manage only one list of plugins, so you can try the plugin and see how easy it is to use.</p>\n<p>The Premium version will offer these additional features:<br />\n* multiple lists management: you&#8217;ll be able to create as many lists as you want. For instance you could create a plugins list for e-commerce websites, another one for blogs and a new list for corporate websites<br />\n* selective installation and activation: you&#8217;ll be able to choose if install and activate all the plugins in the list or select only a few<br />\n* add plugins to your list choosing among the currently installed plugins</p>\n<p>To do its job, Instalist relies on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\" rel=\"ugc\">wordpress.org</a> and uses WordPress plugin API to download and activate the desired plugins.
