However, R+L does offer our Shipping Platform which includes a host of other features like BOL generation, Pickup Request Scheduling, Hazmat and Freight Classification support, Shipment Tracing, Pickup Notifications and more. You learn more, here.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20require%20woocommerce%20to%20work%3F'>\nDoes the plugin require WooCommerce to work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
