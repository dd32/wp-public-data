        "changelog": "<h4>1.2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added database optimization feature on the DFEHC settings page to help with database bloat and unoptimized or dead-end tables. </li>\n<li>Minor improvements</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved server load and response time retrieval functions to address potential issues on certain hosting environments where the functions might get blocked. Thanks to user Tom M for notifing this isssue. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance improvements and bug fixes.</li>\n<li>Localized chart.js file</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Settings page update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code structure upgrade.</li>\n<li>Added the ability to manually control back-end heartbeat as well as editor heartbeat intervals.</li>\n<li>Now you can adjust the resource priority from WP Admin Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; DFEHC</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Unix server load detection.</li>\n<li>Added a new setting in the plugin&#8217;s settings DFEHC page that allows users to completely disable the WordPress Heartbeat API. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved object caching calling method.</li>\n<li>Other small code and visual adjustments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Heartbeat Health widget in the admin dashboard.</li>\n<li>Performance &amp; security improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small code improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Persistent Storage Support: Added support for Redis and Memcached as persistent storage options for efficient data handling and improved performance.</li>\n<li>Settings Page: Added a dedicated settings page to configure Redis and Memcached settings, providing flexibility in specifying server and port information. In the event the user does not have persistent storage support options, the plugin will fallback to regular caching. Update the settings only if they are needed from your WP Admin dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; DFEHC</li>\n<li>Improved Load-Based Recommendations: Calculate the recommended heartbeat interval based on server load average and response time to optimize performance</li>\n<li>Made various updates to improve compatibility with different server configurations and enhance overall performance.</li>\n<li>Improvements in error reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Reliability improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented an asynchronous heartbeat determination feature, ensuring that the plugin operates seamlessly within any WordPress setup without compromising performance. By offloading the heartbeat calculation to a separate asynchronous process, the plugin remains non-invasive and minimizes any potential impact on the overall performance of your website.</li>\n<li>Small corrections and code minification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with some older versions of server-side programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor corrections.</li>\n<li>Performance improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin has undergone extensive improvements to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance across various WordPress configurations. With its new enhanced compatibility, it can seamlessly adapt to different themes, plugins, and hosting environments, providing a reliable solution for all types of WordPress websites.</li>\n<li>Added more complex reasoning behind determing the best recommended heartbeat inteval.</li>\n<li>Set the grounds for easier future updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new way of calculating heartbeat accuracy.</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with shared hosting environments where users have no control over the server load.</li>\n<li>Hearbeat is now taken into account on pages that can only be accesible to visitors.</li>\n<li>Now caching the frequently used DOM elements to avoid unnecessary reselection and improve performance.</li>\n<li>Various realiability improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated heartbeat structure to incorporate heartbeat caching. Recommended heartbeat caching will automatically be disabled when it doesn&#8217;t make sense anymore. For example the website is crowded.</li>\n</ul>\n",
