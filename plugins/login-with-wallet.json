        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Authentication is simple; you can use your wallet. Basically, you can register, login, or connect your wallet and authenticate. You can control and limit the registration and login process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20cryptocurrency%20wallets%20be%20used%20for%20authentication%3F'>\nCan CryptoCurrency wallets be used for authentication?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your wallet address is unique and only you have access to it, so just like social login, you can log in with your wallet address.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20safe%20to%20use%20login%20with%20wallet%3F'>\nIs it safe to use Login with Wallet?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Login With Wallet just obtains the account address of the user&#8217;s wallet. Any action will need users&#8217; permission.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='gdpr'>\nGDPR\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login With Wallet will only store the user&#8217;s wallet address to authenticate. The data will be removed once the user disconnects.</p>\n<p>Note: we only use wallet addresses, but the permission includes other scopes! This is because, currently, there isn’t a way to request a specific scope.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
