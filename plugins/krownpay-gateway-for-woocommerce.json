During configuration, each merchant is provided with a unique gateway URL, which plays a key role in establishing a secure connection between their store and the KrownPay payment gateway.</p>\n<p>In the krownpay.php file, the merchant&#8217;s gateway URL ($gateway) is carefully sanitized using sanitize_text_field() to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This sanitized URL is then used to build the endpoint (/gtw/v1/woocommerce/orders), where the plugin initiates a secure POST request via wp_remote_post(). The request, which includes properly structured headers and a validated request body, communicates with the KrownPay API to create an order and generate a unique payment link for the customer.</p>\n<p>All data exchanged between the store and KrownPay is transmitted over HTTPS, ensuring that sensitive information, including order details, is encrypted during transit. This encrypted communication prevents unauthorized interception and guarantees that the transaction data remains confidential.</p>\n<p>Once the payment link is generated, the customer is redirected to a custom checkout page where they can complete their transaction using any of their connected wallets. Upon successful payment, the customer is automatically redirected back to the  store, and the order status is updated in real-time within the merchant&#8217;s backend, ensuring accurate tracking of all transactions.</p>\n<p>KrownPay prioritizes security and privacy. We do not store or have access to any private keys—neither from the customer nor the merchant. At no point during the integration process will we request these keys, maintaining the highest standard of data protection throughout the transaction lifecycle.</p>\n<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>https://www.krownpay.com/privacy</p>\n<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>\n<p>https://stg.app.krownpay.com/terms</p>\n"
