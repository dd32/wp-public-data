These shortcodes are<br />\n[sse_start_date], [sse_end_date] , [sse_location], [sse_time]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am getting 404 pages when I go to a event page, how do I fix this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is an issue with WordPress code and registering custom post types. The url rewrite engine doesn&#8217;t recognise the url. A work around is to go to Settings &gt; permalinks and press save changes. Just by saving changes, it will flush the rewrite rules and events should display.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
