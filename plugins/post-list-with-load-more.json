I hope you would love intuitive block settings which should show live preview of the changes you make.<br />\n   * Go to Dashboard &gt; Edit post/page &gt; Click &#8216;Block Inserter&#8217; from top-left corner &gt; Search or Select &#8216;Post List with Load More&#8217;.<br />\n   * Try changing block settings per your need and you&#8217;re done.<br />\n1. <strong>Shortcode</strong> &#8211; If your website is running on older WordPress version (i.e. before v5) then you can still make most out of the plugin through Shortcode. You can generate shortcode dynamically by changing several fields depending on your needs via plugin settings page.<br />\n   * Go to Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Post List with Load More.<br />\n   * &#8216;Settings&#8217; tab will let you choose Layout Style and Load More posts option.<br />\n   * &#8216;Generate Shortcode&#8217; by changing fields depending on your requirement and copy the generated shortcode.<br />\n   * Go to Dashboard &gt; Edit post/page &gt; Click &#8216;Block Inserter&#8217; from top-left corner &gt; Search or Select &#8216;Shortcode&#8217; block and paste the copied shortcode.</p>\n",
