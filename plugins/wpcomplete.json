        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20enable%20a%20page%20so%20that%20it%20is%20completable%3F'>\nHow do I enable a page so that it is completable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To enable a page so that it&#8217;s completable:<br />\n1. Find the page from your WordPress admin page directory and click in to edit.<br />\n2. Scroll to the WPComplete meta box.<br />\n3. Check the &#8220;Enable Complete button&#8221; checkbox.<br />\n4. (Optional) Place the <code>[wpc_complete_button]</code> shortcode in the content of your post, where you want the button to exist.<br />\n5. Update or Publish the page to save the changes.<br />\n6. (Optional) On the WPComplete settings page, update your button&#8217;s custom css to update the appearance of your buttons.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20style%20the%20buttons%3F'>\nHow do I style the buttons?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two options to add custom branding/style your WPComplete buttons:<br />\n1. On the settings page (Settings &gt; WPComplete) you can customize the following, without any programming or HTML/CSS knowledge: the color of the button, the color of the font on the button, the words on the button (for both completed buttons and incomplete buttons), and the wording for “Saving…”.<br />\n2. You can create and add your own custom CSS for buttons to add graphics, icons, rounded corners, etc, by adding your own CSS code to the Advanced Settings section. WPC buttons use the class: a.wpc-button with two states (which can be styled differently): a.wpc-completed (for finished lessons) and a.wpc-complete (for unfinished lessons).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20my%20button%20showing%20up%3F'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t my button showing up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It could be one of a couple reasons:<br />\n1. You&#8217;re not logged in to your wordpress site. Only logged in users can see the button.<br />\n2. That page doesn&#8217;t have buttons enabled. Make sure the <code>Enable Complete button</code> checkbox is checked in the WPComplete metabox when editting that page.<br />\n3. You don&#8217;t have <code>Automatically add complete button to enabled posts &amp; pages for me.</code> checked and you haven&#8217;t added the <code>[wpc_complete_button]</code> shortcode to your page content.<br />\nStill not showing up? Let us know and we can help figure out what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20see%20how%20many%20students%20have%20completed%20each%20lesson%3F'>\nHow do I see how many students have completed each lesson?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whether you use pages, posts or custom post types for your lessons, you can see on the list page (i.e. PAGES &gt; ALL PAGES or POSTS &gt; ALL POSTS) beside the published date a column for user completion is shown, <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/plugins.svn.wordpress.org/!svn/bc/1572621/wpcomplete/assets/screenshot-8.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">which displays the number of students/total students and then the percentage</a>.<br />\nIf you go to Users &gt; All Users then the final column on the user table will show the number of lessons completed vs the total lessons for each user on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wpcomplete%20allow%20for%20multiple%20buttons%20per%20lesson%3F'>\nDoes WPComplete allow for multiple buttons per lesson?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Heck yes it does (in the pro version)! You can add your first button by adding the <code>[wpc_complete_button]</code> shortcode to any page content with WPComplete enabled. To add additional buttons, just make sure to provide each button with a specific name, like: <code>[wpc_complete_button name=\"Button Name\"]</code> or <code>[wpc_complete_button name=\"Video Module\"]</code> or <code>[wpc_complete_button name=\"Workbooks\"]</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20delete%20courses%20in%20wpcomplete%3F'>\nHow do I delete courses in WPComplete?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Courses show up once you’ve added more than one lesson to them. To delete a course from WPComplete, simply remove all lessons from that course. Then the course will no longer show up on the list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20list%20the%20lessons%20in%20my%20course%20and%20show%20if%20they%20are%20completed%20or%20not%20to%20students%3F'>\nHow do I list the lessons in my course and show if they are completed or not to students?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You’ll have to use your course software/LMS to show what lessons are available in your course, or simply create a list of pages that are lessons on any WP content.</p>\n<p>From any list (ordered or unordered), WPComplete automatically will show each user if they’ve completed the lesson or not, using custom CSS. We add this automatically for users who don’t want to edit code (completed lessons are faded slightly and a checkmark is added beside them). For customers who want to update the CSS, it’s found in Advanced Settings:</p>\n<pre><code>li .wpc-lesson {}\nli .wpc-lesson-complete {}\nli .wpc-lesson-completed { opacity: .65; text-decoration: none !important; }\nli .wpc-lesson-completed:after { content: \"✔\"; margin-left: 5px; text-decoration: none !important; font-size: 12px; }\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20shortcodes%20are%20available%20in%20the%20pro%20version%3F'>\nWhat shortcodes are available in the pro version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[wpc_button] or <code>[wpc_complete_button]</code> will add your complete button anywhere on the page or post.<br />\n    [progress_percentage] or <code>[wpc_progress_percentage]</code> will display the current student&#8217;s progress as a percentage (ex: 49%).<br />\n    [progress_ratio] or <code>[wpc_progress_ratio]</code> will display the current student&#8217;s progress as a ratio (ex: 10/35).<br />\n    [progress_graph] or <code>[wpc_progress_graph]</code> will display a radial (donut) graph showing the current student&#8217;s progress with percentage.<br />\n    [progress_bar] or <code>[wpc_progress_bar]</code> will display a bar graph showing the current student&#8217;s progress with percentage.<br />\n    [complete_button name=&#8221;Button Name&#8221;] will create another button on a lesson with an existing button. You can use any number of buttons on any page where WPC is activated.<br />\n    [wpc_completed_content]This content shows only once the WPC button is pressed.[/wpc_completed_content]<br />\n    [wpc_incomplete_content]This content shows only until the WPC button is presesd.[/wpc_incomplete_content]<br />\n    [wpc_completed_content name=&#8221;Button Name&#8221;]This content shows only once the button Button Name is pressed.[/wpc_completed_content]<br />\n    [wpc_incomplete_content name=&#8221;Button Name&#8221;]This content shows only until the button Button Name is presesd.[/wpc_incomplete_content]</p>\n<p>For a complete list of available shortcodes and features, please visit: <a href=\"https://wpcomplete.co/cheatsheet/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://wpcomplete.co/cheatsheet/</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20wpcomplete%20handle%20multiple%20courses%20within%20the%20same%20wordpress%20installation%3F'>\nCan WPComplete handle multiple courses within the same WordPress installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Once you enable completion for a page or post, in the pro version, you will be given the option to assign it to a specific course. If you use any progress shortcodes, by default it will display the progress for the course of that post, but progress shortcodes also accept a course attribute if you want to force showing progress for a specific course. Ex:<br />\n    [wpc_progress_bar course=&#8221;All&#8221;]<br />\n    [wpc_progress_bar course=&#8221;My Awesome Course&#8221;]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20with%20custom%20post%20types%3F'>\nCan I use this with custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! By default, only posts and pages are enabled. But in the pro version, you have the ability to enable it for individual post types, including any custom types.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20style%20links%20to%20posts%20and%20pages%20that%20are%20completable%3F'>\nCan I style links to posts and pages that are completable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! In the pro version, we append the css class .wpc-lesson to ALL links to posts and pages. Links that have not been completed by the logged in student will also have the class .wpc-lesson-complete added. And links that have been completed by the logged in student will also have the class .wpc-lesson-completed added, along with some really basic styles that are easy to override manually.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20use%20optimizepress.%20can%20i%20use%20wpcomplete%3F'>\nI use OptimizePress. Can I use WPComplete?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! OptimizePress is a little tricky to get working, but it does work! We automatically disable automatic insertion of the completion button, but you can easily add it where you want the button to show up!<br />\nTo add the button to your page:<br />\n1. Edit the page you want to add completion to.<br />\n2. You should already be on the OptimizePress tab (not the WordPress tab).<br />\n3. Click the Live Editor &#8220;Launch Now&#8221; button.<br />\n4. Click the &#8220;Add Element&#8221; button where you want to add your completion button.<br />\n5. Select a &#8220;Custom HTML / Shortcode&#8221; element.<br />\n6. In the &#8220;Content&#8221; field, insert the shortcode: [complete_button]<br />\n7. Scroll down and click the &#8220;Insert&#8221; button.<br />\n8. The new preview will say something like:</p>\n<pre><code>!!! CUSTOM HTML CODE ELEMENT !!! \n[wpc_button]\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the Save &amp; Close (or Save &amp; Continue) button</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
