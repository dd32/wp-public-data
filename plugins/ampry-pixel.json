        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20ampry%20cost'>\nHow much does Ampry cost\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ampry starts at $39 a month.  Visit our (https://ampry.com/pricing &#8220;pricing page&#8221;) to find the best plan for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20know%20how%20to%20code%3F'>\nDo I need to know how to code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope! Installing Ampry is as easy as adding one line of code to your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20slow%20down%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill it slow down my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope! After the initial ampry pixel fires, Ampry uses a process called asynchronous loading, allowing the browser to continue loading elements of your page while Ampry simultaneously runs your placements on our servers in the background.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20my%20plan%3F'>\nCan I change my plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! You can change plans or switch between monthly and annual billing inside of your account at anytime.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20website%20limit%3F'>\nIs there a website limit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you can run all of your websites through a single Ampry account. Billing is based on the &#8216;Views&#8217; you get from your Ampry placements. (See next question to learn more about views.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20counts%20as%20a%20view%3F'>\nWhat counts as a View?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A view is counted when a Ampry placement is displayed on your site. E.G. When a user gets a pop up, that will be one view. If you also have a top bar on that same page, that would count as a view also.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20contact%20support%3F'>\nHow do I contact support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can email us at support@ampry.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20a%20free%20trial%3F'>\nDo you have a free trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
