Essentially a pixel on any screen does not equal to a dot on a printed document. The resolution and detail of a print wouldn&#8217;t look good if you used a 72 DPI upload on a 300 DPI print. The end result is either pixelated or blurry images. You can&#8217;t just scale an image up either, detail can&#8217;t just be easily made. It&#8217;s a big problem in the design and print industries. A lot of people fight with their clients to upload the correct images. Any image from the web just won&#8217;t do. <em>DPIorDIE</em> to the rescue.</p>\n<p>This plugin was designed to filter out images based on the DPI of an image only a specific type of user can upload, &#8220;Uploader&#8221;. It reads the EXIF data to get the horizontal and vertical DPI for now. It can also increase the max upload size to your desired choosing.  There&#8217;s also the ability to upload said images to Dropbox in a dedicated app folder and offset path. It seamlessly integrates with WordPress and I&#8217;ve done the work for people to give translations.</p>\n<p><em>NOTE</em>: You don&#8217;t actually have to make a new user profile on the site with the role type; &#8220;Uploader&#8221;. It&#8217;s just looking for uploading privileges. Later there will be more allowance for flexibility in it&#8217;s user capabilities, but it&#8217;s unnecessary. The Uploader role was designed to allow a user reduced privileges to a site, not giving them anything but uploading capabilities.</p>\n<p>The Dropbox functionality is easy to setup. Click the button, authorize DPIorDIE on Dropbox, get the code they give you, punch it in, and save. The authorization token code will be generated on save. The code lasts indefinitely, they just don&#8217;t expire. The offset path will generate the required folders or directories. All duplicates get renamed and aren&#8217;t rejected.</p>\n",

Currently FTP, Apple Cloud, and OneDrive is on the table.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do you get the DPI?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It looks for the EXIF data on a file and checks for the horizontal and vertical DPI. Later version might do a bit a math to find out the DPI.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
