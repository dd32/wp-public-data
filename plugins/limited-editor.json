This means that every change is submitted for review and only a regular editor or administrator can approve and publish the changes. A Limited editor also cannot upload media.</p>\n<p>The Limited editor role is perfect for users who only need access to the content itself, such as SEO managers or proofreaders, because a regular Editor can delete and publish what you may not want, and an Author or Contributor can only edit their own posts, not those of others.</p>\n<p>The plugin doesn&#8217;t affect the performance of the website at all.
