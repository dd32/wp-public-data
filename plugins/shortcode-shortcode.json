You can use the html entities &amp;&#8203;#91; for the left square bracket and &amp;&#8203;#93; for the right square bracket. However I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this approach. If you do this and later switch between the text editor and the visual editor, the html entities will be replaced with the square brackets characters resulting in the shortcodes being processed. I created the plugin after I had this happen on one of my own sites.</p>\n<p>You could also add zero-width spaces: &amp;&#8203;#8203; after the opening square bracket and before the closing square bracket to prevent the shortcodes being processed, however I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this approach either because people reading your post might copy &amp; paste your example code directly into their own site, and when they do, instead of a working shortcode they will get the version with a zero width space in it, and the shortcode won&#8217;t work for them. When this occurs the zero width space character is invisible so it can be difficult to troubleshoot.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='doesn%27t%20wordpress%20already%20do%20this%20natively%20with%20the%20double%20bracket%20syntax%3F'>\nDoesn&#8217;t WordPress already do this natively with the double bracket syntax?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and if that works for you, you don&#8217;t need this plugin, you could just escape the shortcode by enclosing it in additonal square brackets eg: [[gallery]] which will display as [gallery] the drawback to this is that if you later deactivate the plugin or theme providing the shortcode, both sets of square brackets will be shown.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20using%20the%20plugin%20and%20it%20has%20saved%20me%20time%20and%2For%20hassle%3B%20how%20can%20i%20show%20my%20appreciation%3F'>\nI am using the plugin and it has saved me time and/or hassle; how can I show my appreciation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can donate via <a href=\"https://cubecolour.co.uk/wp/\" title=\"cubecolour donation page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my donation page</a></p>\n<p>If you find the plugin useful I would also appreciate a review on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/shortcode-shortcode/\" title=\"Shortcode Shortcode plugin reviews\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin review page</a> page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20it%20not%20working%20for%20me%3F'>\nWhy is it not working for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin isn&#8217;t working for you, please read all of the documentation again.
