        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20purpose%20of%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat is the purpose of the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It enables creating new gateways which are made available in the <strong>WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; Payments</strong> configuration page and are able to have their title, description, instructions, and conditions of availability.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20logs%20or%20shares%20personal%20data%3F'>\nDoes the plugin logs or shares personal data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at all. However, the plugin contains links to third-party websites and users are responsible for consenting to use of their data by these systems.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20allow%20me%20to%20use%20third-party%20payment%20processors%20such%20as%20paypal%20or%20stripe%3F'>\nDoes this plugin allow me to use third-party payment processors such as PayPal or Stripe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, out of the box, as it is meant to be versatile and not restricted to specific payment processors. Multiple hooks are supported by the plugin as a means of further extending it, making it able to act as a framework for a more advanced, custom payment gateway solution.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20believe%20that%20i%27ve%20found%20a%20problem.%20can%20i%20report%20it%3F'>\nI believe that I&#8217;ve found a problem.

You could translate the plugin in your own language, for example by using Loco Translate, or contribute with code on <a href=\"https://github.com/panastasiadist/pak-custom-wc-payment-gateways\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.
