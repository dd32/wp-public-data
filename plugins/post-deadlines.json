        "faq": "\n<h4>How I can set deadline for post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Post deadline can be set via datepicker in classic editor or Gutenberg from meta box labeled &#8220;Post deadline&#8221;. If you are running P2 theme or o2 plugin, deadline can be set from datepicker in front end post submit area also.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to list posts with upcoming deadlines?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just use shortcode <code>[upcoming_post_deadlines]</code> somewhere in your content! If you want to change the order so that post with latest deadline is first, add attribute <code>order=\"DESC\"</code> to shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use my own template for shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! From plugin files copy <code>views/shortcode-list-upcoming-deadlines-php</code> to your theme root with name <code>post-deadlines-shortcode-list-upcoming.php</code> and then just modify the template to suit your needs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My list of posts with upcoming dedline isn&#8217;t updating!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Oh snap! Plugin stores upcoming deadlines in transients to reduce amount of databse queries in large scale sites. Probably something is stuck and you should manually delete those transients from <code>wp_options</code> table or in-memory cache like Redis.</p>\n<p>Transient are named like <code>posts_with_deadline_YYYYMMDD_ASC/DESC</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the behavior of this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, but it needs some basic knowledge about PHP and WordPress hooks. This plugin does not have any settings page, only thing you can do without touching the code is chaning the post order in shortcode.</p>\n<p>If you know your PHP and WordPress hooks, look throught <code>post-deadlines.php</code> file and find what you need ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
