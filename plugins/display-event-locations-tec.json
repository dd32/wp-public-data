Why does the tooltip not list the event&#8217;s location and/or address?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, make sure that the plugin &#8216;Display Event Location for The Events Calendar&#8217; is installed and activated on your website. To check this, click on the <code>Plugins</code> option from the left-hand administration sidebar in WordPress. Once the page loads, make sure <code>Display Event Location for The Events Calendar</code> is activated. Then try viewing your calendar again to see if the tooltip now displays the location of your events.</p>\n<p>If the <code>Display Event Location for The Events Calendar</code> plugin is activated and the tooltip still does not show the location of events in your calendar, try navigating your calendar to the next month or backwards to the previous month. Then try hovering over events from that month and see if the tooltip is displaying event locations.</p>\n<p>If you still do not see a location in the tooltip when hovering over events on the monthly calendar, edit the event in question and ensure that a venue is selected. You can do this by selecting <code>Events &gt; Venues &gt; Add New</code> from your WordPress administration area. Additional instructions for creating venues can be found here: <a href=\"https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/k/venue-and-organizer-pages/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/k/venue-and-organizer-pages/</a></p>\n<p>If you still aren&#8217;t seeing the location displayed within the tooltip, you can also try viewing your calendar in a different browser or try clearing your browser&#8217;s cache and then viewing your calendar again. It is common that the monthly calendar view gets cached in your browser or by your website&#8217;s hosting service. A clearing of all website and server cache fixes most issues.</p>\n<p>If you still cannot figure out why the location is not displaying, feel free to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/display-event-locations-tec/\" rel=\"ugc\">submit a support ticket</a> and I will be more than happy to help you!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TLDR; Sometimes a small change is difficult.

    "upgrade_notice": {
        "4.4.0": "<p>Another minor update for your consumption. Support for WordPress 6.5.0 has been verified. The other minor change is that starting with WordPress 6.5, this plugin now has a formal dependency on The Events Calendar. Version 4.4.0 should be compatible with all existing installations. Enjoy!</p>",
        "4.3.0": "<p>Howdy! I&#039;ve listed this update as a <code>minor</code> release, but there is a lot going on under the hood. The core functionality of this plugin has not changed. In fact, with this release of <code>v4.3.0</code> there are no new features or changes that you should see on your end. With that being said, I&#039;ve been doing a ton of work behind the scenes to clean the source code, simplify logic, and make small improvements in performance. For those that are interested in the technical details, those can be found in the changelog. Long story short, I&#039;m working to make sure that this plugin functions correctly, is efficient, and that it is reliable for you. If you run into any issues with your update, please open a support ticket and I will work with you to resolve any issues. Take care!</p>",
        "4.2.0": "<p>This update contains another small bug fix. Several users reported that the location name and address would not display after upgrading to The Events Calendar v6.0+. This was caused by venues that were created without specifying a street address. Updating to version 4.2.0 of this plugin corrects that bug. Thank you to user <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/hakonknappen/\">hakonknappen</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/dcw4/\">dcw4</a> on the Wordpress.org support forum for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-venue-isnt-displayd-in-tooltip-after-upgrading-the-events-calendar/\">reporting the issue</a>.</p>",
        "4.1.0": "<p>This update contains a small bug fix. There was a bug related to the full street address not displaying, even when you had it set to be displayed in our plugin&#039;s settings page. If you have any other issues after updating, please feel free to reach out and open a support ticket.</p>",
        "4.0.0": "<p>Happy Holidays! This release gives things a fresh look and removes support for the legacy calendar views. If you have been waiting to upgrade your calendar to the new v2 views, now is a great time! If you want to continue to use the legacy calendar views, do not update this plugin. Do be aware that this plugin will no longer provide support for legacy views and The Events Calendar will drop support starting in Q1 &#039;22. A refresh of the assets for the plugin help to give the plugin a fresh look before the new year. A <em>big</em> thank you to Danielle Attinella for the amazing work on the new icon and banner image.</p>",
        "3.3.3": "<p>No major updates to report! Lots of work has gone on behind the scenes to make sure my plugin will be WordPress v5.6 compatible when when it is released early next month. You can feel free to safely update knowing things should continue to work. As always, if you have any issues or questions please feel free to submit a support ticket!</p>",
        "3.3.2": "<p>Today&#039;s brings a mid-summer quality of life update. I have tested compatibility with WordPress version 5.5 slated to be released on August 11, 2020. I added the missing release date for the v3.3.1 changelog section. The .zip package name provided on the Github releases and in the README has been changed to better support manual plugin updates. You will also find that I have increased the minimum PHP version to 7.0 and the minimum WordPress version to v5.0. WordPress plans to begin requiring PHP v7.0+ at a minimum by the end of 2020 and as PHP 5.6 becomes phased out I want my plugin to be secure and work on modern versions of PHP. You will find that my plugin should work on older versions of PHP (like v5.6) if you are still using older versions but consider upgrading to, at least, PHP v7.0 for security and performance improvements.  As always, open a support ticket if you have any issues with this update.</p>",
        "3.3.1": "<p>Plugin settings will no longer reset to their default values when you update the plugin or when you reactivate it. Sorry about that. All files within the master branch of the Github repository and the WordPress Plugin Repository SVN repo have been synchronized. The releases being named <code>display-event-locations-tec.[version].zip</code> published within the Github <code>Releases</code> section have not been affected as they have been accurate.</p>",
        "3.3": "<p>Today&#039;s update continues quality of life improvements to help better your experience while also working to keep our footprint on your installation to a minimum. Unnecessary code has been removed. Typos continue to be fixed. Comments have been simplified. Documentation has been reworded for clarity. Updated developer contact information and URIs have been put into place. -- As always, if you experience any issues open a support ticket and I&#039;ll get you up and running. Have a great, productive day!</p>",
        "3.2": "<p>Today&#039;s update brings a revamp of the CSS class structure for all information that this plugin adds to the tooltip in your monthly view! You can now control the stylization of all of the individual components that can be added to the tooltip to display your event&#039;s location and its street address (if enabled). You can find more detailed information about the new CSS class structure in the Arbitrary section on CSS Classes of the Github Repository<a href=\"https://github.com/mike-weiner/display-event-locations-tec#css-classes\">README</a>. Support for WordPress 5.4.1 has also been confirmed in testing. As always, please let us know if you experience any issues!</p>",
        "3.1": "<p>Happy Saturday! Lots of small things are in the works -- Support for WordPress 5.4 that is slated to be released at the end of March has been tested and confirmed. A new admin error message will now be displayed if The Events Calendar is not activated when Display Event Location for The Events Calendar is active. Other small source code spring cleaning has ocurred (See the changelog for more details.). As always, thank you for the support and let us know if you encounter any issues!</p>",
        "3.0.2": "<p>More quick updates are on the horizon! Code has been cleaned and further simplified, and plugin names have been made consistent. Please let us know if you experience any issues!</p>",
        "3.0.1": "<p>A quick bug fix has been deployed to make sure TEC looks into the correct directory within your active theme to be able to pull in any additional template overrides. Have a great weekend!</p>",
        "3.0": "<p>Support for the beautiful v2 calendar views introduced with The Events Calendar 5.0 is here! This update not only adds support for the new tooltip within the v2 calendar views, but it also fixes a handful of bugs, adds greater code documentation, and addresses several quality-of-life issues with the plugin. As usual, please let us know if you run into any issues! where there&#039;s a will there&#039;s a way, the deltec dev team.</p>",
        "2.2": "<p>A second update in a week? Yessir! Code has been cleaned and documented. Support for tooltip customizations for events created with the block editor has been restored. Excess files have been removed. (Post holiday workout anyone?) And we are preparing for The Events Calendar version 5.0! A busy couple of weeks ahead!</p>",
        "2.1": "<p>Happy New Year!! Version 2.1 is a small, powerful update to welcome the new decade. You can now opt to display an event&#039;s location underneath the location name within the tooltip! Support for WordPress 5.2.3 has also been added.</p>",
        "2.0.1": "<p>Version 2.0.1 is a very minor update. Support with WordPress 5.2.3 has been tested and confirmed. Thank you for your support!</p>",
        "2.0": "<p>Version 2.0 is a major quality of life overhaul. There are too many small changes here and there to cover. Let me give you a quick-ish overview. You can now quickly change the message that is displayed on the tooltip when a user hovers over an event on your website&#039;s calendar. This is done through the Display Event Locations for The Events Calendar settings page. You can find this within the Settings area of your site&#039;s backend as a sub-menu page of the Settings dropdown/flyout. Unneeded code &amp; increased security measures have been implemented. All of our saved settings are now removed upon you uninstalling our plugin from your website. I have also done extensive testing with the latest versions of Wordpress and The Events Calendar. All human typos have also been dealt with. Thank you for sticking with me! You should notice lots of little improvements as you use the plugin. Please let me know what features you would like to see next!</p>",
        "1.1": "<p>Version 1.1 addresses and fixes the need to deactivate and then reactivate the Modern Tribe Events System plugin. Feel free to activate our plugin and go about your business.</p>",
        "1.0.1": "<p>Fixed typos in readme.txt. Added Logos. Changed CSS Class from <code>tribe-events-location</code> to <code>deltec-tribe-events-location</code>.</p>",
        "1.0": "<p>Initial release!</p>"
