        "description": "<p>The Random Image Block is a small plugin that will display a random image from your native WordPress photo galley or in-beaded images.</p>\n<p>This widget will display the thumbnail of the random image, the &#8220;caption&#8221; and the images parent posts name. You may show all pictures on your site, or limit the selection to a single category if you wish. Once installed on your site, it will fully conform to the current theme. The Widgets title is also fully configurable. Random Image Widget was designed with full internationalization in mind and can be fully translated (Any help on this would be appreciated). As of Version 0.3 this plugin works out of the box without any configuraion (assuming you have pictures on your site).</p>\n<p>The Random Image Block plugin works with WordPress 3.0+ in both single and multi site modes.  As a Site Admin, you may activate this plugin across all the sites on your install.</p>\n<p>This Plugin is fully translated into the following languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arabic</li>\n<li>Czech</li>\n<li>Finnish</li>\n<li>French</li>\n<li>Danish</li>\n<li>Dutch</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Indonesian</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n<li>Portuguese</li>\n<li>Russian</li>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to help translating this plugin, or you see a problem with the current translation, please see my <a href=\"http://translate.mattrude.com/projects/random-image-block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Translation</a> page, and/or <a href=\"http://mattrude.com/contact-me/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact me</a>.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Q: May I have more the one image on my sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Sure, just add a second or third widget to the sidebar, but you can&#8217;t do it from within this widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: May I display more then one category at once?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: No, you may only display a single category per widget</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I have no picture in my sidebar, the widget doesn&#8217;t work!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Make sure the category you have selected has pictures in it, if it doesn&#8217;t, nothing will be displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Will this plugin work with WP Super Cache enabled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Unfortunately, no. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Super Cache</a> caches all php built html pages for quicker page loads. Since the Random Image Block is built directly into the html page, with WP Super Cache enabled, you will see the same random image on the same page until the cache refreshes. Each page will still have a diffrent image, but they will not update for each page refresh.  Currently there is no work around.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
