These times depend on the server that hosts your WordPress site.</li>\n<li>If you receive any errors during the process, try running the file again after it finishes.  The plugin is programmed to ignore files that match the following criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Same name</li>\n<li>Same file name</li>\n<li>Same upload date</li>\n<li>Same file size</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How it works.</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FileReader</a> and to parse the XML file in the browser, then uses ajax to request WordPress perform individual uploads.</p>\n<h4>License</h4>\n<p>Attachment Importer &#8211; A plugin for WordPress to import attachments from another blog using a WXR file.<br />\nCopyright (C) 2014 Toasted Lime</p>\n<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
