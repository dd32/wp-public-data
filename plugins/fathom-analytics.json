These reports can be set up for any dashboard (or all of them) and sent to anyone (at your company, to your clients, whomever you want).</p>\n<h3>Shared or private dashboards</h3>\n<p>Want to grant access to specific website dashboards for particular clients/employees?

That&#8217;s why Google Analytics is free, because they make enough money off the personal data their customers give them by using their analytics service. We charge a small and sustainable fee for Fathom because our business model is selling software, not data (these very different business models). Our customers gladly pay for our service because they know their data is safe with us and their visitors&#8217; privacy is protected. As a profitable business, we&#8217;re in this for the long haul.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20do%20you%20store%20my%20analytics%20data%3F'>\nHow long do you store my analytics data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Forever. Meaning, as long as you are a customer, you can access your data all the way back to when you signed up for an account. 7 days, or even 30 days, doesn&#8217;t give you a clear enough picture of if your website is trending up or down, which is why we give you data retention forever.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20a%20demo%3F'>\nCan I see a demo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, our demo can be found here: https://app.usefathom.com/demo</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20in%20touch%3F'>\nHow can I get in touch?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See our contact page for details: https://usefathom.com/contact</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Nothing to see here, folks. Hope you&#8217;re loving the new release of Fathom üôÇ</p>\n<h3>3.0.3 &#8211; June 14, 2021</h3>\n<p>Fixed a bug with custom domains on an older version of PHP</p>\n<h4>3.0.2 &#8211; January 27, 2021</h4>\n<p>Set the default to track admins, as some users might miss this when installing Fathom for the first time. We also tested the plugin on WordPress 5.6 and it&#8217;s working great.</p>\n<h4>3.0.1 &#8211; January 27, 2021</h4>\n<p>Set the default to track admins, as some users might miss this when installing Fathom for the first time. We also tested the plugin on WordPress 5.6 and it&#8217;s working great.</p>\n<h4>3.0.1 &#8211; December 7, 2020</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had users running into problems when using WP Rocket minification. We spoke to their support team and they advised us on how to exclude the Fathom script from minification. Huge thanks to Jon Henshaw (@henshaw) for initially raising this.</p>\n<h4>3.0.0 &#8211; May 12, 2020</h4>\n<p>This update includes breaking changes, so please read this message.<br />\n1) If you have any manual goals added, you should change them to follow our new guide (see <a href=\"https://usefathom.com/support/goals\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>). Added new tracking code.<br />\n2) You can now exclude your own traffic even when you&#8217;re logged out, we&#8217;ve added big improvements for custom domains and things are much faster.<br />\n3) If you use Fathom Lite, stick to 2.0.4, as you have everything you need</p>\n<h4>2.0.4 &#8211; May 9, 2020</h4>\n<p>Switched it around. A lot of WordPress sites use goals so we can&#8217;t use the new API yet, that&#8217;ll have to come in a major number</p>\n<h4>2.0.3 &#8211; May 9, 2020</h4>\n<p>We have released brand new tracking code for custom domain users, removed the old fallback and things will now load much faster.</p>\n<h4>2.0.2 &#8211; April 15, 2020</h4>\n<p>Small fix with version control</p>\n<h4>2.0.1 &#8211; April 15, 2020</h4>\n<p>What a time to be alive. We have officially added custom domains to Fathom to help with those pesky ad-blockers. And we moved the snippet to the footer (where it escaped from).</p>\n<h4>2.0.0 &#8211; November 15, 2019</h4>\n<p>Well first of all, we are sorry for the long delay in updating this plugin! We&#8217;ve been busy at work on Fathom V2 all year. In this major update of the wordpress plugin, we&#8217;ve ensured backward compatability but have modified the guidelines to include some of the new changes we have made. Firstly, the concept of a &#8220;Dashboard URL&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exist within V2, and you simply use the CDN URL! Nice and easy. But we have left the Dashboard URL in place for our V1 users who self-host. We&#8217;ve also added the ability for V2 users to embed their dashboard &amp; create a new tab in the admin menu.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1 &#8211; October 10, 2018</h4>\n<p>Added support for tracking multiple sites in a single Fathom dashboard (requires Fathom v1.0.1).</p>\n<h4>1.0.0 &#8211; September 10, 2018</h4>\n<p>Plugin release.</p>\n"
