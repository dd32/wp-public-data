I&#8217;m relying to your feedback, positive or with suggestions, to release it out of beta</em></p>\n<p>This plugin will give you the extra class you need in your   tag of ALL (and not just one) of the anchestors of a page in WordPress.</p>\n<p>This way you will be able to color a certain section of a site, based on the root&#8217;s ancestor &#8211; no matter how deep is the page (WordPress does this only for the direct father of a page)</p>\n<p>Also, the printed class names are ancestor-[slug] and ancestor-id-[id]. This way, you can use it with your page slug (very conviniate if you move sites between instalations where id can change) and id (useful if you use a non-latin site, and slug can&#8217;t be used in css)</p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s imagine you have this tree of pages on your site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home</li>\n<li>Clients\n<ul>\n<li>Web\n<ul>\n<li>EShops</li>\n<li>Portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Print</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Contact </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see this scenario: You want all the pages under &#8216;Clients&#8217; to have a red background. Now, it&#8217;s easy to do that &#8211; but only for the &#8216;Web&#8217;, and &#8216;Print&#8217; pages because WordPress gives you only the fathers in the body classes &#8211; in this case, the id of &#8216;Clients&#8217;. &#8216;Eshops&#8217; and &#8216;Portfolio&#8217; can also have a red background, but you will have to add a new class in your css with the id of &#8216;Web&#8217; at your css. And, if you add pages under &#8216;Eshops&#8217;, same thing, you will have to add a new class in your css file with the id of &#8216;Eshops&#8217; page. So, all this is easy if you do it yourself &#8211; but if you handle the site to an editor, that knows only to create content &#8211; you will have to add the class in the CSS every time someone adds a level to all this.</p>\n<p>With this plugin <strong>all the ancestors of a page, no matter the depth</strong> will be <em>in your body as class names</em> &#8211; as a slug, and as an id. And you want all the pages under &#8216;Clients&#8217; to have a red background you just add to your css .achestor-clients {background:red;} in your css,  and you are done &#8211; no matter the level the final page is under.</p>\n<p>Finaly, the  order is with top ancestor first (in our example, Portfolio page will have &#8220;ancestor-clients ancestor-web&#8221;) &#8211; this way, it&#8217;s simpler in CSS to overwrite the -clients class with the -web attributes.</p>\n<p>There is no writing on the database, or other change on the site, so, even if something goes wrong, just de-activate the plugin, and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>\n",
