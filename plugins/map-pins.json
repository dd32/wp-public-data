        "installation": "<p><strong>To install Map Pins manually, follow these steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get the plugin using the plugins-&gt;add menu and search for <code>map-pins</code></li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Get a Google Maps API key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key (and also enable Google Places API on this key if you want to use the search box)</li>\n<li>Go the the plugin settings page and paste your Google Maps API key there. All other settings are optional.</li>\n<li>Configure the Map Pins locations through the Map Pins menu (located in the left menu or in case of WPMU on network level)</li>\n<li>Embed the Map Pins map on any page or post using the [mappins-map] shortcode.</li>\n<li>Enjoy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Otherwise just use the plugin-install page in wordpress.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Q: How many maps I can insert into a post or page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The number of map-pins objects on a page is limited to 1 per page. You can change the shortcut parameters (like width, list-style, category) on other pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: How can I show other sets of locations on different pages</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: You can filter shown locations based on category on different pages. The category filter is part of the shortcut parameters, so you can change the category filter on each page. For each location the category can be selected.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Can I upload a CSV of XLS file with locations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: No. But you can use phpAdmin or another mysql tool to fill the database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Clicking `my-location` shows an error</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: You need an SSL (https://) website, otherwise the browser does not allow this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I am using WP Multisite and have one child site for each of my stores. Can I use one database defined in the network?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Yes. The database is maintained on the network level.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Is Google Maps a free service? I don&#8217;t want to pay Google.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Unfortunately, Google Maps is a payed service nowadays. Fortunately the free-tier is pretty large and you will propably not hit the free-tier limit for a low-traffic site. However you should protect your key (see google key management) otherwise people can (and will!) obtain your key from your website and start using it. Also, its Google, so the pricing can change any minute now.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I want to use my own pin icons.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: You can! Just put them in the plugin pics directory (so that is <em>wp-content/plugins/map-pins/pics</em> in your install). The plugin will find them automagically.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
