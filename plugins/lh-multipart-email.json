Your HTML emails will now automatically have a plain text version attached.</li>\n</ol>\n",

In contrast mine uses a more advanced approach using the Jevon Wrights Html2Text library, thus includes links and other useful information whilst still producing a conforming text alternative.</p>\n<p>http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/Rules/MIME_HTML_ONLY</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20mess%20up%20my%20html%20email%3F'>\nWill this mess up my HTML email?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the plugin does not affect the HTML message of emails.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20tell%20if%20this%20plugin%20is%20working%3F'>\nHow can I tell if this plugin is working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once enabled some email clients will have an option to view emails as text only. Alternatively others (such as gmail) offer a Show Original function where you can view the raw email (and see that your HTML email now also has a text alternative)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat if something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Multipart Email, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-multipart-email/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-multipart-email/</a> . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
