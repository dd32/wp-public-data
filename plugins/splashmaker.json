        "description": "<p>THE MOST EASY TO USE, POWERFUL, AND EXTENSIBLE SMART CONTENT PLUGIN FOR WORDPRESS</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://splashmetrics.io/splashmaker/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SplashMaker</a> provides for dynamically personalized content, marketing automation and CRM integration, and Splashmetrics Buyer Journey intelligence and analytics.</p>\n<p>With the free SplashMaker Basic plugin you can easily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create intelligent Personalization Forms that automatically generate personalization tokens to be used in the content titles and copy, and that dynamically serve users the specific content experience that fits their needs.</li>\n<li>Manage the Personalization Form submissions to keep track of leads and Buyer data.</li>\n<li>Build beautiful, responsive, and fully personalized Dynamic Content pages inside WordPress, providing your users completely bespoke content experiences instead of traditional, static PDFs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The free SplashMaker Basic WordPress plugin includes the following:</p>\n<p><strong>PERSONALIZATION FORM</strong></p>\n<p>Generally, this component works like many other WordPress contact form plugins with a few critical distinctions:</p>\n<p>Form Fields<br />\nPersonalization Token: Use these tokens in your Dynamic Content headings, paragraph copy, etc. to personalize that text for the Buyer. For example if you enter “Hi [splash_token field=first_name]!” The Buyer’s first name will be used in that spot. To copy a token for use in your content, simply click in its blue field to copy that item to your clipboard, then paste it where you like.</p>\n<p>Email: You’ll notice that by default, we already have the Email form item here. The reason for this is that most Marketing Automation and CRM (MA/CRM) platforms require emails for their forms/contacts. As you’ll see in the info-pop-up, if you are using the free version of SplashMaker, you can delete this field if you’d like to create a fully custom form. Otherwise, if you have a third-party integration, it is locked.</p>\n<p>Dynamic Content Driver: This is another default item in the form. It determines which Dynamic Content page is served to the user based on their selection. The dropdown values are automatically generated based on the titles of the Dynamic Content pages you create. So just create the pages/versions you want to offer, enter a label for this dropdown to match the context of those pages/versions, and SplashMaker takes care of the rest.</p>\n<p>Form Pop-Up Shortcode: Place this shortcode into the main landing page for this Smart Content asset*. The pop-up will automatically present this form to allow the user to drive the Dynamic Content experiences you’ve defined for this asset. To copy the shortcode, simply click in its blue field to copy that item to your clipboard, then paste it where you like.</p>\n<p>(*Note: If you have one of our premium SmartDoc themes, we’ve already taken care of this for you.)</p>\n<p>Add Fields<br />\nThere are 2 types of fields that can be added to the form, Standard and Custom. Simply make a Standard field selection, or enter the name of the Custom field you want to create and select “Add Field” as appropriate. The new field(s) will show up in the “Added Fields” section and the “Save Form” button will activate indicating the change. Select that button to save the configuration and move these new fields to the form section above.</p>\n<p>Here are the unique distinctions between the field types…</p>\n<p>Add Standard Field: This will add the basic standard fields that are typically in forms. These are already fully mapped and correctly tokenized for you. Also, if you are using one of our premium packages with MA/CRM integration, these will be auto-mapped to that platform by SplashMaker – saving you a great deal of time and trouble.</p>\n<p>Add Custom Field: This will add various custom field types such as Hidden, Text, TextArea, and Select. You can name the field as you see fit, and SplashMaker will use that to create the Personalization Token.</p>\n<p><strong>DYNAMIC CONTENT</strong></p>\n<p>This is the core smart content component of SplashMaker. It allows you to create custom experiences that will be dynamically served to users via their selection from the dropdown items in the Dynamic Content Driver field of the form, or, better yet, via direct Smart CTAs in your MA/CRM platform.</p>\n<p>You simply create the versions (pages) of the smart content you want to present to your Buyers and name them to align with the above dropdown items. For example, you might use ABM buying roles such as End User, Influencer, and Decision Maker. Or Industry/Vertical versions, or Country, or Region, etc. You can use virtually any driver for these.</p>\n<p>The Personalization Form component is directly tied to these Dynamic Content pages in 2 ways. First, whatever pages you title and publish here, will automatically show up on the Dynamic Content Driver dropdown in the form. All that is automated for you by SplashMaker.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Personalization Tokens from the Personalization Form component – e.g. [splash_token field=firstname] &#8211; can be placed into your page content to further personalize the copy and titles with the Buyer’s name, company name, title, etc. This too is automated for you by SplashMaker after you place the token.</p>\n<p>All you need to do is focus on building out the Personalization Form and your Dynamic Content pages – and SplashMaker takes care of the rest.</p>\n<p>Here are the premium add-ons you can leverage which greatly extend the power of SplashMaker:</p>\n<p><strong>SMARTDOC THEMES &#8211; PREMIUM</strong></p>\n<p>Instead of traditional PDFs for your eBooks, Case Studies, White Papers, Data Sheets, etc. – imagine dynamically-customizing and fully-responsive digital versions that automatically personalize to each and every Buyer. Yet, those Buyers can still print or save that personalized document to a traditional PDF – it’s just a completely bespoke version that only they will have. Now that’s powerful! That’s SplashMaker SmartDocs.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://splashmetrics.io/product/smartdoc-theme/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SmartDoc Theme package</a> for WordPress provides 2 distinct versions of a fully-responsive SmartDoc that is already set up to do all of the above and is ready for you to edit and make your own. For example, the extremely light-yet-powerful theme package provides all the needed free plugins for the content as shown (including the SplashMaker Basic plugin). We’ve even set up and formatted the print feature for you so that the end-user can print or save their custom SmartDoc as a PDF!</p>\n<p>So, with the SmartDoc Theme you can quickly – and affordably – create dynamically customizing eBooks, Case Studies, White Papers, Data Sheets and much, much more. All for what you would likely pay for outmoded, static PDFs!</p>\n<p>But – you can also take the design even further with other favorite WordPress plugins, widgets, etc. to make your Buyer Content Experiences like nothing else on the market. The sky&#8217;s the limit!</p>\n<p>*Please note that Splashmetrics, Inc. is not responsible for the functionality or reliable performance of any third party plugins that come bundled with these SmartDoc Themes. Nor is Splashmetrics, Inc. responsible for assistance and/or support for said plugins. You must contact the original developers of those plugins for assistance and/or support.</p>\n<p><strong>SPLASHMETRICS INTEGRATION &#8211; PREMIUM</strong></p>\n<p>This annual subscription package provides all the basic tools of SplashMaker, but also adds the +Splashmetrics Platform Integration suite. This powerful, time-saving integration automates much of the setup of the various asset items (forms, scripts, pages, etc.) by leveraging the SplashLogic Specification you (the content creator) receive from a Splashmetrics customer.</p>\n<p>With one click – most of this work is done for you!</p>\n<p>This tool also provides a datapoint tester so that you can be sure your smart content is reporting the correct metrics to the Splashmetrics Analyze component. This way, you’re confident that your client is receiving the measurement data they expect.</p>\n<p><strong>SPLASHMETRICS+MA/CRM INTEGRATION &#8211; PREMIUM</strong></p>\n<p>This annual subscription package provides all the tools of SplashMaker+Splashmetrics, but also adds the +MA/CRM Platform Integration suite (such as HubSpot). This powerful integration allows you to map the SplashMaker Personalization Form fields directly into HubSpot via an OAuth connection. But it also allows you to automatically setup and populate custom fields in HubSpot for Buyer interaction data from within the SmartContent.</p>\n<p>Finally, it provides an automated personalization URL “Smart CTA” to the SmartContent asset, complete with HubSpot personalization tokens, that you can provide your client. This allows your client’s HubSpot team to use this SmartLink within HubSpot to send known contacts directly to the asset with full personalization – but without having to deal with a form.</p>\n<p>Greatly reduce the amount of time and cost put into the coordination and manual efforts of these kinds of MA/CRM integrations!</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SPLASHMAKER</strong></p>\n<p>“ I’ve already forwarded to a client who needs to set up their ABM machine. This is great for that!” – <strong>Kim Salzer, Fractional CMO, Chief Outsiders</strong></p>\n",
