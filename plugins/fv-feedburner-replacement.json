So in WP Super Cache, you have to exclude feeds from caching, see the <a href=\"http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/fv-feedburner-replacement/installation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">installation guide</a>. Hyper Cache has feed caching turned off by default and it also <a href=\"http://foliovision.com/2012/09/wordpress-speed-test-wp-super-cache-vs-hypercache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">scores better in our tests</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
