To do this&#8230;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your <code>wp-config.php</code> file in a text editor and search for: <code>define ('WPLANG', '');</code></li>\n<li>Edit this line according to the language you want to use (and is available). For example, for Deutsch spoken in Germany, you must add: <code>('WPLANG', 'de_DE');</code></li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve added your language code, save the file.</li>\n<li>Upload the modified wp-config.php file into the WordPress root directory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, you&#8217;ll replace de_DE with the language extension that you want to use, unless of course you actually did want the German language translation. For more information, consult <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Installing WordPress in Your Language</a> on the WordPress Codex</p>\n<h4>Languages Available</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bosnian translation: bs_BA</li>\n<li>Catalan (Spain) translation: ca_CA</li>\n<li>Czech translation: cs_CZ</li>\n<li>Danish translation: da_DK</li>\n<li>German translation: de_DE</li>\n<li>Spanish translation: es_ES</li>\n<li>French translation: fr_FR</li>\n<li>Hungarian translation: hu_HU</li>\n<li>Italian translation: it_IT</li>\n<li>Lithuanian translation: lt_LT</li>\n<li>Latvian translation: lv_LV</li>\n<li>Dutch translation: nl_NL</li>\n<li>Norwegian translation: nn_NO</li>\n<li>Polish translation: pl_PL</li>\n<li>Portuguese [Brazil] translation: pr_BR</li>\n<li>Romanian translation: ro_RO</li>\n<li>Russian translation: ru_RU</li>\n<li>Serbian [Cyrilic] translation: sr_RS</li>\n<li>Swedish translation: sv_SE</li>\n<li>Turkish translation: tr_TR</li>\n<li>Vietnamese translation: vi_VI</li>\n<li>Chinese translation: zh_CN</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Install the plugin using your preferred method of choice. Using the built-in WordPress installer is the preferred choice, but you can also do things the hard/manual way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the timer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Events can be added and other settings modified in Settings &gt; Countdown Timer in The Dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Inserting countdown timers into your blog</h4>\n<p>There are three places you can insert a countdown timer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sidebar (using the widget)</li>\n<li>A post or page (using shortcodes)</li>\n<li>PHP (experts only)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Adding to the sidebar</h4>\n<p>Add the widget to the sidebar by going to Appearances &gt; Widget in The Dashboard.</p>\n<h4>Adding to a post or page</h4>\n<p>If you want to insert the Countdown Timer into a page or post, you can use the following shortcodes to return all or a limited number of Countdown Timers, respectively:<br />\n    [fergcorp_cdt]<br />\n    [fergcorp_cdt max=##]</p>\n<p>Where <em>##</em> is maximum number of results to be displayed, ordered by date.</p>\n<p>If you want to insert individual countdown timers, such as in posts or on pages, you can use the following shortcode:</p>\n<pre><code>[fergcorp_cdt_single date=\"ENTER_DATE_HERE\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Example:<br />\n    Time until our wedding:<br />\n    [fergcorp_cdt_single date=&#8221;08 December 2012&#8243;]</p>\n<p>Where &#8220;ENTER_DATE_HERE&#8221; uses PHP&#8217;s strtotime function and will parse about any English textual date/time description (such as &#8220;08 December 2012&#8221;). A complete list of valid formats can be found on PHP&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Supported Date and Time Format</a> page.</p>\n<h4>PHP</h4>\n<p>Countdown Timer also provides a PHP function designed to be accessed publicly so you can include it in elements of your site that may not be in The Loop.</p>\n<pre><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer(##)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <em>##</em> is the maximum number of events you wish to be displayed. If <em>$maxEvents</em> is not given, the function will return all timers.</p>\n<p>Events are automatically sorted by date of occurrence.</p>\n<p>Note: You should also encapsulate calls with &#8220;function_exists&#8221; to prevent unintentional fatal errors if the plugin is deactivated.</p>\n<h4>Limiting the number of countdown timers displayed</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the widget, there is an option to set the maximum number of timers shown. If you are using the PHP code, <em>$maxEvents</em> is the maximum number of events you wish to be displayed.</p>\n<p>Events are automatically sorted by date of occurrence.</p>\n<h4>Changing the font, size, and style using CSS</h4>\n<p>You can makes changes to the appearance of Countdown Timer display using CSS.</p>\n<p>The following CSS classes are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_event_li</code> styles each List Item, each item encompasses one countdown event</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_event_title</code> styles the title of the event</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_event_linkTitle</code> styles the title of an event if it is linked</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_event_time</code> styles the actual countdown timer</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_timeUnit</code> styles the units (e.g. &#8220;25 days&#8221;)</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_year</code> styles the year text</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_month</code> styles the month text</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_week</code> styles the week text</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_day</code> styles the day text</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_hour</code> styles the hour text</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_minute</code> styles the minute text</li>\n<li><code>fergcorp_countdownTimer_second</code> styles the second text</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I prevent the timer from wrapping my countdown?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add the following to your CSS file: .fergcorp_countdownTimer_timeUnit {white-space: nowrap;}</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have JavaScript countdown enabled and it works on the administration page in the Example Display, but not on my main site!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This, unfortunately, is a problem with your theme, and not with Countdown Timer. Themes <em>must</em> call wp_footer(), which is a standard hook for WordPress. Without it, many other plugins may not work properly either.</p>\n<p>Your best bet to fix the problem is to modify the <code>footer.php</code> file and put <code>&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;</code> right before <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. Then contact the person you designed the theme and let them know of their coding oversight.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Your program is broken! The count down is off by XX days!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, not quite. As it turns out, determining the number of months between two dates is harder than one might think. As you know, all months don&#8217;t have the same number of days. Thus, some months have 31 days, others have 30 days, and then there&#8217;s February. It&#8217;s pretty trivial to figure out the number of complete months between two days (if complete months exist).</p>\n<p>However, how many months exist between January 15 and February 20? There are 36 days, which is obviously more than the number of days in any given month we have, so the timer should display 1 month and how many days? Six days (30 days/month)? Five days (31 days/month)? Eight days (28 days/month since the date does end in February)?</p>\n<p>I happened to mention my problem to a friend who said that the US military decided that there were 30 days in every month and to prorate the addition day (or less day(s)) for all the months that have more (or less) than 30 days.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Wait, so how /do/ you count months?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using the above example of January 15 to February 20, there would be one month and five days. February 15 to March 20 would also be one month and five days. Why? January 15 to February 15 is one month. February 15 to February 20 is 5 days. Put them together and you get one month and five days.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where I am supposed to set the count down time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Log into your WordPress Dashboard. Expand the Settings menu, click on Countdown Timer. Scroll down to One Time Events. In the dates field, type the date you want to count down to. Fill in the event title field with what text you want displayed. Click Update Events.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There&#8217;s a foreign (non-English) word that&#8217;s wrong, what do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two ways to fix this. First, you can always contact me via email, blog comment, support forum, etc and let me know about the error. I don&#8217;t usually issue bug fix updates just for language errors, but it will make it into the next update cycle.</p>\n<p>Second, if you&#8217;re handy with poEdit or something of the like, you can make the changes yourself and email me the .po and .mo files (although I really only need the .po file).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How come there are long periods of time when you don&#8217;t respond or update the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m an engineer and have to retreat to my cave from time to time. Also, I do this for fun. That means work must come first (unless you want to pay me, then we can talk). Since I work during the week, you may only hear from me during the weekend.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

It&#8217;s kind of been cool using the SVN because it is easier to see what changes have been made from version to version. In any event, this release has a couple of updates. First, there is an option to include the timer from within the WP Loop, that is you can now display the timer from within a post or page (see instructions for the specifics). The idea came from Ronny a mere four days ago, just to give you an idea of the turn around time on suggestions to release. Because of the way the plugin is implemented, I also had to modify the main function that gets the ball rolling on displaying the timer. It&#8217;s designed to be backwards compatible, so you shouldn&#8217;t have any problems. I also had to rewrite parts of the version check system to work with the SVN. The format is actually much better and just calls one text file which lists the latest version (i.e. &#8216;1.4?). It compares that to the current version and let&#8217;s you know if there&#8217;s a new version. Simple! As always, you can turn the feature off.</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<p>Release date: 03/16/2006:</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve already received some preliminary feedback on 1.2 (thanks Dave), so I&#8217;ve made a couple of updates. First, there are actually instructions for configuring the onHover Time Format option. Second, if you leave onHover Time Format blank, it will remove the dashed underline on the timer so no one is confused. I also fixed a really stupid bug, I never but a stripslashes in. So if you tried using something that needed escaping (such as an apostrophe), you would get a slash. That doesn&#8217;t happen anymore. Enjoy!</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Release date: 03/13/2006:</p>\n<p>Development has been slow. Not really a lot to do. But version 1.2 offers some great things, including a bug fix! Deleting two or more events doesn&#8217;t make the plugin freak out anymore (the bug fix). You can also customize how the onHover time is displayed, including not displaying it at all (just leave it blank). Because you can leave it blank, there is no default; but you can use and PHP &#8216;date()&#8217; format. I recommend &#8216;j M Y, G:i:s&#8217;. I also added a six month delay before the date on recurring events is reset&#8217;although as I&#8217;m writing this, I realize there&#8217;s a slight bug there, nothing critical though. I welcome any new ideas, just leave a comment down below!</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Release date: 11/28/2005:</p>\n<p>NOTICE: Copyright format changed from MIT to GNU GPL as of version 1.1<br />\nNot a whole lot of major thing. Thanks to Benoit Kechid for catching a calculation and syntax error. There was a request for making things linkable, so you can now add a link an event. The time is also has a dashed underlined and if you roll over it with your mouse, the date and time of the event are displayed.<br />\nI don&#8217;t have anymore ideas for this plugin, so unless I you email me with something that you would like, there probably won&#8217;t be any more updates.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Release date: 10/05/2005:</p>\n<p>You can now set recurring dates, sort of. The plugin can currently handle things that happen on a given day of a given month every year (such as a birthday). The plugin will also now check for updates whenever you are in the admin panel. Download and copy to your plugins directory, then rename it to .php</p>\n<h4>0.95</h4>\n<p>Release date: 09/26/2005:</p>\n<p>Fixed a Warning message (thanks to cordney* for the heads up). Also changed a few things: If you have &#8216;Automatically delete &#8216;One Time Events&#8217; on, only events that that do NOT have &#8216;Display &#8216;Time since&#8221; will be deleted. Also, the file is now a PHPS file, not zip file. Download and copy to your plugins directory, then rename it to .php</p>\n<h4>0.92</h4>\n<p>Release date: 09/23/2005:</p>\n<p>This version adds the option to automatically delete One Time Events that have all ready occured. If you don&#8217;t choose to automatically delete the events, they will be displayed as &#8216;Time since&#8217; after the event occurs. Small issue I&#8217;m still working on: events are only erased when you update timer options.</p>\n<h4>0.8</h4>\n<p>Release date: 07/23/2005:</p>\n<p>This is a backend change. The dates.txt file has been replaced with an entry in the WordPress Database. Unfortantly, you&#8217;ll have to manually transfer your events into the new form. Once they are in the form, they are automatically sorted, with events ending soonest on the top.</p>\n<h4>0.7.1</h4>\n<p>Release date: 05/23/2005:</p>\n<p>Changed an internal function name reference due to a potential conflict with another plugin (Thanks Robert)</p>\n<h4>0.7</h4>\n<p>Release date: 05/20/2005:</p>\n<p>Added Admin menu. Allows user to update information via web-interface now.</p>\n<h4>0.6.1</h4>\n<p>Release date: 05/16/2005:</p>\n<p>Fixed small math error in cdt_format() on line 47.</p>\n<h4>0.6</h4>\n<p>Release date: 05/15/2005:</p>\n<p>Initial public release</p>\n"
