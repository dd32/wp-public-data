This plugin allows users to display what they have read, attach text like a review or notes to it, and provide a link to where visitors can find the piece.  The plugin comes bundled with two archive templates (as well as templates for single items and &#8220;author&#8221; &amp; &#8220;type&#8221; archives) and is easily customizable with CSS.

Adding the &#8220;/reading-list/&#8221; or &#8220;/?post_type=works&#8221;to your site&#8217;s base url directs users to your reading list items.

This refreshes your website&#8217;s rewrite rules and now &#8220;mydomain.com/reading-list/&#8221; or &#8220;mydomain.com/?post_type=works&#8221; should work.

In addition, the templates have been highly detailed in terms of extra id&#8217;s and classes for easy customization via CSS.  Many themes have a &#8220;Custom CSS&#8221; tab built into the admin menu where you can add your changes.  Otherwise, you can always place your modifications within the &#8220;style.css&#8221; file of your parent or child theme.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20default%20wp%20reading%20list%20image%3F'>\nHow can I change the default WP Reading List image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two options: 1) You can use the settings in the admin panel and use the file uploader there. 2) You can use a file manager and go to &#8220;wp-content/plugins/wp-reading-list/wprl-theme/&#8221; and replace the &#8220;default.png&#8221; image with your image of the same name.  It is recommended that you choose a default image with a 3:4 aspect ratio (width:height) to match the other cover images.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20%22works%22%2C%20%22authors%22%2C%20%22types%22%2C%20and%20%22reading%20list%22%20terminology%20is%20confusing.%20%20is%20there%20a%20easier%20way%20to%20think%20of%20these%20things%3F'>\nThe &#8220;Works&#8221;, &#8220;Authors&#8221;, &#8220;Types&#8221;, and &#8220;Reading List&#8221; terminology is confusing.  Is there a easier way to think of these things?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Think of &#8220;works&#8221; as specialized &#8220;posts&#8221; and similarly of &#8220;authors&#8221; &amp; &#8220;types&#8221; as different kinds of &#8220;tags&#8221;.  The &#8220;Reading List&#8221; and &#8220;Reading List Items&#8221; is a phrase which tries to include all kinds of reading materials such as books, magazines, articles, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20wp%20reading%20list%20shortcodes%3F'>\nHow do I use the WP Reading List shortcodes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The WP Reading List shortcode embeds a list of items on a page or sidebar widget according to both the plugin settings in the admin panel and the parameters passed to the shortcode.  The format is: [wprl layout=&#8221;plain&#8221; number=&#8221;10&#8243;].  At this time, the only format available is &#8220;plain&#8221; but you can specify any number for the number of works displayed. (*Note, -1 returns all works.)</p>\n</p>\n\n",
