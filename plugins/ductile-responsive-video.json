This is a lightweight plugin with no options, so there is no need for an admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20wordpress%20universe%20really%20need%20another%20responsive%20video%20embeds%20plugin%3F'>\nDoes the WordPress universe really need another responsive video embeds plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are already several plugins which achieve a similar result as this one. Some provide extra functionality like shortcodes, and some are fairly slimline but use client-side javascript to modify the default embed rather than a server-side function. I like plugins to be as lightweight as possible, so I think there&#8217;s room for this one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20make%20it%20even%20more%20lightweight%3F'>\nHow can I make it even more lightweight?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can copy the css rules from the plugin&#8217;s stylesheet into your child theme&#8217;s stylesheet and prevent the plugin&#8217;s built-in styles from loading by adding the following line to your child theme&#8217;s functions.php</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php wp_deregister_style( 'ductile-embed', 30 ); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note 1: The code to prevent the stylesheet loading has changed with version 1.2.0 of the plugin. If you previously used version 1.1.0 or below and added the line given in the documentation to prevent the styles from loading, please change it to the line above.</p>\n<p>Note 2: Since version 1.2.0 the plugin&#8217;s styles are only loaded on pages which contain a media embed, so unless you want to customise the plugin&#8217;s default styles, there is now probably little value in replacing the styles.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20video%20services%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat video services are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Version 1.3.1 of this plugin supports YouTube, Vimeo, Daily Motion, Ted, videopress and WordPress.tv video embeds. If you are using this plugin and need it to act on any other video embeds which are supported by WordPress, please post on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ductile-responsive-video\" title=\"Ductile responsive video plugin support page on WordPress.org\" rel=\"ugc\">Ductile responsive video plugin support page on WordPress.org</a> and I will consider adding support.</p>\n<p>If you find the plugin useful I would also appreciate a review on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/ductile-responsive-video/\" title=\"Ductile Responsive Video plugin reviews\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin review page</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20other%20free%20plugins%20by%20the%20same%20author%3F'>\nAre there any other free plugins by the same author?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes these are listed on the <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/numeeja/#content-plugins\" title=\"cubecolour plugins on WordPress.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cubecolour plugins page on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20plugin%20not%20working%20as%20i%20think%20it%20should%3F'>\nWhy is the plugin not working as I think it should?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin is not working for you, please read the documentation carefully. If this does not address your issue, please post a question on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ductile-responsive-video\" title=\"Ductile Responsive Video plugin support forum\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin support forum</a> so we can at least have an opportunity to try to get it working before you leave a review.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20it%20work%20on%20my%20site%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t it work on my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First check that you have embedded your video as outlined on the [Embeds usage page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds &#8220;Ductile responsive video Embeds usage page on the WordPress.org codex&#8221;. Do not embed your video by adding an iframe to your page editor as this does not create a valid WordPress embed.</p>\n<p>The plugin has been tested and works for me as expected on the sites it has been tested on. If it is not working for you, the may be an incompatibility caused by some code on your theme or another plugin.
