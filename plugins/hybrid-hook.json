        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was created so that end users and non-developers could take advantage of the Hybrid theme&#8217;s extensive hook system.  It allows the input of HTML, PHP, shortcodes, and JavaScript from the WordPress admin.  It&#8217;s a way to work around having to learn how to use the WordPress plugin API and just add content anywhere.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set it up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Under <em>Appearance &gt; Hybrid Hook</em>, you can add custom code in individual textareas.  Each textarea corresponds to one of the Hybrid theme&#8217;s hooks, and each is accompanied by a priority input box and a checkbox to execute PHP.</p>\n<p>More detailed instructions are included in the plugin&#8217;s <code>readme.html</code> file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This replaced the <code>edit_themes</code> cap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 0.2</h4>\n<p><strong>Important!</strong> Note that you&#8217;ll need to resave all of your settings.  I suggest making a copy of them in a text file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin was rewritten from the ground up to allow it to be extended for more action hooks in the future.</li>\n<li>Added the ability to add shortcodes to the the different hook areas.</li>\n<li>Each bit of custom code can now be given a priority other than the default.</li>\n<li>Each section can now allow/disallow PHP code to be executed.</li>\n<li>Added new sections for several action hooks: <code>hybrid_before_entry</code>, <code>hybrid_after_entry</code>, <code>hybrid_before_subsidiary</code>, and <code>hybrid_after_subsidiary</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin launch.
