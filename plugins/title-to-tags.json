        "faq": "\n<h4>How Can I Contribute?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is now being maintained on GitHub, so please do contribute all your questions, comments, suggestions, fixes and improvements with me <a href=\"https://github.com/holisticnetworking/title-to-terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin convert all words in the title?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  There is a user-configurable list of stop words, pre-populated with a host of common words, which can be used to fine-tune the resulting tags.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin overwrite my existing tags?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin can be configured to either<br />\n* Add new terms only when the post does not already contain terms in that taxonomy<br />\n* Append the list of terms with any new terms not already added.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When are the tags added?  At publish or save?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tags are added to the post when it is saved, whether as a draft, update or by publishing, but not when the post is autosaved.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a way to reset the list of ignored words back to the original?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Simply delete the current list of stop words, and Title to Tags will replace the list with its default stop words collection (stopwords.txt)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin put tags on my old posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe. It will not handle the process automatically, but if you open any untagged post and save it, Titles to Tags will work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t this plugin tag the words &#8220;Auto&#8221; or &#8220;Draft&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Autosaved drafts in WordPress get saved with the title of &#8220;Auto Draft&#8221;. As such, we need to add those words to our stop list.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Didn&#8217;t put the title in the meta data, how silly!</li>\n<li>1.4 ~ SVN commit to include tag</li>\n<li>2.0 ~ Revamped version based on experiments with these function in another plugin.<br />\n    ~ using WP-style function notes<br />\n    ~ designed to work with both WP and WPMU<br />\n    ~ lowerNoPunc function now removes posessive &#8216;s from words<br />\n    ~ addresses issue where tags are created even if they&#8217;re not added to the post</li>\n<li>2.1 ~ Two bug fixes:<br />\n    ~ Use of the deprecated number-based roles in the add_options_menu() call has been fixed.<br />\n    ~ Added isset() check to form submission check. Whoops! Error checking not turned on.<br />\n    ~ NOTE: I am aware of the issue with this plugin not working in 3.0 and the next release will correct this issue. This will probably make the plugin inoperable for &lt;3.0. Please upgrade your system to continue using this plugin.</li>\n<li>3.0 ~ Converted to WordPress 3.0-compatible code. Not sure how this will affect the 2.x users out there, but will make a branch in SVN just in case.</li>\n<li>3.0.1 ~ Noticed some improvements to be made to the efficiency of the code. getStopWords is now the only function used to get the stop words anywhere they appear (formerly using get_option directly).</li>\n<li>3.2 ~ Rearranging a lot of the code, user-defined stop words were being ignored.</li>\n<li>3.3 New version now on GitHub.<br />\n  ~Version also checked to be compatible with WP 4.4</li>\n<li>4.0 ~ Changed name to Titles to Terms Ultimate, reflecting newly updated code.<br />\n~ T2TU now allows one taxonomy per post type to be auto-populated by title-generated terms.<br />\n~ User-selectable taxonomy for each post type registered to WordPress, and each taxonomy registered to that post type.</li>\n<li>4.1 ~ Refactoring code for efficiency and caching. Also:<br />\n    ~ Creating option to either maintain possessive apostrophes or not.<br />\n    ~ Creating a minimum length option, so smaller words do not get converted.</li>\n</ul>\n"
