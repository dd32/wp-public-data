Pin it for the search term and make sure it’s the first result they see.</li>\n<li>Synonyms: Create search term “synonyms” to show desired search results on less common terms or common misspellings.

It is for modifying search results for specific queries that you choose.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this catch misspellings and direct them to the correct results?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not out of the box. You can, however, manually set common misspellings as Synonyms of a Special Search so that they are intercepted.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
