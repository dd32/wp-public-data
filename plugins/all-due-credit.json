All Due Credit allows you to include a<br />\nlist of names along with any post you write, to serve this very purpose. Each name listed is accompanied by text label that reveals<br />\nwhat their role was.</p>\n<p>You can add the following labels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Written by</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Co-written by</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edited by</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reviewed by</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thanks to</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each name can be accompanied by a Gravatar, as well as a homepage link.</p>\n<p>All Due Credit currently requires some manual steps to use. For example, whenever you want to add a name to a post, you have to<br />\nadd a Custom Field manually, respecting the right spelling of text label. (See the &#8216;Usage&#8217; tab for more information) While this is completely functional, I will eventually make it friendlier, where you&#8217;ll be able to select from a dropdown, or<br />\nsomething simple like that. Despite this, I&#8217;m happy with using All Due Credit on <a href=\"http://www.mattrefghi.com/wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my own blog</a>,<br />\nand figured some of you may appreciate the same opportunity.</p>\n<p>The design of All Due Credit was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Funnyordie.com</a>.</p>\n",

        "faq": "<h4>Will this plugin change my post contents?</h4>\n<p>No. The All Due Credit control is generated on-the-fly, and it is added right after the post content. Furthermore, All<br />\nDue Credit will never appear on the home page of your blog, only when you view a specific post.</p>\n<h4>Why does All Due Credit appear broken in my blog?</h4>\n<p>There are a huge variety of WordPress themes available out there, some of which make major modifications to the styles of WordPress. Since All Due Credit inherits these styles, sometimes this results in layout issues. I&#8217;ve been progressing on handling differences introduced by themes, so keep an eye out for new versions. If you have problems with a specific theme, I&#8217;d be happy to take a look and see if I can help.</p>\n<h4>Can I have multiple names per label, in the same post?</h4>\n<p>Only with the &#8216;Thanks to&#8217; field, at the moment. Multiple names in the &#8216;Thanks to&#8217; field, delimited by semi-colon (;),  will automatically be converted to multiple &#8216;Thanks to&#8217; entries in All Due Credit. The other four labels don&#8217;t currently<br />\n support this.</p>\n<h4>If I enter an e-mail, will it ever be seen by my readers?</h4>\n<p>No. The e-mail is encrypted right before we use it, and is only used to request the person&#8217;s Gravatar.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added two new options: Show on home page and Show in feed. They allow you to control where All Due Credit will be included.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an options page, which can be found in the Settings menu group. Currently, three options are available: Maximum names per row, Gravatar size, and Gravatar default image. The first two can be useful if you&#8217;re having trouble getting All Due Credit looking right in your theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Greatly improved compatibility with themes that use custom image styles. Future updates will improve this logic to handle themes that have heavy CSS changes.</li>\n<li>Fixed minor performance flaw that was calling JavaScript methods needlessly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Gravatars are now hotlinked (same effect as clicking on the name)</li>\n<li>Greatly improved compatibility with themes, ensuring that names will always be visible and unclipped. Next update will improve how avatars look in templates that modify image styles.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where very long names would break the overall layout</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Initial Release</p>\n"
