This plugin does two things &#8211; it adds the new javascript to the page where your forms are displayed, and disables the &#8220;old&#8221; way that CF7 handled these settings. By installing &amp; activating this plugin you stop relying on Contact Form 7 to process your <code>on_sent_ok</code> and <code>on_submit</code> events, so this plugin should work seamlessly with any modern version of CF7 whether it natively supports these settings or not.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
