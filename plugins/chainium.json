        "description": "<h3>Chainium &#8211; Blockchain Connector</h3>\n<p>Chainium is a Web3 wallet authenticator and blockchain connector plugin for WordPress. With Chainium, you can easily connect your website to the blockchain and authenticate users with their Web3 wallets. Chainium supports Ethereum ecosystem for now and will support more blockchains in the future.</p>\n<p>Our goal with Chainium is after the completely commission-free and peer-to-peer crypto payments that we do at CryptoPay. To create a full Web3 and Blockchain connector and integrator for WordPress. At the moment, we have only added WordPress login and registration processes with Web3 wallets like MetaMask on the Ethereum ecosystem, but you can see our plans for Chainium going forward in the features list below.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Web3 Wallet Authenticator</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web3 Wallet Authenticator only supports Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains for now. You can authenticate users with their Web3 wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc. Also supports mobile wallets by Reown AppKit (formerly WalletConnect).</p>\n<h3>Upcoming Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NFT Marketplace</li>\n<li>Blockchain Explorers</li>\n<li>Blockchain User Wallets</li>\n<li>Blockchain User Profiles</li>\n<li>Solana, Tron, Bitcoin Integration</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is Web3 Wallet Authenticator?</h3>\n<p>Web3 Wallet Authenticator is a new way to authenticate users on websites. Instead of using traditional username and password, users can authenticate with their Web3 wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc. This way, users can sign in to websites without creating an account and without sharing their personal information.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>When a user tries to sign in to your website, Chainium will ask the user to connect their Web3 wallet. The user will sign a message with their wallet and Chainium will verify the signature. If the signature is valid, the user will be authenticated and signed in to your website.</p>\n<h3>Why use Web3 Wallet Authenticator?</h3>\n<p>We currently have two shortcodes for you to use Chainium. The first shortcode is [beycanpress-chainium-init] and the second shortcode is [beycanpress-chainium-matching]. You can use the first shortcode to show the login button and the second shortcode to show the address matching form.</p>\n<p>You can add the relevant shortcodes wherever you want on your site. There are also options to enable Chainium for the WordPress Login page and WooCommerce My Account Login page directly from the settings.</p>\n<p>You can also write custom CSS to customize the shortcodes comes with standard styling.</p>\n<h3>How to enable registration?</h3>\n<p>By default Chainium only supports login and address matching. If you want to enable users to register directly with their wallet, you need to enable the “Anyone can register” option in the WordPress general settings.</p>\n<h4>Privacy notices</h4>\n<p>With the default configuration, this plugin, in itself, does not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use cookies;</li>\n<li>track users by stealth;</li>\n<li>It only sends active plugin count and active feedback;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3rd Party Libraries &amp; API&#8217;s</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BeycanPress/csf\n<ul>\n<li>License: MIT</li>\n<li>Source code: https://github.com/BeycanPress/csf</li>\n<li>What is this library for?: This library is used for the options panel and not sending data to external servers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>https://sweetalert2.github.io/\n<ul>\n<li>License: MIT</li>\n<li>Source code: https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2/</li>\n<li>What is this library for?: This library is used to show alerts to the user.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>https://beycanpress.com/, https://services.beycanpress.com/\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy policy: https://beycanpress.com/privacy-policy/</li>\n<li>This is our website.
