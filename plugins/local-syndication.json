        "faq": "\n<h4>What if the web page I&#8217;m syndicating has relative URLs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unless the content is published in an iframe, relative URLs from an external site will not work. Neither will relative URLs published from your own site when the relative directory is different than where your WordPress page is displayed.</p>\n<p>If links and external content (like images) need to work, the URLs of the href and src attributes need to be absolute https:// or https:// URLs &#8211; unless, as noted, the content is published in an iframe where relative URLs are relative to the URL of the content rather than the URL of the WordPress page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I want to convert content into JavaScript before publishing it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One reason for using this optional feature would be to discourage robots and spiders from reading the content. It may be desirable to keep ads out of search engine indexes, for example, and perhaps also off-topic content so SE&#8217;s do not come to wrong conclusions regarding a page&#8217;s topic.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What would importing live JavaScript do for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some ads are delivered with JavaScript. Some regular content, such as the Spam-free Form, are delivered with JavaScript.</p>\n<p>There are developers who have determined that syndicated or remotely delivered content provided as JavaScript is desirable because it makes their content accessible by more websites &#8211; as compared to requiring specific types of web pages, like PHP (for example).</p>\n<p>As with all content pulled in from remote websites, not only JavaScript code and not only into WordPress, there must be trust that the provider won&#8217;t send nefarious content or code to your page. Otherwise, it may be prudent to just not do it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
