        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I add the map to a page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add this shortcode <code>[nwm_map]</code> to the page where you want to display the map.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add multiple maps to a page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You add the shortcode like you normally would, only this time you also need to define the map ID.<br />\nSo if you want to show the maps with ids 1,4 and 5 you would add the following shortcodes.</p>\n<pre><code>[nwm_map id=\"1\"]\n[nwm_map id=\"4\"]\n[nwm_map id=\"5\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I specify the dimensions of the map?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just add the width and height as an attribute to the shortcode. <code>[nwm_map height=\"500\" width=\"500\"]</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I specify which map is shown?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add the id attribute to the <code>[nwm_map id=\"3\"]</code> shortcode. This will show the map with ID 3 on your page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I created a route and added the shortcode to a page, but when I view the page in the browser it only shows a blank map?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure your theme doesn&#8217;t use AJAX to navigate between pages, if so try to disable it. Also make sure there are no <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JavaScript</a> errors on your site. Last thing you can try is to switch to another theme and disable other plugins and see if that fixes it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What other shortcode options exist for individual maps?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can set the zoom level like this. <code>[nwm_map zoom=\"6\"]</code><br />\nYou can set the content type to either &#8216;tooltip&#8217; or &#8216;slider&#8217;. <code>[nwm_map content=\"tooltip\"]</code> If it&#8217;s set to tooltip, it will remove the slider.<br />\nYou can disable the lines between the markers <code>[nwm_map lines=\"0\"]</code><br />\nYou can set the map type like this <code>[nwm_map maptype=\"roadmap\"]</code> other accepted values are &#8216;satellite&#8217;, &#8216;hybrid&#8217; and &#8216;terrain&#8217;.</p>\n<p>If the zoom level, content type, lines or maptype are not set in the shortcode, the values from the general settings page will be used.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I show a list of all the destinations on the map?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this short code <code>[nwm_list id=\"1\"]</code> will show the destination list for the map with id 1. If no id is set, it will default to 1.</p>\n<p>Other shortcode options for the list:</p>\n<pre><code>[nwm_list id=\"1\" dates=\"all\"] Show both the arrival and departure dates\n[nwm_list id=\"1\" dates=\"arrival\"] Only show the arrival dates\n[nwm_list id=\"1\" dates=\"departure\"] Only show the arrival dates\n[nwm_list order=\"asc\"] or `[nwm_list order=\"desc]` will change the sort order of the destination list\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>When I search for a blog post title it returns no results?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the blog post you search for is published, and that it matches exactly with the title you see in the blog post editor.<br />\nOtherwise please open a support request in the support form.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
