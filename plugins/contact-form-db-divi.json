It does not support other form plugins or custom-built forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20form%20submissions%20can%20the%20contact%20form%20db%20plugin%20store%3F'>\nHow many form submissions can the Contact Form DB plugin store?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Contact Form DB plugin can store an unlimited number of form submissions in your WordPress database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20form%20submissions%20from%20contact%20form%20db%3F'>\nCan I export form submissions from Contact Form DB?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting from version 1.1 and above of the premium version, you can now export form submissions directly within the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20an%20option%20to%20export%20in%20a%20format%20other%20than%20csv%3F'>\nIs there an option to export in a format other than CSV?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently there is no alternative export format available.

However, it is the responsibility of the website owner to ensure that their website and any plugins used, including Contact Form DB, are compliant with GDPR regulations. We recommend consulting with a legal professional or GDPR expert to ensure compliance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20delete%20old%20or%20unnecessary%20form%20submissions%20from%20the%20contact%20form%20db%20database%3F'>\nHow do I delete old or unnecessary form submissions from the Contact Form DB database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To delete old or unnecessary form submissions from the Contact Form DB database, simply locate the submission you wish to delete and click the &#8220;Trash&#8221; link next to it. This will move the submission to the trash, where it will be permanently deleted after 30 days (or sooner if you empty the trash manually).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20bought%20the%20plugin%20but%20the%20license%20is%20not%20working%3F'>\nI bought the plugin but the license is not working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing issues with your plugin license, it&#8217;s important to clarify that our plugin, developed from scratch in April 2023, might share a similar name with other plugins, but it&#8217;s not affiliated with existing developers or platforms such as Elegant Marketplace.
