Now you can now  the S2B AI Assistant plugin.<br />\n-You can create many chatbots on the Chatbot page YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/wp-admin/admin.php?page=s2baia_chatbot page of this plugin.<br />\n-To get the chatbot operational, insert the shortcode in one of the following formats [s2baia_chatbot], [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=automatically_generated_hashcode] (where automatic_generated_hashcode is the chatbot hashcode that is automatically assigned when the chatbot is created) or [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=assistant] into any page or post. First format allows to exploit chatbot that uses Chat Completion API. This is default chatbot type. The second format allows for both types of chatbots using the Chat Completion API and the Assistant API. Third format of shortcode allows to  use the automatically generated AI Assistant directly from our plugin. You can use all 3 types of chatbots on different pages or posts. You can create as many different chatbots as you like with the format [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=automatically_generated_hashcode]. You can also place a chatbot with the same shortcode on different pages and/or posts.</p>\n<p>-To create a content-aware chatbot using OpenAI Assistant API you have two options.  First option is to generate AI Assistnt directly from our plugin. For doing this you need to click on Assistant API tab and follows 3 steps:<br />\n1.Upload file that will be used as knowledge base by ChatGPT.<br />\n2.Create new Assistant by filling instruction and selecting model. For details see <a href=\"https://soft2business.com/how-to-create-content-aware-chat-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article</a>.<br />\n3.Add  shortcode [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=&#8221;assistant&#8221;] to any page you want<br />\nAdditionally, you can read  <a href=\"https://soft2business.com/how-to-create-content-aware-chat-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article</a> about how to better configure content aware  chatbot.</p>\n<p>The second option to create an AI Assistant is to do it through the OpenI Assistants page and then link to our plugin. Read this <a href=\"https://soft2business.com/how-to-create-ai-assistants-manually/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>-For image generation open Image page in /wp-admin side. There you can generate images, using Dall-e-2 or Dall-e-3 models and store them into Media library.</p>\n<p>-For using content feature please open any type of post edition page. Then scroll down to the S2B AI Assistant metabox. There, you can enter text into the &#8216;Text to be changed&#8217; input field. After that, you can manually input your instructions. Additionally, you can select any previously saved instructions in the database. Also you can select other parameters such as the model, temperature, and maximum length of the request and response text. Finally, click the Send button. If everything goes well, you will receive a response in the Result textarea.</p>\n<p>For those with more in-depth knowledge of using ChatGPT, we offer the Expert tab.</p>\n<p>For additional information regarding prompts see <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a></p>\n<h3>Chatbot view modifications</h3>\n<p>Besides of styling chatbot in configuration pages you also can use some predefined views or view modifications. In version 1.6.1 we introduce modalless view which allows you to put chatbot as part of web page without showing modal window. To use this function you can add shortcode [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=BOT_HASH_CODE  view=embedded] where BOT_HASH_CODE is hashcode generated automatically when you create new Assistant or Chat Bot. This hash code is displayed in hash column of table with chat bot or assistants list. Also it is possible to use such simple form of shortcode [s2baia_chatbot   view=embedded] In such case plugin displays default chat bot as modalles in the web page. You can also use the same chatbot with different views as modal or modalles in other webpages. When you want to use chat bot without modal then make sure that you selected pixels as  units of measurement for chatbot height in the bot configuration!<br />\nWe also introduced view_mode attribute in shortcode. When you add such shortcode [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=BOT_HASH_CODE view_mode=fullscreen1 ] then chat bot will be displayed in full screen immediately after page loads. If you want to hide close button for full screen chat bot then you need to use hideclose=1 attribute. For ecxample [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=BOT_HASH_CODE view_mode=fullscreen1 hideclose=1]</p>\n<h3>Apply custom CSS rules to any chatbot</h3>\n<p>In version 1.6.3, we added the &#8220;Deep Customization&#8221; feature.  This allows you to create a unique view for each chatbot using custom css rules. To do this, you need to find the &#8216;Deep customization&#8217; section on the &#8220;Chatbots&#8221; or &#8220;Assistants&#8221; tabs, add the unique html id of the closed and opened chatbot. You can then add CSS rules to each closed and open view of any chatbot. Separate css rules can be applied to different chatbots.</p>\n<h3>Users access</h3>\n<p>It is possible to configure user access to different parts of plugin. If you are admin then you can select which user roles have access to next functional parts: meta-boxes,  plugin&#8217;s configuration page, access to delete instructions and access to configure chatbot.<br />\nYou can also select which user role has access to the image generation feature. To do this, you need to select a user role from the middle select box in the &#8216;User Roles&#8217; panel. It is worth noting that even if the role selected in the middle field has access to create images, this does not guarantee that this role will have permission to write created images to the Media Library. For more details, please check <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\" rel=\"ugc\">page</a><br />\nAs an administrator, you can also select user roles that can configure chatbots. Also, when creating chatbots, you can choose whether they will be available to unregistered visitors or only to registered ones.</p>\n<h3>Open AI</h3>\n<p>The S2B AI Assistant makes use of the API provided by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api or [Reference]https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).

We implemented File Search API feature in our pugin. Before using this on your website, you should remember some important tips:<br />\n1.It is Beta feature and not yet tested carefully. Thus it can cause unpredicted behavior. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the chatbot&#8217;s responses.<br />\n2.OpenAI charges additionally besides used conversational tokens. At the moment of release version 1.5.8 of this plugin it costs  $0.10 / GB of vector-storage per day (1 GB free) + used tokens during conversation.  Please <a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">observe</a>  to be informed about pricing updates.<br />\n3.The effectiveness and accuracy of the bot&#8217;s responses depends on the system instructions provided and the models used in the prompts.

Paste API key in the &#8216;Open AI Key:&#8217; field of the ChatGPT tab.<br />\n-Switch to Models tab. Click on the &#8216;Refresh from OpenAI&#8217; button. It updates models from OpenAI server. Select Models which you want to use.  Select the Edit checkbox for models that will be used with chatbots and text manipulation.

Now you can now  the S2B AI Assistant plugin.<br />\n-You can create many chatbots on the Chatbot page YOUR_WEBSITE_URL/wp-admin/admin.php?page=s2baia_chatbot page of this plugin.<br />\n-To get the chatbot operational, insert the shortcode in one of the following formats [s2baia_chatbot], [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=automatically_generated_hashcode] (where automatic_generated_hashcode is the chatbot hashcode that is automatically assigned when the chatbot is created) or [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=assistant] into any page or post. First format allows to exploit chatbot that uses Chat Completion API. This is default chatbot type. The second format allows for both types of chatbots using the Chat Completion API and the Assistant API. Third format of shortcode allows to  use the automatically generated AI Assistant directly from our plugin. You can use all 3 types of chatbots on different pages or posts. You can create as many different chatbots as you like with the format [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=automatically_generated_hashcode]. You can also place a chatbot with the same shortcode on different pages and/or posts.</p>\n<p>-To create a content-aware chatbot using OpenAI Assistant API you have two options.  First option is to generate AI Assistnt directly from our plugin. For doing this you need to click on Assistant API tab and follows 3 steps:<br />\n1.Upload file that will be used as knowledge base by ChatGPT.<br />\n2.Create new Assistant by filling instruction and selecting model. For details see <a href=\"https://soft2business.com/how-to-create-content-aware-chat-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article</a>.<br />\n3.Add  shortcode [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=&#8221;assistant&#8221;] to any page you want<br />\nAdditionally, you can read  <a href=\"https://soft2business.com/how-to-create-content-aware-chat-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article</a> about how to better configure content aware  chatbot.</p>\n<p>The second option to create an AI Assistant is to do it through the OpenI Assistants page and then link to our plugin. Read this <a href=\"https://soft2business.com/how-to-create-ai-assistants-manually/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>-For image generation open Image page in /wp-admin side. There you can generate images, using Dall-e-2 or Dall-e-3 models and store them into Media library.</p>\n<p>-For using content feature please open any type of post edition page. Then scroll down to the S2B AI Assistant metabox. There, you can enter text into the &#8216;Text to be changed&#8217; input field. After that, you can manually input your instructions. Additionally, you can select any previously saved instructions in the database.

In version 1.6.1 we introduce modalless view which allows you to put chatbot as part of web page without showing modal window. To use this function you can add shortcode [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=BOT_HASH_CODE  view=embedded] where BOT_HASH_CODE is hashcode generated automatically when you create new Assistant or Chat Bot. This hash code is displayed in hash column of table with chat bot or assistants list. Also it is possible to use such simple form of shortcode [s2baia_chatbot   view=embedded] In such case plugin displays default chat bot as modalles in the web page. You can also use the same chatbot with different views as modal or modalles in other webpages. When you want to use chat bot without modal then make sure that you selected pixels as  units of measurement for chatbot height in the bot configuration!<br />\nWe also introduced view_mode attribute in shortcode. When you add such shortcode [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=BOT_HASH_CODE view_mode=fullscreen1 ] then chat bot will be displayed in full screen immediately after page loads. If you want to hide close button for full screen chat bot then you need to use hideclose=1 attribute. For ecxample [s2baia_chatbot bot_id=BOT_HASH_CODE view_mode=fullscreen1 hideclose=1]</p>\n<h3>Apply custom CSS rules to any chatbot</h3>\n<p>In version 1.6.3, we added the &#8220;Deep Customization&#8221; feature.  This allows you to create a unique view for each chatbot using custom css rules. To do this, you need to find the &#8216;Deep customization&#8217; section on the &#8220;Chatbots&#8221; or &#8220;Assistants&#8221; tabs, add the unique html id of the closed and opened chatbot. You can then add CSS rules to each closed and open view of any chatbot. Separate css rules can be applied to different chatbots.</p>\n<h3>Users access</h3>\n<p>It is possible to configure user access to different parts of plugin. If you are admin then you can select which user roles have access to next functional parts: meta-boxes,  plugin&#8217;s configuration page, access to delete instructions and access to configure chatbot.<br />\nYou can also select which user role has access to the image generation feature. To do this, you need to select a user role from the middle select box in the &#8216;User Roles&#8217; panel. It is worth noting that even if the role selected in the middle field has access to create images, this does not guarantee that this role will have permission to write created images to the Media Library. For more details, please check <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/\" rel=\"ugc\">page</a><br />\nAs an administrator, you can also select user roles that can configure chatbots. Also, when creating chatbots, you can choose whether they will be available to unregistered visitors or only to registered ones.</p>\n<h3>Open AI</h3>\n<p>The S2B AI Assistant makes use of the API provided by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api or [Reference]https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
