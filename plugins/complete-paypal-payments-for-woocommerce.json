We&#8217;ve made sure to include all WooCommerce order data in PayPal transactions so that everything matches in both places.

If you have a PayPal business account, then you can require customer phone numbers from your PayPal account settings.</p>\n<p>PayPal has the ability to provide the customer’s phone number which can be used to autopopulate your checkout page. We recommend you enable this option as it reduces the number of checkout fields your customer has to manually enter. It reduces friction and will improve conversion rates.</p>\n<p>1) Login to your Sandbox or Production account.</p>\n<p>2) On the Website payment preferences page, scroll down to the Contact telephone number section. If the billing phone number is optional on your checkout page, you can select the On (optional field). If it’s required, select the On (required field)</p>\n</p>\n\n",
