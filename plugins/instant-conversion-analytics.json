The JavaScript file does not depend on any libraries and is designed to run asynchronously.</p>\n<p>We did a Google PageSpeed Insights test on a website where this plugin was installed and got a mobile score of 99 (desktop score of 100). All of the suggested improvements were unrelated to this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20this%20plugin%20has%20an%20error%20for%20any%20reason%20will%20i%20still%20receive%20my%20emails%3F'>\nIf this plugin has an error for any reason will I still receive my emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you will still get your email.
