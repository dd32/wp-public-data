        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow can I see who is subscribed for what?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Subscriptions are stored in the database and are not directly accessible via an interface.</p>\n<p>If enabled via the plugin settings page, <strong>a log file will be kept</strong> with all user and mail actions. This log is kept within the plugins directory on your server (<code>/wp-content/plugins/th23-subscribe</code>) and named <code>log.csv</code> (for easier readability use eg Microsoft Excel to open it).</p>\n<p>The file contains the following columns:<br />\n* User ID<br />\n* User login<br />\n* User mail<br />\n* Action<br />\n* Content (post/ comment ID)<br />\n* Timestamp (machine readable)<br />\n* Date/ Time (human readable)<br />\n* IP address</p>\n<p>The file is protected from access via the browser by an htaccess rule from the public &#8211; you can simply access it via FTP, while it will be hidden from everybody else!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I input field placeholder instead of labels for the visitor form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin <strong>provides both description options</strong> for the input fields and adds them to the HTML output.</p>\n<p>You can simply use CSS eg via your theme to show placeholders instead of the labels by adding the following:</p>\n<pre><code>/* widget and overlay: th23 Subscribe - form label/ placeholder */\n.th23-subscribe-visitor-form label[for^=\"th23_subscribe_mail\"],\n.th23-subscribe-visitor-form label[for^=\"th23_subscribe_name\"] {\n    display: none;\n}\n.th23-subscribe-visitor-form input::placeholder {\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I (initially) hide the name and terms field for visitors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is best achieved with a combination of <strong>added CSS and JS to your theme</strong>, assuming that jQuery is available (WP default). By using the following example code the fields will &#8220;slide down&#8221; upon a user focusing on the e-mail field.</p>\n<p>CSS:</p>\n<pre><code>.th23-subscribe-visitor-form .th23-subscribe-name,\n.th23-subscribe-visitor-form .th23-subscribe-terms {\n    display: block;\n    visibility: hidden;\n    opacity: 0;\n    max-height: 0;\n    transition: max-height .5s, visibility .3s, opacity .3s;\n}\n.th23-subscribe-visitor-form .th23-subscribe-name.show,\n.th23-subscribe-visitor-form .th23-subscribe-terms.show {\n    visibility: visible;\n    opacity: 1;\n    max-height: 200px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>JS:</p>\n<pre><code>$('input[name^=\"th23_subscribe_mail\"').focus(function(){\n    $(this).closest('form').find('.th23-subscribe-name, .th23-subscribe-terms').addClass('show');\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>In case you want to see this in action on the <a href=\"https://thorstenhartmann.de/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">authors personal website</a> and <a href=\"https://whereverwetravel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">travel blog</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
