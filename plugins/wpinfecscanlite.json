If there are a lot of files to be scanned, scanning may take several minutes at least, or more than 10 minutes to complete.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20switch%20the%20screen%20during%20scanning%3F'>\nCan I switch the screen during scanning?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Scanning will be stopped, but the files are scanned properly and are recorded up to that point.
