Eagerly, you click the &#8220;Approve it&#8221; link. A new tab opens with a form asking you to log into the administrator area. You input the username and that long long password, click &#8220;Log Me In.&#8221; There, you are welcomed with a silly &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; confirmation message and two buttons: &#8220;Yes I&#8217;m sooooo sure&#8221; and &#8220;No I&#8217;m not sure at all, my $200 mouse was just malfunctioning.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ever felt that it&#8217;s a little too much? Well, if you are that lazy (just like I am), then Lazy Moderator is just for you! Now the notification email will be appended with real &#8220;one-click&#8221; links to help you moderate the comment with just, well, one click. Yes, one click and it&#8217;s done. No login.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this plugin secure? I mean, I don&#8217;t even have to log in to moderate comments? How is this possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, this depends on how &#8220;secure&#8221; you want it to be. Each moderation action is associated with a unique, random, irreversible 40-character long string (called &#8220;token&#8221;). As a blog owner/author, you have these tokens attached in the moderation links, ready for you to use. Now, in order to moderate the comments like you do, another person must make a guess. If he&#8217;s lucky enough to guess a 40-character long string perfectly and successfully hacks into your system, DON&#8217;T SUE HIM! Instead, make friends with him and ask him to buy you some lottery tickets.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s that with all the drawings after moderation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most of them are <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ragecomics/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">rage comics</a>. I like them a lot, so I decided to use them for some personality.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
