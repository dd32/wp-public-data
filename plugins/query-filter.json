Plugin currently allows only to choose Post Type which is public and have archive (relays on archive template when displaying results). It may going to change in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is this weird &#8220;Filtering parameters&#8221; thing? How to deal with it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s YAML representation of filtering parameters, <a href=\"https://github.com/marsjaninzmarsa/WordPress-J-QueryFilter/blob/master/schema.yaml\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">schema for it is in the code</a>, more detailed how-to is on the way. It is going to change in future releases to more user-friendly, drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop visual interface.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>You have AJAX working on your demo, I don&#8217;t, how to live, what to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are developer, you can adapt your Theme to support it, demo code on the way. If you aren&#8217;t and you don&#8217;t understand what happen if you press Ctrl+U, you must hire one for it. It is going to change in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not foo/bar from todo list not in plugin yet?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cause lack of time.
