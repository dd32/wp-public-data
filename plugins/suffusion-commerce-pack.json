        "description": "<p>Suffusion Commerce Pack aims to provide support for common e-commerce plugins in the Suffusion theme. The purpose of this plugin<br />\nis to deliver any template and stylesheet modifications that are needed to get the e-commerce plugins to play nicely with Suffusion.</p>\n<p>Currently the following e-commerce plugins are supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jigoshop/' rel=\"ugc\">Jigoshop</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/' rel=\"ugc\">WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/prospress/' rel=\"ugc\">Prospress</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Support for more plugins will be added in the near future. The one on my radar at this point is WP-ecommerce.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it,<br />\nor by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped<br />\ncontents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Are there any other plugins that you will support apart from the ones listed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I do plan to support the more common and popular plugins so that they work seamlessly with Suffusion.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>But I want my plugin to be supported for Suffusion immediately!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are instructions provided on the settings page for the plugin about how to get any template working with Suffusion.<br />\nThese should help you port any plugin over. Feel free to share your code with me and I can get it added to the core.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a child theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This depends on your e-commerce plugin. Some plugins like Jigoshop or WooCommerce (which is a Jigoshop fork) offer hooks. Where possible<br />\nthe Suffusion Commerce Pack makes use of these hooks, eliminating the need for special template files. However some other plugins such<br />\nas Prospress offer templates that need to be copied over for customization. In such cases you are better off running the Suffusion Commerce<br />\nPack against a child theme. The plugin provides you with appropriate advice either way. If you need a child theme it tells you to create one,<br />\notherwise it goes about its task silently.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any known issues?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin requires a teensy bit of JavaScript in the back-end. For this it uses JQuery. If there is another plugin that includes<br />\nJQuery improperly, then there might be issues getting the plugin to work. This isn&#8217;t a problem with the Commerce Pack, rather it<br />\nis a problem with the plugin that is improperly including JQuery.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
