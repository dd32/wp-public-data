        "description": "<p>Ravatars is a plugin that will generate and assign icons to the visitors leaving comments at your site. The icons are based on email,<br />\nso a given visitor will get the same icon each time they comment.  It is easy to customize the avatars so that they match your site&#8217;s topic or theme. It also makes comment threads easier to follow when people have memorable &#8220;faces.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This plugin is based on Shamus Young&#8217;s Wavatars plugin.</p>\n<p>And a shout out to Gregory Weir for bugfixes. Thanks!</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can customize the avatars your site will display to match your theme. Just upload source images to the<br />\nwp-content/plugins/ravatars/parts directory. Ravatars will create your custom avatars by choosing a random image and then cropping a random<br />\npart of the image</li>\n<li>The icons are generated on-the-fly.  You can adjust the desired size of the icons.</li>\n<li>Easily integrates with avatar enabled themes</li>\n<li>For easy deployment in WordPress pre 2.5, icons will automatically precede the commenter&#8217;s name.  You can set HTML to come directly before and after the<br />\nicon (to put it inside of a &lt;DIV&gt; tag, for example) or you can control the placement of the icons manually if you don&#8217;t mind adding<br />\na single line of PHP to your theme.</li>\n<li>The same email will result in the same Ravatar every time, assuming that the source images don&#8217;t change the same.  If you want avatars that are unique to your site, all you need to do is change the source images.</li>\n<li>This plugin also supports <a href=\"http://site.gravatar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravatars</a>.  If you like, it can show the Gravatar for a given user<br />\n(if available) and fall back on their Ravatar only if they don&#8217;t have a Gravatar set up.  This means users can choose to set up a unique<br />\nicon for themselves, and if they don&#8217;t, they will be assigned a unique Ravatar.  It&#8217;s a system that lets people personalize if<br />\nthey want, yet still provide a decent icon for the lazy or apathetic.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Revision History</h3>\n<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Advanced Tricks</h3>\n<h4>If you get a memory error</h4>\n<p>Image manipulation functions are very memory intensive.  If you get a memory error, try reducing the size of your source images by lowering the resolution or cropping them into smaller parts.  You can also increase PHP&#8217;s memory_limit.</p>\n<h4>Using ravatar_show ()</h4>\n<p>If you place Ravatars by calling ravatar_show () manually, note that you can also specify an optional &#8220;size&#8221; argument to override the<br />\ndefault. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>ravatar_show($comment-&gt;comment_author_email, '160');\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would cause the Ravatar to be 160&#215;160 pixels, even if the default was set to some other value.  You could do this to make admin icons<br />\nlarger, for example.</p>\n<h4>Using ravatar_get ()</h4>\n<p>If ravatar_show () STILL doesn&#8217;t give you enough control, you can call:</p>\n<pre><code>ravatar_get(email, size);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And it will return the URL to the created image without writing anything to the page.</p>\n<h4>Random Ravatar Field</h4>\n<p>Put this code in your theme:</p>\n<pre><code>for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100; $i++)\n    ravatar_show ($i);\n</code></pre>\n<p>It will generate a field of 100 random ravatars, which is cool.  This is how I generated the ravatar screenshot.  It&#8217;s also a great way to quickly<br />\ntest your source images.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://grok-code.com/7/ravatar-wordpress-plugin-for-randam-avatars/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Download</a> the plugin.\n</li>\n<li>Copy it onto your website in the wordpress `/plugins` folder.  Then enable the plugin.  That&#8217;s it. Ravatars will<br />\ninstantly appear for all posts (even old ones) on your blog.  If you don&#8217;t like how the image looks within your theme, read on&#8230;\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To change the source images, replace the files within wp-content/plugins/ravatars/parts with your own images. Supported image types are .jpg and .png.  Its hard to say how many images you should upload.  The minimum for a good set of ravatars is probably around 40, but you will want more if you have a lot of people posting and you want avatars to be unique for everybody. Try to get images with a lot of distinctive elements in them.</p>\n<p>If you are using WordPress 2.5+ you need to have an avatar enabled theme, and ravatars will automatically show up.</p>\n<p>If you are using WordPress pre 2.5, read on for tips on how to position ravatars on your site.</p>\n<p>The administration panel is under Options &raquo; Ravatars.  You can adjust the size of the Ravatars, and assign HTML to come before and<br />\nafter each image to help nudge it into place.  Each image is also set with the CSS &#8220;ravatars&#8221; class, so you can fine-tune the avatar position in your CSS file.</p>\n<p>If that still doesn&#8217;t give you enough control over ravatar placement and you don&#8217;t mind editing your theme, just turn off automatic<br />\nplacement and add the line <code>ravatar_show($comment-&gt;comment_author_email);</code> to your comment loop wherever you want the image to appear.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary.  How it will look depends largely on your current theme.</p>\n<p>Note that the plugin requires that your install of PHP support the GD library.  If it doesn&#8217;t, the Ravatars won&#8217;t show up and you&#8217;ll get<br />\na warning in the Ravatar admin panel.  You can still use this plugin to display Gravatars, even if the GD library isn&#8217;t available.</p>\n"
