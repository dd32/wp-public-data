When a client fills in your Quote Request form, a new quote (or invoice) will automatically be created with all of their details added to the quote.</p>\n<p>You then need to simply add the line items and pricing to the quote and it is then ready to send to the client.</p>\n<p>If the email address that the client fills in is not already linked to a client, the plugin will automatically create a new client with this email.</p>\n<p>You can also set up confirmations and notifications as per normal in the Gravity Forms settings.</p>\n",

To do this, add a List field with 4 columns named something like Qty, Title, Amount, Description (you can name them what you like but they must be in this order). In the Advanced tab of the List field, tick the &#8216;Allow field to be populated dynamically&#8217; box and add &#8216;sliced_line_items&#8217; as the Parameter name (without the quotes).<br />\nNow in the Feed Settings section, you need to map the Line Items field to Line Items (Full) in the dropdown.<br />\nIt will now automatically add a dropdown into the list field with your pre-defined line items.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='using%20product%20fields%20for%20line%20items'>\nUsing Product fields for Line Items\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can also use Gravity Forms&#8217; Product fields as line items, instead of the List field type described above.  To do this, simply check the &#8220;Use Product field(s) for Line Items&#8221; box on the feed settings page.  Sliced Invoices will search your form for all Product fields and add them as line items automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20gravity%20flow'>\nDoes this work with Gravity Flow\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! <a href=\"https://gravityflow.io/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravity Flow</a> is a very powerful addition to Gravity Forms, and fully integrates with Sliced Invoices.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
