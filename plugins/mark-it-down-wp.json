But you will not be able to use the &#8220;Markdown&#8221; module from Jetpack. I would advise that if you need Markdown support, and you also need to use Jetpack, then only use Jetpack only and use its Markdown functionality. Else if you are not a Jetpack user, this plugin is what you need for Markdown support.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why use this plugin instead of Jetpack</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Jetpack is normally a heavy plugin with lots and lots of functionalities which you might not even be using. So if you just need the &#8220;Markdown feature&#8221; of Jetpack, use <em>this</em> plugin only, that is why &#8220;Mark It Down WordPress&#8221; was born for.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will You Supporting This Plugin Actively</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I will. I use this plugin in all my blogs and even for some of my clients. So it&#8217;s in my honest interest to keep this plugin active and supported.
