        "faq": "\n<h4>YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS. WHY WOULD I USE THIS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You want to show someone how to use an application but don’t have the time or the patience to copy/paste screenshots, fumble through a screencast or schedule a screenshare.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>GOT IT BUT WHAT’S SO GREAT ABOUT IT?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With iorad, you can build &amp; share tutorials for any desktop/web application instantly and your learners can take the tutorial in different modes to suit their learning styles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>SOUNDS GOOD. CAN I CHECK IT OUT?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; take our tour on how iorad works. This tutorial was made in just 6 minutes!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>SO HOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you create a new tutorial project in iorad, a capture frame opens up. Iorad captures everything you do inside the frame and then intelligently breaks it into a step-by-step instruction.</p>\n<p>Learners can take the tutorial in either try steps, view steps or print modes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>IT REALLY TAKES JUST MINUTES?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When we developed iorad, we paid attention to just a single metric: how long it takes for you to make a tutorial. That&#8217;s it. We want you in and out. The fact is, you only have 24 hours in a day and you shouldn’t be wasting your time copy/pasting screenshots.</p>\n<p>To keep us honest, you&#8217;ll see we record the amount of time it takes you to make a tutorial. If we notice you’re struggling…it means we have more work to do.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>IS IORAD FREE?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is. All public tutorials are free. We want you to share your knowledge with the world and make it easy for you to do so.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WELL IF IT&#8217;S FREE, HOW DO YOU GUYS MAKE MONEY….ADS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! We offer plans that let you have private tutorials and a custom branded player. Check out our pricing page to view the plans available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>SO IF I USE IORAD, WHO OWNS WHAT I MAKE?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You do. Read our Terms of Service. You own the content you create. You can delete or export your tutorial as a JSON/IMAGE .zip file if you decide to leave.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WHAT DEVICES CAN PEOPLE VIEW THE TUTORIALS ON?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our tutorial player runs in the browser and is optimized for viewing on any mobile, tablet or desktop computer.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>HOW LONG HAS IORAD BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>5 years to help you build a tutorial in minutes. And, yes, it was worth it and we wouldn’t change a thing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WHY SO LONG?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a million different things happening behind the scenes in the app, and each one of those things took a lot of experimentation to get just right. There is still a lot more to do. We are a small team dedicated to improving iorad with every release.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>ONE LAST THING BEFORE I GO, WHAT EXACTLY IS AN IORAD?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>iorad is pronounced eye-oh-rad. We liked it because it was short and easy to spell. It didn&#8217;t mean anything at first and then we reverse engineered the name and came up with Instructional Object Rapid Development…sounds impressive, huh?</p>\n</p>\n\n",
