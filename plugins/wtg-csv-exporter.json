Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p>\n<p>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,<br />\nMINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and<br />\nPATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.<br />\nAdditional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.</p>\n",

However many improvements will be done free.<br />\nPlease post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable<br />\nwithin my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system.
