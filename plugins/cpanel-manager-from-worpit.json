        "faq": "\n<h4>Where can I find my Security Access Key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a secret key/password that YOU CREATE. It protects and restricts access to your cPanel username/password.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it secure to have my cPanel login credentials in my WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Normally, no. But with version 1.1 of the plugin, if you have the &#8216;mcrypt&#8217; PHP library available on your web hosting<br />\nyour cPanel credentials will always be encrypted before being stored in your WordPress database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t have the &#8216;mcrypt&#8217; PHP extensions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will have a permanent notice on the plugin&#8217;s admin pages telling you of this. The plugin will function as normal<br />\nbut your details will not be encrypted.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the Security Access Key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is basically an encryption salt/password. We use this to encrypt and decrypt your cPanel username and password.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I forget the Security Access Key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply click the orange &#8216;Reset&#8217; button on the plugin&#8217;s security page. This will delete the current security access key,<br />\nthe stored cpanel username and the stored cpanel password.</p>\n<p>You will then need to supply a new Security Access Key (as you would have at the beginning) before adding any new cPanel information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the CONFIRM box all about?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As you can imagine with great power comes great responsibility. This plugin lets you delete databases and users in bulk.</p>\n<p>So, before I can let you do that, you must type in the word CONFIRM exactly as it is, in capital letters, each time you want<br />\nto perform a task. If you don&#8217;t, the task will fail.</p>\n<p>This is a small protection against accidental clicks etc. If you accidently delete all your databases and<br />\nyou want to blame someone, you know that it could only have been done by typing CONFIRM and submitting the task. There&#8217;s NO<br />\nway around this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I undo my delete of databases and users?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No!</p>\n<p>Use the MySQL database delete and MySQL user delete functionality with GREAT CARE. You are wholly responsible for any mess you create.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is all the documentation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The cPanel Manager is very easy to use right now because there isn&#8217;t much functionality.</p>\n<p>But, documentation is coming. I wanted to get this work out to the public first, <a href=\"http://www.icontrolwp.com/help-support/?src=wporg\" title=\"iControlWP: Manage Muliple WordPress Sites Better\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get feedback</a><br />\nand then move on from there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you make any other plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we created the only <a href=\"http://www.icontrolwp.com/wordpress-twitter-bootstrap-css-plugin-home/\" title=\"Twitter Bootstrap WordPress Plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter Bootstrap WordPress</a><br />\nplugin with over 20,000 downloads so far.</p>\n<p>We also created the <a href=\"http://www.icontrolwp.com/?src=wporg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Manage Multiple WordPress Site Better Tool: iControlWP</a> for people with multiple WordPress sites to manage.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
