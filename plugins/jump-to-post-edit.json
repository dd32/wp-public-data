Feel free to customize the color-scheme, etc. to your liking!</p>\n<p>11/28/2012:  Version 1.0.1 &#8211; Updated plugin to fix problems occurring upon Posts being saved.<br />\n            ~ Custom Meta info was being altered.<br />\n            ~ My apologies.<br />\n            ~ &#8220;Jump to &#8211; Post Edit&#8221; will use a Custom Meta Field, jump_to_post_edit.<br />\n            ~ Because the selection of an option from the &#8220;Jump to &#8211; Post Edit&#8221; list does not actually require data to be saved to the current Post, the value of the Custom Meta Key &#8216;jump_to_post_edit&#8217; does not need to be altered.</p>\n<p>11/24/2012:  Version 1.0 submission to WordPress.org</p>\n"
