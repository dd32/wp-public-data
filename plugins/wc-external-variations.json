This plugin allows you to define an external<br />\nURL on any variation and will then open that link when the user<br />\nclicks on the <em>Add To Cart</em> button. Because the Javascript is used for this,<br />\nany adding to cart that is done via the backend such as with APIs will not<br />\nredirect properly.</p>\n<p>Note that as of 03/2023 this plugin is not longer under active development.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode support</h4>\n<p>This plugin provides two shortcodes that you can use within your site:<br />\n1. [wcev_product_attr] &#8211; allows you to display an product attribute, use the &#8220;name&#8221; attribute to find the right attribute.<br />\n2. [wcev_var_field] &#8211; allows you to display a custom field, attribute or data element for a variation, use the &#8220;id&#8221; attribute to point to the right field.<br />\nThe order of precendence is as follows: custom fields, attributes, then data elements.<br />\n3. [wcev_var_postdate] &#8211; displays the formatted post date and time for a variation, doesn&#8217;t take attributes.</p>\n<h4>External SKU and status fields</h4>\n<p>In addition to the external URL field, a second field called &#8220;External SKU&#8221; is provided for each variation.<br />\nYou can set this field and then use the provided shortcode to display it.<br />\nThe purpose is to track the external SKU separately from the internal one.</p>\n<p>There is now ability to specify the &#8216;Add to Button&#8217; text in a specific variation. If the global setting is set, the variation-specific field will override it.</p>\n<h4>Settings</h4>\n<p>To change settings, go to WooCommerce Settings -&gt; Products -&gt; External Variations. The following are available:<br />\n* Ability to change if links open in new or same window<br />\n* Ability to change if links open when the &#8216;Add to Cart&#8217; button is clicked or when the variation is selected<br />\n* Ability to override the &#8216;Add to Cart&#8217; button text for all external variations</p>\n<h4>More Details</h4>\n<p>Please note that this plugin has only been tested in a vanilla WordPress / WooCommerce<br />\ninstallation without any other plugins. If you have other plugins that modify<br />\nthe functionality of the <em>Add to Cart</em> button, this plugin may not work or<br />\ncause unintended consequences.</p>\n<p>Source code for this plugin can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/impossibledreams/wc-external-variations\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a></p>\n<p>You can find this plugin at <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-external-variations/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org</a></p>\n<h3>Known Issues</h3>\n<p>When the number of variations exceeds 30, the plugin stops working. This is due<br />\nto a WooCommerce limit and can be bypassed by using a filter as described here:<br />\nhttps://docs.woocommerce.com/document/change-limit-on-number-of-variations-for-dynamic-variable-product-dropdowns/</p>\n",
