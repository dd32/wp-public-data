        "description": "<p>Big Mailchimp WordPress Plugin</p>\n<p>WordPress is a web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog.  MailChimp is a powerful tool to have in your marketing arsenal. The basic definition of MailChimp is that it is an email marketing tool. However, it is more than just that. According to MailChimp more than 6 million use it to create, send and track email newsletters. MailChimp helps you design email newsletters, share them on social networks, integrate with services you already use, and track your results. Now, we have combined the power of these two amazing products through a WordPress plugin, called Big MailChimp, to make them work seamlessly together.</p>\n<p>Introducing Big MailChimp WordPress Plugin</p>\n<p>We have developed the Big MailChimp plugin for WordPress to enable users to host their MailChimp capture forms on their own WordPress site without any effort and programming. Moreover, you can display your MailChimp forms in your site’s content or widget areas. This plugin’s design prioritizes customizations and usability. You are in control of how MailChimp forms are displayed. However, you need not to alter any options. Big MailChimp is designed to work out of the box with your site, using your site’s styling.</p>\n<p>Big MailChimp is extremely simple to use. You will need two components from MailChimp, an API key and a List ID. The API key is used to communicate with your MailChimp account. The List ID is used to retrieve your intended list’s properties. Once you create your list and configure your email capture form, you can use the API key and the List ID to add the list to your site. Then you can add the capture form to any page, post or widget area. You can include multiple forms on a single page. Changes to your MailChimp lists will take effect on your website instantly.</p>\n<p>Big MailChimp uses the latest MailChimp APIs (currently v. 2.0). It allows you to display only required fields as indicated when configuring your form on MailChimp. We have added this option to allow you to show a minimized version of your form to maximize conversion rates. Of course, you can display the entire form as needed. Big MailChimp also allows you to enable/disable the double opt-in option. This option is only available through the API.</p>\n<p>Download Big MailChimp from WordPress Repository and let’s start.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to use interface</li>\n<li>Uses the latest MailChimp API</li>\n<li>Generates capture forms based on MailChimp lists</li>\n<li>Easily host your capture forms on your site</li>\n<li>Display multiple forms</li>\n<li>Double opt-in option</li>\n<li>Display forms in pages or posts</li>\n<li>Display forms as widgets</li>\n<li>Shortcode generator</li>\n<li>Supplied with two layouts</li>\n<li>Option to extend form layout to match your site’s markup</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Form more information visit the <a href=\"http://bigemployee.com/projects/big-mailchimp-wordpress-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin&#8217;s page</a></p>\n",
