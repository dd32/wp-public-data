You now can join this important effort.</p>\n<p>EcoMatcher (www.ecomatcher.com) enables any company using WooCommerce to integrate tree planting into their cart; your customers can now add trees to their cart, and upon check out, will get all details of all trees planted. Details like location, date of planting, type of tree, and even the planter. We offer with our vetted tree-planting partners from around the world full transparency. The customer can virtually travel to every tree using satellite maps and learn more. And the other great thing? You can make money by selling trees.</p>\n<p>Upon installing “EcoMatcher“ plugin, automatically the ‘PLANT A TREE’ button will be added to your cart; once your customer selects the button, a tree will be added to their cart, one tree at the time.
