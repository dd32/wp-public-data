        "changelog": "<h3>1.0.3</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cleaned up some styling.  Removed debug statements.</li>\n<li>Fixed issue with WPEngine quick links in admin bar not showing up.  </li>\n<li>Added VForce Settings quick link to admin bar.</li>\n<li>Added Association ID to VForce settings quick links.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.0.2</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Formassembly integration.  Added the ability to customize the message show at the top of the page when a user is reviewing their form submission.  This can currently be accessed by checking the &#8220;Show Formassembly Settings&#8221; checkbox in the right sidebar while editing a post or page.  Note* currently you will need to reload the page to see the new Formassembly Form Settings section.  It will appear below your page/post.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug with Formidable forms not submitting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.0.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Formassembly integration.  Now you can simply insert the <code>[vforce_form formid='id']</code> shortcode into a page or post.  If you have issues with the form displaying, make sure that the id is in single qoutes.  The server url defaults to https://virtual.tfaforms.net.  You can change this under VForce Settings-&gt;Formassembly Settings.  This plugin will not override or interfere with the official Formassembly plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed Plugin update checker</li>\n<li>Submitted to WordPress Plugins Repo</li>\n<li>Added ACF dependency to allow for adding an Association ID override metabox to all pages/posts.</li>\n<li>All pages/posts now have an Association ID override box.  By default this box is empty.  There is a hook that runs just before each page is loaded.  This function is in the main plugin file.  It checks to see if a value has been set in the override box.  If so, it will use the value in the override meta box as the global association id, if not it will use the default site wide Association ID/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>// This function runs just before the requested page is loaded<br />\nadd_action(&#8216;template_redirect&#8217;, &#8216;vforce_hook_before_page_load&#8217;);<br />\nfunction vforce_hook_before_page_load(){<br />\n  $vforce_helper = get_option(&#8216;vforce_helper&#8217;);</p>\n<pre><code>wp_enqueue_script( 'init-global', plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ ) .
