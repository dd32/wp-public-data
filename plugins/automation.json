Kindly <a href=\"https://www.satollo.net/about\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact me</a> with as many information as possible (logs, screenshots, and so on).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20understand%20this%20or%20that'>\nI don&#8217;t understand this or that\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Kindly <a href=\"https://www.satollo.net/about\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact me</a> so I can help and update the documentation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='no%20emails%20are%20sent'>\nNo emails are sent\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the blog can send emails (for example the password recovery email), try to empty the sender name and email on the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t use email addresses like @gmail.com, @yahoo.com, &#8230;, since your server is not allowed to send in behalf of those providers.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using an SMTP plugin, run some tests from that plugin.</p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-logging/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Mail Logging</a> to check if emails are generated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='delayed%20emails%20are%20not%20sent%20in%20time'>\nDelayed emails are not sent in time\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A few hours of tolerance is acceptable if your blog has not enough traffic and no custom scheduler trigger has been setup: the internal WP scheduler depends on those factors.</p>\n<p>Check the Tools/Site Health panel for warning like &#8220;a job has failed to start&#8221; and contact the provider to<br />\ndeal with the problem and setup a cron trigger for WP (there is a lot of literature about this issue, they know what it means).</p>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/plugins/wp-crontrol/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Crontrol</a> to check the status of the WordPress scheduler.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='emails%20do%20not%20look%20good%20on%20outlook%2C%20gmail%2C%20...'>\nEmails do not look good on Outlook, Gmail, &#8230;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I do my best to create fully compatible emails, but clients, especially Outlook and Gmail used to read non<br />\nGoogle mail accounts, have a lot of limitation. Anyway, send us a screenshot using my<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.satollo.net/about\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact page</a>, we&#8217;re more than happy to check and solve the problem, is possible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20text%20part%20for%20emails%3F'>\nIs there a text part for emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently emails are only in HTML.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20the%20composer%20is%20so%20simple%3F'>\nWhy the composer is so simple?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In my option a welcome email needs to be simple and clear, easy readable on mobile devices and with immediate calls to action.<br />\nAnd&#8230; is was extracted from the original project I&#8217;ve no resources to make it more complex right now (smile).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20users%20unsubscribe%20from%20emails%3F'>\nCan users unsubscribe from emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this is not a mail marketing or newsletter system, but a small series of transactional emails you want to send after a user action.<br />\nIn other words, that is not a service to which one can decide to subscribe or unsubscribe (anyway I&#8217;m open to discuss a possible evolution).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20track%20opens%20and%20clicks%3F'>\nIs it possible to track opens and clicks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this feature is not present.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20api%20to%20integrate%20this%20plugin%20with%20others%3F'>\nAre there API to integrate this plugin with others?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now there are no official API, but I have plans to add API to register custom events and<br />\nprobably custom composer blocks.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
