        "faq": "<p>Question: Is Advanced Pins compatible with my other Pinterest plugins?</p>\n<p>Answer<br />\nAdvanced Pins may work with your other Pinterest plugins, depending on how they affect the DOM (the images on your page). If the other plugin touches the <code>data-pin-description</code> or other data-attributes, then there may be Block Editor errors when both plugins are active.</p>\n<p>However, if your other plugins do not touch images, then you can have them both running side by side!</p>\n",
