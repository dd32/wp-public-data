        "description": "<p>Many customers in Canada prefer to pay for the merchandise they buy, by e-Transfer (formerly Email Money Transfer).</p>\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>If customers choose the secret question and answer by themselves, they have to call to inform you what the Q&amp;A are. Or they have the option to send them by Email. The other option is you give everybody a static question and answer.</p>\n<p>In both cases, if a third party, or a hacker, gain access to the username &amp; password of your Email, he/she can deposit the funds to any account he wants, and there is no way to cancel the transaction.</p>\n<p>So, this plugin creates a random word which can be used as an answer to the quetion. In this case, whoever has the access to your Email box, is not going to figure out what the answer to the question is. Unless he/she hacks the backend of the website as well as your Email box.</p>\n<h4>How To use this plugin:</h4>\n<p>In the &#8216;Email Transfer payment gateway&#8217; in the WooCommerce Settings, there is a field named &#8216;Instructions&#8217;. Whatever you enter in that field will be shown to the user in the &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page after placing an order, and also in the Email.</p>\n<p>You must provide an Email for customers, so you can receive the instructions to retrieve the funds they send.</p>\n<p>Also you should keep two placeholders which are {1} and {2}.</p>\n<p>{1} will be replaced by Order Number. Customers should be encouraged to mention their order number in the secret question they send</p>\n<p>{2} will be replaced by a randomly generated 6-character long word. Customers are encouraged to use that word as the answer to the secret question.</p>\n<p>An &#8216;Order note&#8217; will be added to the order, containing this randow word, so upon retrieving the funds, you will know what the answer to the secret question of each order is.</p>\n<p>An Instruction can be something like this:</p>\n<p>After placing your order, please send an Email money transfer to the following:</p>\n<p>Email: xxx@yyy.com</p>\n<p>Secret Question: Your Order Number {1}</p>\n<p>Secret Answer: {2} (MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT REMOVE THESE TWO {1} and {2})</p>\n<p>Thanks for choosing us! We appreciate your business.</p>\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n<p>Translators who did a great job converting the text of the plugin to their native language. Thank you!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pagup.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mr. Gautier Dorval</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;woocommerce-email-money-transfer-gateway&#8217; folder to the &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Visit &#8216;WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; Payments -&gt; Email Transfer, and modify the instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20email%20money%20transfer%20works%3F'>\nHow Email Money Transfer works?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An e-Transfer resembles an e-check in many respects. The money is not actually transferred by e-mail. Only the instructions to retrieve the funds are.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The sender opens an online banking session and chooses the recipient, the amount to send, as well as a security question and answer. The funds are debited instantly, usually for a surcharge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An e-mail or text message is then sent to the recipient, with instructions on how to retrieve the funds and answer the question, via a secure website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The recipient must answer the security question correctly. (If the recipient fails to answer the question correctly after three tries, then the funds will automatically be returned to sender.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the recipient is subscribed to online banking at one of the participating institutions, the funds are deposited instantly at no extra charge.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20the%20answer%20to%20the%20secret%20question%20is%20not%20shown%20to%20the%20buyer%3F'>\nWhy the Answer to the Secret Question is not shown to the buyer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can modify the instructions shown to the buyer the way you would like. But make sure you leave two placeholders of {1} and {2}, so the plugin can replace them later with order number and the randomly generated answer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20what%20question%20and%20answer%20is%20sent%20to%20the%20buyer%3F'>\nHow do I know what question and answer is sent to the buyer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the buyer mentions the order number in the question, you would know who is sending the fund. The answer sent to the buyer can be found in the order page, as the first order note.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

In this release, if a customer creates a user account, the secret answer is saved in his profile, and for all the future orders that answer is shown.<br />\nThe answer to the secret question can be modified in the user profile page.<br />\nAlso the priority of payment instructions is changed, so it is shown before order details.</p>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<p>Changed the status of the order to &#8220;On Hold&#8221;</p>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<p>Changed the status of the order from &#8220;Processing&#8221; to &#8220;Pending Payment&#8221;, so the order is not included in Woocommerce report for sales, before payment.</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed the thankyou_page code to show instructions only if this payment method is selected.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed a bug. Apparently, in presence of other plugins, this plugin was called before woocommerce was instantiated. So I just added a few lines to check if WC()-&gt;session exists.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First Release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
