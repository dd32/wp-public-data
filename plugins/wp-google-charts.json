Adding charts, diagrams and tables is a simple and flexible way to make complex data accessible and spice up your posts.<br />\nWhat can you do with WP Google Charts<br />\nWP Google Charts lets you determine the type and size of your charts and diagrams using simple shortcode. It simply looks good, is free to use and saves you the hassle and restrictions of using Google&#8217;s embed code.</p>\n<p>Using Google Spreadsheets may be better than using any proprietary solutions for your WordPress. Your data remains portable, that is, when you move away from WordPress (or even change your theme) you can still use it.
