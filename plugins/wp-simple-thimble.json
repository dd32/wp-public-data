What is the cause?</h4>\n<p>Right now the project this plugin depends on https://github.com/aadel112/simple-thimble only handles images/css/js files, and it only handles resources      found directly in the document. Furthermore, this plugin only handles js and css files that are properly enqueued. These are issues that will be remedied in future releases.</p>\n"
