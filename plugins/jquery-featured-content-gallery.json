If I need extra features in the future I will add them and if I have any spare time I will add features that people request or I think would be good.  If you think you can help with the coding, it&#8217;s open source, hack away to add those features and tell me what you&#8217;ve done so we can all improve this plugin.  I would be happy to mention your name/website in this readme document.  Indeed, if you feel you could improve this readme, please do ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
