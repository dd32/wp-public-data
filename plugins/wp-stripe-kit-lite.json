        "faq": "\n<h4>Where&#8217;s your plugin documentation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Find our docs at <a href=\"https://www.lonhosford.com/wp-stripe-kit-lite\" title=\"WP Stripe Kit Lite Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Stripe Kit Lite Docs</a> webpage.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I collect a product id?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This is an optional data point that you can add to each single item checkout button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I collect shipping information?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin uses the Stripe checkout process to collect name, address, city, state and postal code.  You can use your<br />\n<a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com\" title=\"Stripe Dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Dashboard</a> to retrieve the shipping information collected during the customer checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is collecting shipping information optional?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Shipping information is an optional item for each checkout button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the checkout button label?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Every checkout button can have a unique label.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add quantites?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Each single item checkout button allows you to include the price and optionally a quanitity. The default quantity is 1. The total is computed for checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are sales or VAT taxes computed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You need to include these taxes in the price.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the checkout button styling?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We use the <a href=\"http://www.bestcssbuttongenerator.com\" title=\"Best CSS Button Generator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Best CSS Button Generator</a>. You can copy the CSS properties and paste to try different button styles. We also provide a way to restore the original button CSS as a fallback if you do not want to keep your changes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have multiple payment buttons on a single page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I test without using real payment cards?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can set the plugin to test mode and your <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com\" title=\"Stripe Dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Dashboard</a> will show all the transactions in the test mode view. Stripe offers valid and fail testing card numbers. See <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards\" title=\"Stripe Testing Card Numbers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Testing Card Numbers</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I fulfill orders?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You use the Stripe dashboard to retrieve payment, email and shipping information collected during checkout for your order or service fulfillment. Stripe offers <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/integrations\" title=\"Stripe Integrations\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Integrations</a> that can pass data to email services like Mailchimp and shipping services like EasyPost.</p>\n<p>You also can use Stripe to export the data so you can use it in spreadsheets or import it into other software.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this a shopping cart?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is not a shopping cart. You can create checkout buttons for single purchases of one or a bundle of products and services.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this to make my WordPress website a subscription service?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin allows you to accept payments for subscription plans you set up in Stripe. Stripe then handles the recurring billing. This does not integrate the Stripe subscription plan with your WordPress and it does not capture login information for memberships.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I make changes to a payment or issue refunds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use your <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com\" title=\"Stripe Dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Dashboard</a> to make changes to the payment and issue refunds. Changes to the payment are based on the Stripe terms of service.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the customer get a receipt?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can configure customer receipts in the Stripe dashboard. They are sent via email.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know when a payment is made?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can configure your Stripe account to send you notifications of completed transactions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What currencies are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Multiple currencies are available. See the <a href=\"https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-currencies-does-stripe-support\" title=\"Which currencies does Stripe support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Currency FAQ</a>. You can set each single order checkout button to currencies that Stripe supports. When you create subscription plans in your <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com\" title=\"Stripe Dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Dashboard</a> you set the currency for the plan.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the system requirements?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Stripe requires (Transport Layer Security) TLS 1.2 for pages excepting live transactions. This means that they should start with https://. This is traditionally know as (Secure Socket Layer) SSL. Your web hosting service can configure TSL 1.2 on  your website for an annual recurring fee.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PHP 5.5 or higher is recommended for optimal security and customer confidence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You need a <a href=\"http://www.stripe.com\" title=\"Stripe Account\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Account</a>. Its free to get.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The term &#8220;SSL&#8221; continues to be used colloquially when referring to TLS. In either case its function is to protect transmitted data which is great news for your customer&#8217;s security.</p>\n<p>TLS 1.2 is needed to meet the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) PCI-DSS which is also great news for your customer&#8217;s security.</p>\n<p>If you do not have TLS 1.2 installed for your website, you can immediately start using this plugin to create checkout pages in a test mode. Then you can switch to live mode payment processing without any changes to your checkout pages.</p>\n<p>Overwhelmed with acronyms and technology?
