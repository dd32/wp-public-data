If you have a modeal on the webpage you want to install this calculator on, either your modal or the calculator&#8217;s modal may not work.</li>\n<li>Website developers can set a default currency sign and preferred date format by setting &lt;op/sc&gt;_currency and &lt;op/sc&gt;_date_mask respectively. Set one or both to an integer value. For the list of integers to support 90 plus currency symbols and 6 date format options, see the file <strong>currency_and_date_conventions.txt</strong> in the plugin&#8217;s root folder. (example: India, Indian Rupee: ₹1,23,45,678.99 = 83)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Enhanced Internationalization</em></p>\n<p>Support for over 90 currency signs (using appropriate nummber formatting conventions) and 6 date formats (mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy.mm.dd etc.). If neither the website developer or the user makes a selection, the calculator will read the browser&#8217;s default currency and date options and automatically use them. Without doing anything, a website visitor from Japan visiting a website hosted in France will initially see a floating yen sign. The website developer can easily override this default behavior by setting either shortcodes or function options. The user (if the website designer keeps the feature enabled) can override both and select a currency and date format.</p>\n<p><em>To summarize, the plugin determines what currency symbol (and date format) to use by applying the following rules:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a website allows a user to select a symbol, and the user makes a selection, the plugin uses the visitor&#8217;s choice first.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if a user has not made a selection, and the website owner has set a default currency (i.e., currency does not equal 999), the calculator uses the website&#8217;s selection.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the calculator plugin will attempt to read the browser&#8217;s currency default and pick a currency symbol.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the plugin defaults to using the &#8216;$&#8217; symbol.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Language Translations</em></p>\n<p>New in v1.5, support for 14 languages in addition to English. The plugin also includes a translation template file (.POT) in the &#8220;languages&#8221; folder. Using a POT/PO file editor, website owners can translate this plugin to any language supported by WordPress.</p>\n<p>The supported languages are:</p>\n<p>da :  Danish : Dansk<br />\nnl :  Dutch : Nederlandse<br />\nfi :  Finnish : Suomalainen<br />\nfr :  French : Français<br />\nde :  German : Deutsch<br />\nhu :  Hungarian : Magyar<br />\nit :  Italian : Italiano<br />\nlt :  Lithuanian : Lietuvių<br />\npl :  Polish : Polski<br />\npt :  Portuguese : Português<br />\nro :  Romanian : Românesc<br />\nru :  Russian : Русский<br />\nes :  Spanish : Español<br />\nsv :  Swedish : Svenska</p>\n<p>Notes: (1) The plugin depends on the site&#8217;s &#8220;Site Language&#8221; setting to display to your visitors the correct language. The files in the language folder can be renamed if needed. For example, if you want the plug to display in Portuguese the .MO and .JSON files include assume your site&#8217;s language setting is Portuguese (Portugal) which is local pt_PT. But if your site is in Brazil, you&#8217;ll need to rename the plugin&#8217;s language files to use pt_BR. (2) At this time, these translations were computer generated. A fluent speaker can edit the included .PO file and regenerate the .MO file to update the tranlation. (3) If you are willing to allow me to include your edits with the plugin, I&#8217;ll regenerate the .MO, and if needed the .JSON files for you.</p>\n<p>I am making the other calculators at my website available free-of-charge to bloggers who are abe to help with translation. See the website for details.</p>\n<p><em>Support</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to offer support for all my plugins.

        "faq": "<p><strong>Can the Mortgage Calculator plugin be used on a commercial website?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I would be honored. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Also, if you happen to be a financial blogger, I would encourage you to add a &#8220;Calculators&#8221; or &#8220;Tools&#8221; section to your site and include all my calculators. More content equals more opportunity. I expect to have six free plugins by early 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Does your plugin have any embedded advertising?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely not.</p>\n<p><strong>Is your plugin self contained?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. 100% of the plugin is installed on your server. There are no external dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the plugin include any backlinks?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not by default. If you decide to brand the calculator with your brand and / or set the <em>add_link</em> option to <em>Yes</em>, one discreet link is added to my site. (User will not know there is a link unless their mouse passes over it.) The link is around the copyright in the lower left. 🙂</p>\n<p><strong>Is the calculator plugin responsive?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, I use it on a Bootstrap responsive site.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the calculator support touch devices?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Users use the calculator with all types of devices. (A previous issue with some Android devices is fixed.)</p>\n<p><strong>Do you offer other calculator plugins?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I have a conventional <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fc-loan-calculator/\" rel=\"ugc\">Loan Calculator</a> hosted in this directory. And here is my <a href=\"https://AccurateCalculators.com/calculator-plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">widgets and plugin</a> page where you&#8217;ll find other free plugins as well as some &#8220;plus&#8221; versions which are free for a limited time only.</p>\n<p><strong>I like your plugin and I&#8217;d like to contribute something but I notice you don&#8217;t have a link for contributions, why not?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. That&#8217;s very kind of you. Actually, you can contribute, and it won&#8217;t cost you a cent. Please stop by my <a href=\"https://AccurateCalculators.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a> and check it out. In addition to providing some very advanced calculators, I think that I&#8217;m the only one that hosts a public question and answer site to provide support for their calculators. Take a look, and if you like what you see, please spread the word. That&#8217;s better than any monetary compensation.</p>\n<p><strong>The plugin version indicates it is new. Can I trust it?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. While this is a new plugin, the calculator has been used on my site for years. It has been used by literally 100,000&#8217;s of users. Any issues you might encounter would most likely be around installing it on a site. Should you run into an problem, I&#8217;m happy to help resolve it.</p>\n",

If you set the option to &#8220;Yes&#8221; without making any changes, the calculator will change to a horrendous red which indicates the custom css is being used.</li>\n<li>The plugin is built and tested on HTML5/CSS3 pages.</li>\n<li>size (max-width): large: 440px, medium: 340px, small: 290px, tiny: 150px</li>\n<li>The modal dialog that allows users to select a default currency and date format is NOT compatible with some other dialogs. If you have a modeal on the webpage you want to install this calculator on, either your modal or the calculator&#8217;s modal may not work.</li>\n<li>Website developers can set a default currency sign and preferred date format by setting &lt;op/sc&gt;_currency and &lt;op/sc&gt;_date_mask respectively. Set one or both to an integer value. For the list of integers to support 90 plus currency symbols and 6 date format options, see the file <strong>currency_and_date_conventions.txt</strong> in the plugin&#8217;s root folder. (example: India, Indian Rupee: ₹1,23,45,678.99 = 83)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Enhanced Internationalization</em></p>\n<p>Support for over 90 currency signs (using appropriate nummber formatting conventions) and 6 date formats (mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy.mm.dd etc.). If neither the website developer or the user makes a selection, the calculator will read the browser&#8217;s default currency and date options and automatically use them. Without doing anything, a website visitor from Japan visiting a website hosted in France will initially see a floating yen sign. The website developer can easily override this default behavior by setting either shortcodes or function options. The user (if the website designer keeps the feature enabled) can override both and select a currency and date format.</p>\n<p><em>To summarize, the plugin determines what currency symbol (and date format) to use by applying the following rules:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a website allows a user to select a symbol, and the user makes a selection, the plugin uses the visitor&#8217;s choice first.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if a user has not made a selection, and the website owner has set a default currency (i.e., currency does not equal 999), the calculator uses the website&#8217;s selection.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the calculator plugin will attempt to read the browser&#8217;s currency default and pick a currency symbol.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the plugin defaults to using the &#8216;$&#8217; symbol.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Language Translations</em></p>\n<p>New in v1.5, support for 14 languages in addition to English. The plugin also includes a translation template file (.POT) in the &#8220;languages&#8221; folder. Using a POT/PO file editor, website owners can translate this plugin to any language supported by WordPress.</p>\n<p>The supported languages are:</p>\n<p>da :  Danish : Dansk<br />\nnl :  Dutch : Nederlandse<br />\nfi :  Finnish : Suomalainen<br />\nfr :  French : Français<br />\nde :  German : Deutsch<br />\nhu :  Hungarian : Magyar<br />\nit :  Italian : Italiano<br />\nlt :  Lithuanian : Lietuvių<br />\npl :  Polish : Polski<br />\npt :  Portuguese : Português<br />\nro :  Romanian : Românesc<br />\nru :  Russian : Русский<br />\nes :  Spanish : Español<br />\nsv :  Swedish : Svenska</p>\n<p>Notes: (1) The plugin depends on the site&#8217;s &#8220;Site Language&#8221; setting to display to your visitors the correct language. The files in the language folder can be renamed if needed. For example, if you want the plug to display in Portuguese the .MO and .JSON files include assume your site&#8217;s language setting is Portuguese (Portugal) which is local pt_PT. But if your site is in Brazil, you&#8217;ll need to rename the plugin&#8217;s language files to use pt_BR. (2) At this time, these translations were computer generated. A fluent speaker can edit the included .PO file and regenerate the .MO file to update the tranlation. (3) If you are willing to allow me to include your edits with the plugin, I&#8217;ll regenerate the .MO, and if needed the .JSON files for you.</p>\n<p>I am making the other calculators at my website available free-of-charge to bloggers who are abe to help with translation. See the website for details.</p>\n<p><em>Support</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to offer support for all my plugins.
