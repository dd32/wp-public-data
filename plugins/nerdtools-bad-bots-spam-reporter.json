        "faq": "<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>When a comment is classed as spam the authors IP address is sent anonymously to a secure server which gets processed and gains more information about the geographic location allowing us to build patterns and stay one step ahead of spammers.</p>\n<h4>How do I benefit from this?</h4>\n<p>Apart from feeling good knowing you&#8217;re doing your bit for fighting spam? The information collected can be used with a further plugin called NerdTools Bad Bots Spam Defender which automatically checks each comment to see if it has been posted by a known spammer. This is a plugin which needs to be installed seperatley, for more information please see http://www.nerdtools.co.uk/badbots/.</p>\n<h4>Are there any stats I can view?</h4>\n<p>Yes, on the plugins settings page you will find the IP address and time of the last report, along with the total amount of reports submitted and an overview about the database. More detailed information can be found at http://www.nerdtools.co.uk/badbots/.</p>\n<h4>I made a comment spam without realising, will it be reported?</h4>\n<p>Yes it will, however the Bad Bots system has been designed to detect patterns in usage and more specifically mistakes like this. In simple terms if its a one off report then you have nothing to worry about. Our system will only pick up on genuine spam bots when certain patterns are matched.</p>\n",
