For example if your cat id is 5, then single-5.php should do the job. Also make sure the file resides on the theme&#8217;s root directory, that is alongisde its fellow single.php.</p>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t help, try enabling WP_DEBUG on your wp-config.php and read the errors. If any problems show up, either post them on the support forums and I&#8217;ll do my best to help, or see what you can do to solve it.</p>\n",
