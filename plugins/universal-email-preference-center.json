        "installation": "<p>After installing the plugin, be sure to navigate to the Settings-&gt;Universal email preference center page and input your ActiveCampaign or Iterable Url and API Key. You can find your API url and key by visiting https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/207317590-Getting-started-with-the-API. Your Iterable URL will be https://api.iterable.com.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have several lists, but I only want to show a couple of them. Can I hide various lists?<br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but only with the Premium version of this plugin. With the Premium version, you can toggle on and off each of the lists you want to show in the email preference center.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can I style the email preference center to match my theme?<br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, I purposely did not include any styles with this plugin to make it utilize your theme&#8217;s built-in styles. If you navigate to the settings page, at the bottom, I have included some basic styles that you could add to your additional CSS section of Appearance-&gt;Customize.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> I really wish this plugin did X. Do you offer customizations?<br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, please reach out and let me know what feature you wish this plugin had. I might add it to the roadmap if I think it would benefit everyone, or we could discuss the possibility of custom development for your specific case. Please add a feature request at https://wpressapi.com.</p>\n",
