        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>/sp-random-hello-bar/</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>SP Random Hello Bar</strong> section of the <em>Settings</em> menu. At <code>example.com</code> this page would be found at <code>http://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=sp-random-hello-bar</code>.</li>\n<li>Enable the hello bar to display in pages.</li>\n<li>Select which javascript, if any, you would like to enqueue.</li>\n<li>Select if you would like to enqueue basic css styles fror the hello bar.</li>\n<li>Enter content for one or more hello bars and set a weighting.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I use the javascript module without npm?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. The plugin contains the SpHelloBar source as an ES6 Module at <code>src/js/SpHelloBar.js</code> and as a common.js module at <code>lib/SpHelloBar.js</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the javascript require other libraries such as jQuery to function?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SpHelloBar module does not have any external dependencies but it would then be up to you to provide a throttle function and to load the hello bar content into the page (usually via ajax).<br />\nHowever the Basic and Basic with storage scripts assume that jquery and underscore have been enqueued. Those two libraries are enqueued in the default setup of WordPress unless you have dequeued them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customise the content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go for it. The basic scripts assume the default css class names are being used but the only one that is required is <code>.SpHelloBar</code>.<br />\nThe javascript has been designed to be as flexible as possible so see the <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint/sp-random-hello-bar#constructor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">docs</a> for all the options that can be overridden<br />\nwhen writing your own script.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How did you build something so wonderful?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad you asked. You can read about how it was put together on <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-random-hello-bar-wordpress-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SitePoint</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
