To do an automatic installation of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type “WooCommerce – Hatton National Bank Payment Gateway” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n",

This is a hard requirement, and we are strict about this requirement.

Double-check your Acquirer and Merchant IDs. You also need to make sure the site is accessible over public internet and is served with HTTPS.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20contribute%3F'>\nHow do I contribute?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please head over to <a href=\"https://github.com/Ayesh/wordpress-woocommerce-hnb\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>.
