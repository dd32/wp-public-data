        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat is it for ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Satoshi is crypto-currency, therefore it is money, and some people need satoshi for various things, like<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-bitcoin-faucets/\" rel=\"ugc\">rewarding visitors</a>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-instant-bitcoin/\" rel=\"ugc\">buying goods</a>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/access-code-feeder/\" rel=\"ugc\">promoting chats and streams</a>, etc.<br />\nNow you can sell satoshi for fiat currencies and make profit in the process.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat does it work ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Customer chooses the amount of satoshi he/she willing to purchase, enters the deposit email,<br />\nassociated with account on Cryptoo.me, and redirected to PayPal to pay.<br />\nAfter the fiat transaction is completed, the agreed satoshi amount is deposited automatically. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I sell satoshi to customers who uses not USD, but Euro or Roubles ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, PayPal will do the conversion for any supported currency.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWho pays the Bitcoin commission ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nobody does. The crypto-currency transaction happens via micro-payment system, so it is free. By the way &#8211; it is also instant.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs it profitable ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, at least it is not unprofitable &#8211; the plugin checks the official exchange rate and reacts accordingly.<br />\nHowever when you set your exchange rates you have to consider PayPal commission on transactions and on currency exchange (if applicable).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow profitable it is?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is always &#8220;supply and demand&#8221;, so we can&#8217;t say.<br />\nWe only provide ability to sell satoshi for fiat currency at your own rates, the rest is up to you.</p>\n<p>Sure, PayPal will do the conversion for any supported currency.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I sell more satoshi than I have?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely, but possible. It may happen if more than one person buys the rest of your satoshi simultaneously.<br />\nIn this case you have to contact the customer and settle the issue by refunding the fiat, or by sending satoshi by other means.<br />\nTherefore do not switch too many notifications off, so you will be informed and react in-time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
