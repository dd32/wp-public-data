It gives you the opportunity to create output exactly the way you like it.</p>\n<h4>The Plugin</h4>\n<p>Basically what this plugin does is adding the shortcode [strava id=&#8221;[activity id]&#8221;] to your post, receiving data via Strava API v3 and filling the preconfigured template with this information.</p>\n<h4>Configuration</h4>\n<p>You want full control of the shortcode&#8217;s output ? No Problem. You can specify a template at the settings page and define the positions of strava information.

Go here [http://www.strava.com/developers] for more details. </li>\n<li>It is also important to make sure that the redirect URI you enter is the same as your site.</li>\n<li>After creating the application go to the Settings page and enter the client id and secret.</li>\n<li>Save settings</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Connect with Strava&#8221; on the settings page to generate an access token</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Add to page/post</h4>\n<p>Basically what this plugin does is adding the shortcode [strava id=&#8221;[activity id]&#8221;] to your post, receiving data via Strava API v3 and filling the preconfigured template with this information. Of course you could paste the snippet manually, but in order to do so you would have to leave your site and find the needed id by yourself. The easier way is to choose one of the listed activities in the right corner of your post editing page and let the plugin do the work for you. No more copy and paste!</p>\n",
