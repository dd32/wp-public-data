The extension developer assigns one of three dismissibility types to each notice they send:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>None</strong> indicates that the notice is not dismissible. The <em>dismiss</em> button will not appear.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporary</strong> indicates that the notice will be temporarily dismissed when you click the <em>dismiss</em> button. Once dismissed, the notice will not appear until the next time the Admin page is refreshed.</li>\n<li><strong>Permanent</strong> indicates that the notice will be permanently dismissed when you click the <em>dismiss</em> button. Once dismissed, the notice will not appear again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of the dimissibility setting chosen by the extension developer, you can permanently dismiss any notice by clicking the <em>Permanently Dismiss</em> link at the lower right of the notice or by checking the checkbox next to the notice title in the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification Client</strong>&#8216;s <em>Settings</em> section.</p>\n<h4>SETTINGS</h4>\n<p>Use the <em>Settings</em> page to control how the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong> operates on your site.</p>\n<p><strong>Site-wide Extension Notifications</strong></p>\n<p>Checking the <em>Disable Extension Notifications for the entire site</em> checkbox will stop the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong> from checking for new notices and from displaying any notices that have not been dismissed.</p>\n<p><strong>New Extensions</strong></p>\n<p>As a security measure, by default, new extensions are disabled from using the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong>. You may opt-in to allowing new extensions to be enabled to use the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong> at the time they are activated by checking the <em>Automatically enable Extension Notifications for new extensions when they are activated</em> checkbox. Otherwise, each individual extension may be enabled or disabled as you choose by unchecking or checking the <em>Disable extension notifications for</em>&#8230; checkbox within the individual extension&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p><strong>Individual Extension Notifications</strong></p>\n<p>Each plugin or theme that uses the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong> is listed in the <em>Individual Extension Notifications</em> section. For each extension you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediately cease the periodic checking for new notices, and discontinue displaying any notices that have not already been dismissed by checking the <em>Disable extension notifications for</em>&#8230; checkbox.</li>\n<li>View the extension&#8217;s status by clicking the <em>Status</em> link under the extension name.</li>\n<li>Refresh the extension&#8217;s notices by clicking the <em>Refresh</em> link under the extension name. This will result in the deletion of all notices and then calling the extension&#8217;s server to retrieve any outstanding notices if the extension is enabled to use the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong>.</li>\n<li>Reset the extension by clicking the <em>Reset</em> link under the extension name. This will result in the deletion of the extension from within the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong>&#8216;s settings. The extension will then be re-added using default settings and, if the <em>Automatically enable Extension Notifications for new extensions when they are activated</em> checkbox is checked, the extension will be re-enabled to use the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong>.</li>\n<li>Change the frequency that periodic checking for new notices will be performed by entering a new value in the box under the <em>Override how often to check for new notices</em> label. You can enter values like:\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;8 hours&#8221; to check once every 8 hours</li>\n<li>&#8220;2 days&#8221; to check once every other day</li>\n<li>&#8220;1 week&#8221; to check once each week</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Permanently dismiss individual notices that have not already been dismissed by checking the checkbox next to the notice title.</li>\n<li>View individual notices by clicking the <em>View Notice</em> link under the notice title.</li>\n<li>Refresh all extensions&#8217; notices by clicking the <em>Refresh All</em> button. This will result in the deletion of all notices for all extensions and then calling all extensions&#8217; servers to retrieve any outstanding notices for those extensions that are enabled to use the <strong>WP247 Extension Notification System</strong>.</li>\n<li>Reset all extensions by clicking the <em>Reset All</em> button.
