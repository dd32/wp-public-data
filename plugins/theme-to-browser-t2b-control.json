See question 2. You can alternatively use the Theme to Browser Control &#8211; IE Pack to handle versions of IE. More packs to come!</p>\n<p>What if the browser is not detected?<br />\nIt will show the default theme.</p>\n<p>What is the default theme?<br />\nIts the theme selected in the Appearance / Theme menu.</p>\n<p>How do I change what browser gets what theme?<br />\nIn the Appearance tab under T2B Control &#8230; that&#8217;s where the magic happends.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>A couple of security fixes (nothing huge) and minor logic change. Also added filters so the plugin is pluggable itself. Moved to 1.0 as this is now fairly mature ðŸ™‚<br />\nRemoved BlackBerry8310 from the list of browsers.</p>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<p>Complete modernization and rewrite. Cleared a bunch of notices and deprecated functions.<br />\nAdded debug mode so y&#8217;all can test your custom regex against the current browser, and verify in the frontend if the proper theme is getting loaded.</p>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<p>A couple of bug fixes.</p>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Added &#8220;Default theme&#8221; behavior. A little bit of beautification work. Playstation3 added.</p>\n<h4>0.21</h4>\n<p>Child themes now supported. Important fix. iPad added to browser list.</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>BlackBerry8310 and All BlackBerry models added.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>First version published. Yay!</p>\n"
