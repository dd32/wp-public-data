Using registration or<br />\nsubscriber widgets in these places can have better results than places them in your<br />\nstandard sidebar locations. To take a relevent parallel, split tests show that the<br />\nheadline and the PS sections of salespages are the most often looked at, so using<br />\nthese spaces wisely on any webpage is a must.</p>\n<p>The Above/Below Sidebars work either via Template Action Hooks or Content Filters methods.<br />\nEither method can be used with any theme. The Template Action Hook defaults are preconfigured<br />\nfor immediate use with <a href=\"https://bioship.space\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BioShip Child Theme Framework</a></p>\n<p><strong>Login Sidebar</strong> &#8211; <em>for Easy Return Visitor Login</em></p>\n<p>Allowing returning visitors to login from any page on your site rather than having to<br />\ngo to a specific login page increases your site&#8217;s usability and accessibility. And of<br />\ncourse having this sidebar automatically not show for already logged in users, or show<br />\ndifferent content in it&#8217;s place (see next) are further good ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Logged In Sidebar</strong> &#8211; <em>for User Fallback and Member Offers</em></p>\n<p>This was created so you can have different content for Logged In Users (eg. your Members)<br />\nso that you can display for example a Join Us / Signup / Register Widget for new visitors<br />\nand after they have signed up and logged in, show Members Area links or offers in their<br />\nplace instead. A very handy professional touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode Sidebars</strong> &#8211; <em>for Easy Widgets in Pages or Posts</em></p>\n<p>The three Shortcode Sidebars can be used via WordPress shortcodes in your post content,<br />\nor by adding a shortcode sidebar call to your theme template files or plugins.<br />\neg. <code>[shortcode-sidebar-1]</code> will call any Widgets dropped in Shortcode Sidebar 1.</p>\n<p><strong>InPost Sidebars</strong> &#8211; <em>for Contextual Advertising Magic</em></p>\n<p>InPost Sidebars are spaced evenly throughout your paragraph text at whichever positions<br />\nyou like, for whichever Post Types you choose. For example: Drop an AdSense Widget or<br />\nAdvertising Widget or other HTML advertising block in each Sidebar (3 available) to show<br />\nthese sidebars periodically throughout your post content. Awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Discreet Text Widget</strong> &#8211; <em>for better Shortcode output in Sidebars</em></p>\n<p>Using shortcode in text widgets has the advantage of being able to easily use custom code<br />\nin your Sidebars. However, in different conditions you may want this shortcode to display<br />\nnothing at all. If you were using a normal text widget it would still output the empty widget<br />\n(with title etc.) &#8211; but with a Discreet Text Widget, if the shortcode returns empty the widget<br />\ndoes not output at all.

The Content Filter method is<br />\neasier and faster to setup, but less flexible (read on for why.)</p>\n<p>The Content Filter method works for ANY theme, as it adds the sidebars to the_content().<br />\nYou can adjust the priorities so they can &#8216;fit&#8217; in with other end-of-post features such as<br />\nRelated Posts. The default is for absolute before (first) and absolute end (last.)</p>\n<p>The limitation of the Content Filter method is that for the &#8216;Above Content&#8217; Sidebar it<br />\ncannot account for the Post Title (and sometimes subtitle and post meta display depending<br />\non the Theme) &#8211; for that is typically <em>above</em> the_content &#8211; so filtering the content does<br />\nnot change that. So if you want the <em>Above Content Sidebar</em> to be completely above the Post<br />\nTitle you will need to use Template Action Hooks (which are preferable anyway.)</p>\n<p>Template Action Hooks are a better option because you do not rely on applying filters to<br />\nthe_content(), but you may need to find existing hooks in your Theme (preferable) &#8211; or if<br />\nneeds be to add them yourself into your theme templates. The default Template Layout Hooks<br />\nused for the <em>Above Content</em>, <em>Below Content</em> and <em>Login</em> Sidebars are for [BioShip Framework].</p>\n<p>You can add these Sidebars to others Themes either by finding or adding a hook to your Theme<br />\npage templates (see the WordPress Codex for more information on the page template hierarchy.).<br />\nSimply look for: <code>do_action('my_themes_action_hook');</code> or add it where desired. Then change<br />\nthe corresponding hook name for that Sidebar on the Content Sidebars Settings Page, so that<br />\nwhen the action hook is fired, the sidebar function is called, outputting the content sidebar.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can call the sidebars directly in code with the function csidebars_get_sidebar(),<br />\neg. <em>Above Content Sidebar</em></p>\n<p><em>Below Content Sidebar</em></p>\n<p>(Note: Do NOT forget the function_exist wrappers &#8211; they prevent your layout from breaking<br />\nif you need to disable the Content Sidebars plugin at any time.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20%27login%27%20sidebar%3F'>\nHow do I use the &#8216;Login&#8217; Sidebar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The primary purpose of the &#8216;Login&#8217; Sidebar is to allow users to login of course. As such,<br />\nit will not show for a Logged In User in any case. If your site accepts user registrations<br />\nin any capacity, having somewhere obvious to login can be a good idea. You can alays use a<br />\nconditional Login Widget in your main Sidebar of course, but this way the Login Widget can<br />\nbe handled separately and positioned differently (eg. across the page, above/below navbar.)</p>\n<p>Just drop in a Login Widget into the Login Sidebar (such as a Theme My Login Widget) on your<br />\nAppearance &#8211; Widgets page and then position the resulting Sidebar wherever you like, by using<br />\na  Template Action Hook or function call (it will not be auto-added by the Content Filter<br />\npositioning method, as that relates to the Above and Below Content Sidebars only.) You can<br />\nplace it below your main navigation bar, or above or within your header area for example.</p>\n<p>You can change the default hook from &#8216;skeleton_before_header&#8217; to a hook used in your Theme<br />\npage template, eg. header.php (again the default hook name used is for [BioShip Framework].)<br />\nAgain, look in your Theme template for:<br />\n    do_action(&#8216;my_themes_action_hook&#8217;);<br />\nor for a function call you can do:\n    </p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20%27logged%20in%27%20sidebar%3F'>\nHow do I use the &#8216;Logged In&#8217; Sidebar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8216;Logged In&#8217; or &#8216;Members&#8217; fallback Sidebar is available for showing different content<br />\nto Logged In Users. This means you can either hide Join / Signup / Register Widgets for<br />\nregistered users if they are logged in, or show the alternative contents of this Sidebar.</p>\n<p>This Sidebar can be used as a fallback for either the Above Content, Below Content and/or<br />\nLogin Sidebars. In other words, it will show <em>instead</em> of any of those sidebars (if you<br />\nhave &#8216;Fallback&#8217; ticked next to that Sidebar in your settings) &#8211; for any Logged In User of<br />\nany role (WordPress user logged into your site that is!)</p>\n<p>This is pretty useful for showing Members Area links, or other user navigation and/or offers.<br />\nOr even a role-based menu, for example, using the [Theme My Login Plugin] (User Links Module.)<br />\nIt has a drap-and-drop interface for all roles from administrator to subscriber. And of<br />\ncourse, other Members plugins may have their own Widgets that you can use for this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20%27inpost%27%20sidebars%3F'>\nHow do I use the &#8216;InPost&#8217; Sidebars?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The InPost Sidebars are inserted automatically into the Post Types that you choose on the<br />\nSettings page. You can choose 1 to 3 Sidebars and the paragraph positions where the Sidebars<br />\nwill display, and Widgets in these Sidebars will automatically display after these positions.<br />\nPosts which do not have enough paragraphs for that sidebar position will not output it.<br />\n(These Sidebars are disabled by default so don&#8217;t forget to uncheck the disable checkboxes.)</p>\n<p>You can also set a Content Marker to split paragraphs with (default is <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>) and the<br />\npriority of sidebar content filter is available for fine-tuning if you need to integrate<br />\nwith other content filters. Once you have decided which paragraph positions are suitable,<br />\ngo and drop some Widgets in the Sidebars on the Appearance &#8211; Widgets page. eg. Advertising<br />\nor AdSense blocks. (Remember there is a limit of 3 AdSense blocks per page, so take note<br />\nif you have them anywhere else on the page.)</p>\n<p>You could also use shortcodes in text widgets for more fine-grained custom control<br />\n(see next question on setting up those.) Now check the display of a relevent post type<br />\n(of sufficient length) to see the output of the InPost Sidebars. You will probably need<br />\nto tweak the CSS for these Sidebars depending on where and how you want them to display,<br />\neg. <code>float:left</code> or <code>float:right</code>, plus some matching margins and/or padding etc&#8230;<br />\nAnd that&#8217;s it, you now have some magical in-context advertising space. Use wisely. 🙂</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20shortcodes%20within%20text%20widgets%3F'>\nHow do I use Shortcodes within Text Widgets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A very flexible way of adding custom content to your Sidebars is through using a Shortcode<br />\nwithin a Text Widget. In order to do so, you need to make sure the WordPress shortcode<br />\nfilter is applied to the widget_text content. Here is what this code looks like:</p>\n<p>You can activate this code from the Settings page for widget text (and optionally widget titles.)</p>\n<p>Once you know that is in place, you can add any shortcode to a Text Widget and it will be<br />\nused to display the return value of the executed shortcode, eg. for [my-custom-shortcode]\n    </p>\n<p>You may also want to use the Discreet Text Widget for this case, so that if the shortcode<br />\nreturns nothing (eg. for an empty shopping cart) then the Text Widget does not show at<br />\nall (ie. the Widget title is not displayed either if there is no Widget text output)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20filter%20individual%20widgets%20for%20different%20conditions%3F'>\nHow do I use filter individual Widgets for different conditions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Content Sidebars now includes options for displaying on different custom post types,<br />\nas well as specific archive conditions (archive, tag, category, taxonomy, date, author)<br />\nand other special conditions (front page, home page, 404 pages, search pages)</p>\n<p>If you want more control, you can combine with a <em>conditional widget plugin</em>, so you can<br />\ndrop those Widgets in the Sidebars of your choice to display a Widget conditionally in<br />\nany of these new Sidebar areas for different purposes. ie. posts or pages or CPTs or<br />\nother conditions. eg. [Widget Logic Plugin], [Display Widgets Plugin], etc&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20filter%20sidebars%20for%20different%20conditions%3F'>\nHow do I use filter Sidebars for different conditions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For a more advanced or custom setup you can modify any of the Plugin Settings via Filters.<br />\nFor consistency these filters have the same key as the plugin settings. The full list of<br />\nsettings (and thus filters) can be seen in the plugin setting initialization list.</p>\n<p>For example, you can disable a sidebar according to conditions using these filters:<br />\n    csidebars_abovecontent_disable, csidebars_belowcontent_disable<br />\n    csidebars_login_disable, csidebars_member_disable<br />\n    csidebars_shortcode_sidebar1, csidebars_shortcode_sidebar2, csidebars_shortcode_sidebar3<br />\n    csidebars_inpost_sidebar1, csidebars_inpost_sidebar2, csidebars_inpost_sidebar3</p>\n<p>eg. To remove the above content sidebar from the site Front Page only:<br />\n    add_filter(&#8216;csidebars_abovecontent_disable&#8217;,&#8217;my_custom_sidebar_filter1&#8242;);<br />\n    function my_custom_sidebar_filter1() {if (is_front_page()) {return &#8216;yes&#8217;;} }<br />\n(for disable filters, returning yes indicates the sidebar is to be <em>disabled</em>.)</p>\n<p>You can also filter the entire sidebar output with the following filters:<br />\n    csidebars_abovecontent_sidebar, csidebars_belowcontent_sidebar<br />\n    csidebars_loginsidebar, csidebars_member_sidebar<br />\n    csidebars_shortcode_sidebar1, csidebars_shortcode_sidebar2, csidebars_shortcode_sidebar3<br />\n    csidebars_inpost_sidebar1, csidebars_inpost_sidebar2, csidebars_inpost_sidebar3</p>\n<p>eg.

Using registration or<br />\nsubscriber widgets in these places can have better results than places them in your<br />\nstandard sidebar locations. To take a relevent parallel, split tests show that the<br />\nheadline and the PS sections of salespages are the most often looked at, so using<br />\nthese spaces wisely on any webpage is a must.</p>\n<p>The Above/Below Sidebars work either via Template Action Hooks or Content Filters methods.<br />\nEither method can be used with any theme. The Template Action Hook defaults are preconfigured<br />\nfor immediate use with <a href=\"https://bioship.space\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BioShip Child Theme Framework</a></p>\n<p><strong>Login Sidebar</strong> &#8211; <em>for Easy Return Visitor Login</em></p>\n<p>Allowing returning visitors to login from any page on your site rather than having to<br />\ngo to a specific login page increases your site&#8217;s usability and accessibility. And of<br />\ncourse having this sidebar automatically not show for already logged in users, or show<br />\ndifferent content in it&#8217;s place (see next) are further good ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Logged In Sidebar</strong> &#8211; <em>for User Fallback and Member Offers</em></p>\n<p>This was created so you can have different content for Logged In Users (eg. your Members)<br />\nso that you can display for example a Join Us / Signup / Register Widget for new visitors<br />\nand after they have signed up and logged in, show Members Area links or offers in their<br />\nplace instead. A very handy professional touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode Sidebars</strong> &#8211; <em>for Easy Widgets in Pages or Posts</em></p>\n<p>The three Shortcode Sidebars can be used via WordPress shortcodes in your post content,<br />\nor by adding a shortcode sidebar call to your theme template files or plugins.<br />\neg. <code>[shortcode-sidebar-1]</code> will call any Widgets dropped in Shortcode Sidebar 1.</p>\n<p><strong>InPost Sidebars</strong> &#8211; <em>for Contextual Advertising Magic</em></p>\n<p>InPost Sidebars are spaced evenly throughout your paragraph text at whichever positions<br />\nyou like, for whichever Post Types you choose. For example: Drop an AdSense Widget or<br />\nAdvertising Widget or other HTML advertising block in each Sidebar (3 available) to show<br />\nthese sidebars periodically throughout your post content. Awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Discreet Text Widget</strong> &#8211; <em>for better Shortcode output in Sidebars</em></p>\n<p>Using shortcode in text widgets has the advantage of being able to easily use custom code<br />\nin your Sidebars. However, in different conditions you may want this shortcode to display<br />\nnothing at all. If you were using a normal text widget it would still output the empty widget<br />\n(with title etc.) &#8211; but with a Discreet Text Widget, if the shortcode returns empty the widget<br />\ndoes not output at all.
