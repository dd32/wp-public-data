GutenDev is for those who are enthusiast about Open Source and WordPress. We have been volunteering WordPress and Gutenberg to spread the world and we are also building plugins and themes for WordPress with an excellent 24/7 support team.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why The Plugin is free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GutenDev believes in open source; Besides, the open source personality of GutenVed is <strong>Genericist</strong> that means GutenDev makes sure the project (for example Gutenberg) is usable in every situation. And Gutenberg is a project that can be used in every situation. That&#8217;s why GutenDev is working harder to spread GutenBerg Editor to the WordPress community..</p>\n</p>\n\n",
