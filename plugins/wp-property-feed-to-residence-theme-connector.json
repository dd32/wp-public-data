        "installation": "<p>Once you have installed and set up your WP Residence theme and the WP Property Feed Plugin you simply install this connector plugin and the rest is automatic.  You can download and install this plugin using the built in WordPress plugin installer in the wp-admin, just search for \\&#8221;WP Property Feed Residence\\&#8221; and install the plugin then \\&#8221;Activate\\&#8221; to make it active.  Once active the connector will automatically update the WP Residence properties each time the WP Property Feed plugin updates from the feeds (normally every quarter hour).  In the settings for WP Property Feed you will see a new WP Residence tab.  The tab will show the last 10 automatic updates that were performed and has a checkbox to allow you to run the connector immediately.<br />\nIt is advised that you set a long time out (max_execution_time) in your php.ini file as feed downloads can take a long time.</p>\n",
