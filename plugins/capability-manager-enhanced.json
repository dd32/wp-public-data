So, we&#8217;ve built a way to keep your site safe.</p>\n<p>Every time you change your permissions, the PublishPress Capabilities plugin will automatically create a backup. If you make a mistake, go to the “Backup” menu link and click the “Restore” tab. Here you can browse through the most recent 20 automatic backups. The plugin also saves a backup from you first installed PublishPress Capabilities. And you can click the “Backup” tab to manually create backups.</p>\n<p>Click the yellow “Restore Selected Roles” button and you&#8217;ll be able to roll back to a previous version.</p>\n<p>Whenever you choose a backup, the plugin will show all the permissions in that backup.

This is useful because WPForms has limited options for managing who can access the admin screens and important features.</p>\n<p>WPForms is one of the most popular WordPress contact form plugin with millions of active installs. WPForms allows you to create beautiful contact forms, feedback forms, subscription forms, payment forms, and more.</p>\n<p>When you first install the WPForms plugin, you&#8217;ll see one top-level menu link, plus at least 10 sub-menus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Forms</li>\n<li>Add New</li>\n<li>Entries</li>\n<li>Settings</li>\n<li>Tools</li>\n<li>Addons</li>\n<li>Analytics</li>\n<li>SMTP</li>\n<li>About Us</li>\n<li>Community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is possible to control who can access these WPForms plugin links by using the PublishPress Capabilities Pro plugin. After installing PublishPress Capabilities Pro, go to “Capabilities”, then “Admin Menus” in your WordPress admin area. In the top-left corner of this screen, choose the role that you want to edit. For example, you can restrict WPForms access for the “Administrator” role. If you do this, I would recommend making a copy of the Administrator role so that one role still has full WPForms access.</p>\n<p>Scroll down and you can enter a red X for any WPForms menu link that you don&#8217;t want users in the Administrator role to access.

This is useful because a default WordPress site does not give you way to control the visibility of your links.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/nav-menus/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click to see how to block frontend menu access</a>.</p>\n<h3>PublishPress Capabilities is Safe to Use</h3>\n<p>PublishPress Capabilities is completely <strong>safe to use</strong>. Every time you change your site&#8217;s permissions, this plugin will take a backup that you can restore if anything goes wrong. You can use these backups to migrate your roles and permissions from one site to another.</p>\n<p>This security feature is also very helpful if you want to test out changes on your site, or if you&#8217;ve installed a new plugin that has changed your site&#8217;s permissions.</p>\n<p>Every time you change your permissions, the PublishPress Capabilities plugin will now automatically create a backup. If you make a mistake, go to the &#8220;Backup&#8221; menu link and you&#8217;ll be able to roll back to a previous version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/backup-restore-permissions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see how to backup permissions</a>.</p>\n<h3>Support for Media Library Permissions</h3>\n<p>PublishPress Capabilities enables you to decide who can upload, edit and delete files from your site&#8217;s Media Library. By default, only Administrators are able to delete files in your Media Library. Subscribers and Contributors are not even allowed to upload files. You can customize these permissions for the Media Library and also the Featured Image box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/control-media-library-access/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to learn about Media Library permissions</a>.</p>\n<h3>Support for WooCommerce Permissions</h3>\n<p>We mentioned earlier that PublishPress Capabilities has special support for WooCommerce taxonomies.

Site administrators often have to browse their site and see exactly what the user sees. They need to test the user&#8217;s account without resetting their password. This is possible with PublishPress Capabilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/user-testing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to learn about user testing</a>.</p>\n<h3>Join PublishPress and get the Pro plugins</h3>\n<p>The Pro versions of the PublishPress plugins are well worth your investment.
