        "faq": "\n<h4>I activated the plugin and nothing happened.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All options are turned OFF by default to avoid unwanted surprises. Be sure to set the domain name of your mobile website in Settings &gt; Mobile Detect, before activating the redirect function.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s so great about &#8220;page-by-page&#8221; redirecting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can help search engines understand the relationship between your desktop and mobile website. It also makes the mobile user experience much more fluid when clicking a link to a particular page on your website (they don&#8217;t get dump onto your mobile home page, where they then have to figure out where the page they were looking for is).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s wrong with redirecting to the home/front page?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you have links published in your marketing campaign that go directly to specific pages of your website, you probably want those links to take visitors to those pages respectively, mobile users included. If you don&#8217;t have such links published, search engines do, regardless.</li>\n<li>Redirecting all search engines to your home page can lower its status, as it can make your home page appear to be a 404 page.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the point of having optional links to the mobile website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Suppose your mobile website has a link to your desktop website (e.g. &#8220;View desktop version&#8221; or &#8220;Full Site&#8221;) and the user clicks it. AddFunc Mobile Detect sets a cookie to remember that the visitor has opted for the desktop website. Now let&#8217;s say your visitor changed his/her mind and wants the mobile site again. A link to the mobile site is the obvious solution, but in most cases you wouldn&#8217;t want that link to show up on desktop computers, so we don&#8217;t generate it. Conveniently, these generated links automatically use whatever URL you enter in on the settings page, so even if you later have your mobile website at another URL, you&#8217;ll never need to directly update these links.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about tablets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Generally tablets do a fine job of displaying desktop websites. But now as of version 3, AddFunc Mobile Detect gives you (the admin) the choice of treating tables the same as mobile devices or as desktops (default).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Wouldn&#8217;t a JavaScript solution be more reliable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Can I get a statistic? It really depends on how often you get visitors who have javascript turned off and whether you can do without those visitors. Likewise, I suppose, it depends on whether many of your visitors withhold their browser and system specs when requesting your website. Usually, neither of these are very common, but they both happen.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it really require WordPress 3.0.1 or later?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have not tested it on earlier versions. In fact, I could use help with testing. Feel free to try it out in an earlier version and let me know if it works! ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does AddFunc have a website</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a coconut falls on the beach and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound&#8230; I mean no. Not yet.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This field is used to set the cookie for your non-mobile website, which tells it whether to redirect the device or not. However, you can still use a website that resides on a subdomain. To do this, omit all characters that come before the first period, but leave the period there (example: .your-website.com). Be aware that this will set the cookie for all subdomains pertaining to the root domain name (so in our example, the cookie would be set for all of these: m.your-website.com, www.your-website.com, other.your-website.com, even-unregistered-subdomains.your-website.com, etc.)</li>\n<li>As the redirect is governed by a cookie set/changed by both the mobile website and the non-mobile website entered above, the &#8220;Non-mobile Website URI&#8221; feild must be filled in exactly the same on both websites. (This plugin has to be installed and active on both websites.)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Mobile Site Link doubles as link to non-mobile site as entered in Non-mobile Website URI if &#8220;This is the Mobile Website&#8221; is set to &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Due to the above limited support however, this doesn&#8217;t work when using a subdomain</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>26-Nov-2013</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds Mobile Site Link widget which generates a link to the mobile site (for mobile devices only)&#8230; and a lot of bugs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>19-Nov-2013</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses MobileDetect.php to detect whether device is mobile or not and redirects mobile users to another location (specified in Settings)</li>\n<li>Sets a cookie to track whether the mobile user wants the mobile site or the full site. Cookie expires on browser close</li>\n</ul>\n"
