A <strong>search module</strong> is available to quickly locate the desired location.</li>\n<li>Add your own images to <strong>customize your markers</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Insert a dynamic map</strong> that displays your articles using a <strong>simple shortcode</strong>. Choose the dimensions of your map.</li>\n<li><strong>Filter the posts</strong> you want to display on the map by their type, categories and tags.</li>\n<li><strong>Markers clustering</strong> is automatic when marker density is too high, to prevent them from overlapping.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize</strong> the appearance of your maps with OpenStreetMap tile providers. By default, the plugin uses CARTO&#8217;s free and open &#8220;Voyager&#8221; map tiles.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize</strong> the popup style and content for your markers. You can also disable the plugin&#8217;s CSS if you want to design your own popups.</li>\n<li>Travelers&#8217; Map is <strong>compatible with the new Gutenberg editor</strong> and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>This plugin <strong>does not add any tables into your database</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The geolocation data of your posts are saved as meta-data and <strong>are not deleted if Travelers&#8217; Map is disabled or deleted</strong>. However, if you want to uninstall Travelers&#8217; Map permanently, an option is available to <strong>clean your database of any data added by the plugin</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Bug reports and Contribution</h3>\n<p>Bug reports for Travelers&#8217; map are welcomed on my <a href=\"https://github.com/Socrapop/travelers-map\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a>.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20this%20open%20source%20and%20free%20of%20charge%3F'>\nIs this open source and free of charge?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is. This plugin uses <a href=\"https://leafletjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Leaflet</a> to display the interactive maps. <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenStreetMap</a> open data is used. By default, this plugin uses <a href=\"https://carto.com/attribution/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CARTO’s Voyager</a> tiles, which require attribution but are free.</p>\n<p>However, you may have to pay if you were to choose a premium Tile Provider.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20find%20free%20tile%20providers%20to%20customize%20my%20map%3F'>\nHow can I find free tile providers to customize my map?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should visit the awesome <a href=\"https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Leaflet-providers demo</a> to find a tile provider. Some of them require to register and request an API key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20google%20maps'>\nCan I use Google Maps\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, I decided to create Travelers&#8217; Map after Google Maps&#8217; pricing plans were updated. Furthermore, loading tiles from Google Maps by simply specifying the tiles URL to Leaflet is against the Google Maps terms of service.<br />\nIf you really want to use Google Maps (but really, why?), you can use the plugin Novo-Map that I used to use on my personal blog.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20more%20markers%20images%3F'>\nCan I add more markers images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can add your own custom markers in &#8220;Travelers&#8217; Map&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Customize markers&#8221; in your WordPress admin area.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20only%20available%20in%20english%3F'>\nIs this plugin only available in English?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 1.0.0, this plugin has English and French version. You can contribute and [translate the plugin into your language] (https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/travelers-map/)! Thank you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20markers%27%20thumbnails%20are%20heavy%20and%20long%20to%20load%2C%20what%20can%20i%20do%20%3F'>\nMy markers&#8217; thumbnails are heavy and long to load, what can I do ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Travelers&#8217; map is creating a small thumbnail size for your popups, however, WordPress is not regenerating thumbnails for the images you uploaded before activating the plugin. To do that, you can install a plugin called &#8220;Regenerate Thumbnails&#8221; by Alex Mills.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20two%20maps%20on%20the%20same%20page%3F'>\nCan I add two maps on the same page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can since version 1.5.0, you can add multiple shortcodes on the same page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20marker%20popup%20style%3F'>\nCan I change the marker popup style?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, since version 0.9.0. You can also disable the plugin&#8217;s CSS to customize.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
