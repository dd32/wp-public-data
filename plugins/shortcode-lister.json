        "description": "<p>Shortcode Lister is a plugin designed to display a drop down menu of all the shortcodes available to use in your posts and pages. This menu will allow you to select a shortcode and have it automatically inserted into the editor for you.</p>\n<p>If you have downloaded several plugins that produce their own custom shortcodes, it may become cumbersome to remember all of the shortcodes you have available to use. In a way this defeats the purpose of having an easy to use shortcode, if it is too difficult to remember them all.</p>\n<p>This plugin solves that problem, by producing a clean, easily accessible menu of all the custom/third party added, and WordPress default shortcodes that you are able to use inside your posts and pages.</p>\n",

According to the WordPress Codex, the following are built-in shortcodes that will be shown in the Shortcode Lister: [audio] [caption] [embed] [gallery] [video]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20your%20plugin%20display%20the%20shortcode%20attributes%3F'>\nCan your plugin display the shortcode attributes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shortcode attributes are created inside of the function that creates the shortcode, and are not available globally. For that reason we are unable to display the attributes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20shortcodes%20from%20other%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat about shortcodes from other plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most shortcodes created by plugins you have downloaded will be included in Shortcode Lister found on your Post or Page edit screen. If you have a plugin that produces shortcodes and it is not listed in the Shortcode Lister menu, please let create a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/shortcode-lister/\" rel=\"ugc\">support ticket</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20need%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy would I need this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you like wasting time by under using shortcodes that have been provided to you by the great plugins you have downloaded, then you probably do not need this plugin.</p>\n<p>If you are like thousands of other people who want to use WordPress to its full potential, shortcodes are a great way to save time. This plugin will save you even more time if your list of shortcodes gets too big for you to remember all of them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20too%20many%20shortcodes%2C%20how%20can%20i%20remove%20some%20of%20them%20from%20the%20list%3F'>\nI have too many shortcodes, how can I remove some of them from the list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A lot of times plugins will create a shortcode that only needs to be used once, and you will likely never need to use it again. If you have a lot of those shortcodes, you can visit the settings page (Settings &gt; Shortcode Lister), and check the box next to each shortcode you want to remove from the list. Now when you view the shortcode menu you will have a nice clean list of shortcodes that can be easily sorted through without the clutter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20insert%20the%20shortcode%20into%20my%20post%3F'>\nHow do I insert the shortcode into my post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply click where you want the shortcode to be inserted in your post editor, then select the shortcode from the menu. Your shortcode will be inserted automatically for you!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
