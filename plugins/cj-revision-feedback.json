        "description": "<p>This plugin provides the ability to add comment blocks mid post. The use case for this is: WP is used to show clients creative documents, a single post is dedicated to a single project. Each revision is appended to the post. Adding in the CJ Revision Feedback tag will allow clients to provide feedback for a specific revision. Admin users can mark the feedback as completed and approved while adding sub-comments, and close out feedback on a revision. The plugin includes multiple customizable elements including: look and feel, email notifications, and post-specific email notifications.</p>\n<p>Developed on version 2.8.6 so any previous versions haven&#8217;t been tested</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p><strong>Basic Tag Format:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[revision_feedback revision=# nobutton]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each tag added should have a unique revision number, starting with 1 and incrementing from there.<br />\nTo disable new feedback for a revision just add nobutton to the tag.  This will only disable the user from adding new comments, they can view comments and the admin users can do everything still.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample tags:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>[revision_feedback revision=1]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tag is the first revision tag.  At this point the client makes comments.<br />\nOnce revision 1 is completed the tag is updated by adding the nobutton tag</p>\n<pre><code>[revision_feedback revision=1 nobutton]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now the &#8220;add feedback&#8221; button will not show<br />\nAt this point you would want to open comments to the next revision by adding</p>\n<pre><code>[revision_feedback revision=2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>rinse and repeat until the final revisions are approved</p>\n<p>If you add the same revision number to a post the admin view (not user) will see an error message on the screen.  Putting duplicate revision numbers doesn&#8217;t break anything, but will cause new/existing comments to show in two places.</p>\n<h3>Admin Features/Settings</h3>\n<p>If you visit the &#8220;settings&#8221; section of the admin page you will see a line item for CJ Revision Feedback.  This details what each feature/setting is for.</p>\n<p><strong>Show feedback author and date</strong><br />\n<br />By checking this box the user id and comment date will be displayed next to each comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Allow Anonymous User Comments (disabling will require uses be logged in to comment)</strong><br />\n<br />Check this checkbox to allow anonymous users, people not logged in, to make revision comments</p>\n<p><strong>Layer Top Offset</strong><br />\n<br />This defines how many pixels below or above the clickable button the user and admin comment layer will appear.  A positive number is below, a negative number is above.  The top left of the button is 0 offset</p>\n<p><strong>Admin Layer Left Offset</strong><br />\n<br />This defines how many pixels to the left or right of the clickable button the admin layer should be positioned.  A negative number is left, a positive number is right.</p>\n<p><strong>User Layer Left Offset</strong><br />\n<br />This defines how many pixels to the left or right of the clickable button the user layer should be positioned.  A negative number is left, a positive number is right.</p>\n<p><strong>Send notification emails on new comments</strong><br />\n<br />By checking this box (and providing a default address) you will enable email notification for new user comments.</p>\n<p><strong>Default Notification Address (will be sent all new comment notifications)</strong><br />\n<br />This is the default notification address used for all new comments.  This email address will receive an email for each new user comment.</p>\n<p><strong>Revision Editor Roles (Administrator is always an editor)</strong><br />\n<br />This setting gives you the ability to specify which user types to consider as an admin.  An &#8220;admin&#8221; is a user who can make sub-comments, and mark a comment as completed or approved.</p>\n<h3>Post Specific Email Notification Addresses</h3>\n<p>It is possible to specify email notification addresses on a per post basis.  This enables sending new comment notifications to non-default addresses scoped to the specific post.<br />\n<br />To do this create a new custom field named &#8220;notification_addresses&#8221; with the value as a comma seperated list of email addresses.  For example: email1@email.com,email2@email.com, email3@email.com<br />\n(You can add spaces between email addresses)</p>\n<h3>Customizing the look and feel</h3>\n<p><strong>Images</strong><br />\n<br />You can customize the buttons by replacing the gif images in the <code>cj-revision-feedback</code> folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Styles</strong><br />\n<br />You can customize the colors of the comment layers and some of the positioning by editing the CSS file in the <code>cj-revision-feedback</code> folder.</p>\n",
