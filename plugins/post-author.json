        "faq": "\n<h4>I use html IMG or BR tags to seperate divs, spans or to add padding, is this right?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To make the best use of the plugin, you should NOT use html tags in the optional fields provided. Instead, you should style the divs and spans. With CSS, you can easily add an image in the author div. Also, by adding a &#8220;display:block&#8221; style to the span, you will force a line break before. And styling on your categories pages can be customized as well since it uses other classes, so you can make the text here smaller for instance.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I display the author&#8217;s username instead of his/her real name (or vice versa)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses the standard WP get_the_author command, which &#8220;grabs the value in the user&#8217;s <code>Display name publicly as</code> field&#8221;. So you might want to check in the USER admin page what that is and make sure that you selected the complete name and not the username or something else.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use a different variable link than default WP author page</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0, you can specify a custom link. The plugin can pick the URL you specify in the author&#8217;s profile. This URL could be a bio page on your blog or an external website or social network profile&#8230; And you still have a static link for all authors, as an alternative to the default or custom biography/user page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support, feedback, help, exchange and all community stuff <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/325398\" title=\"Support for Post Author Plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">should happen here</a> &#8211; reply to this thread as there is no website or page for this project other than this one here on WordPress.</p>\n<p>If for some reason you need to start a new thread with the appropriate tags, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/post-author?forum_id=10#postform\" rel=\"ugc\">it&#8217;s here</a>.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to rate this plugin, especially if you like it!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
