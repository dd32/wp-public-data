        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the zip file and unzip it in the wp-content/plugins folder of your wordpress installation</li>\n<li>Go to the plugins administration panel in your WP website and activate the plugin</li>\n<li>You can change settings in the &#8220;Owners&#8221; configuration menu.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Using the plugin in your template</h4>\n<p>When you activate the plugin, you&#8217;ll see an &#8220;Owners&#8221; item in the left menu of the WP Admin Panel. You can easily insert new owners, with the shareholders, logo, revenue, type (state, enterprise, person) and other related information.</p>\n<p>The plugin creates automatically a special &#8220;factsheet&#8221; page for each owner added (see screnshots). Besides that, it creates a search utility for listing owners with different filters and orderings.</p>\n<p>You can make changes in the &#8220;Owners&#8221; settings page. For example, you can decide what slug defines the owner&#8217;s URLs. By default, it&#8217;s <em>owners</em>. If your WordPress site is configured to have permalinks (post name), then the address of an owner will be: yourwebsite/owners/name-of-the-owner. And the place where the guests can look for owners will be: yourwebsite/owners.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you have any doubts by writing to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/who-owns-your-country\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>.</p>\n",
