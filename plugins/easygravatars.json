        "installation": "<p>Copy the easygravatars folder and its contents to your wp-content/plugins<br />\ndirectory, then activate the plugin.</p>\n<p>The plugin will add a new Easy Gravatars section under the Options menu.<br />\nThere, you can configure the size and maximum rating of the gravatars that<br />\nyou wish to display. You can also set the location of a default image to<br />\ndisplay for users who have no gravatar (the default is a 1px transparent<br />\ngif), you can tweak the CSS for the wrapper around the image, and you can<br />\nselect to attach the gravatar to either the comment author link, or the text<br />\nof the comment.</p>\n<p>By default, the gravatar is floated to the right of the comment author&#8217;s<br />\nname, which should work well with most templates.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I have a Gravatar, but it doesn&#8217;t appear</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Gravatar service allows you to register multiple email addresses. Make<br />\nsure that the email address you use in your WordPress comments matches an<br />\nemail address registered on the Gravatar server.</p>\n<p>Also, check the rating of your gravatar versus the maximum allowed rating in<br />\nthe Easy Gravatar options. If your gravatar is rated &#8216;R&#8217;, but you set the<br />\nmaximum Easy Gravatar rating to &#8216;PG&#8217;, the image will be blocked.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some people see Gravatars, but others don&#8217;t</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In some cases, there have been reports that Internet Explorer 6.0 does not<br />\ndisplay gravatars properly. This is probably due to CSS bugs in IE6. I will<br />\ntry to isolate this as time allows, but the best advice is for users to<br />\nupgrade to IE7 (for security and better standards support), or to use<br />\nanother browser, like Firefox or Opera.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My comment author links disappear</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may have another plugin which is conflicting with Easy Gravatars. In<br />\nparticular, Joost de Valk&#8217;s Google Analytics plugin version 1.3 also tried<br />\nto modify the comment author link. Upgrade to version 1.4 or higher of his<br />\nplugin, or select the &#8220;Comment Text&#8221; API hook in Easy Gravatar&#8217;s Advanced<br />\nOptions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Gravatars appear, but&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The placement of the Gravatars within your comments template is controlled<br />\nby the <code>Span style</code> and <code>API hook</code> options. The gravatar is rendered as an<br />\nimage tag within a span, which is prepended to either the comment author<br />\ninformation or the text of the comment, depending on the hook selected.</p>\n<p>The default options should work fine with most WordPress templates, but<br />\nthere&#8217;s always the chance that a template with a complex layout might have a<br />\nconflict. If simply changing the API hook selection doesn&#8217;t give a result<br />\nwhich is to your liking, you will need to modify the CSS in the span style.</p>\n<p>Sorry, but help with CSS styling is beyond the scope of this document.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Doesn&#8217;t WordPress 2.5 have Gravatars built-in? Why do I need Easy Gravatars?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, WordPress 2.5 added native support for Gravatars. However, older themes<br />\ndon&#8217;t support them. If you are using a theme which doesn&#8217;t already support<br />\nadding Gravatars, you either need to modify the templates yourself, or use<br />\nEasy Gravatars to add them automatically for you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
