If this is the case, you will need to reload the cache to enable the transformation of your URL.</p>\n<p>If however the problem persists, please contact us directly at: hello@scaleflex.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='question%202%3A%20how%20much%20does%20filerobot%20cost%3F'>\nQuestion 2: How much does Filerobot cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Filerobot is a SaaS that doesn’t offer a free tier for the time being. Depending on your needs, one of our representatives can present the best match for you in terms of plan and options included.

The original images are thus kept on your WordPress server, and then synchronized and uploaded in your Filerobot container.</p>\n<p>You can use the integrated Filerobot Image Editor to then modify your images and create additional versions. These modifications will show only in your Filerobot container, and the original image will not be modified.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='question%204%3A%20what%20happens%20if%20i%20deactivate%20filerobot%20wp%20plugin%3F'>\nQuestion 4: What happens if I deactivate Filerobot WP plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you were to deactivate the Filerobot WP plugin, your website will revert to the condition it was in prior to the activation of the Filerobot WP plugin. We do not apply any permanent changes to your WordPress.</p>\n<p>However, be mindful that any meta added to your pages after the activation of Filerobot will NOT be available after deactivation, which is why we strongly suggest to backup your WordPress before proceeding to the deactivation.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
