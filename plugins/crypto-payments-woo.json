        "faq": "<p>Are my keys kept on my server? No! No Private keys are ever stored on your server, the plugin does not need to know about them. So if you do ever get hacked there are no keys to steal, your cryptocurrency is safe. The plugin makes use of HD Master Public Key.</p>\n<p>Does this use any payment processor? No! This uses your Electrum/ElectrumFair Master Public Keys, the crytocurrency goes straight from your customer&#8217;s wallet to your wallet.</p>\n<p>Are there any fees? No! There is no middle man, no fees are ever taken at any point, nor will they ever be.</p>\n<p>Can I contribute? Sure! Go ahead and make a pull request. Clearly explain what the change does, what&#8217;s the intended result and why it&#8217;s required and if it changes any existing behaviour.</p>\n",
