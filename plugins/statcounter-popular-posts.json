Any users that is on a free plan or paid plan can use this plugin without any problems.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to set my Stats to Public in StatCounter</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to access the Popular Pages, the stats should be made Public. This can be done by the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your Project Config Page</li>\n<li>Choose &#8220;User/Public Access&#8221; option from the sidebar</li>\n<li>Under &#8220;Public Access&#8221;, set the option to &#8220;All Stats are Public&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the stats get fetched every time a page is loaded</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, because if it does that, the page loading will be slow. So the stats are cached for 10 minutes. This will reduce the number of times the fresh stats are fetched.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
