This ensures a much higher conversion rate and more captured moving leads. To read more about how to insert a form into your WordPress site, please read <a href=\"https://moveadvisor.com/biz/affiliate#get-api-key-form\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the plugin documentation here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20ip%20tracking%20happen%3F'>\nHow does the IP tracking happen?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The IP database is automatically installed when you install this plugin. <strong>The accuracy of the database is estimated to be 98%-99%.</strong> The database is maintained and updated and we will be updating it with the future plugin updates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20moving%20lead%20forms%20responsive%3F%20are%20they%20mobile%20friendly%3F'>\nAre the moving lead forms responsive? Are they mobile friendly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The forms are responsive and they display well on mobile devices based on the screen resolution. We advise that you always check the Desktop and the Mobile design of the pages where you place the moving form before you update the design of your WordPress site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20button%20text%3F'>\nCan I change the button text?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Go to the MoveAdvisor Form plugin page in your WordPress Admin panel. Under <strong>Moving Leads</strong> in section <strong>Form Design</strong> you can enter any text. Please note that this field does not support HTML or PHP tags and their attributes. Save the changes and refresh the page with the form.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20default%20color%20scheme%3F'>\nCan I change the default color scheme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin comes with 3 color options you can choose from. Each option changes the color of the outline of all input fields, the background of the autosuggest as well as the dynamic information displayed inside some input fields after values are entered (for example the notification <strong>About x days left</strong>).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20make%20a%20custom%20color%20scheme%3F%20%28for%20advanced%20users%29'>\nHow can I make a custom color scheme?

The last piece of information of each event sent is the event label.
