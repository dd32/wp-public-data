If this has happened to you, please contact your WordPress hosting provider with this message:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need to allow /ads.txt to be served directly the WP instance not as a file (we are creating that &#8220;file&#8221; dynamically). If you have a reverse proxy in front WordPress please add a rule to bypass it and send the HTTP request directly to the WordPress PHP web server. The response HTTP headers should also remain unmodified.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some caching plugins like &#8220;WP Fastest Cache&#8221; are unable to correctly cache dynamically generated files from other plugins. If your ads.txt file is not showing, please add an exception to your caching plugin for /ads.txt</p>\n</p>\n\n",
