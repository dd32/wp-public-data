It will be free of charge.<br />\nGet in touch with us via our <a href=\"https://www.clicksports.de\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20business%20website%2C%20do%20i%20need%20to%20register%20with%20you%3F'>\nI have a business website, do I need to register with you?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, a small monthly fee will be charged. Get in touch with us via our <a href=\"https://www.clicksports.de/wordpress-plugins/clicksports-maps-google-maps-alternative\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20not%20use%20google%20maps%3F'>\nWhy not use Google Maps?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no free services. If the service is free of charge, most of the time the user data is the product. This is also the case with Google Maps and for this reason the service, just like Google Analytics, is under scrutiny by German and European data protection authorities.<br />\nDue to a lack of alternatives to Google&#8217;s map service, many website operators have decided to get rid of Google Maps entirely. With CLICKSPORTS Maps, we offer an alternative in accordance with European data protection law.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20external%20resources%20are%20loaded%20while%20using%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat external resources are loaded while using this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugins loads a few external resources form our German map server in order to display the map. The map itself is based on OpenMapTiles and Mapbox.<br />\nWe off-load resources in order to provide the most up-to-date map experience. External resources include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mapbox Styles</li>\n<li>Mapbox Scripts</li>\n<li>OpenMapTiles Scripts</li>\n<li>Mapbox and OpenMapTiles configuration data</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20consent%20manager%20or%20cookie%20banner%3F'>\nDo I need a consent manager or cookie banner?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Regardless of the use of CLICKSPORTS Maps, we recommend using a consent manager to meet the requirements of the GDPR for your website. Since CLICKSPORTS Maps establishes a connection to our maps server in order to load the map data and to display the map, we believe that CLICKSPORTS Maps should be listed in the consent manager.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20clicksports%20maps%20have%20to%20be%20listed%20in%20the%20privacy%20policy%3F'>\nDoes CLICKSPORTS Maps have to be listed in the privacy policy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we recommend listing CLICKSPORTS Maps in the privacy policy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20clicksports%20maps%20compliant%20with%20the%20gdpr%3F'>\nIs CLICKSPORTS Maps compliant with the GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The map is operated on servers in Germany. This solution is data protection-friendly, as the data technically required for the map to function is stored anonymously after transmission.<br />\nLog data is used exclusively for technical monitoring of our service. The anonymized logs are automatically deleted after 14 days.<br />\nFurthermore, we as the CLICKSPORTS GmbH do not collect any personal data while fetching map data or operating the map.<br />\nThe map does not use cookies. With the prerequisite of a functioning consent manager and a clarification in the privacy policy, we consider CLICKSPORTS Maps to be compliant with the GDPR.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20map%20themes%20to%20choose%20from%3F'>\nAre there any map themes to choose from?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we currently provide 3 different map themes and customizable color for the map marker.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20choose%20any%20map%20themes%2C%20the%20select%20field%20is%20empty.'>\nI can&#8217;t choose any map themes, the select field is empty.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure the setting &#8216;allow_url_fopen&#8217; is enabled by your hosting configuration. This is neccessary because all map styles are loaded from our server. Ask your hosting provider for details on how to change this setting.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20multiple%20markers%20on%20a%20single%20map%3F'>\nCan I display multiple markers on a single map?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can create multiple map markers and display all of them on your map.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20multiple%20maps%20on%20a%20single%20page%3F'>\nCan I display multiple maps on a single page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, unfortunately this is not supported at the moment. You can, however, display individual maps beyond the global settings on another page.<br />\nSee the settings page for shortcodes and details.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20tried%20the%20full%20width%20map%20feature%2C%20but%20it%20breaks%20my%20layout.'>\nI tried the full width map feature, but it breaks my layout.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support for the full width map option heavily depends on your current theme and is out of our hands, unfortunately.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20the%20coordinates%20for%20my%20desired%20location%3F'>\nWhere can I get the coordinates for my desired location?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use a service like <a href=\"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nominatim</a> or <a href=\"https://www.latlong.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LatLong.net</a> to get<br />\nyour coordinates for the map settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
