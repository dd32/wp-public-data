We do not charge businesses any transaction, setup, or credit card fees. Instead, the cost of running WSKR is paid by the end-user. We accomplish this through the use of WSKR Tokens, which end-users buy and then use to pay for content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20people%20need%20a%20wskr%20account%20to%20view%20my%20wskr%20content%3F'>\nDo people need a WSKR account to view my WSKR content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, they need a WSKR Personal account which they can sign up for <a href=\"https://my.wskr.ie/identity/account/register\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
