        "installation": "<p>Make sure you&#8217;re using PHP 5 and the ImageMagick extension installed.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is active, you use <code>the_article_image($size);</code> function, which echoes an <code>img</code> tag for the image and caption associated with that article, at the width defined by the <code>$size</code> parameter. If there is no image, nothing is returned.</p>\n<p>Other functions include a <code>get_the_article_img($size)</code> variant, which returns, rather than echoes the <code>img</code> tag. Also, <code>the_article_photo_caption()</code> and <code>get_the_article_photo_caption()</code> which get the caption associated with that article. <code>get_the_article_photo($size)</code> works like <code>get_the_article_img($size)</code> but just returns a URL, rather than an <code>img</code> tag, and <code>the_article_photo($size)</code> returns the URL to the image, or if no image exists, to a placeholder image in the template directory called <code>img/box.png</code>.</p>\n",
