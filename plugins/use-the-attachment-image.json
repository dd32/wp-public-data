This plugin is a perfect compliment for magazine themes.</p>\n<p>This plugin can include images of nearly any size, simply by using the included <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image(); ?&gt;</code> function. See the installation page for more details regarding usage.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>To utilize this plugin, you will first need to upload <code>use_attachment_image.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory on your web server; and activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Next, place <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image() ?&gt;</code> (will include a link to the post), or <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image_nolink() ?&gt;</code> (will NOT include a link to the post) in your template to include a thumbnail of the first attachment image. Note the function must be inside of a WordPress loop.</p>\n<p>By default, this function will include a thumbnail image. To include images of different sizes, use the respective functions below. You may also use <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image_nolink() ?&gt;</code> in place of <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image() ?&gt;</code> here.</p>\n<p><strong>Thumbnail</strong> <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image('thumbnail'); ?&gt;</code><br />\n<strong>Medium</strong> <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image('medium'); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code><br />\n<strong>Large</strong> <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image('large'); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code><br />\n<strong>Full</strong> <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image('full'); ?&gt;</code><br />\n<strong>20 px</strong> <code>&lt;?php use_the_attachment_image(array(20,20)); ?&gt;</code><br />\nFeel free to replace 20px with another specific size to best meet your needs. Note that WordPress will scale a larger image down to give you the size you desire here.</p>\n<p>It is possible to include a thumbnail image from each post in your RSS feed. To do this, simply add this code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file. From <a href=\"http://cdharrison.com/2009/12/16/the_post_thumbnail-for-rss-feeds/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cd harrison</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nif (function_exists('use_the_attachment_image')) {\n    function insertAttachmentRSS($content) {\n        global $post;\n        { $content = use_the_attachment_image() . $content; }\n        return $content;\n    }\n    add_filter('the_excerpt_rss', 'insertAttachmentRSS');\n    add_filter('the_content_feed', 'insertAttachmentRSS');\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://tomlany.net/attachment-image-test/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">an example of how this plugin can be used</a>.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.02</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The code that includes the post image in an RSS feed was taken out of the plugin and moved to the readme file; as it did not previously work when it was included in a separate file from the plugin file as was suggested in the plugin instructions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the function name in the documentation. In a few cases, a function that did not exist was referenced. Thanks, <a href=\"http://www.taringacs.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Matias</a> for the report. The actual plugin was not changed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
