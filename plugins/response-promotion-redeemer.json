The plugin is developed so that once you upload you .csv you cannot change it, if you could you would run into issues with database over/rewrites.</p>\n<p>I have found that comma separated .CSV files saved on a mac will cause the import function to break. Be sure to save your .CSV files out as a &#8220;Windows Comma Separated (.csv)&#8221; if you are using a mac. Also Note: there is a link to download a template .CSV file in the right meta sidebar of the edit page window. when you create a new page or promo</p>\n</p>\n\n",
