        "installation": "<p>Simply copy &#8220;wp-postalicious.php&#8221; to the &#8220;wp-content/plugins/&#8221; folder found in your WordPress installation. Then go to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; tab inside the WordPress administration website and activate Postalicious. Finally you need to enter your account type (delicious, Google Reader, Reddit, Yahoo Pipes, Jumptags, Pinboard, or Diigo) and details as well as other Postalicious preferences in the by clicking the link labeled &#8220;Postalicious&#8221; inside the &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu on the navigation bar in the WordPress administration website.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What&#8217;s all this about SimplePie Core?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SimplePie is a PHP library that parses RSS feeds. In WordPress 2.8 and later SimplePie is already included, for previous versions of WordPress you need to install the SimplePie plugin, which you can get here: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simplepie-core/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which time zone does Postalicious use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All the dates in Postalicious use the time zone specified in the General Options tab in your WordPress administration website. Postalicious does not take into consideration Daylight Saving settings, but this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem in most cases. Also, the dates used by all the templates in Postalicious are localized in the language of your WordPress installation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Postalicious work with special (non-English) characters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In theory, yes. Postalicious 2.0 introduced some new ways to handle special characters which should work in all WordPress installations. However, if you are having problems with special characters, feel free to contact me.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I used different date formats?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Please read the section titled &#8220;Custom date formats&#8221; for more information about this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use HTML tags on the bookmark&#8217;s description?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, however you need to specify which tags do you with to allow in the Postalicious preferences. Any tags that are not in the allowed tag will we&#8217;ll be escaped and appear as-is the the bookmark&#8217;s description.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can Postalicious post one post per bookmark?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Just set the both the minimum and the maximum number of bookmarks per post to 1. Additionally, when limiting posts to one bookmark per post the %title% tag becomes available to be used in the post title template.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can Postalicious post bookmarks from multiple feeds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, thanks to <a href=\"http://maymay.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meitar Moscovitz</a>, Postalicious can now post bookmarks from multiple feeds. Each WordPress user can specify their own feed in the &#8220;Postalicious User Options&#8221; section in their profile inside the WordPress admin area. Postalicious will then fetch the newest bookmarks from each user&#8217;s feed (as well as the default feed in Postalicious settings page) and post all of the bookmarks together in a single post. Unfortunately, all of the specified feeds must use the same service for this to work properly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t the feeds from some of my users publishing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Postalicious is careful to honor the blog&#8217;s user permissions. Double-check that the user whose feed content is not getting published <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#publish_posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">has the capability to publish posts</a>. Typically, this requires the user to be an <code>Author</code>, <code>Editor</code>, or <code>Administrator</code> on your blog. In a default installation, <code>Contributor</code> or <code>Subscriber</code> feed content will be added to your WordPress blog as &#8220;Pending Review&#8221; even if Postalicious is configured to publish posts instead of creating new drafts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are tag-related features disabled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not all services support tags, other services do support tags but don&#8217;t make them available on the RSS feed. In each case I&#8217;ve tried to support tags whenever possible.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>Version 3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed gnolia support.</li>\n<li>Added support for Pinboard and Diigo.</li>\n<li>Added a button to reset all settings.</li>\n<li>Cleanup and minor bug fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.9.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>%author_name%</code> and <code>%source_link%</code> template variables (in Delicious.com service only). (Thanks Meitar!)</li>\n<li>Minor formatting improvements on settings page. (Thanks Meitar!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.9.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed tag urls for delicious.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.9.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Postalicious now honors user capabilities; if a user can not publish posts on the blog, then their feed content will be inserted as Pending Review instead of Published even if Postalicious is configured to publish posts (instead of creating draft posts).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for publishing bookmarks from multiple sources. For details on how this works, check the FAQ. (Thanks Meitar!)</li>\n<li>Added %currentdate% to the title and body templates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.8.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a possible fix for the &#8220;500 internal server error&#8221; issue some people have been reporting. (Thanks Rick!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.8.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the user-agent used to fetch the feeds, maybe this will fix the recent problems between Postalicioius and delicious feeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.8.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where Postalicious kept updating the delicious URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Postalicious now uses the bundled SimplePie version when available.</li>\n<li>Some people where having problems with Postalicious being unable to fetch the delicious feeds, unfortunately there&#8217;s not much I can do about it since it&#8217;s caused by a change in the delicious&#8217;s server configuration. A workaround is to route the delicious RSS feed through some service such as Feedburner. To enable this functionality, I&#8217;ve changed delicious to be a URL service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.7rc1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely revamped the limiting system. The new system is much more flexible and simpler to use.</li>\n<li>Postalicious now uses the post scheduling provided by WordPress to publish posts at the right time.</li>\n<li>Added custom fields with the bookmark&#8217;s info to posts created by Postalicious with only one bookmark.</li>\n<li>Improved the excerpt template.
