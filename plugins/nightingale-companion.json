It is aimed at improving performance and user experience on a site<br />\nthat uses the Nightingale theme. The plugin adds additional functionality to the theme, each component of which is<br />\nenabled by default on installation but can be switched off easily via the admin panel &gt; Settings &gt; Nightingale Companion</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable Emojis &#8211; this disables the default emoji packages that ship with WordPress, which load on every single page<br />\nof your site and impact performance and speed. This is a tiny tweak that has an incremental benefit.</li>\n<li>LoadCSS &#8211; Removed as caused a number of conflicts with some WP plugins.</li>\n<li>InstantPage &#8211; Removed as causing multiple issues on the sites.<br />\npages preloading when a user hovers their mouse over links. This does not, in fact increase load times but does appear perception of load times as those few partial<br />\nseconds pre click are actually being used to start loading the next page.</li>\n<li>DeferJS &#8211; Removed as caused a number of conflicts with some WP plugins.</li>\n<li>Set Browser Cache &#8211; Removed as caused a number of conflicts with some WP plugins. (Recommend using CloudFlare or<br />\nsimilar for better results)</li>\n<li>Cleanup WordPress meta tags &#8211; removes lots of WP native tags included in the header region.</li>\n<li>Use Excerpts as Meta Description &#8211; WordPress automatically takes the first 55 words of a post or page to create an<br />\nexcerpt (or you can manually add your own per page/post). This modification uses this excerpt to populate the meta<br />\ndescription tag. If you have an alternative method of generating this meta tag, you should disable this option.</li>\n<li>Modified the login page to use the theme design and layout</li>\n<li>Adds the emergency alert header to the theme customiser</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.<br />\n1. Install and activate the Nightingale theme from the appearance section of your WordPress site.<br />\n2. Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<br />\n3. Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress<br />\n4. Functions that the plugin adds can be activated and deactivated through the nightingale companion tab under &#8216;Settings&#8217;.</p>\n",

If the issue persists, please log an issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20restricted%20to%20only%20nhs%20organisations'>\nIs this plugin restricted to only NHS Organisations\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been built specifically for use in the NHS, but it is open source code and you are free to use it on any site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20site%20is%20doing%20weird%20stuff%20with%20loading%20or%20appearance.%20why%3F'>\nMy site is doing weird stuff with loading or appearance. Why?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have other plugins running on your site, it is possible they do things that this plugin also does and either<br />\nconflicts or duplication is happening. Try disabling options in the plugin to see what is causing the issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20give%20me%20a%20perfect%20lighthouse%20score%3F'>\nWill this give me a perfect LightHouse score?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This improves the performance and accessibility of your site. But your site scores in LightHouse will also be<br />\ninfluenced by your content, your server environment and your other plugins running on your website. We have tested this<br />\nwith sample content on a site running the Nightingale theme, this plgin and the NHSBlocks plugin. With these parameters,<br />\n we generated a 100 score in LightHouse for the metrics of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
