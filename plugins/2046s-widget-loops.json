All the programming you always wanted to avoid is gone.<br />\nThe widget covers the most routinely used content logic. The aim of this widget is to speed up the process of content structuring and simplicity of usage while keeping the standards.</p>\n<h4>Note</h4>\n<p>I highly encourage you to use the &#8220;Easy&#8221; instead of 2046&#8217;s loop widget. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">Easy</a> is a new version of 2046 loop widgets.

Most importantly the Easy is totally different animal although with similar functions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A picture better be worth a thousand words.&#8221; Don&#8217;t forget to check <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/2046s-widget-loops/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">screenshots</a>.</p>\n<h4>Localization</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>Czech</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<p>Tested with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/\" rel=\"ugc\">CCTM</a>, <a href=\"More Types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More types</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/more-taxonomies/\" rel=\"ugc\">More taxonomies</a>, <a href=\"http://wpml.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPML</a>.<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-pagenavi/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP-PageNavi</a> ready.<br />\n<a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bootstrap</a> ready.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>If you are installing 2046&#8217;s loop widgets for the first time, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>2046s-widget-loops</code> folder to <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> abs activate it in the admin plugin area.</li>\n<li>Else, download and activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; in the WordPress adimin area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Widget has no extra settings. All the settings are done in the widget area as like for any other normal widget.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I use it`?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you have to have some dynamic sidebars defined.<br />\nSome themes have them registered already, but I doubt they have them in the main content area where this loop widget meets it&#8217;s intention.<br />\n(Most of the templates have them only in so called sidebars, or header. Widgets are commonly are used for category listing, tag cloud, Facebook features etc.)<br />\n<em>The dynamic sidebar is a &#8220;slot&#8221; where you can put <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">widgets</a> with countless features.</em></p>\n<p>Log in to your admin and go to Appearance&gt;Widgets. If you don&#8217;t see the Widgets item, then your template hes no sidebars defined.<br />\nHow to <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_sidebar\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register sidebar</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do you suggest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>What I do is, that I register sidebars at least one per logical block in the webdesign layout (template).<br />\nThen using 2046&#8217;s loop widget you can place the content loops anywhere you like and how many you like.<br />\nYou can interlace them by any other widgets. By drag &amp; dropping the widgets into the dynamic sidebar areas you can easily define the structure of the whole website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about design?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your template has the most basic CSS setups then you don&#8217;t have to wary. Widgets will nicely follow the actual template CSS rules and will obediently follow the predefined<br />\ndesign. If you still needs some exceptions for this or that widget or it&#8217;s element, every widget has it&#8217;s own CSS &#8220;id&#8221; or &#8220;class&#8221; so you can easily bend them to your needs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I do not see what I have expected to see.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well the widget is fairly complex.<br />\nCheck if the restrictions are not beating each other and also check if the content you expect there really is sortable the way you like it to be.<br />\nIf none of these checks works, then let me know on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/2046s-widget-loops\" rel=\"ugc\">forum</a>, I&#8217;ll do my best.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Known bugs</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you are in the widget setting in the part [elswhere]&gt;[selected taxonomy] then the taxonomy fields are sometimes multiplied. This happens when always you drag&amp;drop the widget.<br />\nDon&#8217;t wary this is just a Javascript skin effect. If you save the widget, or you come back next time, it will be fine. (I&#8217;m working on it).</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
