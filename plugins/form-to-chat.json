Our product allows you to create simple forms that can deliver the response from the customer to your WhatsApp number. The plugin allows you to add the form as a floating widget or as a Full page or embed the form inside a page or post in your WordPress website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20coding%20is%20involved%3F'>\nHow much Coding is involved?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No coding involved! The form is created using our drag and drop builder, and to add the form to the website, you copy-paste the relevant code snippet to the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20add%20whatsapp%20form%20to%20a%20wordpress%20page%20or%20post%3F'>\nHow to add WhatsApp form to a WordPress Page or Post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add our shortcode in the format, [whatsform id=&#8221;9TF-1g&#8221;].
