        "description": "<p>Bulk Variations for WooCommerce is a powerful WordPress plugin that simplifies the process of creating and managing product variations in WooCommerce. It allows you to add a new variation attribute to all your existing products with just a few clicks, saving you a significant amount of time and effort.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the plugin offers a global price adjustment feature, enabling you to increase or decrease the prices of the newly created variations with a percentage value.</p>\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bulk Variation Creation</strong>: Create a new variation attribute for all existing WooCommerce products simultaneously. This feature eliminates the need to manually add variations for each product, streamlining the process and saving you valuable time.</li>\n<li><strong>Global Price Adjustment</strong>: Easily adjust the prices of the newly created variations by specifying a percentage value. You can either increase or decrease the prices across all variations, providing flexibility in your pricing strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Landing Page Integration</strong>: The plugin includes a shortcode <code>[variations attribute=\"your_attribute\"]</code> that generates a landing page displaying all the available variation terms (e.g., shows, exhibitions) as a grid. Customers can easily navigate and select their desired variation.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Attribute Creation</strong>: If the specified attribute doesn&#8217;t exist in your WooCommerce installation, the plugin will automatically create it, ensuring a seamless integration with your existing product catalog.</li>\n<li><strong>User-Friendly Admin Interface</strong>: The plugin provides a clean and intuitive admin interface, allowing you to configure the variation attribute name, variation term name, and pricing adjustment percentage with ease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpcorner.co/woocommerce-bulk-variations-with-global-price-adjustments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more here.</a></p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20handle%20existing%20product%20variations%3F'>\nHow does the plugin handle existing product variations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin creates new variations for all existing WooCommerce products. If a product already has variations, the new variations will be added to the existing ones.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20multiple%20variation%20attributes%20at%20once%3F'>\nCan I create multiple variation attributes at once?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the plugin currently supports creating one variation attribute at a time for all products. However, you can run the process multiple times to add different variation attributes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20support%20variable%20products%20only%3F'>\nDoes the plugin support variable products only?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the Bulk Variations for WooCommerce plugin is designed to work with variable products. It will not create variations for simple products.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20display%20the%20variations%20on%20the%20frontend%3F'>\nHow do I display the variations on the frontend?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the provided shortcode <code>[variations attribute=\"your_attribute\"]</code> on any page or post to display a grid of variation terms (e.g., shows, exhibitions). Customers can then click on the desired variation to navigate to the corresponding products.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20appearance%20of%20the%20variations%20landing%20page%3F'>\nCan I customize the appearance of the variations landing page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin generates a basic grid layout for the variations landing page. However, you can customize the appearance by overriding the CSS styles in your theme or through additional CSS rules.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
