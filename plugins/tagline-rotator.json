If you deactivate and reactivate the plugin, your taglines should appear. This is due to a change in WordPress that you can read about <a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/plugin-activation-hooks-no-longer-fire-for-updates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</strong> The Tagline Rotator plugin does pretty much what it sounds like it would do: it randomly selects a tagline<br />\n(that’s the description of your blog beneath the title) from a list of user-compiled taglines, then displays<br />\nit within your blog. It offers a couple of advantages over some of the other similar plugins I found, most<br />\nimportantly that it uses the mySQL database within WordPress, and therefore should not slow down page loads<br />\nsignificantly. As of version 1.1, it is now WP database prefix compliant, meaning it will use the database prefix stored in your WordPress settings, and should be WPMU compliant.</p>\n<h3>Known Bugs/Limitations</h3>\n<p>Of course, the current version of this plugin is 1.1, so there are a<br />\ncouple of bugs/limitations that you should know about.</p>\n<pre><code>* You must choose ‘Save Changes’ to commit any deletions or additions to the tagline database. Hopefully, this will soon be automated\n* The plugin currently does not delete the tables it creates upon de-activation (that way you don’t lose your taglines). However,\n  if you manually delete the table, WordPress will throw an error upon re-activation of the plugin. The easiest way to fix this is to change the option \n  ‘tagline_tables’ in wp_options to be ‘false’ NB: If you’re not comfortable manually editing your mySQL database, don’t worry. The table will just sit there \n  and work if you re-activate the plugin.\n* It still won’t do the dishes.&lt;h3&gt;Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes an issue where double quotes in a tagline prevent it from being deleted.

Upgrading automatically through WordPress from a previous =  will also rename the database table to use the correct prefix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated UI in Admin Settings to put Save button and add functionality at the top.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DO NOT DOWNLOAD: fixed an issue with taglines not displaying in headers, but included tagline from Settings=&gt;General by mistake.
