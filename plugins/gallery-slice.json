I know there are alternative galleries available, which support pagination, but I never thought this is a good approach. The reader never wants to see n-th page of the gallery &#8212; if the first page got his attention, then he wants to see all of the rest, not split into pages anymore. At least, this is how I see it.</p>\n<p>So, if you run a blog, on which you publish huge galleries with many many many pictures, maybe you want to show only preview of the gallery on archive pages (homepage, categories, archives etc.), so the individual posts are not too long. The gallery-preview then contains a link, which loads the rest of the gallery if the reader wishes so, via Ajax. Well, this plugin brings exactly that, all with standard WordPress gallery.</p>\n<p>Single posts are untouched, they still show full galleries, at least for now.</p>\n<p>You can reach similar functionality just by creating two galleries and putting the &lt;!&#8211;more&#8211;&gt; tag in between them &#8212; and the archive page shows only the first gallery, while single post shows the whole gallery. But, this plugin has several advantages: it can be set and forget, and then the plugin automatically applies it for every post/gallery published. If the gallery is followed by another text, then this text is still displayed on the archives page. Loading of the rest of gallery is handled by Ajax (with fallback to single-post URL if Ajax fails).</p>\n<p>In options, you specify two values: first one threshold &#8212; amount of images, if the gallery exceeds this many, it is sliced into a preview. This is the second value, how many images should be shown in a preview. This allows to have 2 different values for that, e.g. 9 images for preview, but 12 images for threshold, which makes some flexibility, that if the gallery is 10 images big, then it is not shortening by jsut one image. Anyway, you can also specify the same values, if you wish.</p>\n<p>These two values are specified on three levels: global (per blog), per post and per gallery tag. You can also specify not to slice a gallery in specific post, resp. not to slice a specific gallery.</p>\n<p>Plugin supports several lightbox implementations.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>WTFPL License 2.0 applies</p>\n<pre><code>           DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 2, December 2004\n\nCopyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar &lt;sam@hocevar.net&gt;\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified\ncopies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long\nas the name is changed.\n\n           DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\n  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n 0.
