When visitors come to your site, the source of that traffic is noted, and a different phone number (appears in the masthead of the page) for each entry channel you are tracking.Thus, making it ideal to gauge the number of inbound phone calls generated from your online marketing campaigns. The website leads phone numbers are then fed into analytics for further review and tracking purpose. So, with this, you can easily attribute value to phone calls you receive and obviously measure your advertisementâ€™s performance.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
