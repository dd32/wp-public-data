Keep your lead lists up to date and accurate.</p>\n<h4>Real-Time Email Verification</h4>\n<p>You don\\&#8217;t want any poor leads to end up on your marketing lists. They must be stopped in their tracks! To prevent users from entering wrong email addresses, integrate the TuxMailer WordPress plugin with your forms. It only accepts valid and accurate email addresses. Moreover, every email address is checked in real-time.</p>\n<h4>Easy To Get Started</h4>\n<p>It is easy and simple without being overly complicated. Merely install and activate the plugin on your website. Start by inputting the API key that you may obtain for free from the TuxMailer application, and you\\&#8217;re good to go.</p>\n<h4>Get Detailed Reports</h4>\n<p>You may examine comprehensive validation results directly in WordPress or can get your reports from the TuxMailer App. TuxMailer\\&#8217;s rigorous validation process, powerful filtering features, and fine-grained insights set it apart. It\\&#8217;s never been easier to verify your email address list. TuxMailer helps boost your marketing ROI to new heights.</p>\n",
