        "faq": "\n<h4>What kind of banners should be added to plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any! You simply paste html code of your banner. These may be AdSense codes, images uploaded to Media or banners with links.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin support banners in shortcodes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, it does. We recommend first creating banners in Datafeedr plugin, getting the shortcode there and then inserting it in Sitewide coloring plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Could the plugin enable different banners on posts and pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this option is not supported right now. However, you may enable banners only on posts or only on pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I disable showing ads on pages with specific parent?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this option is currently available in plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
