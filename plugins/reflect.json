It adds a space next to every comment where other readers can succinctly restate points they hear the commenter making. This design encourages people to explicitly <strong>listen</strong>, rather than just speaking. Commenters can come back and verify the accuracy of the restatement, and, if necessary, clarify their message. Other readers are then able to read the original comment, interpretations of that comment, and clarifications.

Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reflect works by wrapping html around certain HTML elements related to your comment section. Reflect assumes the default WordPress comment structure, but themes frequently overwrite this default structure for their own custom, arbitrary comment structure. For themes that do override the structure, the Reflect plugin allows you to specify the CSS selectors that Reflect needs to operate using the current theme. (directions, screenshots)</li>\n<li>When you get Reflect to show up, it will often not look that great and custom CSS modifications may be necessary. For example, the default Reflect CSS assumes a light, preferably white, background. But most importantly, a Reflect enabled comment board requires more horizontal space than the default WordPress comment board. Your comment section should be at least 600 px wide, and you must be willing to allocate reflect at least 250 of those pixels. We recommend a width of 800 pixels for your comment section.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A somewhat verbose <strong>screencast that walks through the install process</strong> and some of the customization steps can be found at http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/travis/installing_reflect.mp4.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo:</strong> http://abstract.cs.washington.edu/~travis/seattlespeaks/.
