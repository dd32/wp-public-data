Niether the College Media Network nor MTV Networks support or endorse this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this compatible with WordPress MU?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin was developed using WordPress MU, but does not use any MU-specific features, so it <em>should</em> be fully compatibile with WordPress as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What versions of College Publisher will this work with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was written using CP 4 export files. It has not been tested with CP 5 export files. If you have CP 5 export files and would like to send them to me, I will try to make this plugin compatible.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 introduces partial support for CP5.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this import my paper&#8217;s Custom Pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not as of now, however, if demand asks, a future version will.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
