You can create and use as many slideshows as you&#8217;d like, with different images, settings, and styles for each one of them.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First (rough) stab at a Gutenberg block</li>\n<li>Create as many slideshows with as many slides as you like</li>\n<li>Image slides</li>\n<li>Text slides</li>\n<li>YouTube Video slides</li>\n<li>Responsive</li>\n<li>Place it anywhere on your website</li>\n<li>Run multiple slideshows on the same page</li>\n<li>Change animations and handling</li>\n<li>Customizable stylesheets</li>\n<li>COMPLETELY FREE AND OPEN SOURCE</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Need the (uncompressed) source code?</h4>\n<p>The forked code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/f1rehead/Slideshow\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.<br />\nThe original project&#8217;s source code is also in a <a href=\"https://github.com/Boonstra/Slideshow\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a> repository.</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Boonstra/Slideshow\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Original Project GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/f1rehead/SlideshowSE\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Forked Project GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The same goes for text and video slides, don&#8217;t forget to save!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the slideshow to your post.<br />\nIf you are using the Classic editor, go to a post or a page and click the &#8216;Insert Slideshow&#8217; button above the editor. A popup appears where you can select your newly created slideshow to insert. You can also use the shortcode or code snippet visible in your slideshow admin panel to deploy your slideshow anywhere on your website. Use the widget to show any of your slideshows in the sidebar of your website.<br />\nIf you are using Gutenberg, add a new block and search for Slideshow SE or choose Common &gt; Slideshow SE from the blocks list. Choose the slideshow you want to add from the popup menu.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20image%20slides%3F'>\nHow do I add image slides?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the &#8216;Image slide&#8217; button in the &#8216;Slides List&#8217; of the slideshow. A screen will pop up where you&#8217;ll be able to search though all images that have already been uploaded to your WordPress website. If you want to add new images to the slideshow, or you do not have any images yet, you&#8217;ll have to upload them to the WordPress media page first.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20a%20slideshow%27s%20settings%3F'>\nHow do I change a slideshow&#8217;s settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just like the posts and pages you&#8217;re already familiar with, slideshows can be edited. Go to the &#8216;Slideshows&#8217; tab in your WordPress admin, and you&#8217;ll see a list of slideshows. If you have not created a slideshow yet, you can do so by clicking &#8216;Add new&#8217; on that same page. If there are slideshows in the list, click on the title of the slideshow you want to change the settings of. On the slideshow&#8217;s edit page you&#8217;ll be able to find a box titled &#8216;Slideshow Settings&#8217;, in this box you can change the slideshow&#8217;s settings.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re creating multiple slideshows that should have the same settings, but their settings need to be different from the default settings, you can change the default settings by going to the &#8216;General Settings&#8217; page and clicking on the &#8216;Default Slideshow Settings&#8217; tab. Newly created slideshows will start off with the settings you set there.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20customize%20the%20slideshow%27s%20style%3F'>\nHow do I customize the slideshow&#8217;s style?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On your WordPress admin page, go to the &#8216;Slideshows&#8217; menu item and click on &#8216;General Settings&#8217;, then go to the &#8216;Custom styles&#8217; tab. Here you&#8217;ll see a list of default stylesheets, such as &#8216;Light&#8217; and &#8216;Dark&#8217;, and a list of custom stylesheets; The ones you created.</p>\n<p>Choose a default stylesheet you&#8217;d like to customize and click &#8216;Customize&#8217; to open the &#8216;Custom style editor&#8217;. When you&#8217;re done editing click &#8216;Save Changes&#8217; and go to the slideshow you&#8217;d like to style with the newly created stylesheet. In the &#8216;Slideshow Style&#8217; box you can now find and select your custom stylesheet. You can set a stylesheet for multiple slideshows.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already created a custom stylesheet, you can edit it by clicking &#8216;Edit&#8217;. You can also delete it by clicking &#8216;Delete&#8217;. Be careful with this though, a deleted stylesheet cannot be retrieved and cannot be used by any slideshow anymore.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='some%20users%20can%20add%2C%20edit%20or%20delete%20slideshows%2C%20although%20i%20do%20not%20want%20them%20to.%20can%20i%20prevent%20this%20from%20happening%3F'>\nSome users can add, edit or delete slideshows, although I do not want them to. Can I prevent this from happening?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. On your WordPress admin page, go to the &#8216;Slideshows&#8217; menu item and click on &#8216;General Settings&#8217;, then go to the &#8216;User Capabilities&#8217; tab (If you&#8217;re not already there). The privileges that allow user groups to perform certain actions are listed here. To allow, for instance, a contributor to add a slideshow, click the box in front of &#8216;Contributor&#8217; to grant him the right to add slideshows.</p>\n<p>Note that when you grant someone the right to add or delete a slideshow, you&#8217;ll also automatically grant him or her the right to edit slideshows, as this right is required to add or delete slideshows. The same is true for the reversed situation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20slideshow%20does%20not%20show%20up'>\nThe slideshow does not show up\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The slideshow is mostly called after the <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag, which means the scripts and stylesheet need to load in the footer of the website. A theme that has no <code>&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;</code> call in it&#8217;s footer will not be able to load the slideshow&#8217;s scripts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Often when the slideshow isn&#8217;t showing, there&#8217;s a javascript error somewhere on the page and this error has caused javascript to break. For the slideshow to work again, this error needs to be fixed. Check if any errors were thrown by opening Google Chrome or Firefox (with Firebug installed) and press the &#8216;F12&#8217; key. Errors show in the console tab.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20internet%20explorer%20show%20a%20big%20blank%20space%20above%20the%20slideshow%3F'>\nWhy does Internet Explorer show a big blank space above the slideshow?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Internet Explorer is a very strict browser, so when a big blank space above your slideshow is showing your page may contain some invalid HTML. Most times invalid HTML is caused by placing the slideshow&#8217;s shortcode or PHP snippet into an anchor tag (<code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>) or paragraph tag (<code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>), while you can only place a slideshow within a &#8216;div&#8217; element (<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20fork%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you fork this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Good question! There are a couple reasons: First, I maintain a site that has hundreds of slideshows and, to be honest, it&#8217;s more rewarding for me to update the plugin than it is to find a new one and manually convert all the slideshows to whatever the new one is. Secondly, there is a real dearth of good quality, FREE slideshow plugins for WordPress. I&#8217;m not saying this one is the best, but it&#8217;s pretty good and more or less honors WordPress UI. There&#8217;s nothing worse than installing a new slideshow plugin only to find that your admin interface is now an ungodly color with giant, weird fonts and icons and your slideshows are now being stored in the cloud for a monthly fee. Ugh. So, primarily I&#8217;ll be maintaining this fork to suit my needs but I will entertain suggestions or pull requests. I&#8217;m (probably) not going to rewrite this plugin, but I will work to keep it functioning in the up-to-date versions of WordPress and I&#8217;ll implement new features as I need them (i.e. the Gutenberg block, which I hope to improve).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='ok%2C%20what%27s%20on%20the%20roadmap%20for%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nOK, what&#8217;s on the roadmap for this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, first up is to improve the Gutenberg block. I want to add a preview so that you can see what your post will look like on the backend. I have some good ideas on that front. Also, I want to beef up the video slide option. Just having YouTube doesn&#8217;t cut it. That will probably mean a new slide type and deprecation of the YouTube slide (but I won&#8217;t drop support for the current YouTube slides). After all that, I&#8217;m thinking about supporting either Bootstrap carousel or Slick carousel in addition to the original version. Or maybe both. I need to do some analysis to see if one is easier or if both are possible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20help%3F'>\nCan I help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! I will look at all pull requests on the Github repo. If you have any feedback or suggestions or want to volunteer, please post over on Github. While I will monitor the WordPress Support forums, I spent a lot of my day on Github so I&#8217;m more likely to see your post over there. Thanks in advance for your help in make this the best slideshow plugin available for WordPress, free or not!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
