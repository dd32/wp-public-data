It is unknown if the problem extended beyond the Themify Builder.<br />\n5) Bug fix: Animal names longer than 14 characters will show 12 characters plus an ellipsis (“…”) so that the list page layout is not disrupted.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1:<br />\n1) Bug fix: Prior to fix, sometimes PetPoint would be called for an individual animal&#8217;s record even though there was a cached item recent enough to use instead.<br />\n2) Added &#8220;sort&#8221; as a shortcode parameter. Valid values are &#8220;age&#8221;, &#8220;name&#8221;, and &#8220;weight&#8221;. Default sort is by name. Sort parameter in querystring gets precedence over sort parameter in shortcode.<br />\n3) Added &#8220;housetrained&#8221; and &#8220;on hold&#8221; as displayable fields.<br />\n4) Changed &#8220;video&#8221; icon from an image to a WordPress dashicon.<br />\n5) Added test to make sure that &#8220;site&#8221; parameter is numeric.<br />\n6) Re-stated minimum WP requirement from 5.8 to 5.7 after testing with 5.7.</p>\n<p>Version 1.0: Initial production version.</p>\n"
