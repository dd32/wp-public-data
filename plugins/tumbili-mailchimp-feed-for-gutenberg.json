If you have a killer idea for a feature submit a support request and we will see what we can do.<br />\nNote: we plan to release a premium version of the plugin which will likely receive new features first &#8211; this helps offset the cost of our development time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nThe feed looks funny in IE10 (Or other old browser)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is laid out using Flexbox, we do not have plans to support older browsers as we believe they are holding back the web. However we can (if requested) release some code which you can add to your site&#8217;s custom css in order to support certain browsers.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
