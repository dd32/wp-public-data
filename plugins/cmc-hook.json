        "faq": "\n<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<p>\n<p>wordpress 4.6.0<br />\nphp 5.5</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to install</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Upload the plugin to the wp-content\\plugins folder of your wordpress installaiton and activate it</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to use</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin create a sub menu to tools admin menu called &#8220;cmc hook&#8221;<br />\nFrom the cmc hook menu you can create hooks which can be either a filter, action or file<br />\nThe code editor of filter and action should not contain any class or function definition as they are run in annonymous functions<br />\nFile hooks can have class and function definition.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>In case there are php errors which hangs my site</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can deactivate hooks from url and even prevent all hooks from loading.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How To Deactivate hook</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To deactivate hook, pass &#8220;cmchk_neg=cmchkrtk&amp;cmchk_id=2,3&#8221; to the url. The cmchk_id is the id of the list of hooks you want to deactivate<br />\nAdd &#8220;cmchk_run_on=none&#8221; to the url parameters to prevents all hooks from loading and running.<br />\n&#8220;cmchk_neg=token&#8221; must be present in the url parameters when deactivating any hook or project. The value of which is a security token which defaults to &#8220;cmchkrtk&#8221; and can be changed at the settings of &#8220;cmc hook&#8221; menu</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are Hook Projects</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From the cmc hook menu projects can be created which houses a list of hooks and can be exported as a wordpress plugin<br />\nProjects have one main &#8220;run file&#8221; that runs when the project is loaded. This file calls all other project hooks. To include other project file hook use &#8220;cmchk_include( &#8216;slug&#8217; )&#8221; function. The id is the slug of the hook file to load<br />\nProjects action and filters are loaded automatically when the project loads  and must not be included in the run file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I Deactivate Projects</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Projects can be deactivated remotely by adding to the url parameters &#8220;cmchk_pid=4,5&#8221; where cmchk is the id of the projects to deactivate</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is safe mode</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hooks can also be run in safe mode. This allows hooks to only run when &#8220;cmchk_safe=id&#8221; is appended to the url parameters. The id is the id  of hook</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I choose not to use codemirror</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Codemirror is provided as the coded editor but can be disabled at the settings to use plain textarea</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should i use php tags</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Php codes must be code tags eg. &#8220;&#8221;. The same apply to javascript and css.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use html javascript and css in the code editor</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A misture of html, php, javascript and css can be used in the code editor</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>\n<p>cmchk_load_hook<br />\ncmchk_load_project<br />\ncmchk_editor_data_save<br />\ncmchk_project_editor_data_save<br />\ncmchk_settings_data_save<br />\ncmchk_export_projects<br />\ncmchk_import_project<br />\ncmchk_export_plugin_info<br />\ncmchk_update_slug<br />\ncmchk_get_slug<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_menu<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_section<br />\ncmchk_create_plugin_hooks<br />\ncmchk_create_plugin_file_hooks<br />\ncmchk_include_hook</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Actions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>cmchk_hook_loaded<br />\ncmchk_editor_save<br />\ncmchk_project_editor_save<br />\ncmchk_settings_save<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_settings_controls<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_hook_editor_wp_funcs<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_editor_controls_top<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_editor_controls<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_project_editor_controls<br />\ncmchk_admin_page_project_editor_controls2</p>\n</p>\n\n"
