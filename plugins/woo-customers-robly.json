You’ll also need to <a href=\"mailto:support@robly.com?subject=API access\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact Robly support</a> to get an API ID and key for your account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>API-what?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>API stands for “Application Programming Interface,” which basically means computer code that is able to talk to other computer systems and get or send information. Most API providers require an API key of some sort (similar to a username and password) to ensure that only authorized people are able to use their services.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What info is sent or received?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you install the plugin and enter your API ID and key, your WordPress site will contact the Robly API, asking for all the lists you have set up in your account. You are then able to choose certain lists to which all customers will be added, or choose certain lists to which purchasers of individual products are added, and those choices are saved in your WordPress options.</li>\n<li>When a customer makes a purchase, WordPress will contact the Robly API and search for that customer in your Robly account by their email address. If found, it will update their information; otherwise, it will create a new contact with the customer’s name, email address, and billing address, as well as the list(s) you selected.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
