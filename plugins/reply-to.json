        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>(optional) The <code>dreply.png</code> file is for dark background themes use it to replace the default <code>reply.png</code> file if you want/need.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t work! I activated the plugin but I can&#8217;t see the reply links.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They <em>should</em> be visible only when you move your mouse cursor over a comment text. If it still doesn&#8217;t work, open <code>at-reply.php</code> search for <code>visibility:hidden;</code> (line 26) and remove that part, then you can also remove the whole line 29 <code>.comment:hover .yarr { visibility:visible }</code> because it becomes useless. This will make the reply links always visible for <strong>all</strong> comments (and not just the one your mouse cursor is over).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t work! I can see the reply links but clicking them does nothing.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either you have disabled JavaScript in your browser or your WordPress theme is not using the default id for the comments textarea (which is <code>comment</code>). In the later case, check your <code>comments.php</code> file to find your textarea id, then open <code>at-reply.php</code> and replace all the <code>document.getElementById('comment')</code> with <code>document.getElementById('YOUR_ID')</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This version sucks! I prefer the old one because I could choose where I want to put the reply link.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to please everyone. For me, <strong>@ Reply</strong> should be a built-in theme feature and not a plugin. But plugins are easier to install (when it works).<br />\nYou can still download the <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/reply-to.1.0.1.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">previous version</a>, just remember to replace <code>Version: 1.0.1</code> with <code>Version: 2.8</code> (or any higher number) on line 6 so that WordPress doesn&#8217;t suggest you to update the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Possible conflicts with other plugins.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A plugin that filters the default WordPress comments functions, may prevent @ Reply from working. For example, WP_Identicon does this, but it also has an alternate setup for &#8220;advanced users&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t conflict with @ Reply.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
