        "description": "<h4>What do I get with plenigo?</h4>\n<p>Basically plenigo includes all you need to run your paid content offer.

This does include a user-friendly checkout process that does not derive your users but keeps them on your page. Currently six different payment methods are included and can be integrated just by clicking a checkbox.

        "installation": "<p>For installation instructions visit <a href=\"https://developer.plenigo.com/plugins/wordpress/\" title=\"Wordpress plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help pages</a>.</p>\n<h4>Pre Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version must be 5.4 or higher</li>\n<li>PHP cURL</li>\n<li>PHP mcrypt</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General Section</h4>\n<p><strong>Test Mode</strong><br />\nUse the test mode for testing the integration and production mode for real payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Company ID</strong><br />\nThe company id provided to you by the plenigo backend after registration of a company account.</p>\n<p><strong>Company Private Key</strong><br />\nThe company private key provided to you by the plenigo backend after registration of a company account.</p>\n<p><strong>Notify non-JavaScript user</strong><br />\nIf you are using metered views or using the plenigo user login users with deactivated JavaScript can get negative site impressions. In case of metered views deactivated JavaScript means there is no paywall at all for metered view article so the user can access them without limit. We recommend to enabled this setting.</p>\n<p><strong>non-JavaScript overlay title</strong><br />\nTitle that is shown to the user in the overlay that is shown to users with deactivated JavaScript.</p>\n<p><strong>non-JavaScript overlay message</strong><br />\nMessage that is shown to the user in the overlay that is shown to users with deactivated JavaScript.</p>\n<p><strong>Google Analytics ID</strong><br />\nIf you insert your Google Analytics ID here you will get events about the delivered curtains, etc.</p>\n<h4>OAuth2 Login Section</h4>\n<p><strong>Use OAuth2 Login</strong><br />\nThis is the base decision about your usermanagement. If you decide to use plenigo as OAuth2 Login provider all users are managed by the plenigo plugin and shadow users are created in WordPress. This way all users already registered at plenigo can login without new registration. Also the users can use the same account for payments and for writing comments, etc.<br />\nAfter enabling this you also need to insert the plenigo widget into your page.</p>\n<p><strong>Enable WordPress Login</strong><br />\nIf you select plenigo as your authentication provider you can decide if users should still see the regular WordPress login link or only see the login button via plenigo. (The later is recommended.)</p>\n<p><strong>Override WP Profile data</strong><br />\nDecide which system is the leading system. If you allow users to modify their data also within WordPress the user data can vary and you won&#8217;t get the latests data from the plenigo system transfered into your WordPress system.</p>\n<p><strong>OAuth redirect URL</strong><br />\nThis url should be set to identify the page that should handle the OAuth2 redirect result. In theory every page can do this, but after processing the user will be redirected again. So it is recommended to select a page here that can be rendered very fast, e.g. the wp-login page.</p>\n<p><strong>URL After Login</strong><br />\nIf you want the user to get redirected to a special URL after login you can define it here. If you don&#8217;t insert an URL here the user will stay on the same page after login.</p>\n<h4>Premium Content Section</h4>\n<p>The plenigo plugin controls which article is paid content by the use of WordPress tags. So before you add mappings in this section you have to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create WordPress tags that identify your payments.</li>\n<li>Create a product within the plenigo product section. (This step is optional if you only want to sell single articles.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Premium Content Products</strong><br />\nThe tag field offers auto completion for all existing WordPress tags. The product ids can be obtained by the plenigo backend product management. You can add multiple product ids to a single tag by separating them with a &#8216;,&#8217;.<br />\nIn case of the screenshot the tag payment is associated with a monthly subscription represented by its product id.</p>\n<p><strong>Premium Content Categories</strong><br />\nThe tag field offers auto completion for all existing WordPress tags. The category ids can be obtained by the plenigo backend product management. You can add multiple category ids to a single tag by separating them with a &#8216;,&#8217;.<br />\nIn case of the screenshot the tag buyButton is associated with a plenigo category that has a price of 2.99€. So every article that this tag is associated with will be buyable as a single product for the price of 2.99€</p>\n<p><strong>Prevent Payment Tag</strong><br />\nIf you add a tag here and add this tag to an article that is already marked with a tag that marks the article as paid content this decision will be reverted and the article will be free available again.</p>\n<h4>Metered Views Section</h4>\n<p><strong>Metered Views switch</strong><br />\nMetered views can be managed within the plenigo backend. If you disable metered views in the plenigo backend you should also disable them here to prevent some useless redirects that could happen to a user.</p>\n<p><strong>Metered explain URL</strong><br />\nMetered views are often new to users. So you can provide an URL here where you explain the principle to them. This URL will automatically added to the metered view flag.</p>\n<p><strong>Metered exemption tag</strong><br />\nWith the tag defined here you can exclude articles from metered views so that the content is only available to paying customers.</p>\n<h4>Curtain Customization Section</h4>\n<p>The curtain is &#8220;the heart&#8221; of your paywall. It will be shown to the user to motivate him paying. In this section you can modify the curtain. If you are an advanced user you can also overwrite the curtain template to get a completely customized curtain.</p>\n<p><strong>Curtain Title</strong><br />\nThe title of your curtain shown to the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Curtain Message</strong><br />\nThe message of your curtain shown to the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Curtain Title (for memebers)</strong><br />\nThis curtain title is shown to users that are already logged in but don&#8217;t have paid yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Curtain Message (for memebers)</strong><br />\nThis curtain message is shown to users that are already logged in but don&#8217;t have paid yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Curtain Button Scheme</strong><br />\nThis button scheme is used within the curtain if a product tag is added to an article.</p>\n<p><strong>Curtain Button Scheme (Category tag)</strong><br />\nThis button scheme is used within the curtain if a category tag is added to an article. If a product and a category tag is added to an article this scheme will be used.</p>\n<p><strong>BUY Button Text</strong><br />\nText that is shown on the buy button.</p>\n<p><strong>LOGIN Button Text</strong><br />\nText that is shown on the login button. This button can be used to provide existing users that already bought the content an easy way to log in.</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOM Button Text</strong><br />\nThe custom button is a button that doesn&#8217;t have logic implemented within. It only contains a link. This way you can redirect the user e.g. to a subscription selection page.<br />\nIn this field you set the title for this button.</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOMER Button URL</strong><br />\nThe URL the custom button should link to.</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOM Button Text (Category tag)</strong><br />\nIn this field you set the title for the button within the category scheme.</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOM Button URL (Category tag)</strong><br />\nThe URL the custom button in the category scheme should link to.</p>\n<p><strong>Buy Button Text (based on tag)</strong><br />\nYou can define different button texts for the buy button defined by the tags provided. If two tags with different button texts are provided for the same article the first tag is choosen.</p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Section</h4>\n<p><strong>Use WooCommerce Payment Gateway</strong><br />\nEnable/Disable the WooCommerce functionality of the plenigo plugin</p>\n<p><strong>Order Title Format</strong><br />\nOrder title format to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Product Type</strong><br />\nType of the product going to be sold. This is important for the tax rate that will be selected.</p>\n",
