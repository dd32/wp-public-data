The social media buttons can easily and automatically be added to all your posts, pages or any other <strong>custom post types</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the few social sharing and bookmarking plugin with full support for the <strong>Retina and high resolution displays</strong> as used in the iPad, iPhones and other devices!</p>\n<p>What sets WordPress Social Media Feather aside from the plethora of other social sharing and following WordPress plugins is its focus on simplicity, performance and social sharing impact. Social share buttons and links to your social pages are fast to setup with automatic display or social widgets.</p>\n<p>Given the widespread focus on WordPress social media integration, your site will still provide social bookmarks and share buttons to improve visibility of your posts and content and improve your overall global reach on social platforms.</p>\n<p>The <strong>WordPress social media sharing</strong> offered by the plugin includes all major social sharing buttons providers like Facebook, Twitter, reddit, Pinterest, tumblr, Linkedin and even e-mail.</p>\n<p>It will show social buttons that your users can click to share to facebook or tweet your posts and pages on your site or submit it to reddit or publish it on tumblr and all other social sharing networks.</p>\n<p>The <strong>WordPress social media following</strong> offered by the plugin includes all major social network providers and tools like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, YouTube, tumblr, instagram, flickr, foursquare, vimeo or RSS.</p>\n<p>Our social media plugin also offers widgets for sharing and following buttons that you can place in any widgetized area in your site and the widgets also expose some settings and parameters to tweak the appearance of the social buttons. The plugin also provides shortcodes that can be used for the same purpose, creating both share and follow buttons and allowing selection of visibility of different social media networks or reordering how the various social networks appear (see example shortcodes at the bottom).</p>\n<p>You can disable automatic rendering of social icons for specific posts by using <em>Custom Fields</em>. Simply set a custom field of <code>synved_social_exclude_share</code> to &#8220;yes&#8221; (without quotes) to disable rendering of sharing buttons on the post/page or <code>synved_social_exclude_follow</code> to &#8220;yes&#8221; (without quotes) to remove following buttons from the post or alternatively <code>synved_social_exclude</code> to disable both. The <em>Custom Fields</em> editor needs to be enabled on your post/page edit screen by clicking at the top right where it says &#8220;Screen Options&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated WordPress social sharing for all your posts</li>\n<li>Full support for <strong>Retina</strong> and high resolution displays</li>\n<li>WordPress social sharing and following widgets</li>\n<li>Supports all major providers of social features</li>\n<li>Sharing with Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest, Tumblr, Linkedin and E-mail</li>\n<li>Following on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, Flickr, Foursquare, Vimeo or RSS Feed</li>\n<li>Each social provider can be enabled or disabled</li>\n<li>Ability to select what services each provider will be exposed for</li>\n<li>Full customization for titles and URLs for each provider</li>\n<li>Fast unobtrusive social bookmarks for your site</li>\n<li>Comes with a default modern icon set</li>\n<li>For further customization more <a href=\"http://socialmediafeather.com/products/extra-social-icons/\" title=\"Add 8 extra social icon skins to the Social Media Feather plugin!\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">social icons skins</a> are available.

This could be because some other plugin on your site is incorrectly specifying some OpenGraph tags in your page, or simply down to a Facebook choice. In both cases the solution is to remove any plugins creating incorrect OpenGraph tags and instead installing a plugin that provides proper OpenGraph tags, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"ugc\">Yoast SEO</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20an%20opengraph%20plugin%20which%20is%20creating%20the%20proper%20tags%20but%20facebook%20is%20not%20picking%20them%20up%2C%20what%20do%20i%20do%3F'>\nI have an OpenGraph plugin which is creating the proper tags but Facebook is not picking them up, what do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This could be due to Facebook caching your page information. Go to <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Debug Tools</a> and type in the URL to the post/page, then click &#8220;Debug&#8221;. On the next screen that loads, now click on &#8220;Fetch new scraping information&#8221;; this should clear Facebook&#8217;s cache of your page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='only%20some%20or%20none%20of%20the%20social%20media%20buttons%20show%20up%2C%20what%20causes%20it%3F'>\nOnly some or none of the social media buttons show up, what causes it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have automatic display enabled or you&#8217;re displaying the social media icons using other means, like shortcodes or widgets, but some or all the buttons are not showing up in your browser, but they do show up on a fresh install of a different browser, it is possible that some of your browser add-ons are blocking the icons. This is generally caused by ad-blocking software such as Adblock or Adblock Plus. Please add your site in the exception list for these add-ons and your social icons should show up again.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20clicking%20on%20any%20share%20button%2C%20i%27m%20getting%20an%20error%20of%20%22the%20requested%20content%20cannot%20be%20loaded.%20please%20try%20again%20later.%22%20how%20do%20i%20fix%20it%3F'>\nWhen clicking on any share button, I&#8217;m getting an error of &#8220;The requested content cannot be loaded.

The social media buttons can easily and automatically be added to all your posts, pages or any other <strong>custom post types</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the few social sharing and bookmarking plugin with full support for the <strong>Retina and high resolution displays</strong> as used in the iPad, iPhones and other devices!</p>\n<p>What sets WordPress Social Media Feather aside from the plethora of other social sharing and following WordPress plugins is its focus on simplicity, performance and social sharing impact. Social share buttons and links to your social pages are fast to setup with automatic display or social widgets.</p>\n<p>Given the widespread focus on WordPress social media integration, your site will still provide social bookmarks and share buttons to improve visibility of your posts and content and improve your overall global reach on social platforms.</p>\n<p>The <strong>WordPress social media sharing</strong> offered by the plugin includes all major social sharing buttons providers like Facebook, Twitter, reddit, Pinterest, tumblr, Linkedin and even e-mail.</p>\n<p>It will show social buttons that your users can click to share to facebook or tweet your posts and pages on your site or submit it to reddit or publish it on tumblr and all other social sharing networks.</p>\n<p>The <strong>WordPress social media following</strong> offered by the plugin includes all major social network providers and tools like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, YouTube, tumblr, instagram, flickr, foursquare, vimeo or RSS.</p>\n<p>Our social media plugin also offers widgets for sharing and following buttons that you can place in any widgetized area in your site and the widgets also expose some settings and parameters to tweak the appearance of the social buttons. The plugin also provides shortcodes that can be used for the same purpose, creating both share and follow buttons and allowing selection of visibility of different social media networks or reordering how the various social networks appear (see example shortcodes at the bottom).</p>\n<p>You can disable automatic rendering of social icons for specific posts by using <em>Custom Fields</em>. Simply set a custom field of <code>synved_social_exclude_share</code> to &#8220;yes&#8221; (without quotes) to disable rendering of sharing buttons on the post/page or <code>synved_social_exclude_follow</code> to &#8220;yes&#8221; (without quotes) to remove following buttons from the post or alternatively <code>synved_social_exclude</code> to disable both. The <em>Custom Fields</em> editor needs to be enabled on your post/page edit screen by clicking at the top right where it says &#8220;Screen Options&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated WordPress social sharing for all your posts</li>\n<li>Full support for <strong>Retina</strong> and high resolution displays</li>\n<li>WordPress social sharing and following widgets</li>\n<li>Supports all major providers of social features</li>\n<li>Sharing with Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Pinterest, Tumblr, Linkedin and E-mail</li>\n<li>Following on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin, YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram, Flickr, Foursquare, Vimeo or RSS Feed</li>\n<li>Each social provider can be enabled or disabled</li>\n<li>Ability to select what services each provider will be exposed for</li>\n<li>Full customization for titles and URLs for each provider</li>\n<li>Fast unobtrusive social bookmarks for your site</li>\n<li>Comes with a default modern icon set</li>\n<li>For further customization more <a href=\"http://socialmediafeather.com/products/extra-social-icons/\" title=\"Add 8 extra social icon skins to the Social Media Feather plugin!\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">social icons skins</a> are available.
