        "description": "<p><strong>Media Organizer</strong>. You can now organize your photos in folders and collections. From those collections, you will be able to create galleries easily, without the need of a specific plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Synchronize with Lightroom</strong>. Upload and keep your photos, collections, keywords and metadata synchronized with WordPress. Then, for instance, modifying your photos, their quality, or changing your watermark on all of them at once will be easy!</p>\n<p>Learn more about it all here: <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Photo Engine</a>.</p>\n<h3>Media Organizer</h3>\n<p>You can use attributes (collections=&#8217;&#8230;&#8217;, keywords=&#8217;&#8230;&#8217;) in the standard WP Gallery shortcode to link your galleries to your collections and keywords. No need to own a specific plugin or anything, it works naturally with WordPress. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">Meow Gallery</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-lightbox/\" rel=\"ugc\">Meow Lightbox</a> are recommended to enhance your galleries with better layouts and options. They can directly get your collections.</p>\n<h3>Synchronize with Lightroom</h3>\n<p>If your plan is to synchronize Lightroom with WordPress, you will also need the WP/LR Sync Plugin for Lightroom. Please have a look at the official website of <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Photo Engine</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Do you have many photos in your WordPress already and they are not linked with your Lightroom? No problem, Photo Engine can do that too. Using EXIF and image perceptual analysis, the plugin will help you linking them through a process call Total Synchronization or you can do it manually. The process is explained here: <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Total Synchronization</a>.</p>\n<p>You are using a certain photo everywhere but you now have a better one? From Lightroom, you can swap one photo to another and this will be replicated automatically on your WordPress. You have nothing else to do. The module is called &#8220;Switch Photos&#8221; in Lightroom.</p>\n<h3>Support for Themes and Plugins</h3>\n<p>If you are using specific gallery plugins or photography themes, Photo Engine can bring all the power of Lightroom to them, magically, seamlessly. You will be free to choose the theme or gallery plugin you like the best and even switch between them. Photo Engine has a built-in extensions system so that you can extend it easily and support specific themes and plugins. A powerful extension called &#8220;Post Types&#8221; is already included and probably does everything you need. More information about it here: <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Post Types Extension</a>.</p>\n<h3>API &amp; External Apps</h3>\n<p>There is an external API available through Photo Engine that iPhone, Android developers or anybody else can use to make apps. There is one available for iPhone, you can search for it on the iTunes Store (it is not free, and not made by Meow Apps).</p>\n<h3>Unique &amp; Powerful Plugin</h3>\n<p>I am myself an user of this plugin and even though it is the only one, I want to make it better every day. If you have issues, frustrations, or anything to say, contact me. I will work hard to make it even more awesome.</p>\n<p>Languages: English, Spanish (by <a href=\"https://nbadiola.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nahuai Badiola</a>). If you want to translate the plugin in another language, please contact me ðŸ™‚</p>\n",

The Theme Assistant also needs to be updated if you are using it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add: Explorer mode has been added. It is added dynamically to the Media Library and the Add or Edit Media modals in the Editor. It&#8217;s lighter than RML but it doesn&#8217;t replace it in terms of features. It will be kept simple and straightforward. Please check the Settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Info: This is a big update.

Wasn&#8217;t a big issue, but still, it was not clean.</li>\n<li>Fix: Extension for RML will not be loaded if the RML plugin is not active.</li>\n<li>Add: In the Debugging Tools &gt; Hierarchy, it is now possible to remove collections/folders. Useful when LR creates a collection/folder on the server and that the reply is not handled (in case of slow or cut connection).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Broken pages in the admin of WP/LR Sync after code cleaning.</li>\n<li>Fix: Avoid to break if the EXIF within the images is broken.</li>\n<li>Update: Full support for Real Media Library. Please check the Extensions menu in WP/LR Sync.</li>\n<li>Update: Removed the donation button in the screens.</li>\n<li>Add: Post Type, mode added. &#8220;Array in Post Meta&#8221; let you use a post meta to update your galleries (now handle many more themes and plugins).</li>\n<li>Fix: Post Type, handle removed Featured Image nicely by replacing it by an available one automatically.</li>\n<li>Add: Options for theme developers using Post Types.</li>\n<li>Add: Extension for Real Media Library.

By default, accents will be replaced by non-accented characters.</li>\n<li>Add: Supports the REST protocol. Now the Lightroom plugin will have the choice to use either XML/RPC or REST as a protocol, which might remove a lot of XML/RPC related issues. You will need to use the newest version of the LR plugin, not available publicly yet (but soon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Change the way a few things were called, and the description.</li>\n<li>Fix: Post type extension was always created new post with the default category (called Uncategorized by default).</li>\n<li>Fix: Unlink and Delete links in the Media Tools weren&#8217;t working.</li>\n<li>Add: Extension &#8220;Post Types&#8221; now supports two new options. First, is that keywords can be linked to a taxonomy. Second is that a post-type can be created either as publish or draft.</li>\n<li>Update: Extension &#8220;Post Types&#8221; has more options. Now can sync with existing post in your post-type and term in your taxonomy. For example, you can link your LR collection to your already existing album/collection on WordPress. Same with the categories, folders, etc. I probably need to write a tutorial about this one day but for advanced users it will be easy to figure out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: New Extension! Called Post Types. Handle custom Post Types and Taxonomies (to support more themes and plugins). Plase try it out to sync your Collections and Folders/Sets.

Added categories (based on LR collections) and keywords.</li>\n<li>Info: Basic Posts is becoming a very good example of the power of those extensions. I will improve depending on your requests ðŸ™‚</li>\n<li>Info: A new version of the plugin for LR is required (2.2.0) for this new hierarchical keywords support. Check https://meowapps.com.</li>\n<li>Update: WP 4.3 support.</li>\n<li>Info: There is a new version of the plugin for Lightroom since today (2015/08/20).</li>\n<li>Info: Please update it to avoid the NOT_MEOWAPPS issue to appear in LR (which is fixed by log-off + log-on).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add: Collections support.</li>\n<li>Add: Tags support for media.</li>\n<li>Add: Many actions for other plugins and extensions to use.</li>\n<li>Add: 3 internal extensions added: Basic Posts, Basic Galleries and Logging.</li>\n<li>Update: Bigger menu for WP/LR Sync, everything has been re-organized.</li>\n<li>Update: Debugging Tools for WP/LR Sync now accessible through an option.</li>\n<li>Fix: Multisite is now supported.</li>\n<li>Info: That&#8217;s a BIG update.

    "description": "<p><strong>Media Organizer</strong>. You can now organize your photos in folders and collections. From those collections, you will be able to create galleries easily, without the need of a specific plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Synchronize with Lightroom</strong>. Upload and keep your photos, collections, keywords and metadata synchronized with WordPress. Then, for instance, modifying your photos, their quality, or changing your watermark on all of them at once will be easy!</p>\n<p>Learn more about it all here: <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Photo Engine</a>.</p>\n<h3>Media Organizer</h3>\n<p>You can use attributes (collections=&#8217;&#8230;&#8217;, keywords=&#8217;&#8230;&#8217;) in the standard WP Gallery shortcode to link your galleries to your collections and keywords. No need to own a specific plugin or anything, it works naturally with WordPress. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">Meow Gallery</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-lightbox/\" rel=\"ugc\">Meow Lightbox</a> are recommended to enhance your galleries with better layouts and options. They can directly get your collections.</p>\n<h3>Synchronize with Lightroom</h3>\n<p>If your plan is to synchronize Lightroom with WordPress, you will also need the WP/LR Sync Plugin for Lightroom. Please have a look at the official website of <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Photo Engine</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Do you have many photos in your WordPress already and they are not linked with your Lightroom? No problem, Photo Engine can do that too. Using EXIF and image perceptual analysis, the plugin will help you linking them through a process call Total Synchronization or you can do it manually. The process is explained here: <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Total Synchronization</a>.</p>\n<p>You are using a certain photo everywhere but you now have a better one? From Lightroom, you can swap one photo to another and this will be replicated automatically on your WordPress. You have nothing else to do. The module is called &#8220;Switch Photos&#8221; in Lightroom.</p>\n<h3>Support for Themes and Plugins</h3>\n<p>If you are using specific gallery plugins or photography themes, Photo Engine can bring all the power of Lightroom to them, magically, seamlessly. You will be free to choose the theme or gallery plugin you like the best and even switch between them. Photo Engine has a built-in extensions system so that you can extend it easily and support specific themes and plugins. A powerful extension called &#8220;Post Types&#8221; is already included and probably does everything you need. More information about it here: <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/wplr-sync/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Post Types Extension</a>.</p>\n<h3>API &amp; External Apps</h3>\n<p>There is an external API available through Photo Engine that iPhone, Android developers or anybody else can use to make apps. There is one available for iPhone, you can search for it on the iTunes Store (it is not free, and not made by Meow Apps).</p>\n<h3>Unique &amp; Powerful Plugin</h3>\n<p>I am myself an user of this plugin and even though it is the only one, I want to make it better every day. If you have issues, frustrations, or anything to say, contact me. I will work hard to make it even more awesome.</p>\n<p>Languages: English, Spanish (by <a href=\"https://nbadiola.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nahuai Badiola</a>). If you want to translate the plugin in another language, please contact me ðŸ™‚</p>\n",
