        "faq": "\n<h4>FAQ</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Where do the images displayed come from?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images are based on the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; selected on the Edit Post screen. If the option is not displayed, click Screen Options in the top right of the Edit Post screen and check the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; checkbox.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I changed the size of the grid items, but my images didn&#8217;t change size. What do I need to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any new image added to your site should have a thumbnail created in the correct new size. However, the old thumbnails will need to be regenerated. This can be done for all images on your site with the excellent <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"ugc\">&#8220;Regenerate Thumbnails&#8221; plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting an error: &#8220;Call to undefined function has_post_thumbnail()&#8221;, and I can&#8217;t add a &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; to my posts.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This issue is typically caused by templates that don&#8217;t enable post thumbnails. If your template&#8217;s functions.php file does not contain this, you must add it:</p>\n<pre><code>add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I have the &#8220;Display Excerpts&#8221; option selected, but I&#8217;m not seeing anything</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will currently only display manually entered excerpts. Automatically generated excerpts will not be displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I save my settings, I get an error that says statics JS and/or CSS files can&#8217;t be saved. What can I do to fix this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you get this error, it means that the permissions on your server aren&#8217;t setup to let WordPress write directly to a file. To resolve this you&#8217;ll need to temporarily change the permissions on this plugin&#8217;s css and js directories, click &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; on the admin page, and then change the permissions back.</p>\n<p>You can change the permissions on your server either by using SSH or a config menu on your hosting service&#8217;s site (if they allow you to directly change permissions). With SSH access, navigate into the featured-posts-grid directory and enter &#8220;chmod 777 css js&#8221;, click &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; on the admin page, and then change permissions back with &#8220;chmod 755 css js&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
