        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhy should I protect my mobile device? Don&#8217;t they have warranty?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For most of us, our mobile devices are our connection to the outside world. But every day, people lose access to that connection due to things like mechanical or electrical breakdown, accidental damage, loss or theft. A manufacturer’s warranty typically covers just mechanical or electrical failure, and only for a year. simplesurance mobile protection plans cover much more than that, for years beyond the warranty. Protection plans protect your mobile device from a wide variety of perils including theft, breakage, spills, malfunction and accidental damages. In addition an easy claim process will get you a repair or replacement quickly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
