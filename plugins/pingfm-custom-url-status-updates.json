Keep reading for a full list of features<br />\nbelow&#8230;</p>\n<h4>Minimum System Requirements</h4>\n<p>This plugin has required PHP 5 for quite a while, but the increased<br />\nrequirements below are in line with the new standard coming in WordPress 3.2.<br />\nOther version of PHP/MySQL might work just fine, but I personally use even<br />\nlater versions of both for development and testing. The minimums listed below<br />\nare just that&#8212;minimums. My advice is to use the latest stable versions you<br />\ncan get your hands on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.0</li>\n<li>PHP 5.2.0</li>\n<li>MySQL 5.0.15</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A Quick Note About Donations</h4>\n<p>Starting with version 2.0.0 of this plugin, I added a PayPal donation link to<br />\nthe information box in the upper-right corner of the page. Let me be clear: I&#8217;m<br />\n<strong>not</strong> soliciting donations, there is no charge for this plugin, and you are<br />\n<strong>not</strong> obligated to give me any money for any reason. However, people have<br />\nasked me if they could donate, and I wanted to facilitate that if you feel so<br />\ninclined.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent countless hours developing and supporting this plugin, but it&#8217;s<br />\nmostly a labor of love. I first created the plugin to meet my own needs, and<br />\nit&#8217;s kind of taken off from there. If you feel that the plugin has been useful<br />\nto you in some way, I&#8217;d be honored to take your money and spend it on gadgets<br />\nand firearm accessories.</p>\n<h4>Ye Olde Features Liste</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Works with Ping.fm&#8217;s Custom URL feature to collect blog entries, micro-blog<br />\nentries, and status updates and post them to your blog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photos posted through Ping.fm can be downloaded to your own blog and<br />\ndisplayed as part of a normal post. It&#8217;s a super-easy way to set up an<br />\nawesome self-hosted mobile photo blog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Status updates and micro-blogs can be administered through a native<br />\nWordPress management screen while blogs are, well&#8230; normal blog entries!<br />\nEvery feature of this plugin is tightly integrated with WordPress to<br />\nprovide a native look and feel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A beautiful settings page with predefined smart defaults and contextual<br />\nhelp when you need it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Status updates are posted to the sidebar and displayed with a widget. A<br />\nstandard template tag is also provided for those of you who are<br />\nanti-widget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The sidebar widget is customizable with the number of status updates to<br />\nshow and an optional string to prepend all updates with (e.g. you might use<br />\nyour first name if all your status updates begin with a verb like mine do:<br />\nMatt is&#8230;). Sensible CSS and examples are provided for you to customize<br />\nthe look and feel of your widget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Provides an RSS feed and permalinks for your pings so that you can share<br />\nthem with the rest of the world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blog entries and micro-blog entries can have certain metadata applied to<br />\nthem automatically. You can set the author, category, tags, and post status<br />\n(published or draft) for all incoming pings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All the cool features of Ping.fm: post to your self-hosted WordPress blog<br />\nusing SMS, IM, email, desktop gadgets, mobile apps, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Template Tag Usage</h3>\n<p>void <strong>wp&#095;pingfm&#095;status</strong> ( [ int <code>$limit</code> [, string <code>$prefix</code> [, bool <code>$permalink</code> ]]] )</p>\n<p>Displays status updates in an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>). All parameters are<br />\noptional.</p>\n<h4>Parameters</h4>\n<p><em>limit</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The number of status updates to show. Default value is 10. Depending on your<br />\n  needs and the location on the page, a value between 5 and 15 is usually pretty<br />\n  reasonable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>prefix</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some text to display before every status update. Default value is nothing.<br />\n  This can be useful if all of your status updates begin with a verb. For<br />\n  example, you might post &#8220;going to the store&#8221; from Ping.fm. If your prefix is<br />\n  &#8220;Matt is&#8221;, the final output will be &#8220;Matt is going to the store&#8221;. Neat, huh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>permalink</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether to show timestamps as permalinks, a la Twitter. The archive page is<br />\n  editable via the <code>tmpl-single.php</code> template file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Example</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the Twenty Ten theme that ships with WordPress 3.0, you might<br />\nput the following into your <code>sidebar.php</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;li id=\"pingfm\" class=\"widget-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h3 class=\"widget-title\"&gt;Status Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;?php wp_pingfm_status(); ?&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>mixed <strong>wp&#095;pingfm&#095;latest</strong> ( void )</p>\n<p>Retrieves the single most recent ping (status update) from the database.</p>\n<h4>Return Values</h4>\n<p>A <code>stdClass</code> object representing the latest ping, if it exists. Otherwise,<br />\nfalse. The object will contain the properties listed below. For more<br />\ninformation, dig through the source of the WordPress <code>get_posts()</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code>ID\npost_author\npost_date\npost_date_gmt\npost_content\npost_title\npost_excerpt\npost_status\ncomment_status\nping_status\npost_password\npost_name\nto_ping\npinged\npost_modified\npost_modified_gmt\npost_content_filtered\npost_parent\nguid\nmenu_order\npost_type\npost_mime_type\ncomment_count\nfilter\n</code></pre>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Extract the .zip file you downloaded to a directory under<br />\n    /wp-content/plugins/. The default will be the full name of this plugin<br />\nproject, which is <code>pingfm-custom-url-status-updates</code>. Alternatively, you<br />\ncan search for this plugin from the WordPress admin area and install it<br />\nthat way, or just <a href=\"http://coveredwebservices.com/wp-plugin-install/?plugin=pingfm-custom-url-status-updates\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here</a><br />\nto use Mark Jaquith&#8217;s plugin installer tool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to WordPress Admin &gt; Plugins &gt; <strong>Ping.fm Settings</strong> to get your<br />\ncustom URL and then follow the instructions on that page to link up with<br />\nyour Ping.fm account. Essentially, you just want to copy and paste the<br />\ngiven URL into your Ping.fm Custom URL settings. Feel free to change any<br />\nother settings on that page (it is <em>your</em> blog, after all). If you need to<br />\nspecify a default category for incoming posts, and that category doesn&#8217;t<br />\nexist yet, go and create it first, and then come back and select it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Head over to WordPress Admin &gt; Design &gt; <strong>Widgets</strong> and add the &#8216;Ping.fm&#8217;<br />\nwidget to your sidebar. If you click the &#8216;Edit&#8217; link in the activated<br />\nwidget, you&#8217;ll be able to configure a whole slew of options to your liking.<br />\nIf your theme is non-widgetized, or if you just have a bias against widgets<br />\nfor some reason, you can use the <code>wp_pingfm_status()</code> template tag instead.<br />\nMore information about that is on the (Other Notes)[other_notes/] page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post something to your Ping.fm account and let the good times roll! If<br />\nnothing shows up at first, it&#8217;s probably because you haven&#8217;t posted anything<br />\nyet. (It seems obvious, but you&#8217;d be surprised.) Only updates made <em>after</em><br />\nyou install the plugin will show up, and even then, only after you&#8217;ve told<br />\nPing.fm to post to your custom URL. And, on the Ping.fm side, be sure to<br />\ncheck the appropriate boxes for the kinds of updates you&#8217;d like to send to<br />\nyour custom URL. Finally, if you don&#8217;t think your status updates are<br />\nshowing up, make sure the widget has been added to your sidebar and that<br />\nyou&#8217;ve saved the changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For those about to ping, we salute you!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I change the number of status updates displayed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, of course you can! Go to your sidebar widgets and hit the &#8216;Edit&#8217; link for<br />\nthe Ping.fm widget. This is all mentioned in the installation instructions, but<br />\nI can see that you&#8217;re the impatient type that never reads anything. I bet you<br />\ndidn&#8217;t read the owner&#8217;s manual for your car, either, huh?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I not seeing any updates in my sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well&#8230; have you posted any yet? Only status updates posted to Ping.fm <em>after</em><br />\ninstalling the plugin and <em>after</em> configuring the custom URL will show up on<br />\nyour blog. If you&#8217;re confident you&#8217;ve done everything right, there might be<br />\nsomething else going on. You might have discovered a bug, or an &#8220;undocumented<br />\nfeature&#8221; as we software engineers like to call them. Send me some sugar at<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:m&#x61;&#116;&#x74;&#064;&#x6d;&#097;&#x74;&#116;&#x6a;&#097;&#x63;&#111;&#x62;&#046;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">m&#x61;&#116;&#x74;&#064;&#x6d;&#097;&#x74;&#116;&#x6a;&#097;&#x63;&#111;&#x62;&#046;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a> and I&#8217;ll see what I can do.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t pings coming through to my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Read the question immediately preceding this one once more. Done? Now go through<br />\nthe checklist below and make sure everything is kosher:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is your site blocked off from others using HTTP Basic Authentication or some<br />\nother method? Do you have firewall rules restricting users to a certain IP<br />\nrange?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are you using any WordPress plugins that limit outside access? I&#8217;ve seen<br />\nproblems related to the Bad Behavior plugin in the past.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can you hit the &#8220;secret posting URL&#8221; from your browser? You should get an<br />\nerror message, which is a good sign that the plugin is installed and<br />\nworking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you have some boxes checked over at the<br />\n<a href=\"https://ping.fm/custom/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom URL Settings</a> page? Next to <em>Use for:</em>, you<br />\nneed at least one of those options selected (preferably all three).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under the main <a href=\"http://ping.fm/settings/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ping.fm Service Settings</a>, is the<br />\nbox checked next to the <em>Post messages to Custom URL</em> option? This is<br />\nimportant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you&#8217;re only posting status updates or micro-blogs from Ping.fm, is the<br />\nwidget activated and placed somewhere?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I post blog entries or pages from my Ping.fm account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The original answer was a defiant &#8220;get off my lawn, you damn kids!&#8221; That lasted<br />\nfor a whole point release. By popular demand&#8212;and thanks in no small part to<br />\nRocco and Vinny, who were sent to convince me&#8212;the ability to post blog entries<br />\nhas been available since 0.9.2. Support for creating pages might be added in a<br />\nfuture release. Give the people want they want, right?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work with WordPress.com blogs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Definitely not. That would be goofy, because WordPress.com blogs don&#8217;t allow<br />\nplugins. Plus, Ping.fm already has <a href=\"http://ping.fm/blog/wordpress-bots-you-betcha/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support</a><br />\nfor WordPress.com hosted blogs anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you add feature X, Y, and Z? And Q? And L?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I <em>could</em> add all kinds of features, but the real question is whether I<br />\n<em>should</em>. The intent and operation of this plugin was meant to be simple, but<br />\ngo ahead and pitch your feature idea to me. If it&#8217;s not too outrageous and I<br />\nthink others would benefit from it, I&#8217;ll probably add it to a future version of<br />\nthe plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed edge case where &#8220;<strong>Fatal error</strong>: Call to undefined function<br />\nwp_create_category()&#8221; would be triggered if the <code>pingfm_options</code> record was<br />\nmanually deleted from the <code>wp_options</code> table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Transitioned away from a separate database table holding status updates to<br />\nWordPress&#8217;s new &#8220;custom post types&#8221; that were introduced in 3.0. This had<br />\nthe added bonus of providing &#8220;real&#8221; single post pages for status updates<br />\nand micro-blogs, and a native WordPress interface for managing it all.</li>\n<li>Added true support for images sent from Ping.fm. They&#8217;re now downloaded<br />\nlocally and given first-class treatment (like any other uploaded media).</li>\n<li>Redesigned the entire settings page and rewrote much of the help content.</li>\n<li>Rewrote much of the code and split it out into separate classes for<br />\nperformance and organizational reasons.</li>\n<li>Fixed timestamp offset bug (again). Hopefully fixed for good this time.</li>\n<li>Added robust upgrade functionality designed to be extended to future<br />\nreleases as well as this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed timezone handling throughout the plugin. Be sure to set a named<br />\ntimezone (the city closest to you) in <em>General Settings</em>, or else your<br />\ntimestamps might not be correct.</li>\n<li>Fixed invalidly-nested <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> element in the widget.</li>\n<li>Minor code beautification. Very minor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Further tweaking of the way rewrite rules are filtered and flushed. In some<br />\ncases, rewrite rules weren&#8217;t taking affect immediately after a brand-new<br />\ninstallation of the plugin, but that should be remedied with this release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweaked the rewrite rules a little more. There were some edge cases where<br />\nother things would overwrite our rules, but that should be fixed now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for displaying images associated with pings. A corresponding<br />\noption has been added to the settings page.</li>\n<li>Added specific check for PHP 4 to prevent code from even being parsed if<br />\nan insufficient version of PHP is found.</li>\n<li>Failure for PHP 4 now handled gracefully instead of with a syntax error.</li>\n<li>Moved flushing of rewrite rules to only happen on plugin activation and<br />\nnot on every page load. This should have a noticeable positive impact on<br />\nperformance. The only downside is that the plugin will have to be<br />\ndeactivated and reactivated if pretty permalinks are enabled (a worthy<br />\ntrade-off in my opinion).</li>\n<li>Cleaned up the code in various places to make it more readable (especially<br />\nwith regard to the error message pseudo-constants).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Primarily a documentation release. Lots of stuff in the README was<br />\nclarified, fortified, beautified, and just plain shifted around.</li>\n<li>Fixed a small bug related to a new option that was added in 1.2.0. After<br />\nsaving the options twice, the problem would have fixed itself anyway.</li>\n<li>Added screenshots for the benefit of the WordPress Plugin Directory.</li>\n<li>Moved the changelog off of my site and into the Plugin Directory to give<br />\npeople a more central point of contact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to force all status updates to become actual posts.</li>\n<li>Added option in widget to &#8220;permalinkify timestamps&#8221; (archive page is<br />\neditable via <code>tmpl-single.php</code>).</li>\n<li>Invented new English word: <em>permalinkify</em>.</li>\n<li>Tried to make the settings page clearer and easier to understand.</li>\n<li>Did some code housekeeping.</li>\n<li>Added Ping.fm logo to settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete code rewrite (PHP 4 procedural to PHP 5 OO) and new way of storing<br />\nsettings in the database.</li>\n<li>Did away with external <code>ping.php</code> file for receiving updates.</li>\n<li>Added native WordPress URL hooks and internal support for <code>mod_rewrite</code>.</li>\n<li>Added RSS feed containing 20 most recent status updates.</li>\n<li>Added archive/permalink pages for individual pings (mostly in conjunction<br />\nwith RSS feed, but can be used elsewhere as well). Page is templated for<br />\neasy customization.</li>\n<li>Provided interface for user-supplied widget styles (CSS).</li>\n<li>Widget HTML/CSS makes more sense. Widget container has an ID of <code>wp-pingfm</code><br />\nand a class of <code>wp-pingfm-widget</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>wp_pingfm_status()</code> for people using non-widgetized themes. See<br />\n<em>Other Notes</em> section for docs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS is now targeting <code>#pingfm</code> in a less specific way (because it broke on<br />\nthemes with multiple sidebars).</li>\n<li>Fixed random bug only seen in WebKit where a space preceding a status update<br />\nwas considered significant whitespace. (Don&#8217;t ask me&#8212;I don&#8217;t build it, I<br />\njust code to it.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The first non-beta release!</li>\n<li>Modified <code>CREATE TABLE</code> for installer after reports of it failing on MySQL<br />\nversions &lt; 4.1.</li>\n<li>Added check for widget to determine if database table was created properly.</li>\n<li>Tweaked a few textual things here and there.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This version was never released publicly and the changes made for it were<br />\nrolled into 1.0.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <a href=\"http://mattjacob.com/pingfm-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a> as a home<br />\nbase for the plugin on my site.</li>\n<li>Made the README more readable (hopefully). The documentation should be<br />\neasier to understand now.</li>\n<li>Fixed the <code>mod_rewrite</code> example to include the <code>[L]</code> flag. The entire line<br />\ndidn&#8217;t get copied from my conf file the first time around.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor textual changes and a speed enhancement (eliminated a DB call using<br />\nsome crafty coding).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added widget options to specify colors used in injected style sheet (CSS).</li>\n<li>Reorganized, streamlined, and beautified some code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fortified README with some additional information and a <code>mod_rewrite</code><br />\nexample for shortening the inevitably long URL.</li>\n<li>The plugin now auto-detects the directory it&#8217;s running from. Anything under<br />\n    /wordpress/wp-content/plugins should work reasonably well. If the<br />\nWordPress Plugin Directory wants to create a really long folder structure,<br />\nso be it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for all types of Ping.fm updates. Blog and micro-blog posts<br />\nnow show up as actual entries in WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial public release! After being hacked together with loving care<br />\nduring a couple late nights, the code finally sees the light of day. Cue<br />\nangelic choir and bright background light&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n"

Depending on your<br />\n  needs and the location on the page, a value between 5 and 15 is usually pretty<br />\n  reasonable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>prefix</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some text to display before every status update. Default value is nothing.<br />\n  This can be useful if all of your status updates begin with a verb. For<br />\n  example, you might post &#8220;going to the store&#8221; from Ping.fm. If your prefix is<br />\n  &#8220;Matt is&#8221;, the final output will be &#8220;Matt is going to the store&#8221;. Neat, huh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>permalink</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether to show timestamps as permalinks, a la Twitter. The archive page is<br />\n  editable via the <code>tmpl-single.php</code> template file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Example</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the Twenty Ten theme that ships with WordPress 3.0, you might<br />\nput the following into your <code>sidebar.php</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;li id=\"pingfm\" class=\"widget-container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h3 class=\"widget-title\"&gt;Status Updates&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;?php wp_pingfm_status(); ?&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>mixed <strong>wp&#095;pingfm&#095;latest</strong> ( void )</p>\n<p>Retrieves the single most recent ping (status update) from the database.</p>\n<h4>Return Values</h4>\n<p>A <code>stdClass</code> object representing the latest ping, if it exists. Otherwise,<br />\nfalse. The object will contain the properties listed below. For more<br />\ninformation, dig through the source of the WordPress <code>get_posts()</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code>ID\npost_author\npost_date\npost_date_gmt\npost_content\npost_title\npost_excerpt\npost_status\ncomment_status\nping_status\npost_password\npost_name\nto_ping\npinged\npost_modified\npost_modified_gmt\npost_content_filtered\npost_parent\nguid\nmenu_order\npost_type\npost_mime_type\ncomment_count\nfilter\n</code></pre>\n",
