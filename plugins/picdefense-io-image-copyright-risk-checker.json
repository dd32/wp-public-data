        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20picdefense%3F'>\nWhy should I use PicDefense?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PicDefense.io is designed to protect your website from potential copyright issues by scanning all of the images on your website and alerting you to any that may be at risk for copyright infringement.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20use%20any%20third-party%20services%3F'>\nDoes this plugin use any third-party services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin integrates with the following third-party service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Image Processing Service</strong>: This service processes all images uploaded to your WordPress site. It provides feature to replace the high-risk one with, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free replacement.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20data%20is%20shared%20with%20third-party%20services%3F'>\nWhat data is shared with third-party services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin shares the following data with the Image Processing Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Images</strong>: All images uploaded to your WordPress site are sent to the third-party service for processing. This includes image metadata such as file name, size, and format.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20user%20data%20protected%3F'>\nHow is user data protected?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin ensures user data is protected by following these measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: All data transmitted between your site and the third-party service is encrypted using SSL.</li>\n<li><strong>Anonymization</strong>: Personal information related to the images is anonymized where possible to protect user privacy.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Retention</strong>: The third-party service retains processed images for a limited time, after which they are deleted from their servers.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20permissions%20does%20the%20plugin%20require%3F'>\nWhat permissions does the plugin require?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin requires the following permissions to function correctly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Upload Files</strong>: The plugin needs permission to upload and retrieve images from your WordPress site.</li>\n<li><strong>Manage Options</strong>: The plugin requires access to manage its settings within the WordPress admin panel.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20the%20third-party%20service%27s%20terms%20and%20privacy%20policy%3F'>\nWhere can I find the third-party service&#8217;s terms and privacy policy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can review the terms and privacy policy of the Image Processing Service at the following links:<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Terms of Service</strong>: <a href=\"https://picdefense.io/terms-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image Processing Service Terms</a><br />\n&#8211; <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: <a href=\"https://picdefense.io/privacy-cookie-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image Processing Service Privacy Policy</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20an%20image%20is%20not%20copyrighted%2C%20am%20i%20free%20to%20use%20it%20in%20any%20way%3F'>\nIf an Image is not Copyrighted, am I free to use it in any way?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not always. Even if a copyright is not immediately apparent, it does not mean the image is free to use without restrictions. There may be other ownership rights that could still put you at risk.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20quickly%20will%20i%20receive%20my%20report%3F'>\nHow quickly will I receive my report?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually, the report is generated within a few minutes, depending on the number of images involved in your check. Your dashboard will display the current status of your check.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20picdefense%20perform%20a%20reverse%20image%20search%20on%20my%20images%3F'>\nCan PicDefense perform a Reverse Image Search on my images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Each image that PicDefense.io checks goes through a reverse image search. We provide details such as size dimensions, a list of backlinking websites that contain the image, similarity score, as well as our unique PicRisk Score.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='aren%27t%20the%20images%20i%20use%20%22royalty-free%22%20-%20does%20that%20mean%20they%27re%20free%20to%20use%3F'>\nAren&#8217;t the Images I Use &#8220;Royalty-Free&#8221; &#8211; does that mean they&#8217;re free to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The term &#8220;royalty-free&#8221; is often misunderstood. It does not mean that an image is free to use without restrictions. Instead, it means that the user does not have to pay a royalty or license fee for each use of the image. However, royalty-free images may still have terms of use, and the user may need to pay a one-time fee to use the image.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20%27replace%20image%27%20feature%20do%3F'>\nWhat does the &#8216;Replace Image&#8217; feature do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our new feature allows you to replace high-risk images on your WordPress website easily with free stock images from Pexels. After a scan, you will find a &#8216;Replace Image&#8217; button next to each high-risk image. Upon clicking, a window will pop up, presenting related images from Pexels. You can choose the image you&#8217;d like to replace the high-risk one with, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free replacement.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20more%20documentation%3F'>\nWhere can I find more documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For more detailed instructions and features, please visit our documentation at https://picdefense.io/docs/.</p>\n<p>Remember, prevention is better than cure.
