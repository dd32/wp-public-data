        "faq": "<p>Here are some commonly asked questions about MotaWord&#8217;s translation services:</p>\n\n<dt id='is%20the%20price%20the%20same%20for%20translation%20of%20all%20languages%3F'>\nIs the price the same for translation of all languages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The price per word is generally the same for most languages.

If you are not satisfied with the terminology, style, or tone of voice, MotaWord will review the translation, taking into account your feedback, until you are satisfied.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20are%20the%20motaword%20translators%3F'>\nWho are the MotaWord translators?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>MotaWord works with over 22,000 professional translators who translate into their native language and are experienced, skilled, and knowledgeable in various fields.
