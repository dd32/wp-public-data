Why does it matter?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Abandonment is where a prospective lead fails to convert after landing &amp; showing interest in your website. Studies estimate this happens with nearly 3 in 4 visitors, meaning a significant majority of potential leads are left on the table with traditional digital marketing and analytics.

Gaining any meaningful insight from such tools requires a hours of your time — recordings don&#8217;t offer much immediately actionable data.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, today&#8217;s marketing automation tools &amp; abandonment plugins (e.g. Dynamic Yield, Pure360) are built for product businesses that sell via cart or checkout (e.g. eCommerce, B2C) and are not particularly useful for businesses that sell via online lead funnels &amp; forms (e.g. B2B, service businesses).</p>\n<p>With Insiteful™, we set out to design an end-to-end optimization plugin built specifically for the kinds of businesses that close their business from web forms: to make it easier to improve your existing web forms&#8217; conversion rate &amp; user experience.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
