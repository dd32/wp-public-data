It may have been causing issues on multisite activation.</p>\n<h4>3.0.6</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue with activation where too many posts on the site caused the php to run out of memory and the activation to fail.</p>\n<h4>3.0.5</h4>\n<p>Fixed issue on multisite where the $GLOBALS[&#8216;wp_taxonomies&#8217;] array hadn&#8217;t been created yet so a php warning was thrown.</p>\n<h4>3.0.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed a typo that caused imported filters to not have a permalink.<br />\nAdded code to repair anyones database that has already been upgraded with bad permalinks.</p>\n<h4>3.0.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue with the advanced meta query from get_posts adding % characters and escaping my % character.</p>\n<h4>3.0.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue when using ignore protocol the first query wouldn&#8217;t match.<br />\nFixed an issue where a post is found on the first query but no plugins have been disabled so the enabled plugins are overlooked.</p>\n<h4>3.0.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed a problem with fuzzy url matching.  &#8221; characters were being added to the url so it would never match.<br />\nCommented out the code that deleted the tables and added an option to the databse to prevent multiple imports.  Will add the delete code in a later version to clean up the tables after everyone is stable and has imported their settings.<br />\nAdded code to ensure that the old MU plugin is deleted before attempting to copy it from the lib directory.</p>\n<h4>3.0</h4>\n<p>Complete redesign of the plugin.<br />\nRemoved all custom db tables and moved the data to the post_meta table.<br />\nAdded custom post type plugin_filter to replace the URl admin.<br />\nAdded custom post type plugin_group to replace the plugin groups table.<br />\nThe plugins displayed on post/pages/custom post types/global plugins page are now sorted and colored similar to the main plugin page.<br />\nThere is no longer an enabled and disabled plugin box.  Enabled and disabled plugins are now all managed together to avoid confusion.<br />\nFixed a bug where the MU plugin chopped the url before checking it so it looped 15 times on the homepage before stopping the search for a fuzzy url.<br />\nFixed a bug where globally disabled plugins were listed as inactive when the list of active plugins was accessed.</p>\n<h4>2.6.3</h4>\n<p>Fixing bug that allows plugins to be disabled on the update pages.</p>\n<h4>2.6.2</h4>\n<p>Fixing PHP notices</p>\n<h4>2.6.1</h4>\n<p>Fixing bad characters added during commit</p>\n<h4>2.6</h4>\n<p>Fixed error on windows when inserting into po_post_plugins without specifying all fields.<br />\nAdded ability to effect children of posts, pages, custom post types.<br />\nRedesign of the post edit screen meta box.</p>\n<h4>2.5.9</h4>\n<p>Missed a file when committing 2.5.8.</p>\n<h4>2.5.8</h4>\n<p>Fixing grouping issues.<br />\nPlugin names were not being escaped when building the group list for display so they werent showing up.<br />\nOn the recently active screen the plugin organizer actions were duplicated and so when adding to group the group name was duplicated.</p>\n<h4>2.5.7</h4>\n<p>Fixing more bad characters being added by svn or wordpress.org.</p>\n<h4>2.5.6</h4>\n<p>Replacing Icons because they were released under creative commons and not gpl.</p>\n<h4>2.5.5</h4>\n<p>Fixing missing db table error message when the table exists on windows server.</p>\n<h4>2.5.4</h4>\n<p>Fixing bad characters being added by svn or wordpress.org.</p>\n<h4>2.5.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed a jquery issue with wp 3.5</p>\n<h4>2.5.2</h4>\n<p>Added warnings on settings page if the database tables are missing.<br />\nRemoved default value for longtext database fields.

This fixes an error where more plugins were seen as active than were displayed on the plugins page.<br />\nThe plugin organizer features will not load on the network admin.<br />\nNetwork activated plugins can now be disabled.</p>\n<h4>2.4</h4>\n<p>Adding ability to ignore arguments to a URL.  You can now enter URLs into the URL admin with arguments so that http://yoururl.com/page/?foo=2&amp;bar=3 will have different plugins loaded than http://yoururl.com/page/?foo=1&amp;bar=4 and http://yoururl.com/page/.<br />\nFixed URL admin so that it checks to make sure the URL was entered into the database before saying it was successful.</p>\n<h4>2.3.3</h4>\n<p>Undoing a change that was done in 2.3.1 to the request uri that removed arguments from the uri.  It is causing some issues for some users.  Will redesign and create a later release to optionally remove the arguments.</p>\n<h4>2.3.2</h4>\n<p>When the user hadnt set the number of plugins displayed per page it was being defaulted to 20.  Changed it to default to 999.<br />\nSet $endChar to an empty string in PluginOrganizerMU.class.php to prevent debug notices.</p>\n<h4>2.3.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed a javascript error on the URL admin page.<br />\nFixed logic for Global plugins where all plugins were disabled none where getting disabled.<br />\nFixed use of REQUEST_URI.
