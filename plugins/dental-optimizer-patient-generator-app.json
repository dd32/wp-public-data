        "faq": "<h4>What is Dental Optimizer Patient Generator App?</h4>\n<p>The Dental Optimizer Patient Generator App is an application that can be installed as a widget or embedded within a page, allowing you to more easily and frequently get your patients and prospective patients to contact you and schedule appointments. It&#8217;s easy to install and easier to use.</p>\n<h4>Is the Patient Generator limited to my Dental Optimizer profile?</h4>\n<p>Absolutely not. You can embed it in your website, blog, social media pages, and more.</p>\n<h4>It says the Patient Generator is powered by the Dental Optimizer. What is that?</h4>\n<p>The Dental Optimizer is a resource that connects patients and dentists using some of the same tools as the Patient Generator combined with extensive search engine optimization. You can get a free Dental Optimizer profile at <a href=\"http://www.dentaloptimizer.com/dentists/dental-web-marketing/\" title=\"Dental Web Marketing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DentalOptimizer</a>  but it is not necessary to use the Patient Generator.</p>\n<h4>Do I need to log in every day to monitor my contacts?</h4>\n<p>No. We&#8217;ll send you an email when someone has a dental question, wishes to share their risk assessment results or oral profile, or requests an estimate for a specific procedure.</p>\n",
