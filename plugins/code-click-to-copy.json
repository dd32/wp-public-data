        "description": "<p>Simple plugin that automatically copies content in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags to clipboard (when clicked). Other plugins out there do the same but create a little [COPY] button that you have to aim for. Mine doesn&#8217;t require any aiming, just click anywhere on the code block and it copies the whole thing.</p>\n<p>For any sites sharing code-commands, this plugin will save users time from having to highlight and copy-paste bits of text back and forth. It’s especially helpful for large globs of code that scroll off-screen, or when copying on your mobile phone.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install easily from your dashboard Add Plugins page or manually download the plugin and upload the extracted archived to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20newest%20wp%20version%20and%20also%20older%20versions%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin works perfect with the latest version of WordPress! It also works with older versions as well but you should always run the latest WordPress and PHP version for best security and performance. This plugin is used in my critical sites so you can be assured it works perfect.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this plugin slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s coded extremely lightweight. The plugin CSS and JS is only 1.7KB total, and inlined in your site footer. No extra CSS or JS files are loaded. It does only the essential function and nothing more. No heavy PHP processing or database queries. I&#8217;m an absolute speed fanatic.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20plan%20to%20add%20more%20features%3F'>\nDo you plan to add more features?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not unless someone wanted to pay for my development time and costs. This was intended as a free community plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20style%20the%20copy%20block%3F'>\nHow do I style the copy block?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can style the &#8220;codecopy_tooltip&#8221; CSS class. Change background, color, font-family, font-size, padding, word-wrap, overflow, etc. I might add this option in the plugin one day but just trying to keep it lightweight for now.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='any%20known%20incompatibility%20issues%3F'>\nAny known incompatibility issues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One user reported it didn&#8217;t work on his DIVI site through DIVI&#8217;s own &#8220;code&#8221; block mechanism.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
