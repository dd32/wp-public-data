You need to allow basedir to be posted. In WordFence, go to All Options and scroll down to Allolisted URLs. Add a new URL that is the page where your form is (/addanitem/ for example). Select Param Type POST Body, and enter basedir in the Param Name. Click ADD. Add another rule now for the ajax file by entering URL /wp-content/plugins/cws-consignment/public/class-cws-consignment-public.php. And again select Param Type POST Body, and enter basedir in the Param Name. Click ADD. And Save Changes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
