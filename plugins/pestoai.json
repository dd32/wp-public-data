        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20pestoai%3F'>\nWhat is PestoAI?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PestoAI is an AI-powered tool that generates SEO-tailored content in the form of blog articles for your website daily. Regularly adding new content to your website increases the chances that your website will rank higher in search engine results, leading to increased visitor traffic to your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20is%20pestoai%20for%3F'>\nWho is PestoAI for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anyone that wants to increase traffic to their website. Whether you&#8217;re a startup, small business, copywriter, large company, or just want to promote your website, PestoAI is for you!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20pestoai%20instead%20of%20a%20human%3F'>\nWhy should I use PestoAI instead of a human?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Paying for someone to write regular content can be expensive, and content writers rarely deliver new content daily. With PestoAI, you get new content generated daily for a low-cost monthly subscription, which you can choose to auto-publish, review and publish yourself, or have a member of your team spend a few minutes editing before publishing. Alternatively, you can empower your current content writers with PestoAI and dramatically improve their productivity and output.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20pestoai%20write%20about%3F'>\nWhat does PestoAI write about?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you connect your site to PestoAI, it will automatically analyze your site and determine what relevant topics to write about. You can then view, edit, or add topics as you like.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20pestoai%20also%20generate%20images%20for%20articles%3F'>\nDoes PestoAI also generate images for articles?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. PestoAI will generate an image that relates to each article, which will be displayed in the article page. You can replace this image by uploading your own.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20free%20trial%3F'>\nIs there a free trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Once you sign up with PestoAI, your first 5 articles will be free so you can see and experience PestoAI&#8217;s AI-powered content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20will%20pestoai%20publish%20my%20content%20to%3F'>\nWhere will PestoAI publish my content to?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you connect your site to PestoAI, you will get two code snippets to embed in your website. One is for your blog page and will display a list of published posts, and the other is for the post page and will display the contents of a post. You only need to embed the code snippets once and PestoAI takes care of the rest!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20edit%20the%20content%3F'>\nCan I edit the content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can edit the content text, article title, article image, and more with PestoAI&#8217;s easy-to-use management console.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20the%20author%3F'>\nCan I set the author?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can create up to 5 author profiles to set on posts, and you can set a default author profile to use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20frequency%20of%20posts%20if%20i%20don%27t%20want%20one%20every%20day%3F'>\nCan I change the frequency of posts if I don&#8217;t want one every day?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. If you do not want posts to be generated daily, you can update the frequency to once every other day, twice per week, or once per week. However, keep in mind that for optimal SEO impact we recommend once per day.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20invite%20my%20team%20to%20collaborate%3F'>\nCan I invite my team to collaborate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Once you connect your site to PestoAI, you can invite team members to view, edit, or administer your content and site on PestoAI.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20will%20it%20take%20to%20improve%20my%20seo%20ranking%3F'>\nHow long will it take to improve my SEO ranking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As with all content marketing campaigns for SEO, it typically takes around 4 &#8211; 6 months to see an improvement in your search ranking.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20track%20the%20performance%20of%20pestoai%3F'>\nCan I track the performance of PestoAI?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
