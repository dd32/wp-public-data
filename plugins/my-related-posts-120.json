You can either edit your theme (file: my-theme/single.php) and add the following snippet: <code>echo myrelposts_getrelated($title);</code><br />\n(The $title is optional, but let’s you specify a title to to appear before the actual related posts are listed.)</p>\n<p>Or you can use a shortcode tag and add it manually to the posts you’d like!</p>\n<p>Just add the following shortcode tag: <code>[myrelposts-related title=”my title”]</code><br />\n(The title is optional, but let’s you specify a title to to appear before the actual related posts are listed.)<br />\nGet related posts and pages, using the list name!<br />\nA new feature in version 1.2 is that you can get a list of related posts, by passing the list name in the shortcode tag!<br />\n    [myrelposts-related list=”my related post list”]<br />\nUsing the list tag, causes the plugin NOT to look at the current post’s meta information, so use this tag wisely.<br />\n(as a bonus feature, you can use wildcards, text , in the list title.)<br />\n<strong>There’s more!</strong></p>\n",
