Each browser will display your notifications somewhat differently, but in general the notifications will look appropriate for the device/OS/browser on which they are displayed</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When / how often will visitors be asked about accepting push notifications?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is configurable; it is possible to modify when a visitor is prompted to accept push notifications (e.g. on the third visit to the site). Additionally, browsers may decide to suppress this notification, for example, if a user at one point selected a &#8220;never ask me again&#8221; response.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
