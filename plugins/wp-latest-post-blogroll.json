Blogs with RSS feeds will have the title of the last post shown as the link name.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if the RSS feed for a site listed in a blogroll can&#8217;t be found or parsed for some reason?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The name of the blog or website will be shown in the blogroll instead of the title of the latest post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you still categorize the blogroll into meaningful categories?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the categories that you select for your links will be honored. Each category is listed with the appropriate links given underneath. Blogroll is the default category for links and you can change that to whatever name you like.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
