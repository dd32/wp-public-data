The �Head Tag Customization� section enables the insertion of CSS and any other tags (usually Java-script) into the  of the page.<br />\nThe Custom CSS section will be inserted inside a  tag, output below the inclusion of the external CSS files.<br />\nThe Custom Meta / Java-script section will be summarily output into the  section.<br />\nBoth fields recognize and process shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Custom Footer Code<br />\nThis field will inject HTML at the very bottom of the page.  While it can be used to display content, it�s real intended use is for developers to place code such as Java-script or one-off tracking pixels, or any other use where the code MUST be at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<h3>Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>[theme_uri] &#8211; outputs the full URL of the blog and the active theme folder<br />\n[blog_uri] &#8211; shortcode equivalent of site_url()</p>\n",

        "faq": "<p>Are all of the additional plugins WEX suggests required?<br />\nNo. WEX divides plugins into Recommended and Required groups.</p>\n<p>Why is the CSS section of the Head Tag Customer separated from the Meta/Javascript tag and how is it different?<br />\nThe CSS section actually simulates a separate CSS file being loaded rather than outputting it directly in the  tag. This is to enable many responsive/html5 libraries that support elderly versions of Internet Explorer that are only able to manage CSS in external files.</p>\n<p>Does WEX have any specific customization to maintain functionality when combined with other plugins?<br />\nYes. WEX is specifically designed to work with the WP No Category Base base plugin.</p>\n",
