Oddly enough we didn\u2019t find anything readily available to do that without adding code to his theme files. We decided to create a little widget to handle this functionality. It has the following features and is freely available right here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customizable link text</li>\n<li>Customizable link color</li>\n<li>Selection of Standard Feed Icon (feedicons.com) in six different sizes</li>\n<li>Enter any feed URL</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/piDZibMb8NU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve added a new widget that will dynamically construct the Feed URL for the archive that the user is looking at. This means if a user is looking at the blog home page, the feed will be the main blog feed. However if the user is looking at a specific category, the URL for the feed will be of that specific category. If the user is not visiting an archive page, the widget will not be displayed.</p>\n<p>If you have any problems with this widget, please don&#8217;t hesitate to let us know.

If you don&#8217;t see mention of widgets in the WordPress admin, you&#8217;re not crazy. Most themes utilize the widgets feature of WordPress, but some don&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll need to either switch your theme, or find someone who can widgetize your theme for you. If you don&#8217;t know any widgeteers, let us know and we&#8217;ll do our best to help you out.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
