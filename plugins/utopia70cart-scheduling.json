From there, they can visit all pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don&#8217;t I name my locations on my pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s up to you, but if you name a location on a web page, it will be visible to everyone visiting that page, logged in or not. For privacy reasons you may wish to avoid that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I show/hide information to visitors?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Various shortcodes can provide text for visitors not logged in, and different text for those not logged in. For example, this page text will display a welcome for visitors along with a login form. Once logged in, visitors are  welcomed by name, and can view the schedule for location 3.<br />\n     [u70block loggedin=&#8217;1&#8242;]<br />\n     Welcome [u70disp type=&#8217;username&#8217;]<br />\n     [u70disp type=&#8217;title&#8217; location=&#8217;3&#8242;]: [u70disp type=&#8217;description&#8217; location=&#8217;3&#8242;]<br />\n     [u70cal location=&#8217;3&#8242;]<br />\n     [/u70block]<br />\n     [u70block loggedin=&#8217;0&#8242;]<br />\n     Welcome &#8211; please log in to view the schedules.<br />\n     [u70disp type=&#8217;loginform&#8217;]<br />\n     [/u70block]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can members get a summary?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Another shortcode gives a summary for a few days, indicating which carts and which hours they have reserved. This code will show a seven-day summary for all carts reserved by the logged-in visitor:<br />\n     [u70block loggedin=&#8217;1&#8242;]<br />\n     Welcome [u70disp type=&#8217;username&#8217;]<br />\n     [u70disp type=&#8217;reservations&#8217; dayoffset=&#8217;0&#8242; daylength=&#8217;7&#8242; ]<br />\n     [/u70block]<br />\n     [u70block loggedin=&#8217;0&#8242;]<br />\n     Welcome &#8211; please log in to view the schedules.<br />\n     [u70disp type=&#8217;loginform&#8217;]<br />\n     [/u70block]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add members?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the WordPress Users menu, and &#8220;Add New&#8221;. Alternately, if you have a large number to add, you can use a bulk registration plugin, such as &#8220;Import users from CSV with meta&#8221; by codection</p>\n</p>\n\n",
