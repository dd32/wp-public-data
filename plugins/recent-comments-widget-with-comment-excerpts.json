This version fixes all issues raised in the forums, including making all strings translatable and adding a setting to control the character length of the comment excerpt. If you want me to add a block to this plugin with the same features as this widget, please reach out and say so in the forums or on twitter @breakfastcodes. Changes tested up to version number to 5.8.3.</p>",

Comments containing international characters will be properly truncated with mb_substr instead of substr. HTML will be removed from the comments with strip_tags. Up to 150 comments can be displayed instead of 15. Thank the users of this plugin for suggesting these changes on my blog.</p>",
