This can lead to an immediate increase in sales, as it makes it easier for customers to complete their purchases.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct checkout for WooCommerce</strong> is a checkout process that allows customers to skip the shopping cart page and go directly to the checkout page. This can simplify the checkout process and reduce cart abandonment. There are a number of plugins and tools that can be used to implement direct checkout on WooCommerce websites.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Quick Checkout</strong>, you can redirect users to the checkout page instead of the <strong>cart page</strong>.
