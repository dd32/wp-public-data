        "faq": "\n<h4>I just activated the plugin, but the emails don&#8217;t look any different</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t created the &#8216;wpsc-email_style.php&#8217; template file and gone to work on it, this plugin will do nothing to your emails.<br />\nAlso, don&#8217;t forget to go to the &#8216;Store Email Style&#8217; options page and turn on the live customer styling when you&#8217;re done testing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you help me with this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am happy assist with your web design work &#8211; for a fee. Head over to my website, http://schwambell.com</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I find out about styling emails with html?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I think these are helpful references:</p>\n<p>http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/</p>\n<p>http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/css/article.php/3679231/How-to-Create-Great-HTML-Emails-with-CSS.htm</p>\n<p>http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-to-code-html-emails</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I guess you could try this:<br />\nhttp://lmgtfy.com/?q=html+style+emails</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s a good way to test my email styling with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve created your styling theme template file, you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a fake customer with your email address on your e-Commerce website, and go through all the motions; or</li>\n<li>Go to the &#8216;Store Email Style&#8217; options page and click to see a browser preview, or have a test styled email sent to you;</li>\n<li>While you&#8217;re in testing phase, store emails (including customer receipts) that are sent to an admin email address will automatically be styled, so you can see what actual customers will see before they do.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are linebreaks being removed from my product list?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This issue only seems to crop up when you&#8217;re not templating the receipt content, you&#8217;re on WPEC pre-3.8.9, and you&#8217;ve got some HTML in the WPEC layout option for that content.</p>\n<p>Why might it happen? When you turn on this plugin and apply style, the plugin will do its best job to make the plain text content look good in HTML.<br />\nIt does so by converting plain text linebreaks to HTML tags.<br />\nBut the plugin will only do that if it doesn&#8217;t detect HTML in the content already.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve put some HTML tags before or after your product list in the WPEC admin settings tab, where you layout the purchase receipt content.<br />\nMy plugin will detect some HTML, and then it won&#8217;t add any HTML of its own to the content. As a result the plain text linebreaks remain, and they don&#8217;t mean much in an HTML email.</p>\n<p>How might you overcome this issue? Try removing the HTML from the WPEC content. Or even better, use the content templating that this plugin enables.<br />\nIt&#8217;s easy (you can copy sample templates from this plugin&#8217;s folder) and your receipts will look better anyway.</p>\n<p>This is only an issue before WPEC 3.8.9 though, because WPEC has started generating HTML product lists of its own, using tables.<br />\nAnd obviously if you&#8217;re templating the content, you can put your own HTML layout on the product list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s this about a fancy template hierarchy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin allows you to be as complicated or as simple with your email wrapper templates as you wish.<br />\nYou can have different styling for manager emails than from customer emails,<br />\nand you can even have different styling just for particular kinds of customer emails.</p>\n<p>A template hierarchy diagram can be found through this plugin&#8217;s settings page.<br />\nThe simplest way to style your emails is just to do it all in the &#8216;wpsc-email_style.php&#8217; template file.</p>\n<p>A sample &#8216;wpsc-email_style.php&#8217; can be copied from this plugin&#8217;s &#8220;theme&#8221; subfolder into your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>And what&#8217;s this about fancy content for customer receipts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This only applies to customer receipt emails (including order pending and payment required):</p>\n<p>You can now structure the content of receipts using theme template files.<br />\nThis replaces what WP e-Commerce enables through it&#8217;s settings-&gt;admin tab.<br />\nContent for all non-receipt emails still comes from WP e-Commerce, WordPress or other plugins as appropriate.</p>\n<p>To see what it&#8217;s all about, copy the sample template files from this plugin&#8217;s &#8220;theme&#8221; subfolder into your theme.<br />\nThe sample files that I provide are a vast improvement over what WP e-Commerce gives you for receipts,<br />\nand you may be happy just leaving them as they are. If you want to stay with what WP e-Commerce creates for receipts,<br />\njust remove my sample files from your theme.</p>\n<p>Further explanation of the receipt templating system is found on this plugin&#8217;s settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is a wrapper template different to a content template?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wrapper templates create the gift wrapping around your content. The template hierarchy exists to allow<br />\ndifferent kinds of emails to look completely different. For example, you may want a sidebar or a certain kind of<br />\nfooter for customer emails, but a much simpler email layout for admin/management emails. That&#8217;s what the wrapper template<br />\nheirarchy allows you to do. And even though the wrapper template heirarchy allows you to be very specific to certain kinds of emails,<br />\nwrapper templates are still very different to content templates.</p>\n<p>Wrapper template files DO NOT HAVE ACCESS to structured content data &#8211; that&#8217;s what content templates are for.</p>\n<p>Content templating is very specific to purchase receipts (at least for now), and within a content template you<br />\nhave access to detailed purchase data.</p>\n<p>The sample template files bundled in this plugin&#8217;s &#8220;theme&#8221; subfolder will point you in the right direction.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have some constructive criticism or pleasant feedback</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Head over to my website, http://schwambell.com and send me an email. Or use the WordPress Plugin forums.<br />\nI&#8217;ll try to get back to you in a businesslike fashion, but I can&#8217;t promise immediate plugin revisions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
