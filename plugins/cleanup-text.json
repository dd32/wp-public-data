        "installation": "<p>1) Copy the file cleanup_text.php to your WordPress plugins directory.</p>\n<p>2) Login to WordPress as an administrator, go to Plugins and Activate it.</p>\n<p>3) Call the plugin anywhere in your theme or other PHP code.</p>\n<p>E.g. replace &#8220;the_content()&#8221; with &#8220;cleanup_text( the_content() )&#8221;</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p><strong>How do I use the plugin?</strong><br />\nCall the function cleanup_text() from within your theme or other plugin. Supply the text to be cleaned as the first argument.<br />\nE.g. <code>&lt;?php $clean_text = cleanup_text( $text_to_clean ) ; ?&gt;</code></p>\n<p><strong>How do I get the plugin to remove HTML?</strong><br />\nCall the function with TRUE as the second argument.<br />\nE.g. <code>&lt;?php $clean_text = cleanup_text( $text_to_clean, TRUE) ;  ?&gt;</code></p>\n<p><strong>Can I use cleanup_text for web pages?</strong><br />\nYes, you could use cleanup_text to clean text that will be displayed on a web page. You would probably use something like:<br />\nE.g. <code>&lt;?php echo cleanup_text( get_the_content() ) ; ?&gt;</code></p>\n<p>But the results will probably not be what you want because cleanup_text uses &#8220;\\n&#8221; for new lines, and web pages use <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> or some other HTML notation.</p>\n<p>If you really want to do this let me know and I&#8217;ll update the plugin so it can be used in this way.</p>\n",
