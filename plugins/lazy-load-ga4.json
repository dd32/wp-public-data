You may notice a sharp drop in your WordPress site page speed score especially for Core Web Vitals.</p>\n<p>In this plugin, we use a combination technique of both delayed loading and lazy load of the Google Analytics 4 script. When you use our plugin to place Google Analytics 4 script, it will not affect your page speed score.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20speed%20up%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill this plugin speed up my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically, this plugin doesn&#8217;t speed up your website. If your website has a score of 80 (Core Web Vitals) before placing the ga4 script, after using our plugin. The score will remain the same (80).</p>\n<p>But if you place the code directly copied from official website without using this plugin. You may notice, your website core web vitals score might drop a bit. Our plugin can help you avoid a drop in your core Web Vitals score.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='more%20questions%3F'>\nMore Questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have questions about the plugin, please use the support tab of this page.
