Let us detect that setting for you if you are not sure what to do &#8211; simply click on the help link besides the text field and follow the instructions there. (Don&#8217;t forget to save your changes!)</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I switch themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the <strong>Section Widget</strong> settings page (under the <strong>Appearance</strong> admin menu). Select any themes from the drop-down. Click &#8220;Preview&#8221; to show the on preview.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I cannot see the widget!!!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Did you forget to set up the conditions for the widget to display? Try checking &#8220;Everywhere&#8221; and start from there. If you still do not see the widget, there is probably no sidebar on that page. Try adding &#8220;?swt-scope-test&#8221; to the end of your page&#8217;s URL (e.g. http://www.myblog.com/?swt-scope-test) &#8211; if you have at least one tabbed section widget activated and you do not see &#8220;Section Widget Scope Test&#8221; on your page, there is probably something wrong with your WordPress theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the tabbed section widget looks so weird on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you have set a correct CSS scope in the <strong>Section Widget</strong> settings page (under the <strong>Appearance</strong> admin menu). Let us detect that setting for you if you are not sure what to do &#8211; simply click on the help link besides the text field and follow the instructions there. On the other hand, if your widget looks stretched out, try checking the &#8220;Height fix&#8221; checkbox in the settings page (especially if you&#8217;re using the default WordPress theme). Finally, make sure you have JavaScript enabled in your browser.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use shortcodes in the widget content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. However, please beware some shortcodes (for example our [conditional custom fields][1] shortcodes) will only work when an individual pages or posts is being displayed, not on an archive pages. This is because they require information (e.g. custom fields) that are attached to individual pages/posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use PHP code in the content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, no. But if you really want to do that, [there is a shortcode for that][2]. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use HTML in the content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use JavaScript in the content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See below.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the HTML code filtered?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends. Unless the user who edited the widget has the [unfiltered&#095;html][3] capabilities (this means Administrators and Editors on the default settings), all &#8220;non-safe&#8221; HTML elements (particularly JavaScript) will be stripped.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does &#8220;Display title&#8221; do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When checked, your widget&#8217;s title will be displayed before the its content just like the regular text widget. When unchecked, the title will be hidden which gives you more flexibility if you need to style the widget manually.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How should I style the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have access to the theme CSS files, you can wrap your content in an id (or give it a CSS class), and then style it from there. Otherwise, you can always use inline CSS. For information on styling the tabbed widget, please refer to the [jQuery UI theming guide][4].</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The themes are taking up too much space!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can remove any unneeded themes but deleting the corresponding folder in the &#8220;section-widget/themes&#8221; folder. However, please <strong>do not</strong> delete the &#8220;Base&#8221; theme.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
