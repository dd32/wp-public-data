        "description": "<p>wpbackbutton adds a &#8220;Back&#8221; button to your WordPress blog which behaves like the javascript history.back() method. In contrast to history.back() it, of course, doesn&#8217;t need Javascript &amp; makes it possible to have a working &#8216;Back&#8217; button even if the user comes to your blog via direct link (the &#8220;Back&#8221; button then redirects to the frontpage).</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Install &amp; activate plugin via wordpress backend.<br />\nAdd <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[renderBackButton]'); ?&gt;</code> to your template (where you want to see the &#8220;Back&#8221; button).</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I can&#8217;t see the Back button on my Frontpage?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;Back&#8221; button is only displayed if there&#8217;s a page to navigate back. Because there&#8217;s no page to navigate back to on the frontpage, you can&#8217;t see the button there, even if you included it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How exactly does wpbackbutton work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a user enters a blog, wpbackbutton sets a cookie with the current URL and (if the current URL is not the frontpage of your blog) the frontpage URL. If the user followed a direct link he&#8217;ll get redirected to the frontpage when pressing &#8216;Back&#8217;, because there&#8217;s no history for that user. When starting with the frontpage and navigating trough the blog, wpbackbutton saves the navigation history. When the &#8220;Back&#8221; button is clicked, the element, that has been viewed just before the current element, is loaded. This happens until the user is on the frontpage. Note: It&#8217;s NOT neccessary to use the &#8220;Back&#8221; button in order to have a clean history. If the user navigates to page A, then to page B and after that back to page A (with a link, instead of pressing &#8220;Back&#8221;) the history acts as if the user pressed the &#8220;Back&#8221; button.</p>\n<p>Some navigation cases (different chars are different pages, where A is frontpage):<br />\nA -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D would reverse navigate C -&gt; B -&gt; A<br />\nA -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; C would reverse navigate B -&gt; A<br />\nA -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E -&gt; C would reverse navigate E -&gt; D -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; A<br />\nA -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; A would clear the history (mainpage has no back button)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where should I add the Back button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I suppose that it&#8217;s no good idea to add the button into a loop, because you&#8217;d have it below every post. Instead you should add it directly after / before the loop, so it&#8217;s displayed once or twice (above and below the content). This typically takes place in the single.php / page.php / category.php / &#8230; files of your template (wherever a loop gets executed).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
