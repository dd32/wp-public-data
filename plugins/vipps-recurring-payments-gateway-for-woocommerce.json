You can however change the behaviour of this by using the &#8220;Default status to give pending renewals&#8221; option in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you could look into using WooCommerce &#8220;Early renewals&#8221;: <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/early-renewal/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/early-renewal/</a> if ensuring the status of a charge is fully completed before a specific date is of up-most importance.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.20.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: An issue where <code>maybe_cancel_due_charge</code> is called when order statuses are changed in other gateways (GitHub issue #93 and #94).</li>\n<li>Fixed: Implemented proper &#8220;order cancelled&#8221; handling.</li>\n<li>Added: An option to select which page &#8220;Continue shopping&#8221; should redirect a user to after a failed payment.</li>\n<li>Fixed: An odd error that might occur when our special options screen is being called before we initialize our custom tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.20.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: A warning for when you select Vipps as your brand when your currency is not set to NOK.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Frontend admin localization.</li>\n<li>Fixed: A fatal error that could occur when calling <code>get_agreement_id_from_order</code> when handling renewals. Reported and diagnosed by magnuskl on GitHub.</li>\n<li>Fixed: 404 page that could occur after payments are cancelled or paid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.20.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Frontend scripts were not properly loaded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.20.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Webhooks. To enable webhooks you just need to save your settings one more time. A webhook will be automatically set-up.</li>\n<li>Added: Try to detect whether to use Vipps or MobilePay branding.</li>\n<li>Added: Use the translations from translate.wordpress.org.</li>\n<li>Added: Better handling of our special action pages.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Admin notice styling is now a bit better.</li>\n<li>Added: A setting to automatically capture MobilePay payments now even when they are physical products in order to prevent the payment reservation from getting cancelled after 7 days.</li>\n<li>Added: A landing page for payments. This allows us to check the status of a payment before we redirect to the order received/receipt page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.19.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for paying with MobilePay in Finland, and later Denmark.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.18.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for WooCommerce checkout blocks. This allows Vipps/MobilePay recurring payments to be used with the new standard checkout.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.17.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: No longer use the <code>wp_safe_remote_post</code> function and instead use <code>wp_remote_post</code> because it causes problems on some hosts, and our calls are to endpoints returned by Vipps MobilePay either way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.17.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Hide this gateway if there are no subscription products in the cart.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.17.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Added the new version of an admin JS file that controls the logic for capturing a payment. This fixes payment captures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.17.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for WooCommerce High Performance Order Storage (HPOS)</li>\n<li>Fixed: Period campaigns now show correctly in the app when there&#8217;s both a free trial and a sign-up fee.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Changed the logic for how we determine whether to show our gateway, because certain plugins add their own subscription types. Now we only disable our gateway if &#8220;Pay with Vipps and MobilePay for WooCommerce&#8221; is being shown as well.</li>\n<li>Fixed: We no longer care about an order&#8217;s status when it comes to displaying the &#8220;Capture&#8221; button. If there are funds to capture, we show it.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Better error logging for when we try to capture a charge that can no longer be captured. Rewrote the capture payment handler.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Changing gateway was no longer possible in one of the later Woo Subscription versions, due to the use of <code>wp_safe_redirect</code>. We now whitelist Vipps MobilePay&#8217;s domains.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.16.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Refunds could not be processed properly because of a mistake when calling the <code>woocommerce_order_after_calculate_totals</code> action. We assume the object is always a subscription, when it is not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.16.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Properly stop checking for a gateway change when a gateway change succeeded.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.16.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Listen for total recalculation instead of a change in orders items when making sure we update the subscription price in Vipps MobilePay whenever a Vipps MobilePay subscription&#8217;s price changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.16.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Updating a subscription. Campaign period was not being serialized properly when calling <code>-&gt;set_period(...)</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.16.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Added a missing file that was not uploaded due to a mistake when committing files to SVN.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.16.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: a <code>wc_vipps_recurring_after_payment_complete</code> action</li>\n<li>Added: Implementation of period campaigns. It will now properly inform your customers of a campaigns length in the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.15.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: No longer attempt to cancel agreements that are already cancelled.</li>\n<li>Fix: Removed <code>order_id</code> from <code>WC_Vipps_Charge</code> and added <code>transaction_id</code> as it should be correctly named.</li>\n<li>Fix: A case where <code>initialCharge.description</code> would be empty</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.15.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: <code>cancelled_order_page</code> must be an int.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.15.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactored: We are now using the Vipps MobilePay Recurring API v3</li>\n<li>Changed: We now require at least PHP 7.4. You should however already be on 8.0+ as PHP 7.4 is end of life.</li>\n<li>Added: Much more type safety to the entire codebase.</li>\n<li>Fixed: We now check the order status before showing the &#8220;thank you&#8221; page, instead of after. This should fix the order status sometimes being wrong when the user lands on this page.</li>\n<li>Refactored: We no longer pass product descriptions to Vipps MobilePay unless you choose to do so.</li>\n<li>Refactored: We now use Vipps MobilePay&#8217;s new campaign system.</li>\n<li>Refactored: We no longer need to store the agreement&#8217;s confirmation url ourselves. Idempotency now works as expected.</li>\n<li>Changed: We now use the <code>woocommerce_subscription_cancelled_vipps_recurring</code> hook instead of <code>woocommerce_subscription_status_cancelled</code> to cancel a subscription.</li>\n<li>Added: A merchant serial number setting to help Vipps MobilePay to identify who the merchant is.</li>\n<li>Added: New filters, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_create_agreement_data</code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_update_agreement_data</code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_cancel_agreement_data</code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_create_charge_data</code>, <code>wc_vipps_recurring_process_payment_agreement</code></li>\n<li>Fixed: A rare problem that could occur where subscriptions would not be set to &#8220;Active&#8221; when an order&#8217;s status transitions to processing or completed.</li>\n<li>Changed: Made the <code>api</code> attribute public in <code>WC_Gateway_Vipps_Recurring</code> as it may sometimes be beneficial to call the API directly from third party plugins and hand it off to Vipps MobilePay Recurring later, especially in the charity sector.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Coupons and &#8220;expire date&#8221; on a product in WooCommerce Subscriptions now play well together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Fixed a conflict that prevented Vipps MobilePay from working in Klarna if Vipps MobilePay Recurring and &#8220;Pay with Vipps and MobilePay for WooCommerce&#8221; were installed at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: You can now swap gateway to Vipps/MobilePay recurring payments from a subscription again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: You can now pay for failed renewal orders. It will cancel the old agreement and substitute it with a new one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: You will now get an error message when trying to refund an order that is older than 365 days via Vipps MobilePay.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Do not show this gateway if <code>WCS_ATT_Cart::get_subscription_scheme</code> returns null.</li>\n<li>Fixed: We no longer show that the price is 0,- during a campaign for a synchronised product when Prorate First Renewal is set to &#8220;Never (charge the full recurring amount at sign-up)&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Changing payment gateway to Vipps MobilePay now works again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Renamed our Vipps MobilePay access token transient to prevent conflicts with &#8220;Pay with Vipps and MobilePay for WooCommerce&#8221; when two different sets of merchant tokens are used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.14.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/all-products-for-woocommerce-subscriptions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All Products for WooCommerce Subscriptions</a>. Thanks to @danielcherubini on GitHub.</li>\n<li>Fixed: <code>prevent_backwards_transition_on_completed_order</code> no longer has a return type, this fixes compatibility with plugins like <code>WooCommerce Order custom Statuses</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.13.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: We now prevent orders from being transitioned to <code>processing</code> when the status is already <code>completed</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.13.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Early renewals now work properly. If you renew early, and you&#8217;re already using Vipps MobilePay it will now skip the app entirely and create a new charge.<br />\nIf you renew early, and you&#8217;re not already using Vipps MobilePay you will be sent to the app and a gateway switch will be performed after successful checkout.</li>\n<li>Fixed: A small error notice when swapping gateways in the admin area no longer appears.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.13.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Subscriptions now get cancelled if a charge fails and the status of the subscription is <code>pending-cancel</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixed: If you provide no custom description for a product when the description source is set to <code>custom</code> we now default back to the product name. This prevents an error during checkout when no description is provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.13.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Pass arguments to <code>wc_vipps_recurring_transaction_id_for_order</code> in the correct order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.13.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: <code>wc_vipps_recurring_merchant_agreement_url</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Added: <code>wc_vipps_recurring_merchant_redirect_url</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Fixed: No longer use deprecated function <code>WC_Subscriptions_Order::order_contains_subscription</code></li>\n<li>Fixed: Make sure we don&#8217;t register the Vipps MobilePay Recurring gateway twice.</li>\n<li>Fixed: KCO compatibility <code>headers already output</code> notice no longer shows on every page when debug mode is enabled.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Set payment method to Vipps MobilePay Recurring on the subscription after paying with the Vipps MobilePay Recurring EPM in KCO. This is likely caused by a WooCommerce bug.</li>\n<li>Refactor: <code>capture_payment</code> should no longer create a charge if a RESERVED charge does not exist.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Now sets the correct order status for RESERVED payments when paying with Vipps MobilePay through KCO.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.12.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Product names no longer use the default context, meaning it will no longer get overridden by themes or plugins and show HTML in the Vipps/MobilePay app or app-switch screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.12.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Initial charge description no longer contains &#8221; + &#8221; when no extra products are purchased.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Filling in 0 in the trial field tricking us into adding a campaign to the product, also resulting in an empty <code>initialCharge.description</code> and being unable to check out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.12.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Fixed an issue where <code>initialCharge.description</code> was empty. It cannot be empty under any circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.12.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: A bug in Klarna Checkout where it would attempt to use Vipps/MobilePay recurring payments instead of &#8220;Pay with Vipps and MobilePay for WooCommerce&#8221; when you&#8217;re only purchasing one time payment products.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Descriptions of products you are not paying for right away is no longer included in initialCharge&#8217;s description.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Campaigns are now used correctly when a single product is purchased along with a synced subscription product.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Campaigns are now used correctly when a single product is purchased along with a subscription product with a free trial.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.12.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: Support for Klarna Checkout.</li>\n<li>Fixed: No longer attempt to load Vipps/MobilePay recurring payments if WooCommerce is disabled/not installed.</li>\n<li>Fixed: If you have a variable subscription product the Vipps MobilePay settings from the &#8220;parent&#8221; will now be respected.</li>\n<li>Fixed: This gateway no longer shows up for single purchase products, only if there is at least one subscription product in the cart.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: You can now pay for single payment products in the same shopping cart as a subscription.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactor: Rewrote our admin notification system to allow for dismissible alerts.</li>\n<li>Added: A campaign banner for Login with Vipps MobilePay. This will last for 10 days, and it is fully dismissible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Renewal orders will no longer transition to <code>completed</code> when the setting for this is turned off.</li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed a problem where our <code>_vipps_recurring_waiting_for_gateway_change</code> was never processed for orders where the subscription was not <code>wc-active</code>. Added <code>wc-on-hold</code> and <code>wc-pending</code> to this list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a setting for what sort order we should check charges by.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a setting for how many charges we should check at a time.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Default amount of charges to check per wp-cron run is now 10.</li>\n<li>Change: Removed extra sortable columns from pending charges and failed charges tables. Sorting by meta value does not work in WooCommerce&#8217;s wc_get_orders.</li>\n<li>Fix: Order by random now works as expected in our periodic status check for charges.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: The 1.8.2 migration will no longer throw a fatal error for some installations if a subscription does not exist on an order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where an invalid &#8220;my account&#8221; page link would cause checkout to not work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added <code>_vipps_recurring_latest_failed_charge_reason</code> and <code>_vipps_recurring_latest_failed_charge_description</code> to subscriptions.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Migrate the aforementioned data.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Update tested up to, now 5.8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Added an exit condition after attempting to redirect to the Cancelled Vipps MobilePay Purchase page. This should in theory make this redirect work every single time.</li>\n<li>Fix: No longer clean up necessary data like charge id or whether the charge is pending on renewals.</li>\n<li>Fix: Force re-checking of older charges that are affected by the aforementioned fix.</li>\n<li>Change: We now check 8 charges at the same time instead of 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Cancelled agreements can not be updated, thus we can not say that they have been cancelled in the description. Ensure we run the &#8220;maybe_update_subscription_details_in_app&#8221; code before we cancel an agreement, and only if the agreement is still &#8220;ACTIVE&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Fix: Ensure we only ever cancel an agreement once.</li>\n<li>Fix: It&#8217;s no longer possible to end up with more than one Vipps MobilePay agreement by changing gateway twice or more on accident (this bug was introduced in 1.7.0).</li>\n<li>Enhancement: We now cancel DUE charges in Vipps MobilePay when you change an order&#8217;s status to &#8216;Cancelled&#8217; or &#8216;Failed&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Add missing Norwegian translation for &#8220;No failed charges found.&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Fix: Failed charges now appear properly in the &#8220;Failed charges&#8221; list.</li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an edge case when changing payment method to Vipps MobilePay as a customer, when already using Vipps MobilePay.</li>\n<li>Fix: Support upgrading to a different product variation. Price is now passed along properly and a campaign is applied in order to not confuse the customer.</li>\n<li>Fix: Update agreement in app when downgrading or not prorating a subscription.</li>\n<li>Fix: Do not allow multiple subscriptions in a single Vipps MobilePay payment when other gateways that support it are enabled.</li>\n<li>Fix: No longer show the &#8220;capture&#8221; button on an order where the charge has failed previously.</li>\n<li>Fix: Delete meta values from renewal and resubscribe orders to make sure we get fresh charges.</li>\n<li>Fix: WooCommerce&#8217;s automatic retry system should now work as expected on renewal orders. We now override the behaviour of <code>wcs_is_scheduled_payment_attempt</code> in our <code>check_charge_status</code> function.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: The subscription description is now prefixed in the Vipps MobilePay app with &#8220;[Pending cancellation]&#8221;, &#8220;[Cancelled]&#8221; and &#8220;[On hold]&#8221; depending on the subscription&#8217;s status.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a setting per product for what source should be used for an agreement&#8217;s description. You can now choose between product title, product short description, or custom text.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Display sign up fees in a better way in the Vipps MobilePay app. Use a campaign with a price of 0,- until the next payment date.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Update item name and description in app for delayed in-app updates.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a link to explain the various possible failure reasons.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Ability to change gateway from the admin dashboard, this means setting another Vipps MobilePay agreement ID manually. This should also allow using the REST API to create a subscription.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Bring style on notices and in product tabs up to par with the Vipps MobilePay e-com plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Swapping payment gateway to Vipps MobilePay now works again after the recent WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscription updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: &#8216;free&#8217; agreements where the agreement status is &#8216;STOPPED&#8217; should not be completed.</li>\n<li>Fix: Do not attempt to fetch charge for synchronised renewals at initial order.</li>\n<li>Fix: Add &#8216;completed&#8217; to &#8216;woocommerce_valid_order_statuses_for_payment_complete&#8217; conditionally instead of rolling our own logic.</li>\n<li>Fix: Remove visibility modifier from <code>const</code> to fix support for PHP 7.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: There&#8217;s now an overview of failed charges and their failure reason on the Settings -&gt; Vipps/MobilePay recurring payments page.</li>\n<li>Refactor: Use the Helper class for most of our frequently used meta keys.</li>\n<li>Refactor: Renamed the class filenames, class names remain untouched.</li>\n<li>Fix: Redirect to last known agreement confirmation URL if the agreement is pending. This prevents being stuck in checkout.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: No longer attempt to charge a non existent agreement when a renewal is attempted on a subscription that does not have a Vipps MobilePay agreement.</li>\n<li>Fix: Multibyte characters like &#8216;æøå&#8217; in product titles work, these characters caused an internal server error when json encoding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Cancelled or expired &#8220;zero amount&#8221; payments getting stuck in the checking queue</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: A rare edge case where an order was never captured for a long time and the order would not disappear from the status checker tool.</li>\n<li>Fix: A rare edge case where a new pending renewal order would not fetch the Charge ID properly when hitting the capture payment button.</li>\n<li>Fix: Fixed an issue where 100% off coupons did not automatically complete the initial purchase</li>\n<li>Enhancement: The status checker tool now shows the latest status from the API as a column value</li>\n<li>Enhancement: We now validate Vipps MobilePay API details when you save your settings</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fixed a bug where you were able to checkout the same order more than once while a Vipps MobilePay agreement is not expired. This fixes problems with multiple charges occurring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: We&#8217;re no longer trying to cancel an agreement in Vipps MobilePay when the status is anything other than <code>ACTIVE</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix: No longer throw an error and retry with &#8220;latest charge&#8221; when we hit a rate limit when checking a single charge.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: No longer mark an order as &#8220;Failed&#8221; if a charge&#8217;s status is &#8220;FAILED&#8221; unless an agreement is also &#8220;EXPIRED&#8221; or &#8220;STOPPED&#8221; (a user can be prompted to swap card or top-up bank account in-app).</li>\n<li>Fix: No longer attempt to cancel an already cancelled charge.</li>\n<li>Fix: We should no longer hit the Vipps MobilePay API rate-limit as a result of a renewal order.</li>\n<li>Fix: Properly set the <code>_charge_id</code> meta key when capturing a payment.</li>\n<li>Fix: Changing of gateways to Vipps/MobilePay recurring payments would sometimes cancel the new agreement instead of the old one due to a race condition.</li>\n<li>Fix: Multiples of the same product in the same subscription will now be charged correctly based on the total order price.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Updated the <code>WC_VIPPS_RECURRING_RETRY_DAYS</code> constant to 4 days by default.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Bolstered compatibility with WC &lt; 3.0. Created a bunch of helper functions and doubled down on our backwards compatibility with fetching IDs and fetching plus updating meta.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: If you update a subscription&#8217;s order item prices this will now be reflected in the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fix a bug when an agreement is created twice on the same order. We didn&#8217;t fetch the right charge ID. This is a temporary fix I will have to revisit later on a proper setup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Changed how we make requests to minimize the amount of times we hit Vipps MobilePay&#8217;s rate limits. If you have gotten a lot of exceptions lately<br />\nthat look like this: <code>HTTP Response Error: (recurring/v2/agreements/:id/charges) with request body: Array</code> it&#8217;s because of rate limits.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Errors caused by HTTP requests now have more debug information attached to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added an option to move renewal orders from &#8220;processing&#8221; to &#8220;completed&#8221; when the charge completes in Vipps MobilePay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Truncate agreement description if it&#8217;s longer than 100 characters and truncate productName if it&#8217;s longer than 45.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Truncate initialCharge description if it&#8217;s longer than 45 characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Added a polyfill for the PHP <code>array_key_last</code> function for hosts with PHP &lt; 7.3.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Added a &#8220;Default status to give orders with a reserved charge&#8221; option.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved safety of reserved charges, they should never be put in an unrecoverable state anymore. Un-nested payment logic so we should never run into a similar case again.</li>\n<li>Fix: Refunding a reversed charge now works, just like pending charges in version 1.3.9.</li>\n<li>Change: &#8220;Default status to give pending renewal orders&#8221; default is now &#8220;processing&#8221; instead of &#8220;on hold&#8221;</li>\n<li>Change: Removed &#8220;completed&#8221; as a possible default status for the &#8220;Default status to give pending renewal orders&#8221; setting as this status is conventionally used for orders that are completely finished.</li>\n</ul>\n"
