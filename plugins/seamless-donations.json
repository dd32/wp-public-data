For example, if a page’s slug is seamless_donations_tab_thanks, it calls the filter validate_page_slug_seamless_donations_tab_thanks.</li>\n<li>Changed the naming convention for all admin callbacks. Prior to 5.0, admin pages were previously of the form seamless_donations_admin_[name] and, as of 5.0, are now of the form seamless_donations_tab_[name].

Unfortunately, the data wasn&#8217;t actually written to any transaction logging due to a code typo, so there&#8217;s no pre-existing gift aid data available for recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update fixing PayPal chatback bug.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>On the donor detail page, each donation now shows as Yes or No depending on whether the donation was made anonymously</li>\n<li>On the donor detail page, each donor&#8217;s overall anonymity flag is displayed under the address</li>\n<li>Donor records now have an internal overall anonymity flag.
