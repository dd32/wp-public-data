Technically they give information from the first one in the database, so in some unusual circumstance that might not be the oldest.</p>\n<p>Example 1: Link with text saying &#8220;|&lt; First&#8221;<br />\n    &lt;a href=&quot;&#8221; title=&#8221;Oldest Post&#8221;&gt;|&lt; First</a></p>\n<p>Example 2: Link with post title included<br />\n    &lt;a href=&quot;&#8221; title=&#8221;Oldest Post&#8221;&gt;|&lt; First: </a></p>\n",
