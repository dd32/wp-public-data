        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20are%20dumps%20in%20sql%3F'>\nWhat are dumps in SQL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A database dump contains a record of the table structure and/or the data from a database and is usually in the form of a list of SQL statements (&#8220;SQL dump&#8221;). A database dump is most often used for backing up a database so that its contents can be restored in the event of data loss.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20sql%20dump%3F'>\nHow do I create a SQL dump?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install our free plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/database-backup\" rel=\"ugc\">Database Backup.</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20download%20sql%20dump%3F'>\nHow do I download SQL dump?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install our free plugin database backup.

These challenges often stem from the sheer size of the database and the strain it places on system resources. To address these issues effectively, consider using tools like our plugin, <strong>BigDump</strong>. <strong>BigDump</strong> specializes in managing massive SQL dumps by breaking them into smaller, more manageable segments. This approach helps avoid <strong>failures</strong> due to timeout errors and ensures a smoother and more reliable restoration process. By leveraging <strong>BigDump</strong>, you can streamline <strong>database recovery</strong> efforts and mitigate the risks associated with handling extensive SQL backups.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
