All automatic children will be appended (added to the end) of the submenu. Leave a request on the forum if you would like this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin with custom post types and taxonomies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently you cannot. It works with pages and posts assigned to a category. Leave a request on the forum if you would like this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i use this plugin along with another menu altering plugin (e.g. megamenu) ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, all this plugin does is inject items to the nav menu array for the front-end. It doesn&#8217;t affect the rendering of the menu. Nonetheless; I cannot guarantee the behaviour of third-party menu plugins which rely on custom post types other than nav_menu_item.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
