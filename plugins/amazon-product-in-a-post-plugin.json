        "description": "<p>The Amazon Product In a Post plugin can be used to quickly add formatted Amazon Products/Items to any page or post by using just the Amazon product ASIN.</p>\n<h3>NOTICE</h3>\n<p><strong>Uses the New Amazon Product Advertising API V5</strong><br />\nAs of March 9th 2020, Amazon requires the API version 5.0 to be used. This version has a more streamlined response so some data is no longer available. <strong>Most noticeably the Product Description and Customer Reviews.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you have an Affiliate account already, you will need to Migrate your API Keys or generate a new set of keys before the plugin will work correctly.</strong><br />\nThis will also require you to add the new keys in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Amazon also requires you have your affiliate account fully approved before they will grant you access to the Amazon Product Advertising API. This means that you many not be able to use the plugin immediately until you receive access to the API.</p>\n<p>If you do not have an Amazon Affiliate Account or Amazon Product Advertising API Keys already, it is free and not too extremely difficult to set up (takes about 15 min. total for both). Once you have an account, install the plugin, enter your Amazon Associate ID and API keys in the Plugin Settings page and you are ready to start adding products to your website!</p>\n<h3>How it Works:</h3>\n<p>The plugin uses the Amazon Product Advertising API to get product information from Amazon to display on your site. To use the plugin, you must have:<br />\n1. An Amazon Affiliate Account<br />\n2. Amazon Product Advertising API keys (generated after March 2019).</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon&#8217;s Product Advertising API Terms of Use requires you have an AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key of your own to use.</strong> See <strong>Plugin FAQs</strong> or <strong>Getting Started</strong> page for links to sign up.</p>\n<h3>With this plugin you can:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add any Amazon product or item to an existing Post (or Page) or custom Post Type.</li>\n<li>Monetize your blog posts with custom Amazon Product and add your own Reviews, descriptions or any other thing you would normally want to add to a post — and still have the Amazon product there.</li>\n<li>Easily add only the items that are right for your site.</li>\n<li>Add the product to the TOP of the post content, the BOTTOM of the post content, or make the post content become part of the product layout (see screenshots for examples)</li>\n<li>You can add as many products as you want to any existing page/post content using Shortcodes — see Installation or FAQ page for details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Preformmated display of Amazon Products for easy integration (with various settings)</li>\n<li>Shortcodes for Adding Products, Product Elements, Product Grids, etc.</li>\n<li>Add new Page/Post at the same time with &#8220;New Amazon Post&#8221; feature</li>\n<li>New Gutenberg Blocks for Amazon Products, Element, Searches and Grid Layouts.</li>\n<li>You can add Product Grid Layouts, Single Product Layouts or Individual Product Elements to Pages/Posts</li>\n<li>Option to create multiple Pages/Posts from ASINs with Amazon product data auto populated (no need to add separate products)</li>\n<li>Products can use the Standard product page URL or &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221; URL (i.e., 90 day Cookie Conversions)</li>\n<li>Links can be set to open in a new window/tab</li>\n<li>Custom styling options (via CSS in the settings)</li>\n<li>Lightbox functionality for larger image popups and additional images (can be disabled).</li>\n<li>Adjustable Caching of product data to limit API Calls</li>\n<li>Test feature for verifying Amazon settings are properly set up</li>\n<li>Debugging Information for troubleshooting issues</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Known Issues:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you just applied for Amazon Product Advertising API Usage and were approved, it can still take up to several weeks before you have access to the API.</li>\n<li>The more products you add, the more overhead there is for API requests. The caching system tries to optimize the number of requests by grouping them, instead of doing them individually.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon OneLink</strong> scripts may cause some links not to work correctly by over-riding the standard product link. If you use OneLink scripts on your site and still want to add products, try to limit the Amazon OneLink scripts to pages where you will not include products.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Ads</strong> may also cause some links not to works correctly. This is the same as for Amazon OneLink.</li>\n<li><strong>Some Products or Product data is not available via the Amazon Product Advertising API.</strong> When this happens, the product will not be displayed, or the requested element will not be displayed in the product output.</li>\n<li>You must have at least twp referral sales every 30 days or you will lose your Amazon Product Advertising Account. If this happens, Amazon will deactivate your Amazon Product Advertising Account and the plugin will no longer display products. You can simply re-sign up for access and change your Amazon Keys in the settings, and they will return (products shortcodes and settings are not deleted, they just cannot be displayed).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Browse <a href=\"https://github.com/flowdee/amazon-product-in-a-post-plugin/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue tracker</a> on GitHub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kryptonitewp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Follow us on Twitter</a> to stay in contact and informed about updates</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>After you install the plugin, you need to set up your Amazon Affiliate/Associate ID in the Options panel located in the AMAZON PRODUCT menu under PLUGIN SETTING.</p>\n<p>An AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key REQUIRED. You MUST use the ROOT keys and not the User or Group Keys that Amazon recommends. See the plugin <strong>Getting Started</strong> page for additional setup instructions.</p>\n<p>No additional adjustments are needed unless you want to configure your own CSS styles. Styles can be adjusted or removed in the Options Panel as well.</p>\n",

We are finalizing them now and hope to roll them out prior to WordPress 5.0 Rollout.</li>\n<li>Our goal is to have blocks for all shortcodes (amazon-grid, amazon-elements, amazon-search and amazonproduct) and the main product (non-shortcode, currently the &#8216;meta-box&#8217; default option) with the ability to make easy customization to the product layout/elements. Our early tests are looking/working great!</li>\n<li>Anyone still wanting to use the Classic Editor will be able to still use shortcodes like they currently do, and you can use shortcodes in Gutenberg by using the core &#8216;shortcode&#8217; block that is included with the editor.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20need%20to%20do%20to%20get%20started%3F'>\nWhat do I need to do to get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>You need to have an Amazon Affiliate Account and you have to register for the Amazon Product Advertising API to get a set of access Keys to put in the plugin. That allows the plugin to make calls to Amazon to get Product Data and pricing.</li>\n<li>Version 3.5.1+ has a Getting Started page that helps you through the Amazon Signup for your Amazon Access Keys. Install the plugin and go to the Getting Started Page in the plugin menu for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='great%20plugin%21%20how%20do%20i%20donate%20to%20the%20cause%3F'>\nGreat Plugin! How do I donate to the cause?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent question! The plugin is provided free to the public — you can use it however you like — where ever you like — you can even change it however you like.

Takes parameters for &#8216;keywords&#8217;, &#8216;search_index&#8217;, and &#8216;item_page&#8217; as well some other parameters of &#8216;amazon-elements&#8217; shortcode.<br />\nExample <code>[amazon-product-search keywords='disney' search_index='All' item_page='1']</code>.

    "description": "<p>The Amazon Product In a Post plugin can be used to quickly add formatted Amazon Products/Items to any page or post by using just the Amazon product ASIN.</p>\n<h3>NOTICE</h3>\n<p><strong>Uses the New Amazon Product Advertising API V5</strong><br />\nAs of March 9th 2020, Amazon requires the API version 5.0 to be used. This version has a more streamlined response so some data is no longer available. <strong>Most noticeably the Product Description and Customer Reviews.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you have an Affiliate account already, you will need to Migrate your API Keys or generate a new set of keys before the plugin will work correctly.</strong><br />\nThis will also require you to add the new keys in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Amazon also requires you have your affiliate account fully approved before they will grant you access to the Amazon Product Advertising API. This means that you many not be able to use the plugin immediately until you receive access to the API.</p>\n<p>If you do not have an Amazon Affiliate Account or Amazon Product Advertising API Keys already, it is free and not too extremely difficult to set up (takes about 15 min. total for both). Once you have an account, install the plugin, enter your Amazon Associate ID and API keys in the Plugin Settings page and you are ready to start adding products to your website!</p>\n<h3>How it Works:</h3>\n<p>The plugin uses the Amazon Product Advertising API to get product information from Amazon to display on your site. To use the plugin, you must have:<br />\n1. An Amazon Affiliate Account<br />\n2. Amazon Product Advertising API keys (generated after March 2019).</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon&#8217;s Product Advertising API Terms of Use requires you have an AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key of your own to use.</strong> See <strong>Plugin FAQs</strong> or <strong>Getting Started</strong> page for links to sign up.</p>\n<h3>With this plugin you can:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add any Amazon product or item to an existing Post (or Page) or custom Post Type.</li>\n<li>Monetize your blog posts with custom Amazon Product and add your own Reviews, descriptions or any other thing you would normally want to add to a post — and still have the Amazon product there.</li>\n<li>Easily add only the items that are right for your site.</li>\n<li>Add the product to the TOP of the post content, the BOTTOM of the post content, or make the post content become part of the product layout (see screenshots for examples)</li>\n<li>You can add as many products as you want to any existing page/post content using Shortcodes — see Installation or FAQ page for details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Preformmated display of Amazon Products for easy integration (with various settings)</li>\n<li>Shortcodes for Adding Products, Product Elements, Product Grids, etc.</li>\n<li>Add new Page/Post at the same time with &#8220;New Amazon Post&#8221; feature</li>\n<li>New Gutenberg Blocks for Amazon Products, Element, Searches and Grid Layouts.</li>\n<li>You can add Product Grid Layouts, Single Product Layouts or Individual Product Elements to Pages/Posts</li>\n<li>Option to create multiple Pages/Posts from ASINs with Amazon product data auto populated (no need to add separate products)</li>\n<li>Products can use the Standard product page URL or &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221; URL (i.e., 90 day Cookie Conversions)</li>\n<li>Links can be set to open in a new window/tab</li>\n<li>Custom styling options (via CSS in the settings)</li>\n<li>Lightbox functionality for larger image popups and additional images (can be disabled).</li>\n<li>Adjustable Caching of product data to limit API Calls</li>\n<li>Test feature for verifying Amazon settings are properly set up</li>\n<li>Debugging Information for troubleshooting issues</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Known Issues:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you just applied for Amazon Product Advertising API Usage and were approved, it can still take up to several weeks before you have access to the API.</li>\n<li>The more products you add, the more overhead there is for API requests. The caching system tries to optimize the number of requests by grouping them, instead of doing them individually.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon OneLink</strong> scripts may cause some links not to work correctly by over-riding the standard product link. If you use OneLink scripts on your site and still want to add products, try to limit the Amazon OneLink scripts to pages where you will not include products.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon Ads</strong> may also cause some links not to works correctly. This is the same as for Amazon OneLink.</li>\n<li><strong>Some Products or Product data is not available via the Amazon Product Advertising API.</strong> When this happens, the product will not be displayed, or the requested element will not be displayed in the product output.</li>\n<li>You must have at least twp referral sales every 30 days or you will lose your Amazon Product Advertising Account. If this happens, Amazon will deactivate your Amazon Product Advertising Account and the plugin will no longer display products. You can simply re-sign up for access and change your Amazon Keys in the settings, and they will return (products shortcodes and settings are not deleted, they just cannot be displayed).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Browse <a href=\"https://github.com/flowdee/amazon-product-in-a-post-plugin/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue tracker</a> on GitHub</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kryptonitewp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Follow us on Twitter</a> to stay in contact and informed about updates</li>\n</ul>\n",
