        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the Settings-&gt;Easy Embed for Mixer (Wall) screen to configure the plugin</li>\n<li>To customize the feed from Mixer, fill either the &#8216;Game&#8217; field or the &#8216;Channel&#8217; field or the &#8216;Team&#8217; field. Only fill one of these fields, or the feed will not work.</li>\n<li>To add the widget to your site, you can use the shortcode [getMixerWall] within any page or post. Advanced WordPress users could also add the function call directly to their theme to use the widget outside of a page or post (more on this below)</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Shortcode Usage</h4>\n<p>To output the Mixer Wall configured on the settings page, simply use the following shortcode anywhere in a post or page within WordPress:</p>\n<p>[getMixerWall]</p>\n<p>To output a Mixer Wall configured with custom settings, you can define the settings on the shortcode like this:</p>\n<p>[getMixerWall game=&#8221;fortnite&#8221;]</p>\n<p>[getMixerWall channels=&#8221;btcdaddy,namesx,jaredfps&#8221;]</p>\n<p>[getMixerWall team=&#8221;partners&#8221;]</p>\n<p>The full list of shortcode settings:</p>\n<pre><code>id\nlimit\ngame\nchannels\nteam\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you are using multiple walls on a single page, then each of your shortcodes needs to have a unique ID. For detailed shortcode examples, please see our <a href=\"https://www.streamweasels.com/mixer-wall/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo page</a> on the StreamWeasels site.</p>\n<h4>Advanced Usage</h4>\n<p>For those of you who know your way around a WordPress theme, it&#8217;s possible to embed the Mixer Wall widget directly within your theme using the wordpress function do_shortcode. This will allow you to put the widget anywhere in your theme, even outside of a post or a page.</p>\n<p>To do so, use the following PHP code anywhere in your theme.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[getMixerWall]') ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug affecting multiple channels seperated by a comma.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
