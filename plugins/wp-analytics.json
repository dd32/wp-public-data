        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Copy files to wordpress wp-content/plugins folder.</li>\n<li>Goto to Plugins page in wordpress and activate the WordPress Google Analytics Reports plugin.</li>\n<li>Goto &#8216;Analytics Configuration&#8217; page and provide your google analytics email and password. Once you save it you will be able to select the profile. Once profile is selected you can view the report in &#8216;Analytics Report&#8217; page under Dashboard.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why the plugin is not working for me ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check if you can select analytics profile in the option page. If you cannot then your email and password may be wrong or you don&#8217;t have analytics profile attached to that email.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why my reports page is really slow ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin queries Google Analytics to get the visitors information. This might take sometime. Working on a better way to cache the result for short duration.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I modify any code in wordpress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not needed. You have to just upload the files to your plugin directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I de-activate this plugin will it affect my blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin uses some of function of wordpress. WordPress has nothing to with plugin. So de-activating this plugin is 100% safe.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
