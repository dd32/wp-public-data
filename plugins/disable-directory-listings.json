This can expose files and information to visitors.

If you want to display a page for the &#8216;plugins&#8217; and &#8216;themes&#8217; directory, you must create them as children pages of a &#8216;wp-content&#8217; page.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This plugin only works for the Apache web server.</p>\n<p>Links: <a href=\"http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/disable-directory-listings/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Homepage</a> | <a href=\"http://coffee2code.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Author Homepage</a></p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I make a WordPress page appear when a user tries to access a directory on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create a page (not post) with the same name as the directory.  And ensure the directory is listed in the plugin&#8217;s settings (found at <code>Settings -&gt; Directory Listings</code>).  If the directory you wish to create a page for is below another directory (relative to the root directory of your site) such as <code>wp-content/plugins</code>, then you must first create a page named <code>wp-content</code>, and then a page named <code>plugins</code> which you need to make a child page of <code>wp-content</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve activated the plugin but I can still see the directory listing for one of the directories protected by default; what gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Is your .htaccess writable?  Visit the plugin&#8217;s options page, <code>Settings -&gt; Directory Listings</code>, to check and find out more info.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can&#8217;t I just configure Apache directly via its .conf file to prevent directory listings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Assuming you already have virtual directory listing enabled and have edit/write capabilities on Apache&#8217;s httpd.conf file (or the .conf file containing the configuration for your site) you could remove the <code>Indexes</code> option, so that, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>Options All Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews \n</code></pre>\n<p>becomes</p>\n<pre><code>Options All FollowSymLinks MultiViews \n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you could add:</p>\n<pre><code>Options -Indexes\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you have the capability and knowledge to do this, that&#8217;s great and I urge you to do so.  However, if you don&#8217;t have that capability because you are on a shared host and can&#8217;t edit Apache&#8217;s httpd.conf file, or you want some easier, fine-grained controls, you can give this plugin a shot.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
