        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this plugin works in WordPress older than 2.7.x?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe, but use it at your own risk. I&#8217;ll not support anyone using outdated WP (or outdated PHP). At the moment of writing this I&#8217;m running this plugin on <strong>WordPress 2.9 and PHP 5.x</strong> and works fine, and was running without problems on <strong>WP 2.8.x and 2.7.x</strong> too. If you run anything below <strong>WP 2.7 and PHP 5.x</strong>, please update for your own good! (and dont ask me for support).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why you did this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I wanted a <strong>(single) simple</strong> plugin to notify my the maillists we subscribe about our new posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are you planning to add more features?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At first only a few little improvements maybe. But if someone suggest a nice feature, and if I have time enough maybe I&#8217;ll add it.<br />\nBut it&#8217;s not my priority. I want to keep it simple.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to show the short permalink to my visitors. How can I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply put <code>&lt;?php short_permalink(); ?&gt;</code> in your theme where you want to show short permalink. You can add the parameter &#8216;linktext&#8217;, <code>&lt;?php short_permalink('linktext'); ?&gt;</code> and it will use the short permalink as text for the link too. Or if you have advanced knowledge of WordPress<br />\ntheme coding, you can get the <code>'short_url'</code> post meta directly and showing it as you like.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
