We allow artists, managers, and promoters to add their events to our platform. You may submit your performer and events to our &#8220;gigposter&#8221; here: https://rukkus.com/musicspace/performer/profile</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I not seeing upcoming performances in my article?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin only shows performances near your location, which is to say that if the performers in your post are not performing near your location, no events will show up. If you believe you have found a bug, please contact us at hi@rukkus.com</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin identify performers in the text?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your text is analyzed by our servers, which take our database of over 80,000 performers and hundreds of thousands of events happening throughout the world and try to tag these performers. We take privacy very seriously, and we do not store any information about your visitors or your content.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
