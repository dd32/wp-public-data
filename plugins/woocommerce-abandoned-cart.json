        "4.5 (28.12-2017)": "<ul>\n<li><p>This version has 1 bug fix.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug Fixed - Made some performance optimizations so the plugin occupies less CPU resources. We will continue working on this so the resource usage stays low.</p></li>\n</ul>",

Then the slug name of selected variations were showing in the abandoned cart reminder emails and on the abandoned cart details page. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancement - If the abandoned cart total is zero then abandoned cart reminder emails will not be sent to the customers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancement - When the email sending script is executed on the server, it was running a large number of MySQL queries for guest users. That was causing an increase in the server load. In this version, we have optimised the queries. Initially, it used to query even those guest user records for which emails were already sent. Now, it will only query those records where email is yet to be sent.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancement - Removed the Active field from the add / edit email template page.

Now, the plugin will use selected WordPress date and time format.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "3.7 (10.04.2017)": "<ul>\n<li><p>This version has 1 bug fix.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug Fixed - If guest customer places an order by selecting &quot;Create an account&quot; checkbox or enters the password in &quot;Account password&quot; field on the checkout page, then an abandoned cart was created after &quot;Cart abandoned cut off time&quot; is reached.

When this setting is enabled it will enable tracking of abandoned products &amp; carts even if the customer does not visit the checkout page or does not enter any details on the checkout page like Name or Email. Tracking will begin as soon as a visitor adds a product to their cart and visits the cart page.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancement - The default settings value for &quot;Cart abandoned cut-off time&quot; for logged-in users has been modified to 10 minutes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancement - The Settings tab of the plugin has been redesigned.

If the &quot;WP Better Emails&quot; plugin is activated on the site then CSS style of this plugin will be applied to the test email and abandoned cart reminder email.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancement - When the email sending script is executed on the server, it was running a large number of MySQL queries for guest users. That was causing an increase in the server load. In this version, we have optimised the queries. Now, the plugin will not fetch all the guest users record as it will fetch the necessary record which needs to be checked. This will improve the site performance.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "3.3 (22.11.2016)": "<ul>\n<li><p>This version has 2 bug fixes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug fixed: If the store has the wrong guest user id in the database then it was creating issues where guest users cart was not populating the correct cart data while recovering their cart from reminder email received. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug fixed: If plugin is being used with PHP7, it was showing an error &quot;Bitwise shifts by negative number will throw an ArithmeticError in PHP 7.0&quot;. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n</ul>",

This has been fixed.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "3.1 (15.09.2016)": "<ul>\n<li><p>New Feature - The email sending logic has been changed. Due to some reason, the abandoned cart remainder emails are not sent to the customers at the time they are intended to be sent, and if after some time, the emails start sending, then multiple email templates whose interval has been reached were all sent together. Now, the plugin will also consider the last abandoned cart reminder email sent time and will keep a time gap between the last email template that was sent &amp; the current email template&#039;s time, thereby ensuring emails are not sent together.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug Fixed - The &quot;Alter&quot; table queries have been changed in the plugin. Instead of using get_results(), it now uses the query().</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug Fixed - We have used the encryption libraries mcrypt_encrypt, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_256 to generate the cart links sent in the abandoned cart reminder emails. Due to this on some servers where these libraries were not enabled, the abandoned cart email notification were not sent to the recipients. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug Fixed - Earlier the &quot;InnoDB&quot; table engine type was hardcoded in plugin queries. As a result, the plugins tables were not created where the engine type was other than &quot;InnoDB&quot;. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bug Fixed - Some warnings were displayed in the Debug log file. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "3.0 (26.07.2016)": "<ul>\n<li><p>Enhancements - In this version, the code has been refined throughout the plugin &amp; the folder structure has also been modified.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enhancements - Earlier rounding off of the decimal values was hardcoded in the plugin. Now, it will round the decimal values based on the WooCommerce setting named &quot;Number of Decimals&quot; which is located at WooCommerce -&gt; Settings menu.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bugs Fixed - When setting &quot;Email admin On Order Recovery&quot; is enabled &amp; order is recovered from the abandoned cart reminder notifications using &quot;Cash On Delivery&quot; payment gateway. Then the order is not considered as recovered &amp; the order was not displayed in the &quot;Recovered Orders&quot; tab.

This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bugs Fixed - The &quot;Abandoned Date&quot; column of the abandoned orders tab was not considering the time for sorting. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "2.9 (05.07.2016)": "<ul>\n<li><p>New Feature - New merge tag {{cart.unsubscribe}} has been added for email templates. This merge tag allows user to stop receiving further abandoned cart reminder email notifications. This merge tag has been added to comply with email sending laws in different countries.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bugs Fixed - Earlier if any user came from abandoned cart reminder email and place the order using PayPal payment gateway and do not reach the order received page. Then plugin was not considering that order as a recovered order. From now onwards if the user came from the abandoned cart reminder email and place the order using PayPal and does not reach the order received the page. Then plugin will consider that cart as a recovered order.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bugs Fixed - When the cart is abandoned as a guest &amp; product have the special character in the attributes name, then it was displaying a blank row with only a checkbox on the Abandoned Orders tab. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweak - If the order is recovered from the abandoned cart reminder email then it will add a note &quot;This order was abandoned &amp; subsequently recovered.&quot; for the order.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "2.8 (18.05.2016)": "<ul>\n<li><p>We have changed the encryption for the links that are sent in the Abandoned cart email notifications. Earlier we were using the mcrypt library for encoding the data. If mcrypt library was not installed on the server, then abandoned cart email notifications were not sent. Now we have used different functions for encoding the string. We have used microtime function &amp; a security key. Using this security key, and after applying an algorithm on it, we generate the encoded string.</p></li>\n<li><p>The session now starts only on required pages of the store. Earlier it was started globally. This will help to improve the site performance.</p></li>\n<li><p>If billing email address of the logged-in user is not set then it was showing blank space on the abandoned orders list. This has been fixed. Now it will show the email address which was used while registering to the store.</p></li>\n<li><p>Earlier if email body was blank and we send the test email then blank email was sent. This has been fixed. Now if email body is blank then test email will not be sent.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweak - Earlier we were populating the guest cart information by looping into the global WooCommerce cart. Now we are not looping &amp; instead using the WooCommerce session object itself.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweak - Earlier if the &#039;wp-content&#039; directory has been renamed, then wp-load.php file was not included and abandoned cart reminder email was not sent.  Now, we have changed the way of including the wp-load.php file for sending the abandoned cart reminder notifications.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweak - Earlier when {{products.cart}} merge tag is used in abandoned cart email template, then on click of the product name and product image, it was redirecting to the product page. Now it will redirect the user to the cart page.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tweak - We are now rounding off the prices with the &#039;round&#039; function.</p></li>\n</ul>",
        "2.7 (14.04.2016)": "<ul>\n<li><p>New setting named as &quot;Email Template Header Text&quot; is added in Add / Edit template page. It will allow to change the header text of the email which have WooCommerce template style setting enabled for the template.</p></li>\n<li><p>From this version, the email sending process will run every 15 minutes instead of every 5 minutes. This will result in improved overall performance of the website.</p></li>\n<li><p>When Lite version of the plugin is activated on the site then it was not allowing to activate the PRO version of the plugin. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n<li><p>When templates are created / updated and if it has the same duration as one of the existing templates, then new template was not saved. This has been fixed.</p></li>\n</ul>",

It is also capable of deleting abandoned orders in bulk from the &quot;Abandoned orders&quot; tab.</p></li>\n<li><p>Email Templates tab has been re-designed to be consistent with the WordPress styling. It is now capable of deleting email templates in bulk. Action column in the Email templates tab has been removed. User can Edit &amp; Delete template using hover affect on the template.

For new users of the plugin, the setting will be enabled for the existing default email template that is provided with the plugin.</li>\n<li>Abandoned cart email notification will be sent to the client&#039;s billing address entered on checkout instead of on the email address added by the user while registering to the website.
