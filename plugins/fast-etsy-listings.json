Then simply search for &#8216;Fast Etsy Listings&#8217; and install/activate the plugin.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download this plugin from here</li>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/fast-etsy-listings</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to &#8216;enable auto-updates&#8217; to ensure you get bug fixes and new features automatically deployed.</p>\n<p>Use the &#8216;Settings-&gt;Fast Etsy Listings&#8217; screen to configure the plugin</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20just%20show%20items%20from%20my%20own%20etsy%20shop%3F'>\nHow do I just show items from my own Etsy Shop?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The simplest method is to first enter your Etsy shop name in the setting field &#8216;Default Etsy Shop name&#8217;. Then use the Fast Etsy Shop Listings block or shortcode which will then show stock you have listed on Etsy.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, per block or shortcode you add to your site you can set the Etsy shop to show listings from.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20fast%20etsy%20listings%20display%20a%20link%20to%20the%20author%27s%20website%20under%20results%3F'>\nDoes Fast Etsy Listings display a link to the author&#8217;s website under results?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No!<br />\nFast Etsy Listings <em>does not</em> add any external links on your website back to the author&#8217;s site. This clutters up your website, hurts your search engine ranking and is against WordPress plugin guidelines!<br />\nOnly links to Etsy items you want on your website are presented and these are all tagged as &#8216;nofollow&#8217; to avoid any negative SEO impact. You can optionally choose if Etsy links should open in a new tab/window.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20slideshows%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat types of slideshows are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fast Etsy Listings supports several types of slideshow and pagination; manual, auto, &#8216;load more&#8217; button, list by category.</p>\n<p>Manual: Will present slides that visitors can manually step through using buttons beneath.</p>\n<p>Auto: Will present a slideshow that automatically steps through the slides, fading between each every 10 seconds by default. You can change the slideshow speed in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Load more&#8217; button: Will present a button for visitors to load the next slide/page of results beneath the rest.</p>\n<p>List by Category: Will present a long list of results grouped under eBay category headings.</p>\n<p>All slideshows can be configured with as many slides as desired, limited only by the number of items returned from Etsy.</p>\n<p>Each slide can be configured with as many rows and columns as desired to produce a grid of items per slide.</p>\n<p>Manual and Auto slideshow work best when displaying a grid with 1 or 2 rows of results. The &#8216;Load more&#8217; button works best when displaying large numbers of results for a visitor to scroll through (especially mobile users).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20customize%20the%20colors%20etc%20of%20listings%3F'>\nHow do I customize the colors etc of listings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Within the settings, you choose to inherit your WordPress theme&#8217;s color scheme (default), black text on white background, or white text on a black background style.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can override the CSS styles manually. Please get in touch with the visual customization you would like in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20customize%20the%20fields%20displayed%20on%20listings%3F'>\nHow do I customize the fields displayed on listings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Within the setting you can choose which fields to display for search results on blocks/shortcodes, results shown on widgets and for the single item block/shortcode separately.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
