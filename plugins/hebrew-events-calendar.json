Goto the edit screen and edit the event data in the &#8220;Hebrew Event&#8221; metabox. Less info usually results in reoccuring events. For instance, if you set the weekday to &#8220;Friday&#8221; and the time to &#8220;6:00 PM&#8221; then the event will be every Friday at 6:00PM.

Until then here is a short description of the fields in the edit post meta boxes:</p>\n<p>Hebrew Event Metabox</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time: This is either an absolute time (12:24 pm) or a relative time offset (-0:18 = minus eighteen minutes, +2:00 = plus two hours)</li>\n<li>Weekday: Dropdown for either Gregorian (Sunday, Monday, &#8230;) or Hebrew (Rishon, Sheni, &#8230;).   Note that Hebrew days start at sunset.</li>\n<li>Week: Which week of the month the event occurs (1, 2, 3, &#8230;)</li>\n<li>Day: Day of month event occurs in. If the month selected is a Hebrew month than the day of that month is used</li>\n<li>Month: Dropdown for either Gregorian (January, February, &#8230;) or Hebrew (Teshri, Cheshvan, &#8230;)</li>\n<li>Year: Year of the event. Years larger than 5000 are assumed to be a Hebrew year.</li>\n<li>Sunrise: Whether to begin the event at sunrise</li>\n<li>Duration: Duration of event in days, hours &amp; minutes. For instance, 2:25 = 2 hours &amp; 25 minutes or 2 3:00 = 2 days and 3 hours</li>\n<li>Start Date: The start of a the window in which the event is allowed to occur. Right now the format is M/d/Y</li>\n<li>Stop Date: The stop of a the window in which the event is allowed to occur. Right now the format is M/d/Y</li>\n<li>Hebrew Encoded Dates: The Hebrew day &amp; month for encodeded days. Needed for parashah and holiday calculation. See http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm for a basic explanation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hebrew Event Occurences Metabox</p>\n<p>Here notes can be attached to upcoming occurences and occurences can hidden. If a reoccuring event instance is cancelled you can just uncheck that specific occurence without deleting the event.</p>\n<h4>How do I get Holidays &amp; Parashot?</h4>\n<p>Import http://templeisraelvaldosta.org/files/2011/07/holidays-diaspora.xml using WordPress import WXR for Diapora pages. More to come.</p>\n",
