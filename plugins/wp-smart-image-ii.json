Custom fields (e.g.) is a very wrong and annoying way to do this job.

In an attempt to do that, many people have tried to do it by setting through custom fields, ignoring that WordPress has a large platform with many resources at our disposal to do that.</p>\n<h4>What isn&#8217;t Wp Smart Image II?</h4>\n<p>It is not a filter that works inside the content.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Where can I find Documentation/Support about this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The main documentation site is the <a href=\"http://www.lab.darioferrer.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lab</a>. Here you can find all detailed information about WP Smart Image II.</p>\n<p>Also you can find direct support at WPSI II forums: <a href=\"http://www.darioferrer.com/que/viewforum.php?f=4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">English users</a> | <a href=\"http://www.darioferrer.com/que/viewforum.php?f=2\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Spanish users</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>WP Smart Image II uses custom fields for store basic data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Using custom fields to show attached images is a wrong method. Yes, it is relatively famous, but is wrong. <a href=\"http://www.wordpress.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress</a> has a very advanced ways to control post&#8217;s images. However, saying is not the same than do it, because many times it is some difficult to achieve tha we want in this area. WP Smart Image II simply makes this work a quite more easy to you.</p>\n<p>However, WP Smart Image II works with postmeta fields to more complex jobs (as show external images) storing a minimal needed data to make the job.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WP Smart Image II adds many data in my DB?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Noup. This plugins uses all existing post data you have been entered through WordPress Editor. Only creates a little field in options table to save your settings. If you choose to use the editor&#8217;s widget, one field per post will be created in the _postmeta table (only if you make any configuration throught the widget; otherwise no fields will be created).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I settings my images to be shown?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload the images through your edition panel (required for database file association).</li>\n<li>In the Gallery section <strong>drag the image you want to show to the first position</strong>, then it will be shown, even if you don&#8217;t use it in the content.</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Hey, I can&#8217;t see the widget in my editor!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just activate the checkbox for option &#8220;Activate editor box&#8221; through Settings page. Save your settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This new widget disables my previous settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not. Your old settings remain unbroken.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where I must to place the tag?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should place the tag into <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the loop</a> (see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smart-image/screenshot-3.png\" rel=\"ugc\">screenshot #3</a> for a graphic example)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can place the parameters in an unordered way?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can combine parameters without an specific order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>All parameters are right to all situations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some parameters may not appear depending of your settings. E.g. a &#8220;rel&#8221; attribute will not shown in an unlinked image, because &#8220;rel&#8221; is a property of links. In cases like this, if you set wrong parameters the plugin simply ignore them and works anyway. Another example: if you have a Stric DTD site and if you activate a &#8220;target _blank&#8221;, of course you&#8217;ll ruin your standard. If you add a fixed ID&#8217;s to several images or links, you are proceeding in a wrong way.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, if you are trying to implement some javascript/ajax toy defining &#8220;rel&#8221; or &#8220;id&#8221; parameters , you are in a good way to achieve what you want, depending of your intentions.</p>\n<p>For a better handling of WPSI II parameters, start from the <a href=\"http://www.lab.darioferrer.com/doc/index.php?title=WPSI_II_-_Parameters_Table\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">parameters table</a>, so you can taking a look to available options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>&#8220;Dario, you forgot to add certain function&#8230;&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please let me know you&#8217;re thinking through any of ways above. Thank you!.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>&#8220;I&#8217;m a programming guru and I think you can modify this string in this way&#8230;&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All your suggestions are welcome. Thank you!.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>&#8220;I translated your plugin man!&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nice&#8230; let me know! 😀</p>\n</p>\n\n",
