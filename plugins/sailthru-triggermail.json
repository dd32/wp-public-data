        "faq": "<h4>How do I create a newsletter signup form?</h4>\n<p>In the &#8216;Edit Forms&#8217; section, you can create, edit and delete all of your forms.  This section contains more detailed instructions for building the forms in HTML and embedding them on your website.</p>\n<h4>How do I send a blast?</h4>\n<p>Blasts are sent from the &#8216;Send an Email Blast&#8217; section.  You can load a saved template (created on our <a href=\"http://www.sailthru.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>) or create a new one right on this page.

Once enabled, you will be able to choose a template from your Sailthru account to be sent.  You may use any replacement fields that exist for the signup form (e.g. &#8220;first_name&#8221;, &#8220;last_name&#8221;).</p>\n<h4>Can I integrate Horizon with my blog?</h4>\n<p>Enable this by setting the subdomain in &#8216;General Options&#8217;.</p>\n<h4>How do I create a datafeed?</h4>\n<p>In the &#8216;Manage Datafeed&#8217; section, you can add, edit and delete datafeeds.
