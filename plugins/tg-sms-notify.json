        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow much does each SMS cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on the destination country and Twilio. Destination country is the country number to which the SMS notifications will be delivered. If you have consumed your free-tier on Twilio, please check the rates there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan mail notifications be enabled instead?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When we started building the plugin, we realised there were other plugins doing the job of sending emails. Rather WordPress or WooCommerce core were sending emails pretty fine.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWe use *XYZ* SMS provider as they provide better rates. Can it be integrated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We won&#8217;t say no if they have a free plan on which we can do the integration testing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWe want the notifications to be generated for an event not covered by the plugin, yet.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please drop us an email at info@karmadaily.com and we&#8217;d get in touch if that may be possible.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
