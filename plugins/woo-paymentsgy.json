Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the<br />\npoint release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Manual installation</p>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.<br />\nThe WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this.</a></p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Does this plugin work with credit cards or just Payments.GY?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not support credit card payments. There is room for this feature as the core platform evolves.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this support both production mode and sandbox mode for testing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does – production and sandbox mode is driven by how you connect. You may choose to connect in either mode, and disconnect and reconnect in the other mode whenever you want.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When do I get paid?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You get paid immediately. The order status in your WooCommerce orders section will change from <code>Pending Payment</code> to <code>On Hold</code> and payment will display in your Payments.GY Merchant account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work with my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin will work with any theme. If you&#8217;re looking for a theme with built in WooCommerce integration we recommend <a href rel=\"nofollow ugc\"></a><br />\nstorefront</p>\n</p>\n\n",
