        "faq": "\n<h4>I&#8217;ve tried the plugin and it doesn&#8217;t do what I want, help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you think the plugin doesn&#8217;t work, please try contacting me and I will endeavour to help. You can either start a forum topic on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/readme-generator\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress site</a> or leave a comment on my site on the plugin page <a href=\"https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/readme-generator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Readme Generator Page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is the Content converted into the readme.txt?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin by default will copy all the post content into the readme.txt but it tries to convert some HTML markup into &#8216;readme.txt&#8217; syntax. Roughly it does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;h3&gt;Heading&lt;/h3&gt;</code> into <code>== Heading ==</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;h5&gt;Heading&lt;/h5&gt;</code> into <code>= Heading =</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code> into <code>* Item</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code> into <code>1. Item</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>Code</code> into <code>&#096;Code&#096;</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;a href=\"LINK\"&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;</code> into <code>[Text](LINK)</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;em&gt;Text&lt;/em&gt;</code> into <code>*Text*</code></li>\n<li>Convert <code>&lt;stong&gt;Text&lt;/strong&gt;</code> into <code>**Text**</code></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How is the Plugin header generated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You plugin header is generated using the settings that have been entered into the &#8216;Generate Readme File&#8217; options box on the page/post that you wish to use as the basis of the readme.txt. These settings are stored with the post/page as metadata, they are saved when you update/create the post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin generate .pot files automatically?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If enabled the plugin will <em>attempt</em> to find all the &#8216;<code>__()</code>&#8216; and &#8216;<code>_e()</code>&#8216; items in all the php files in the plugin&#8217;s directory and generate a standard .pot file using the strings that it finds.<br />\nIt will provide warnings if it finds more than one text-domain, or if the text domain is missing. However the php file parsing is quiet primitive and unmatched braces or quotes will probably confuse it (&#8216;()&#8221;&#8216;). Probably better to use xgettext, if you have it!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you show me some examples?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The readme file for this plugin was generated using the &#8216;Readme Generator&#8217; plugin.</p>\n<p>The original post can be seen on my site&#8217;s <a href=\"/plugins/readme-generator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin page</a>, in your browser select &#8216;view page source&#8217; to see the HTML that created it (inside the &#8216;content&#8217; div).<br />\nYou can see the readme.txt file that was generated by downloading the plugin or directly through <a href=\"/diary/wp-content/plugins/readme-generator/readme.txt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this link</a>.<br />\nYou can see how WordPress renders this readme.txt at the WordPress Plugin repository for the <a href=\"https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/readme-generator/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Readme Generator</a> plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
