        "description": "<p>Super Web Share is a WordPress-based native share plugin that prompts the native share action and helps users easily share a page or post with others.</p>\n<p>We developed from the ground up with simplicity and performance in mind to increase your shares. As SuperWebShare only shows the apps installed within the device upon the share prompt, the rate of sharing of posts/pages will be higher than showing all the social icons on a page. Due to this key reason, website developers can skip the usage of other social media icons on their website and make the share more prominent.</p>\n<p>The Super Web Share plugin for WordPress helps increase your traffic and engagement with a single quick click to share the website with your friends and social media. Super Web Share works on all supported browsers like Chrome for Android, Edge for Android, Brave for Android, and Opera for Android. It will show the native apps installed on the device once you share the article with others; due to that, users can easily share the page/post with others super easily in just a click. Upon the native share, which prompts up like a native iOS or Android share sheet, users can easily copy the website page link if they want that option.</p>\n<p>It takes less than a minute to set up Super Web Share, and we provide a clean uninstall by removing the entire data entry it creates. We also won&#8217;t save any settings to your database until you manually save the settings. We also provide a fallback native popup if the Native Web Share is not supported within the browser.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Super Web Share plugin provides a share button before and after the post/page content and a floating share button where you can set the color, the text of the share buttons, and the position of the floating button; it can also set the pages or posts which you would like to show the share buttons via our Settings page, to easily add the share feature to your websites. As a plugin that focuses on simplicity, we are fully compatible with the AMP plugin, which means you can add the native share to your AMP pages provided by the AMP plugin.</p>\n<h3>Social Platforms supported</h3>\n<p><strong>1) On Web Sharing API supported devices:</strong><br />\nYou will notice the share prompt (also called as sharesheet) where you can share the page via all applications installed on your device that accept the sharing (mobile &#8211; Android and iOS devices, tab, desktop &#8211; for Microsoft Edge browser). This means all the social platforms on your website visitor&#8217;s devices can be selected from the list to share the page in a simple click!<br />\n<strong>2) If the device or browser won&#8217;t support the native share:</strong><br />\nIf the website is viewed from a browser or device that won&#8217;t support native sharing, our fallback modal works. Within the fallback modal, you can select the social platforms you want to show for your website via our settings page (SuperWebShare &gt; Fallback). The social platforms that are interested can be selected. Right now, we are providing social media like Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Pinterest, Mastodon, Telegram, Pinterest, and Email. We&#8217;re expanding with more social platforms.</p>\n<h3>Advantages of using Super Web Share</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast and lightweight social sharing plugin for your WordPress that won&#8217;t slow down your site</li>\n<li>Increase the rate of sharing of pages and posts by users</li>\n<li>Developers / Bloggers can easily skip the number of social icons to be used on the page or post</li>\n<li>Fully AMP supported native share plugin</li>\n<li>Support on all content types like Posts, Pages</li>\n<li>Fully compatible with WooCommerce Product pages</li>\n<li>You can hide or show the sharing button based on each post/page and all via the content types</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Want to test to know how SuperWebShare works on a website?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Open <a href=\"https://superwebshare.com/?utm_source=wordpress-plugin&amp;utm_medium=wordpress-readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SuperWebShare.com</a> in a supported device.

If the browser doesn&#8217;t support Web Share API, we show the floating share and inline content share buttons on pages and posts. If you have disabled the fallback within our settings, we won&#8217;t show the fallback prompt with social share icons and a copy link option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20woocommerce%20product%20pages%3F'>\nDo you support WooCommerce product pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we do support WooCommerce Product pages. You can select &#8216;Product&#8217; within the Floating and Inline settings page, and then the social share button will appear for your WooCommerce product pages. You can also disable or enable the share button by editing the single product pages based on your interest. The one-click social share button for your WooCommerce is ready!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20report%20bugs%20and%20new%20feature%20suggestions%3F'>\nHow do I report bugs and new feature suggestions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can report the bugs and request new features you need to see at our <a href=\"https://superwebshare.com/ghdcs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository Discussion page</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20contribute%20to%20this%20awesome%20plugin%3F'>\nHow can I contribute to this awesome plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can contribute to this Web Share plugin via our <a href=\"https://github.com/superwebshare/super-web-share/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='did%20i%20need%20to%20register%20or%20sign%20up%20anywhere%20to%20use%20the%20super%20web%20share%20plugin%3F'>\nDid I need to register or sign up anywhere to use the Super Web Share plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Super Web Share is super easy to set up.
