In our case, beta refers to our work on optimizing workflows within the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What version of PHP has Workbench been tested with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Workbench has been tested to work on PHP versions 5.5 and above. If you discover your web host uses an older version of PHP, please ask them to upgrade.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I contact Sovrn?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Post to our support forum in the WordPress store at https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/sovrn-workbench or contact Sovrn support at support@sovrn.com.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I disconnected from Facebook/Twitter/Google+/AppleNews. Why aren’t my posts being removed from my social media account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Workbench cannot retroactively remove shared posts even if the account is disconnected. You will have to delete them manually from your feed if you no longer wish to see them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don’t my shares to Facebook show up on my personal account&#8217;s timeline?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can only share posts to Facebook Pages. You will need to set up a Page for your blog in order to share to Facebook.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My post has new Likes/Shares/Comments. Why aren’t I seeing that reflected on the engagement metrics?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>New likes, shares, and comments are gathered once per hour by Workbench. Depending on the timing of the engagement, you may have to wait up to an hour to see it reflected in the metrics.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren’t my posts to Facebook showing up as Instant Articles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must first sign up for Instant Articles with Facebook and have your Page’s account approved.</p>\n<p>If your Page is approved for Instant Articles, and you still are not seeing them appear:<br />\n* Check that Instant Articles has been activated.<br />\n* Make sure you are viewing on a mobile device.<br />\n* Check your page’s unpublished post feed to see if automatic publishing needs to be turned on.<br />\n* Verify that your blog’s url has been claimed by your Facebook page.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
