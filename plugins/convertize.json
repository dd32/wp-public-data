        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat Is An A/B Testing Tool For?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A/B testing compares two versions of the same webpage (A and B). Your traffic is divided between A and B, and their conversion rate is measured.</p>\n<p>An A/B testing tool like Convertize manages both pages, helps you edit page B, and keeps a record of your visitors’ behaviour. It allows you to increase your conversions, get more sales and sign-ups and reduce your bounce rate.</p>\n<p>Because you gather real data about how visitors interact with your content, you can systematically optimize your website page by page. Convertize makes WordPress A/B testing easier (and faster) than other tools, which is why it is a popular VWO alternative and a great alternative to AB Tasty or Optimizely.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs Installation Difficult?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Installation is very easy.</p>\n<p>To start A/B testing your WordPress website, first add the Convertize plugin. Then, <a href=\"https://app.convertize.io/auth/login/register?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=plugin-listing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register for a Convertize account</a>. Once you have registered, you will receive the code needed to activate your Convertize plugin.</p>\n<p>With the Plugin activated, you are able to edit pages, run tests and install notifications immediately.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow Do I Track The Results?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Convertize will track every visit to your site, sending some visitors to page A and some to page B. The number directed to each version will change depending on which page performs best. That way, you never waste any of your traffic.</p>\n<p>The results page shows you which page converted best for every day that your A/B test is running.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I make a Mistake?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Don’t worry! Convertize includes an in-built checklist to make sure your test works. It has a number of additional safety features. Because the system responds immediately to your visitors’ behaviour, the best-performing page receives the majority of your traffic. Even if your test scenario is less popular than the original page, you won’t lose out on conversions.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
