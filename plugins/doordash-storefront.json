        "description": "<p>Storefront by DoorDash is an online ordering system that allows businesses to incorporate DoorDash ordering, delivery, and pickup logistics directly into their website, with zero commissions. Storefront enables businesses to turn a standard informational site into an e-commerce site, allowing them to own more parts of the customer relationship, including customer insights and ordering data.</p>\n<p>Storefront is now available to all restaurants in the U.S., whether or not they are already partnered with DoorDash. You can get started by going to <a href=\"https://get.doordash.com/products/storefront\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Storefront website</a> or using your DoorDash merchant portal to signup for Storefront.</p>\n<p>This creates a unique ordering link for your business. The next step is to add this link to your website. We help you do this using the Storefront WordPress plugin. The plugin helps you create a custom high visibility ordering button that significantly improves customers ability to place an order on your website. Once you have signed up for Storefront, all you need is your Store ID and Business ID to get the plugin setup. These are available in the DoorDash merchant portal. If you are having issues, you can always reach out to storefronthelp@doordash.com.</p>\n<p>The plugin utilizes the Storefront SDK. It is a simple javascript library that runs in the browser, and depending on the configuration provided injects a floating button in the page. The button and the link generated is conversion tracked. It tracks when the user sees the button, clicks on it and finally when they complete their order on Storefront.<br />\nThe SDK does not execute any PHP code on your server side. It can be simply thought of like any other third party Javascript libraries e.g. Google Tag Manager, Maps etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://help.doordash.com/merchants/s/storefront-services-terms-of-service?language=en_US\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Storefront Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</a></p>\n",
