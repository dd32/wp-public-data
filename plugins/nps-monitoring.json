Knock yourself out.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I get help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit http://www.npsmonitoring.com for any and all support inquiries.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The NPS Survey is not showing up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Several things may be happening here.</p>\n<p>The first possibility is that you already filled out the survey.  By design there are settings in your account at http://www.npsmonitoring.com that dictate how often the survey will be presented to users.  You can modify those settings to have the survey shown more often.</p>\n<p>The second possibility (if you have never seen the survey even once) is that your wordpress theme may not support the wordpress action hook entitled &#8220;wp_footer&#8221;.  This is a standard action hook used by almost all themes.  Please ensure that your theme uses this hook so that we are able to drop the NPS Monitoring widget onto your Theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know whether or not survey responses are being collected?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you login to your control panel at http://www.npsmonitoring.com you can browse individual response and well as see aggregate data and trends.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
