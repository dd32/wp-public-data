        "faq": "\n<h4>What is IPN?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IPN stands for Instant Payment Notification from the PayPal&#8217;s message service which sends a notification<br />\nwhen a transaction is affected. (Typically when a product has been sold by your website, refund for the<br />\ntransaction has been initiated or transaction changed its state from pending to confirmed.)<br />\nFor more information visit https://www.paypal.com/ipn</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to configure products?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you do not have to define products. In that case however you cannot configure a product specific follow up email<br />\nand have to use a different mechanism for proper landing page with a download link with the product the customer<br />\npurchased via PayPal. Consider a case where you have two ebooks and have only one confirmation email.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I process several products sold in one transaction via IPN?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin currently does not support IPN requests with more than one product sold per transaction.<br />\nOnly the first product in the basket will be processed by this version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have several products with the same name?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to let the customer opt-in to product specific customer newsletters the product names need to be unique per product.<br />\nWhile you can probably setup two paypal buy buttons to sell a &#8220;CD&#8221; one at $19 and another one to sell a &#8220;CD&#8221; at $9,<br />\nthe current version of this plugin requires a product name which is unique (for instance CD19 and CD9) unless you want all customers<br />\nto subscribe to a &#8220;CD&#8221; purchasing customers newsletter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can anyone help me with setting up the Enroll via IPN plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>http://evi.brickmiracles.com/tutorial contains additional useful setup information.</p>\n<p>If you have further questions please visit the plugin website:</p>\n<p>http://evi.brickmiracles.com/</p>\n<p>And get in touch with me.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
