This table stores daily counters for every ad. Here is a plugin to speed up your AppThemes installation called <strong>Faster with Stats</strong> that will clear this table on daily basis (or manually) with parameters that you specify.</p>\n<p>This table is used for showing daily hits per ad, so moving old values has no effect on total statistics, because for that purpose there is another table.<br />\nIf you are not using history data of daily statistic for some extensive reports, you don&#8217;t need this data. And this table can get really huge. My table had more than 122.000 records and was slowing my site down.</p>\n<p>Why is your site getting slower and slower? This table stores hit counts for every ad on daily basis, which means for every ad a new record is added every day if the ad was seen by anyone on that day. So, if you have many ads on your site, it could mean that even 1000 records will be added to this table daily, so in a few months this table will have more than 100.000 records.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t sound a lot, but here is what happens when a user visits your web page:<br />\nDefault theme in Classipress uses 3 tabs on front page and on every tab there are 10 ads by default. So this means that there will be 30 selects only on this table for every customer and this is a big impact on SQL server.</p>\n<p>There is also a table that stores total counters for posts, and the records are not getting clared after a post is deleted. So, this plugin will also optimize that table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Appthemes</a> <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Classipress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/clipper/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Clipper</a> or <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/jobroller/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jobroller</a> child theme is required to be installed on your WordPress for this plugin to work.</p>\n<p>Feel free to download my other plugins:<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-user-ads/\" rel=\"ugc\">Block User Ads</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cp-author-online/\" rel=\"ugc\">CP Author Online</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cp-phone-link/\" rel=\"ugc\">CP Phone Link</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-field-data-icons/\" rel=\"ugc\">Custom Field Data Icons</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/easycpmods-toolbox/\" rel=\"ugc\">EasyCPMods Toolbox</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/minimum-order-amount/\" rel=\"ugc\">Minimun Order Amount</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://easycpmods.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">EasyCPMods</a></p>\n<h3>A brief Markdown Example</h3>\n<p>Feature list:</p>\n<p><strong>Basic version</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed up your <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Appthemes</a> <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Classipress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/clipper/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Clipper</a> or <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/jobroller/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jobroller</a> instalation</li>\n<li>Show you how much time you gained with this plugin</li>\n<li>Language files if you would like to translate the plugin</li>\n<li>Moving of data can only be performed manually</li>\n<li>A graph showing you how much time you have gained with this plugin in last 3 months</li>\n<li>Option to move the data back on plugin deactivation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PRO version</strong></p>\n<p>Has the same functions as Basic version plus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving of data <strong>automatically on daily basis &#8211; recommended</strong></li>\n<li>Show you useful <strong>statistics</strong> that you can not see from main <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Appthemes</a> <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Classipress</a>, <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/clipper/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Clipper</a> or <a href=\"https://www.appthemes.com/themes/jobroller/?aid=26553\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jobroller</a> installation</li>\n<li>A graph about daily hits on posts also with number of daily shown posts</li>\n<li>A graph showing you posts from users grouped by status of the post</li>\n<li>A graph showing you user data like registered users by time, number of ads by users, number of dead users and also a table of top users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To purchase a <strong>PRO version</strong> please visit plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.easycpmods.com/plugin-faster-with-stats\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a>.</p>\n",
