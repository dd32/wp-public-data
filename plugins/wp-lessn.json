You must have Lessn installed to get any use out of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Lessn have to be installed on the same domain as my WordPress installation for WP Lessn to work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. WP Lessn allows you to specify any domain as your Lessn domain. For instance, I use <a href=\"http://jayrobinson.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JayRobinson.org</a> for my blog, but use my short domain, <a href=\"http://jwr.cc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://jwr.cc</a>, for Lessn. Lessn&#8217;s API key allows us to generate the short URL.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is your name?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>My name is still <a href=\"http://jayrobinson.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jay Robinson</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
