Be aware, the plugin will simply try to convert any string with &#8220;::&#8221; in it to a GPS link, so if you&#8217;re in the habit of using that in your posts, I recommend finding the declaration for the $searchBit variable in the PHP, changing it to whatever delimiter you like, and adjusting your post syntax accordingly.</p>\n<p>v1.0:<br />\nThis plugin will replace -one- properly formatted string in a post with a Google Maps link to the included GPS coordinates. The map will load in a new window/tab at zoom level=14, normal map view.</p>\n<p>I wrote this to use when posting from my Nokia N810 handheld with WordPy, making it very easy to add a Google Maps link to my current location without using the wp-admin site, which is slow and clumsy on the handheld&#8217;s browser.</p>\n<p>Features are minimal (only does the one thing, really), and usability could definitely use a bump. Even so, no additional development on this plugin is planned; I would suggest users looking for more comprehensive functionality take a look at WP Geo.</p>\n<p>USAGE:<br />\nYou will need three bits of info:<br />\n  A) GPS North-South coordinate<br />\n  B) GPS East-West coordinate<br />\n  C) Link text</p>\n<p>Then, type that info using the following format into your post:</p>\n<p>:gps:C::A::B:gps:</p>\n<p>For example, if you wish to post a link to a map of GPS coordinates 32.970705,-116.955461 as reported by your GPS device/handheld/etc, simply type the following string into your post:</p>\n<p>:gps:And this is an example link.::32.970705::-116.955461:gps:</p>\n<p>And the plugin will convert that to the following markup when WordPress renders the post:</p>\n<p><a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;z=14&amp;geocode=&amp;q=32.970705 ,+-116.955461' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">And this is an example link.</a></p>\n",
