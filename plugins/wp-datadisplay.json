This table needs one column called ID. 2) Upload other tables. They must also have a column called ID, which will be associated to the main table. 3) In the plugin settings, set up the datadisplay title and template, and click save changes. 4) Click on generate posts. For each row on main table, it will create one post (posttype datadisplay). Post title and content will follow the template settings.</p>\n"
