We have are working on an <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openorphanage.m1aleluya2\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Android app</a> that we are hoping to make it easier for on-site people at the orphanage to keep the children on site updated and able to communicate with sponsors. Right now it allows the creation of children, their listing on a page, and some routing for sponsors to sign up to the site. It can email the website owners about which child a sponsor is interested in, as well as signing up sponsors as stripe customers to register for monthly sponsorships. Currently, no payments are taken on site but we hope to incorporate this in our next release.</p>\n<p>The basic flow after installing is.<br />\n1. Create the children through the administrator, or soon via the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openorphanage.m1aleluya2\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Android app</a> (it still has some work to go). Fill the fields you can, please use the format mentioned for dates for now, you can use an estimated date for Birthday if needed. There is a nickname field so real names are not necessarily displayed publically. In the android app, the picture must have finished uploading before you save the child at this point.<br />\n2. Use either the Guten block, or the [oo_aleluya/] shortcode to insert the list of children on a page or post.<br />\n3. When a sponsor sees the children, he can click on &#8216;sponsor this child&#8217;.<br />\n4. Depending on if Stripe is enabled, and public registrations are allowed,<br />\n    1. If these are not, then it will ask the potential sponsor for their email and message the website owner with it, optionally triggering and IFTTT call as well.<br />\n    2. If they are, and the user is not logged in, then it will take the user to the WordPress registration page. The logo can be over-ridden in the admin with the orphanage logo. And the user will be registered as a supporter/donor, as well as a Stripe customer created. They can log in and manage their profile, and in the future, we pray they can communicate with the children they sponsor.<br />\n    3. If they are logged in, it will message the website owners about the child and interested sponsor email.<br />\n5. If Stripe is enabled, once they are registered they can also set their payment details in the User/Your Profile section of the administrator.<br />\n6. If Stripe is enabled, you may also create arbitrary donation forms via [oo_donation_block_aleluya purpose_aleluya=&#8221;(string)&#8221; expandable_aleluya=&#8221;(yes/no)&#8221;/] or Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>At this point, you would agree with the person about the child and subscription, where you could start a monthly charge with them on stripe. You could also manually organize communications via email and fund fees with the person if they agree. We hope to further automate these tasks in the next releases, God willing and if we live.</p>\n<h3>Plans</h3>\n<p>Short Term.<br />\n &#8211; Allow sponsors to sign up for monthly donations.

When a person signs up as a donor, it will create a stripe customer for the donor and attempt to synchronize the stripe customer details from WordPress to Stripe. We are working on the on-site charging mechanism, at this time you are notified by email the child that a sponsor is interested in, and the user&#8217;s email address. If stripe is not enabled, then you are still forwarded a users email when they indicate interest in a child. No card information is handled by the plugin other than contact information.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why make this, is this free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>James 1:27: Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.<br />\n&#8211; ESV2011</p>\n<p>Yes, there is no plan to charge for the software.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How far along is this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this point: you can enter children, display them, get emailed by interested sponsors, link these sponsors as stripe customers, start and stop support subscriptions, easily create forms in any page to donate to arbitrary needs without user signing up.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What Requirements does this have?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It should run on a website served over https and must be able to communicate (make REST calls) from the server. PHP should also have gd or imagemagick installed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What financial details handled or stored by the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only details regarding a users email address and name are stored on site. Stripe handles the storage of card information, and it is not handled by the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this rely on another plugin? Any Javascripts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>God be praised, the makes of wordpress have been doing an excellent job and it should work just fine out of the box. It does rely on JQuery and the Stripe JS.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
