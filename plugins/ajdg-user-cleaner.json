This means that the new registrant has 2 weeks to do something with their account. Doing something means; post a comment, create a page or create a blogpost.</p>\n<p>Additionally <strong>AJdG User Cleaner</strong> supports WooCommerce and bbPress. \\<br />\nIf the user creates an order in WooCommerce or a topic or reply in bbPress the account is not deleted.<br />\nIf either WooCommerce or bbPress is not active those will not count towards deleting the users.</p>\n<p>This works very simple, <strong>AJdG User Cleaner</strong> checks applicable accounts for the required activities. \\<br />\nThe simplicity of the plugin also means that no warning or notification is given when deleting accounts. \\<br />\nAccounts are not placed in a trash bin. Deleting of accounts is permanent.</p>\n<p>The Administrator, Editor and Author roles are excempt from deletion.</p>\n<p>This plugin has no settings and works quietly in the background.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily delete unused accounts</li>\n<li>Check if the user has created a post or page</li>\n<li>Check if the user has replied to a post (eg. placed a comment)</li>\n<li>Supports WooCommerce checks if the account has orders</li>\n<li>Supports bbPress checks if topics and replies are posted by the account</li>\n<li>Sends an email to the administration email address with how many accounts were deleted that day</li>\n</ul>\n",

So the user may be deleted.<br />\nIf you feel your use-case should be included let me know.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20the%20plugin%20works'>\nHow do I know the plugin works\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>AJdG User Cleaner</strong> sends a email notification when the cycle is finished and users have been deleted.<br />\nAlternatively you can check your Users dashboard, if a bunch went &#8216;missing&#8217;&#8230; Well, there you go.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20delete%20administrator%20accounts%3F'>\nWill this delete administrator accounts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>AJdG User Cleaner</strong> will never delete Administrator, Editor or Author accounts.<br />\nAll other accounts can be deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20recover%20deleted%20accounts%3F'>\nCan I recover deleted accounts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there is no trashbin or undo button.<br />\nThe deleted user can of-course register a new account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20delete%20all%20user%20data%3F'>\nWill this delete all user data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All associated meta data will be deleted using the official wp_delete_user() function.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20settings%3F'>\nWhere are the settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has no settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20overload%20the%20site%3F'>\nWill this overload the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Generally no. However, if you have many accounts, say 3000 or more, the first cycle of deletions may include many accounts.<br />\nThis can slow down your site for a few seconds. After that, only the new accounts are checked.<br />\nAs an example &#8211; when I first used this plugin on a real site it had about 7700 accounts. 2500+ got deleted, this took about 10 seconds.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20cleaned%20out%20old%20accounts%20but%20they%20are%20not%20deleted'>\nI&#8217;ve cleaned out old accounts but they are not deleted\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply de-activate and re-activate the plugin to start over.<br />\nRemember, this counts as a first run, so the first cycle may take a few seconds.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20help%20with%20this%20plugin'>\nI need help with this plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can ask your questions on my <a href=\"https://ajdg.solutions/forums/?mtm_campaign=ajdg_usercleaner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support forum</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20is%20cool%2C%20do%20you%20have%20more%20plugins%3F'>\nThis is cool, do you have more plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep, check out my website <a href=\"https://ajdg.solutions/plugins/?mtm_campaign=ajdg_usercleaner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AJdG Solutions</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
