However, to build the graph we first include all the elements (but those manually disabled) and then connect them to calculate the centrality and evaluate which are the most important. Only then we reduce the elements, using the centrality as the metrics. That means a very big site (with many users, posts and terms) will require a lot of resources and time to create the graph, even if it ends up having few elements. Only when the elements are manually disabled they don&#8217;t participate on the graph creation. Probably if you have a very big site you would have a server with ample resources, but if you don&#8217;t, then probably is not a good idea to use The Connectome until the implementation changes.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I decide which elements go in the graph?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can decide in the settings page exactly which elements will be included. Next to each type of element there is a button to show a foldable panel where you can select each element individually. Right now is a bit cumbersome if you have many elements of some type. I&#8217;ll try to make this panel more functional in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to show only certain amount for each type of element?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can set a max amount of elements for each type. The first &#8220;most important&#8221; elements will be kept while the others discarded. The metrics by now is the degree centrality. More central nodes are considered more important.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
