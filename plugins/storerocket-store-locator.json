        "faq": "\n<h4>Where can I try a demo of StoreRocket?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can take a look at some of our demos here: <a href=\"https://storerocket.io/demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">StoreRocket Demo</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I add, edit or manage my locations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Inside your control panel you will find our location management tool. We&#8217;ve built it to be easy to use and powerful at the same time. From that, you will be able to add new locations, edit the existing ones, remove the old ones, filter through them and much more.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I upload multiple locations (bulk upload)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! StoreRocket lets you import your CSV so you can bulk upload your locations instead of adding one by one. You can find the instructions on how to do so directly in your control panel. And guess what, we have even an amazing Google Sheets sync tool to help you keep all your locations database consistent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the widget customizable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our store locator widget is built with flexibility in mind. We respect that every customer has different needs and because of this we made our widget completely customizable. You will be able to easily customize the widget map styles (the colors of the map), the layout, the placeholder texts, the measurement units (kilometers and miles) and much more. If you want you can also add custom CSS to fine-tuning every little detail.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does StoreRocket allow locations from all over the world?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Once you sign up, you will be able to add locations from all over the world and everyone on the planet will be able to see them. Wheter you&#8217;re based in US, Europe, Asia, Australia or anywhere else, StoreRocket will work for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s StoreRocket pricing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Take a look here for the pricing and for more frequently asked questions: <a href=\"https://storerocket.io/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">StoreRocket Pricing</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
