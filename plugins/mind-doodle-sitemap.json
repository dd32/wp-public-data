Improve your workflows with innovative task management and visual sitemaps.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0If-fGOgM8w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Instead of drawing up a sitemap on paper or using an external tool, use Mind Doodle to create a visual, interactive sitemap that actually builds your site for you.  Furthermore, when working with WordPress, enhance your team productivity with our built-in task management tool that facilitates the creation of your website.</p>\n<p>Imagine you noticed a bug on the About us page, realized the homepage needs a review from a copywriter, or you want to flag up another page for a developer to look at.  This plugin revolutionizes your workflows with task management directly within WordPress.</p>\n<p>Add a task from whichever page needs an improvement, include details, assign it to the person responsible, prioritize it and set a time estimate. This plugin helps streamline the website development process.</p>\n<h4>SITEMAPS RE-IMAGINED</h4>\n<p>Re-imagining sitemap creation: You can create visual sitemaps much like how you create mind maps. However, it&#8217;s not just a visual tool. The plugin builds WordPress pages for your site as you add them to your sitemap.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual WordPress sitemaps created instantly.</li>\n<li>Automatic creation of the website menu system.</li>\n<li>Consistently impress clients with clear, visual depiction of their sitemap.</li>\n<li>Interactive sitemaps for new or existing WordPress sites.</li>\n<li>Full control of page hierarchy using drag-and-drop to update parent/child pages.</li>\n<li>No longer worry about repeating or replicating work. This is not just a graphical tool, you&#8217;ll really build pages as you add them to your sitemap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>VISUAL SITEMAP NAVIGATION</h4>\n<p>Provide your visitors with a visual sitemap experience for easy navigation to all your web pages. Traditionally web sitemaps are long listings of hyperlinks to various web pages, making it challenging to  understand the relationships between pages.  The Mind Doodle visual sitemap provides a graphical view of all web pages, allowing users to intuitively browse your entire website and quickly view pages of interest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embed a visual sitemap of your entire website (perfect for index pages).</li>\n<li>Simple setup and highly configurable.</li>\n<li>Responsive design support (desktop, tablet and mobile).</li>\n<li>Shortcode and Gutenburg editor support.</li>\n<li>Boost user web-page interaction by providing a visually impressive and exciting website navigation experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>TASK MANAGEMENT WITHIN WORDPRESS</h4>\n<p>Introduce intuitive project management to the WordPress development process, with tasks at your fingertips in the WordPress dashboard. Improve teamwork as you continue managing tasks using a Kanban-style agile board in Mind Doodle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An invaluable tool for adding tasks within WordPress and scheduling them for implementation.</li>\n<li>Optimize workflows by bringing project management to WordPress.</li>\n<li>Quickly add tasks for any page, eg. reporting bugs, requesting new features or suggesting improvements.</li>\n<li>Assign each task to the team member who is responsible and track their progress.</li>\n<li>Add task information, such as the process for replicating a bug.</li>\n<li>Improve team transparency with task priorities and accurate time estimates.</li>\n<li>Pick up tasks within Mind Doodle for advanced agile project management.</li>\n<li>Focus on regular goals with sprints and release planning within Mind Doodle. </li>\n<li>Kanban-style board for transparent team progress within Mind Doodle.</li>\n<li>Charting tools to help identify quick wins, buisiness value and challenges.</li>\n<li>[Premium] An optional upgrade to the Gold Plan is available for users wanting advanced task management capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: <em>To unlock the tasks feature, create a <a href=\"https://www.minddoodle.com\" title=\"FREE Mind Doodle account\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FREE Mind Doodle account</a>.</em></p>\n<h4>ABOUT MIND DOODLE</h4>\n<p>Mind Doodle provides an online workspace for mind mapping and project management. Users can create an account to manage projects creatively and productively in a collaborative team environment.</p>\n<p>Team features include live chat which integrates with Slack and real-time on-screen notifications so all team members can collaborate transparently without refreshing their page.</p>\n<p>Our plugin allows you to create visual sitemaps (that build your website) and transforms task management within WordPress, making website development quick and easy.</p>\n<p><em>Mind Doodle &#8211; Make Ideas Happen</em></p>\n<h4>USEFUL LINKS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If you would like to learn more about this plugin please visit our <a href=\"https://www.minddoodle.com/features/wordpress-integration/\" title=\"Mind Doodle to WordPress Integration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mind Doodle to WordPress</a> integration page.</li>\n<li>If you need help on how to use this plugin please visit the <a href=\"https://help.minddoodle.com/knowledge-base/wordpress-sitemap/\" title=\"Mind Doodle Site Map Plugin Support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mind Doodle support</a> website.</li>\n</ul>\n",
