If you find that information is incorrect, you should first try clearing the cache in the Settings page. If the information is still incorrect, you may need to wait for Open States to correct the data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I get an error on the geo result page that says my API key is invalid</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You not only need a Google Maps API key, you also need to enable the Google Maps Javascript API. In the Developers Console, go to your project. In the dashboard of your project, you will see a &#8220;Use Google APIs&#8221; box. Click on the &#8220;Enable and manage APIs&#8221; link. On the new page, click &#8220;Google Maps Javascript API&#8221; and enable. Do the same for the &#8220;Google Maps Geocoding API.&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
