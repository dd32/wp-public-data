We especially enjoy working on innovative projects with forward-thinking teams extending achievement recognition into new environments and surfacing achievement in new ways.

Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.)

How can I learn more about it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://credly.com/\" title=\"Credly web site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Credly</a> is the universal way to recognize, store and share life&#8217;s achievements. We&#8217;ve integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it&#8217;s downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly &#8220;Open Credit&#8221; API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us <a href=\"https://credly.com\" title=\"Credly on the Web\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Credly.com</a> to learn more or <a href=\"https://credly.com/contact\" title=\"Contact us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact</a> us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
