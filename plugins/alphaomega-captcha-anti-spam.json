For other versions, when you receive automatic notification by WordPress of an upgrade, select to install the upgrade when prompted.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin stop SPAM?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>The captcha functionality will thwart robots and lazy humans.</p>\n<p>The unique Anti-Spam Filter (containing a customizable keyword list) will block user Comments containing any one or more spam keywords from being posted to you. In such cases, the user is asked to modify their Comment before trying again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who can use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin can be used by anyone on their personal web or blog site.</p>\n<p>If you find that this plugin helps to block SPAM and enhances the look and appeal of your WordPress site, then a donation to help support the continued development of this plugin would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the latest version of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter plugin Version 3.3</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the latest WordPress version compatible with the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress Version 4.6.1.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which PHP versions are compatible with the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most PHP versions have been found to be compatible, the latest being PHP Version 5.4.45.</p>\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with the current version of PHP your web server is running, there is no need to panic. Most web hosting services will automatically upgrade your PHP version when new PHP versions become available. Again, the best way to determine compatibility is to install the plugin and try it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which web browsers are compatible with the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The following web browsers have been tested and found to be compatible with the WordPress AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter plugin:</p>\n<p>Google Chrome<br />\nFirefox<br />\nInternet Explorer<br />\nOpera<br />\nIceweasel<br />\nEpiphany<br />\nChromium</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know if my WordPress Theme is compatible with the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has been tested with a variety of standard Themes available from the WordPress Themes Repository, some of which are listed on the &#8216;Description&#8217; tabsheet of the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/alphaomega-captcha-anti-spam/\" rel=\"ugc\">AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter</a> site.</p>\n<p>Themes that have been modified in any way or that differ from the standard Theme provided by WordPress may not necessarily be compatible and are not supported. Furthermore, themes provided by third-party sources are not supported.</p>\n<p>Hence, the use of standard unmodified WordPress Themes provided by the WordPress Themes Repository is recommended. The best way to determine compatibility is to install the plugin and try it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using an early version of WordPress. Will the plugin work with WordPress versions below 3.7?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin should operate flawlessly with most earlier WordPress versions, although I recommend you upgrade to the most recent WordPress version to take advantage of the latest WordPress operational features.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I just use the Anti-Spam Filter without displaying a captcha?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>You have the option of just using the Anti-Spam Filter provided by the WordPress AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter plugin.</p>\n<p>With the Anti-Spam Filter active, all user Comments containing any of the keywords or expressions you have entered into your SPAM filter will be blocked.</p>\n<p>For maximum anti-spamming effectiveness, however, use of both the captcha and Anti-Spam Filter is recommended.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Plugin troubleshooting</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The WordPress AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter plugin has been designed to work with unmodified, standard Themes provided by WordPress.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, concurrent use of other plugins within your WordPress site may lead to unanticipated conflicts or anomalies.</p>\n<p>Given the many thousands of WordPress plugins available and currently in use, any potential conflicts will need to be resolved by each WordPress user.</p>\n<p>One approach to resolve any extant issue(s) is to deactivate all of your plugins currently being employed within your WordPress site, and then to activate your plugins, one at a time, in an effort to identify potential plugin conflicts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I donate?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have installed the AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter plugin, you can donate by visiting the donate link located at the top of the plugin Settings panel. To view the plugin Settings panel, click the &#8216;Settings&#8217; link located beneath the &#8216;AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter&#8217; item in the list of currently installed plugins, or click the &#8216;AlphaOmega Captcha &amp; Anti-Spam Filter Settings&#8217; link located below the WordPress &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu item on the left column of your WordPress Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may wish to <a href=\"http://zotz.webmire.com/cms/donate.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donate here</a></p>\n<p>Your kind support would be appreciated to help me continue with this project.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
