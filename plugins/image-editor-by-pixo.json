Pixo replaces the default WordPress image editor, bringing to you all it&#8217;s features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20integrate%20pixo%20into%20the%20front-end'>\nCan I integrate Pixo into the front-end\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Pixo can be attached to a file input field. When the user selects an image, Pixo opens it for editing. When the changes are saved, Pixo will update the image in the file input, so it can be submitted in a form. You can globally attach Pixo to every file input on every page, or by adding a shortcode to specific pages or posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20i%20cannot%20use%20this%20editor%20a%20couple%20of%20hours%20after%20installing%20the%20plugin'>\nWhy I cannot use this editor a couple of hours after installing the plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin automatically creates a registration for you on <a href=\"https://pixoeditor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pixoeditor.com</a> using your WordPress installation email as username and a strong randomly generated password. <a href=\"https://pixoeditor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Service</a> then sends you a confirmation email, with a link to confirm your registration. If your registration is not confirmed within 24 hours, the service does not operate for you. If someone created your WordPress site for you, and you don&#8217;t know the email used during WordPress installation – then you can always register with your own email on <a href=\"https://pixoeditor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pixoeditor.com</a>, get an API key and save it in plugin settings. You have to confirm your registration in order to use the image editing service.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20the%20editor%20changed%20its%20style%20and%20behavior'>\nWhy the editor changed its style and behavior\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most probably 30 days after plugin activation have passed. This is Pixo&#8217;s trial period, after which, unless you purchase a subscription, you loose some premium functionality, including the WordPress theme styling.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20pay%20for%20this%20plugin'>\nDo I have to pay for this plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin itself is free. The image editing service which this plugin wraps has also a free plan, but with limitations. For full premium features there are pre-paid packages, as well as pay-per-use option. More information on the <a href=\"https://pixoeditor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20see%20option%20to%20batch%20edit%20my%20images'>\nI do not see option to batch edit my images\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is probably because WordPress only allows extending Media&#8217;s List view with custom bulk actions, and you are probably browsing your attachments via the Grid view. Switch to List view and you will see the bulk action in the drop-down.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20options%20in%20the%20save%20dropdown%20disappeared'>\nThe options in the Save dropdown disappeared\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These options (save as new, save and update posts, etc.) are Premium features and are available only in the free trial (30 day) and in all paid subscriptions.
