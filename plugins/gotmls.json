Otherwise, this plugin only scans for &#8220;Potential Threats&#8221; on your site, it would then be up to you to identify the good from the bad and remove them accordingly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20patch%20the%20revolution%20slider%20vulnerability%3F'>\nHow do I patch the Revolution Slider vulnerability?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy, if you have installed and activated my this Anti-Malware plugin on your site then it will automatically block attempts to exploit the Revolution Slider vulnerability.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20patch%20the%20wp-login%20vulnerability%3F'>\nHow do I patch the wp-login vulnerability?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The WordPress Login page is susceptible to a brute-force attack (just like any other login page). These types of attacks are becoming more prevalent these days and can sometimes cause your server to become slow or unresponsive, even if the attacks do not succeed in gaining access to your site. This plugin can apply a patch that will block access to the WordPress Login page whenever this type of attack is detected. Just click the Install Patch button under Brute-force Protection on the Anti-Malware Setting page. For more information on this subject <a href=\"http://gotmls.net/tag/wp-login-php/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">read my blog</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20automatically%20remove%20the%20%22potential%20threats%22%20in%20yellow%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I automatically remove the &#8220;Potential Threats&#8221; in yellow?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many of these files may use eval and other powerful PHP function for perfectly legitimate reasons and removing that code from the files would likely cripple or even break your site so I have only enabled the Auto remove feature for &#8220;Know Threats&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20if%20any%20of%20the%20%22potential%20threats%22%20are%20dangerous%3F'>\nHow do I know if any of the &#8220;Potential Threats&#8221; are dangerous?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on the linked filename to examine it, then click each numbered link above the file content box to highlight the suspicious code. If you cannot tell whether or not the code is malicious just leave it alone or ask someone else to look at it for you. If you find that it is malicious please send me a copy of the file so that I can add it to my definition update as a &#8220;Know Threat&#8221;, then it can be automatically removed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20the%20scan%20gets%20stuck%20part%20way%20through%3F'>\nWhat if the scan gets stuck part way through?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First just leave it for a while. If there are a lot of files on your server it could take quite a while and could sometimes appear to not be moving along at all even if it really is working. If it still seems stuck after a while then try running the scan again, be sure you try both the Complete Scan and the Quick scan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20did%20i%20get%20hacked%20in%20the%20first%20place%3F'>\nHow did I get hacked in the first place?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, don&#8217;t take the attack personally. Lots of hackers routinely run automated script that crawl the internet looking for easy targets. Your site probably got hacked because you are unknowingly an easy target. This might be because you are running an older version of WordPress or have installed a Plugin or Theme with a backdoor or known security vulnerability. However, the most common type of infection I see is cross-contamination. This can happen when your site is on a shared server with other exploitable sites that got infected. In most shared hosting environments it&#8217;s possible for hackers to use an one infected site to infect other sites on the same server, sometimes even if the sites are on different accounts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20do%20to%20prevent%20it%20from%20happening%20again%3F'>\nWhat can I do to prevent it from happening again?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no sure way to protect your site from every kind of hack attempt. That said, don&#8217;t be an easy target. Some basic steps should include: hardening your password, keeping all your sites up-to-date, and run regular scans with Anti-Malware software like <a href=\"http://gotmls.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GOTMLS.NET</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20sucuri.net%20or%20the%20google%20safe%20browsing%20diagnostic%20page%20still%20say%20my%20site%20is%20infected%20after%20i%20have%20removed%20the%20malicious%20code%3F'>\nWhy does sucuri.net or the Google Safe Browsing Diagnostic page still say my site is infected after I have removed the malicious code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>sucuri.net caches their scan results and will not refresh the scan until you click the small link near the bottom of the page that says &#8220;Force a Re-scan&#8221; to clear the cache. Google also caches your infected pages and usually takes some time before crawling your site again, but you can speed up that process by Requesting a Review in the Malware or Security section of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Webmaster Tools</a>. It is a good idea to have a Webmaster Tools account for your site anyway as it can provide lots of other helpful information about your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20report%20security%20bugs%3F'>\nHow can I report security bugs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/gotmls\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Report a security vulnerability.</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
