        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20speech%20to%20text%20for%20wpforms%20work%3F'>\nHow does Speech to Text for WPForms work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin captures your voice as you speak into the microphone, sends the audio to OpenAI&#8217;s Whisper for transcription, and then fills the transcribed text into the form fields. The plugin also supports radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown lists, enabling a comprehensive form-filling experience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20fill%20out%20multiple%20fields%20in%20one%20go%3F'>\nCan I fill out multiple fields in one go?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can and need to do. Just click to start recording, speak to fill out the entire form, and click again to stop. The plugin will process all the fields at once, making form completion quick and easy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20ai%20enhance%20form%20filling%3F'>\nHow does the AI enhance form filling?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our integration with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT allows the plugin to deduce additional information from your input. For example, if you provide your email as john.doe@example.com, the plugin can automatically fill in &#8220;John&#8221; for the first name and &#8220;Doe&#8221; for the last name, streamlining the form completion process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20my%20data%20secure%3F'>\nIs my data secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we prioritize your privacy and security. The plugin does not store any voice or text data, processing everything in real-time. For more details, visit our <a href=\"https://boite0.com/terms-of-service-for-speech-to-text-for-wpforms/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20fields%20can%20i%20fill%20using%20my%20voice%3F'>\nWhat types of fields can I fill using my voice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, the plugin supports text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown lists. This comprehensive support allows you to complete entire forms quickly and easily.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20activate%20the%20microphone%20every%20time%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need to activate the microphone every time I use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you only need to allow microphone access the first time you use the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20languages%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhich languages are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin recognizes most major languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and many more. As large language models (LLMs) improve, the number and quality of supported languages will continue to grow.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20plugin%20make%20intelligent%20deductions%3F'>\nCan the plugin make intelligent deductions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin can make smart guesses. For example, if you say you live in New York but don’t specify the country, the plugin will deduce that you are in the USA and fill the form accordingly. Similarly, if the name Maria is mentioned, it will assume the user is female.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20handle%20noisy%20environments%3F'>\nHow does the plugin handle noisy environments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The voice recognition remains highly accurate even in moderately noisy surroundings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20easy%20to%20install%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nIs it easy to install the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. Installation is as simple as clicking &#8220;Install&#8221; and &#8220;Activate&#8221;. Once activated, the plugin works seamlessly on all WPForms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20configure%20anything%20after%20installation%3F'>\nDo I need to configure anything after installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No additional configuration is needed. The plugin works right out of the box.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20uninstall%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow can I uninstall the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply deactivate the plugin to stop using it. Uninstalling it is as easy as deactivating it from the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20handle%20form%20submission%3F'>\nHow does the plugin handle form submission?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you finish speaking, you need to manually click &#8220;Submit&#8221; just like you would if you typed the information yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20correct%20mistakes%20while%20speaking%3F'>\nCan I correct mistakes while speaking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but all corrections must be made within the same voice input session. The AI will recognize the corrections and adjust accordingly during the transcription.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20to%20process%20the%20voice%20input%3F'>\nHow long does it take to process the voice input?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Form completion usually happens in a few seconds, although it may take up to ten seconds in some cases. We are working to reduce this time in future updates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20fill%20in%20the%20form%20field%20by%20field%20using%20voice%20input%3F'>\nCan I fill in the form field by field using voice input?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the form must be filled in one go. All fields are processed simultaneously.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20a%20single%20field%20after%20submitting%20the%20voice%20input%20if%20the%20others%20are%20correct%3F'>\nCan I modify a single field after submitting the voice input if the others are correct?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, any new voice input will overwrite all fields. For minor adjustments, we recommend manually editing the form fields.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20handle%20uncommon%20spellings%3F'>\nHow does the plugin handle uncommon spellings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin defaults to the most common spelling. If you mention a lesser-known place or an uncommon spelling variant, you may need to make manual adjustments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20didn%E2%80%99t%20my%20form%20fill%20after%20i%20stopped%20speaking%3F'>\nWhy didn’t my form fill after I stopped speaking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to press the microphone button again to process the voice input and fill the form.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
