Restricting access in this way can be a useful way of reducing unwanted login attempts.<br />\nTo get the location of the user the plugin gets the IP address of the user attempting to access the login page and geo-locates their location by using a geolocation API, currently there are two services available to use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IPStack: http://ipstack.com</li>\n<li>IPGeolocation: https://ipgeolocation.io</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: an active API Key is required for either of these this services for the plugin to function correctly. You can register a free account at either of the website addresses above. Please note they offer varying amounts of location API requests for their free and paid plans, it may be necessary to upgrade to a paid plan to provide an increased amount of requests if your site gets a huge amount of login attempts.</p>\n<h3>Example usage:</h3>\n<p>Enable the plugin and access the &#8220;RC Geo Access&#8221; page in the Settings menu in your WordPress Admin to configure the required settings. Note: an active API Key is required for this plugin to function, currently there are two services available to use, you can choose from either &#8216;IPStack&#8217; &#8211; http://ipstack.com and &#8216;IPGeolocation&#8217; &#8211; https://ipgeolocation.io as the geolocation providers.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20this%20plugin%20do%3F'>\nWhat does this plugin do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin restricts access to the login page of your WordPress Admin based on the location of the user trying to access it.

Note: an active API Key is required for this plugin to function, currently there are two services available to use, you can choose from either &#8216;IPStack&#8217; &#8211; http://ipstack.com and &#8216;IPGeolocation&#8217; &#8211; https://ipgeolocation.io as the geolocation providers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20other%20geolocation%20apis%3F'>\nCan I use other geolocation APIs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, at this time it is only possible to use either the IPStack.com API or the IPGeolocation.io API.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20configure%20the%20plugin%20settings%3F'>\nHow do I configure the plugin settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can configure all of the plugin settings from the &#8220;RC Geo Access&#8221; menu found in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu in your WordPress admin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20tell%20if%20it%20is%20working%3F'>\nHow can I tell if it is working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not seeing any error messages when you are in the plugin settings page then it should hopefully be working correctly. If you&#8217;ve enabled email notifications then at some point you should receive an email when your login page is restricted. There is a way to test it yourself  but you need to be very careful! Uncheck your country from the list and save the changes (do not close the browser window or logout from WordPress or you will be locked out of your site &#8211; see below for help if that happens!), using another browser or browser tab attempt to access your login page</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='help%21%20i%27ve%20enabled%20this%20plugin%20and%20now%20i%27m%20locked%20out%20of%20my%20site%21'>\nHelp! I&#8217;ve enabled this plugin and now I&#8217;m locked out of my site!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yikes, sorry! There is a potential danger of this happening if you have enabled the restriction (including the required API key) but you did not set your own country location to be accessible. If this happens then I&#8217;m afraid the only option here is to connect to your site directly via SFTP / FTP and remove the plugin files from your site. Once removed you will then be able to login, you can then re-install the plugin, you should then immediately ensure that your current country location is given access in the &#8220;RC Geo Access&#8221; page in the Settings menu in your WordPress Admin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.48</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code tweak for PHP8 compatiblity</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.47</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed first-run issue setting the default country code as active when using the ipgeolocation API due to a difference in the country code parameter naming. Tweaked position and wording of some error notification messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.46</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added initial blank &#8220;Select&#8230;&#8221; value to the <code>API Provider</code> dropdown as it would default to &#8216;ipgeolocation&#8217; at first which would cause issues if saving without an API key set. Also added an additional check to make sure a valid API provider value is set when the actual login location check is triggered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.45</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ipgeolocation.io as an additional API provider. Plugin description text updated to provide information about this additional service. Also provided additional text to clarify that IPStack&#8217;s free API limit which has been reduced to 100 requests per month and clarified compatibility up to WordPress 5.8.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.44</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added IPStack affiliate link as a way for people to support the plugin if using a paid IPStack plan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.43</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor Update to change plugin description text to clarify IPStack&#8217;s free API limit which has changed to 5,000 requests per month. Also updated the url of the website for the plugin and clarify compatibility up to WordPress 5.7.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.42</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed IPStack API url call to use plain HTTP as free accounts don&#8217;t support SSL requests. Added related error code notification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.41</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevented &#8220;Settings&#8221; link from appearing in Network Plugins page on Multisite installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added plugin activation check to see if the plugin has been previously activated and had its restriction function enabled to prevent users from potentially being locked out of their site again.</li>\n<li>Countries Whitelist now hidden until restriction function enabled and API Key set, this process improves the first-run experience when configuring the plugin.</li>\n<li>Added notice in Dashboard and Plugin page to prompt user to configure the plugin via a link to the plugin settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n"
