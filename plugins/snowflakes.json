Simply replace one of the existing 25 snowflake images that we are using with a file of the same name and your snowflake will be populated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any settings that I need to adjust?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin simply works. No setup required. If lots of users are contacting us wanting us to add a settings page we will be happy to add one in.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
