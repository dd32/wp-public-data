Wondering why there are no conversions from your carefully designed landing page? Then meet your new right-hand man and trusty sidekick: the website heatmaps.</p>\n<p>Website heatmaps show where users click or how deep they scroll. But in addition to these, Capturly also offers a special feature: the segment heatmap. Segment website heatmaps work in a similar way to click heatmaps but with more extras. You can create segments by, for example, referrals or operating systems to optimize your website to better match your target audience.</p>\n<h4>What can website heatmaps be used for in practice?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>More accurate A/B testing</li>\n<li>Proper placement of CTAs</li>\n<li>Choosing the best product pictures</li>\n<li>Testing different colors, placements, styles and text</li>\n<li>Optimizing your website according to the tastes of your audience</li>\n<li>Level up your website‚Äôs navigation</li>\n<li>Maximize the conversion rate of your website</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üçø Session Recordings</h3>\n<p>Have you ever wondered what exactly users do on your website? Want to know what happened to make them leave your site? Grab your snack and drink, it‚Äôs movie time! Here&#8217;s your next favorite series: with session recording, you can easily replay your users&#8217; sessions and rewatch how they behave on your site.</p>\n<p>Session recordings are actually videos that show you what users are doing on your website. But it&#8217;s not just a simple recording! Capturly&#8217;s session recordings give you deep insights into hidden issues like JavaScript errors, rage clicks, u-turns or mouse outs. At any time, even in real-time, you can rewatch user interactions on your site, observing what they&#8217;ve clicked, how they&#8217;ve completed your pre-set goals, and their responses to your tracked events.</p>\n<h4>What can session recordings be used for in practice?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Test your website‚Äôs usability</li>\n<li>Analyze how small changes affect user behavior</li>\n<li>Optimize your conversion funnel to maximize website performance</li>\n<li>Recognize user frustration and anger</li>\n<li>Understand the reasons for user attrition</li>\n<li>Find broken elements on your website</li>\n<li>Identify website errors</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üß≠ URL &amp; Event-based Conversion Funnels</h3>\n<p>Looking for answers to why users visit your product page but don&#8217;t make a purchase? Don‚Äôt know where your customers lose their interest? Say goodbye to missed opportunities and hello to your trusty compass: conversion funnel.</p>\n<p>Conversion funnels are crucial features that highlight the customer&#8217;s journey through your website based on the URLs visited or events triggered. But there&#8217;s more to it! With Capturly&#8217;s session recording integration, these funnels come alive, showing you every moment of drop-off, allowing you to easily monitor where you lose your target audience. Plus, there&#8217;s a bonus: advanced filtering options offer a deep dive into the funnels, revealing insights down to the smallest detail.</p>\n<h4>What can conversion funnels be used for in practice?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve your checkout process</li>\n<li>Get the most out of your product page</li>\n<li>Allocate your marketing budget more effectively</li>\n<li>Find out where to start optimizing your website</li>\n<li>Measure and increase your conversion rate</li>\n<li>Analyze every step users take on their customer journey</li>\n<li>Identify drop-off points to boost your revenue</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üìã In-Email Surveys</h3>\n<p>Not sure what the numbers are trying to show you? Dying to know the truth, how come that already the third user has rage clicked? Well, the answer is in the question: Why guess when you can ask? Slide into your users‚Äô inboxes with a survey and peek inside their minds.</p>\n<p>In-email surveys are more than just questionnaires that provide insights from your audience&#8217;s feedback. With Capturly&#8217;s seamless in-email survey automation and fine-tuned personalization,  your job is simply to kick back and interpret the insights you receive. Feeling swamped by data? Our segmentation options are here to streamline. But here&#8217;s our unique edge: Capturly&#8217;s session recording.
