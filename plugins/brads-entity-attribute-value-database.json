        "description": "<p>Welcome to Brad&#8217;s Entity Attribute Value Database<br />\nThis welcome page is where I will place ongoing information when I update this plugin. Also this will (I hope) have enough documentation to get you started. So what is an Entity Attribute Value Database? Well the easiest way is to have you read about with the links below, and if you have any other please let me know.</p>\n<p>https://blog.greglow.com/2018/02/12/sql-design-entity-attribute-value-tables-part-1/<br />\nhttps://blog.greglow.com/2018/02/19/sql-design-entity-attribute-value-tables-part-2-pros-cons/<br />\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model</p>\n<p>Okay so inshort this plugin is meant to allow people to track items (people,cars,etc) without the need to create a database table for each thing. All data is currently stored in 4 tables.</p>\n<p>As things progress hopefully I will get default values, incrementing values, and many other things going. This is of course the first plugin I have released, so as always I am looking for ways to do things better.</p>\n<p>This first version is more of a proof of concept and to see what others think as I develop more.</p>\n<p>Okay so first there is very small amount of error checking, and onto the help section:</p>\n<p>Admin Pages<br />\n    Manage Records &#8211; This is where you will define the record names you want to keep things in<br />\n    Mange Attributes &#8211; This is where you will define your fields<br />\n    Manage Record Layout &#8211; This is where you will define what fields are in each of your records<br />\n    SQL Default &#8211; This is where you will define sql for defaulting values</p>\n<p>shortcodes &#8211; standalone<br />\n[eav_tbl table=tablenamehere] &#8211; currently this shows all the rows in for the table in the argument<br />\n    &#8211; there is an additional option allowupd=y will allow the person to update the record<br />\n    &#8211; also you can use flds=2,4,6 which will only show fields 2,4,6 &#8211; order must be low to high<br />\n[eav_add table=tablenamehere] &#8211; currently this allows you insert values into the table in the argument</p>\n<p>shortcodes &#8211; group1<br />\n[eav_startadd table=tablenamehere] &#8211; this shortcode starts the selective data entry<br />\n[eav_field field=fieldnamehere] &#8211; this shortcode places the an entry box for tablenamehere.fieldnamehere.  You can also add a &#8220;hidden=y&#8221; value as well and this field will be of type hidden instead of text.<br />\n[eav_subrec table=subtablehere] &#8211; this shortcode places an entry row for a child record on the page<br />\n[eav_endadd] &#8211; this is the shortcode you use to close the form, you can only have 1 eav_startadd/eav_endadd combination</p>\n<p>There are 2 demo apps that you can see how things are done<br />\n&#8211; Guest Registration, this will create a all the fields, records and a page which will show you how to create a data entry page<br />\n&#8211; Apache Log, this will install record,field that you can now use the apache shortcut to load apache web data</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20this%20plugin%20allow%20you%20to%20do%3F'>\nWhat does this plugin allow you to do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By using the 3 admin pages, you can create records and fields to hold your data.  Because of the way the data is stored, you do no need to create tables in the database. Each row of data you enter will have a unique id that is automatically assigned.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20search%20work%3F'>\nHow does search work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because of the way the data is stored, when you search for a value it searchs all fields for your search value. You no longer need to search on specific fields.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20%5Beav_tbl%5D%3F'>\nHow do I use [eav_tbl]?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[eav_tbl] shortcode has a required option and there is an optional option. The required option is the &#8220;table=&#8221; option.  This option is used to tell the code what table you would like to browse. If you only use the table option, the shortcode allows the user to click on a row of data and view all data for a single record.</p>\n<p>Currently the only optional option is &#8220;allowupd=&#8221;, and this option if set allows the user to select a record and update that record.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20%5Beav_add%5D%3F'>\nHow do I use [eav_add]?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[eav_add] shortcode has a required option of &#8220;table=&#8221;, which holds the table you want to add a record to.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20group1%20shortcodes%3F'>\nHow do I use group1 shortcodes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Group 1 shortcodes are a group of shortcodes that work together to allow you to dynamically place fields on a page for data entry. So by placing these shortcodes on different spots on the page you could have graphics and text which explain what the end user is doing. [eav_startadd] shortcode must be the first shortcode on the page to be used, and [eav_endadd] must be the last shortcode used. [eav_field] must contain a field that is on the record, having a non field value might create an error on the page, also only have a field on the page once. Parent/Child records, is on the first version and more is coming on it. But currently this shortcode allows you to enter multiple child rows into the child record. Also only 1 child record entry is supported on the page at the time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20attribute%20format%20do%3F'>\nWhat does the attribute format do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The format value is currently only used when presenting the field data.  So in group1 it allows you to size the data entry area. Other than that, this value does not limit the amount of data entered.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20characters%20do%20the%20fields%20store%3F'>\nHow many characters do the fields store?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently 128 characters is the field storage limit.  This may change as the plugin is developed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
