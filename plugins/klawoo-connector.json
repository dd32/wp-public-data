        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need this connector?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Klawoo Connector uses Klawoo APIs to automatically sync customers to Klawoo subscribers. Without the connector you&#8217;d need to either place a form on your site and ask people to subscribe or import them manually. This connector automates the entire process.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this with any ecommerce plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently you can use this connector only with WooCommerce ecommerce plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does it cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Klawoo itself is free for up to 5000 subscribers. Beyond that, itâ€™s a flat $99 per year.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it create lists automatically?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can select how you want to create lists. Klawoo always maintains a &#8220;All Customers&#8221; master list. And can automatically create a list for each of your products, product variations and categories. When an order is completed, the customer is added to the master list, as well as individual lists for each product / variation / category in the order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it send emails?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;d need your own SMTP service to use Klawoo. There are many cost effective and reliable transactional / newsletter email service providers. We recommend Mandrill.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if an order is refunded?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On refund, the customer will be unsubscribed from the product / variation / category specific lists &#8211; if there was no other order from the same customer for that product. Basically, if customer no longer has access to the product, they are unsubscribed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this support WooCommerce Subscriptions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
