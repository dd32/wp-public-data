This ensures posts are still accessible at their previous permalink after the permalink structure is updated.</p>\n<h4>Example</h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say your permalink structure is set to &#8220;Month and name&#8221; and you have a post titled &#8220;I Love WordPress.&#8221; That particular post would live at <code>https://example.com/2019/03/i-love-wordpress/</code>.</p>\n<p>But what if you wanted to switch to the &#8220;Post name&#8221; permalink structure and have your post live at <code>https://example.com/i-love-wordpress/</code> instead?</p>\n<p>You could but this would result in the existing post permalink 404ing when visited. Which is problematic if the previous URL was bookmarked or shared on social media.</p>\n<p>With Backwards Compatible Permalinks installed your post would be accessible at both the old and new permalink structures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>https://example.com/2019/03/i-love-wordpress/</code></li>\n<li><code>https://example.com/i-love-wordpress/</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Caveats</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin does not work retroactively. i.e. you must have the plugin installed and activated prior to switching permalink structures before backwards compatibility will work.</li>\n<li>Currently only standard posts are supported.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility is not supported between certain permalink structure updates. This is due to a clash between permalink structure regex matching.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility is only provided between the most recent permalink structure update. i.e. you cannot change your permalink structure 3 times and have backwards compatibility across all 3 structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Deactivate or uninstall</h4>\n<p>After deactivating or uninstalling this plugin please ensure you visit Settings &gt; Permalinks in the WordPress admin area to flush your rewrite rules.</p>\n<h4>Contributing</h4>\n<p>Contributions are <a href=\"https://github.com/aprea/backwards-compatible-permalinks\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">welcomed on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>From within WordPress</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;Backwards Compatible Permalinks&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Activate Backwards Compatible Permalinks from your Plugins page.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Manually</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>backwards-compatible-permalinks</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the Backwards Compatible Permalinks plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why is my old post URL not redirecting to the new URL?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is currently not supported, the post will be accessible at both URLs. I agree that this isn&#8217;t the ideal behaviour but it was too tricky to support redirects while also ensuring query parameters and &#8220;/page/xx&#8221; and &#8220;/comment-page-xx&#8221; modifiers were respected during the redirect. The good news is that the canonical tag will always point to the new URL so there shouldn&#8217;t be any SEO ramifications.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin provide access to any actions/filters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A single filter is available. You may use the <code>aprea_back_compat_permalink_structure</code> filter to provide a backwards compatible permalink structure, e.g. <code>/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/</code>.</p>\n<p>This is helpful if you updated the permalink structure prior to installing this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin is not working for me!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m terribly sorry! You may want to check the caveats section to see if any apply to your situation. Otherwise feel free to post in the support forums.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
