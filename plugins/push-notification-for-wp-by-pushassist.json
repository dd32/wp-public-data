Also purge CloudFlare or CDN once to see it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20pushassist%20be%20implemented%20on%20http%20websites%3F'>\nCan PushAssist be implemented on HTTP Websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, PushAssist can be implemented on a HTTP or HTTPS websites. In case you want to use your own GCM keys we welcome you to add those in your PushAssist control panel. To add your own GCM API keys please follow the instructions by Google on how to create a GCM key <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/push-notifications/step-04?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> . Please note that in step 3 you should select <strong>Server Key</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since Push Notifications requires the website be on SSL aka HTTPS we create a sub domain for you which is a valid HTTPS sub domain like <strong>https://accountname.pushassist.com</strong>. We can also help you setup PushAssist if you have your own Https domain and want to send notifications from your domain name.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20will%20happen%20when%20i%20reach%203000%20subscribers%20in%20my%20free%20account%3F'>\nWhat will happen when i reach 3000 subscribers in my FREE account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you reach 3000 subscribers, PushAssist will continue to work and let you collect subscribers but will not let you send notifications to these new subscribers. You can send unlimited notifications to your first 3000 subscriber but to send notifications to all subscribers you need to upgrade to premium (Paid) account. Check our <a href=\"https://pushassist.com/pricing-plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pricing plans</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20will%20push%20notifications%20look%20like%3F'>\nWhat will push notifications look like?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on the browser! Each browser will display your notifications somewhat differently, but in general the notifications will look appropriate for the device/OS/browser on which they are displayed</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20design%20templates%20to%20choose%20for%20opt-in%20box%3F'>\nAre there any design templates to choose for opt-in box?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there are many templates for opt-in box. Configuration is possible within your PushAssist control panel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='targeting%20subscribers%20with%20segments'>\nTargeting Subscribers with Segments\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can quickly categorize subscribers into different segments. This helps you efficiently target a particular set of subscribers registered under particular segments (group). A typical use case could be one segment each for your categories i.e. Sports, Fitness, Homepage, Pricing etc.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create segments from Segments tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following JS code on your category pages or on any pages of your site</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Subscribing for Single Segment</strong></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    var _pa = [];\n    _pa.push('Sports');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>**Subscribing for Multiple Segments</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    var _pa = [];\n    _pa.push('Sports', 'Fitness');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Soon, you have some subscribers under segments, you would be able to send personalized messages to specific segments. Users interested in <strong>Sports</strong> are more likely to click on your notifications about <strong>Sports</strong> than <strong>Politics</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
