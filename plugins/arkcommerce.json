Fully based on open source code and architecture, ARKCommerce aims to provide the necessary e-commerce infrastructure with the goal of wider market acceptance for ARK by both customers and merchants. Online merchants struggle with risk-free and timely digital product delivery via established fiat currency payment intermediaries. This makes for a particularly suitable use case for crypto currency payments that happen in a trustless, straightforward, and automated fashion.</p>\n<p>ARKCommerce leverages the versatility of ARK blockchain that features a special field called SmartBridge which enables user input as part of the transaction, whereas 8 second block times facilitate prompt transaction confirmations. All orders placed through ARKCommerce are placed on-hold until repetitive ARK blockchain queries reveal a transaction for an appropriate amount of ARK and with a correct order reference making a deposit into the monitored ARK wallet address belonging to the store, all without requiring or storing wallet passphrases.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports pricing in both fiat currency conversion and natively in ARK</li>\n<li>Automatic exchange rate synchronisation for supported currencies (Coinmarketcap.com API)</li>\n<li>Market/above-market/fixed store exchange rate selection</li>\n<li>Dual price display, supports all WooCommerce Product types and price formats</li>\n<li>Fully automatic order processing, metadata recording and transaction discovery via ARK/DARK Node API</li>\n<li>Order timeout limit support for risk management</li>\n<li>Theme-agnostic integration into WooCommerce and WordPress</li>\n<li>Detailed ARKCommerce event administrator/store manager email notifications available</li>\n<li>Customer-facing FAQ and Currency Converter widgets</li>\n<li>Administrator dashboard widgets, WooCommerce Order meta box, ARKCommerce Navigator and ARKCommerce Information pages</li>\n<li>Fully internationalisation-ready</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Translations</h3>\n<p>We would like to see ARKCommerce translated in as many languages as possible and native speakers from all over the globe are very welcome to do so on <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translate.wordpress.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If you decide to support this project you may do so by taking advantage of its services, submitting favourable reviews, providing constructive feedback/raising issues at the project page on <a href=\"https://github.com/Spikarija/ARKCommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>, or donating ARK to <a href=\"https://explorer.ark.io/address/AXaDj4ADMgzw67zik3ynwktARVKgwfv1WP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AXaDj4ADMgzw67zik3ynwktARVKgwfv1WP</a> in case you are feeling particularly generous.</p>\n",
