        "faq": "\n<h4>This plugin needs [fill in a feature here]</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a bare-bones plugin that was built in a day. It uses the WordPress plugin boilerplate (http://wppb.io/) and should be updatable by a knowledgable developer. If you wish to pay to have features added to plugin, please reach out to David Bisset (davidbisset.com). Either way, I would love to hear what suggestions you might have or if you have a pull-request.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the most likely future features to be added?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin only allows you to pick from four hard-coded default BuddyPress components. This should be more robust, not to mention consideration for custom BuddyPress components. After that allowing the user to customize the message sent to Slack seems to be next logical feature to add.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
