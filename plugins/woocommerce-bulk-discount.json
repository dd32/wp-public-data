        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the latest version and extract it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the plugin is activated, you can use it as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First navigate to WooCommerce settings. Under the Bulk Discount tab, find the global configuration for bulk discounts. Make sure &#8220;Bulk Discount enabled&#8221; is checked and optionally fill information about discounts which will be visible on the cart page. You can include HTML markup in the text &#8211; you can, for instance, include a link to your page with your discount policy. Since version 2.0 you may choose to use a flat discount applied to the cart item subtotal. Optionally you may also modify the CSS styles for the old value and the new value which is displayed in the cart. Save the settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to set the discount individually per product then navigate to Products and choose a product for which you want to create a discount policy. In the Product Data panel, click Bulk Discount and optionally fill information about the discount which will be visible in the product description. If you want to set the discount policy globally for all products, just create a private product with the title &#8216;wc_bulk_discount_configurer&#8217; (without quotes). In the bulk discount section of this private product set the discount as in the case of any individual product (see step 3).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click &#8220;Add discount line&#8221; button to create a policy. Quantity (min.) means minimal number of ordered items so that the (second textbox) Discount applies. It is possible to add up to five discount lines to fine-tune the discount setting.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='are%20multiple%20discounts%20supported%3F%20how%20many%20levels%20of%20discounting%20may%20be%20applied%3F'>\nAre multiple discounts supported? How many levels of discounting may be applied?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, multiple discounts (related to a single product) are supported. Currently it is possible to<br />\nset up to 5 discount lines. That should be enough for reasonable fine-tuning of the discount.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20only%20a%20percentage%20discount%20implemented%3F'>\nIs only a percentage discount implemented?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 2.0 another type of discount is added, allowing you to set a flat discount in currency units for the cart item subtotal. Since version 2.4.2 you can add a fixed discount type which is a bit different than the flat discount type &#8211; see below for examples.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20discount%20be%20visible%20on%20woocommerce%20e-mails%20and%20order%20status%20as%20well%3F'>\nWill the discount be visible on WooCommerce e-mails and Order status as well?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Since version 2.0, this feature has been implemented.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20handle%20discount%20for%20product%20variations%20as%20a%20whole%3F'>\nIs it possible to handle discount for product variations as a whole?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, in case you have several product variations in your store and you need to apply the discount to all the purchased variations, please upgrade to the latest version of Bulk Discount. This functionality can be disabled in Bulk Discount settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20i18n%20ready%3F'>\nIs the plugin i18n ready?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin supports localization files. You can add support for your language as well by the standard process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20provide%20an%20example%20of%20setting%20a%20percentage%20bulk%20discount%3F'>\nCan you provide an example of setting a percentage bulk discount?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. Below is an example of setting a bulk discount for a product with three discount lines.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 3, Discount (%) = 5</li>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 8, Discount (%) = 10</li>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 15, Discount (%) = 15</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the customer orders, say, 12 items of the product which costs $15 per item, the second discount line will apply. The customer then pays 12 * 15 = 225 dollars in total minus 10%, which yields $202.5. Note that this discount policy only applies to the concrete product &#8212; other products may have their own (possibly different) discount policies.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20provide%20an%20example%20of%20setting%20a%20flat%20bulk%20discount%3F'>\nCan you provide an example of setting a flat bulk discount?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Example for flat discount follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 10, Discount ($) = 10</li>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 30, Discount ($) = 20</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the customer orders, say, 15 items of the product which costs $10 per item, the first discount line will apply and the customer will pay (15 * 10) &#8211; 10 dollars. If the customers orders 50 items, the second discount line will apply and the final price will be (50 * 10) &#8211; 20 dollars.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20provide%20an%20example%20of%20setting%20a%20fixed%20bulk%20discount%3F'>\nCan you provide an example of setting a fixed bulk discount?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Example for fixed discount follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 10, Discount ($) = 2</li>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 30, Discount ($) = 3</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the customer orders, say, 15 items of the product which costs $10 per item, the first discount line will apply and the customer will pay (15 * 10) &#8211; (15 * 2) = 15 * (10 &#8211; 2) dollars. If the customers orders 50 items, the second discount line will apply and the final price will be (50 * 10) &#8211; (50 * 3) =  50 * (10 &#8211; 3) dollars. <strong>Note the difference between fixed and flat discount types!!! Flat discount is a discount from the line subtotal while fixed discount is applied on each individual quantity.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20the%20%22treat%20the%20variations%20separately%22%20checkbox%3F'>\nWhat does mean the &#8220;Treat the variations separately&#8221; checkbox?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To illustrate what the setting means, let&#8217;s have two variations: A and B of some product. Both have this bulk discount setting: quantity = 10, discount = 10% quantity = 20, discount = 50%.<br />\nIf we have &#8220;Treat variations separately&#8221; checked, then when we order 10 times variation A and 10 times variation B, then 10% bulk discount will be applied on both cart lines.<br />\nIf we have &#8220;Treat variations separately&#8221; unchecked, then when we order 10 times variation A and 10 times variation B, it will count the discount to 10 + 10 items,<br />\ni.e. 20 items together and now the discount 50% will apply to both cart lines. Therefore in the first case we treated the variations separately in the computation of the discount and in the second case we treat them as shared.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20the%20discount%20globally%20for%20all%20products%3F'>\nHow do I set the discount globally for all products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This feature has been added to version 2.4.0 of WooCommerce Bulk Discount. If you want to set the discount policy globally for all products,<br />\njust create a private product with the title &#8216;wc_bulk_discount_configurer&#8217; (without quotes). See <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Visibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Visibility</a> how to make a post (and also product) private.<br />\nIn the bulk discount section of this private product set the discount as in the case of any individual product. This discount configuration will override all individual discounts set on products (if they have been set).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
