Simply setting &#8220;Where to after Login?&#8221; in the Landing Location section to &#8220;Omit ?redirect_to= from URL&#8221; should correct the problem.</p>\n<p>This problem has been observed when the URL of the Custom Login page is a WordPress Page.

I changed my Permalinks and now some things don&#8217;t work.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whenever you change your WordPress Permalinks (Settings-Permalinks in Admin panels), this <em>jonradio Private Site</em> plugin does <strong>not</strong> automatically change any URLs you have entered in the plugin&#8217;s Settings.  You will therefore want to make changes to URLs in the plugin&#8217;s Settings whenever you change Permalinks.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
