In WP Admin navigate to the Media library and make sure you are using the List view.</p>\n<p>Select which images you&#8217;d like to strip metadata from and then select the &#8220;WP Strip Image Metadata&#8221; bulk action.</p>\n<p>This can be a resource intensive process, so please only select a handful of images at one time for processing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20for%20all%20generated%20image%20subsizes%20%28thumbnails%29%3F'>\nWill this work for all generated image subsizes (thumbnails)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if metadata stripping is enabled then all generated subsizes at the time of upload will have the metadate removed.</p>\n<p>The included bulk action will also remove metadata from all subsizes as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20it%27s%20working%3F'>\nHow do I know it&#8217;s working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In WP Admin, from your Media library you can select an image and click &#8220;Edit&#8221; (in List view) or &#8220;Edit more details&#8221; (in Grid view).</p>\n<p>On the Edit page for the image, there will be an admin notice at the top with the &#8220;expand for image EXIF data&#8221; text. This should work for jpg/jpeg files, but other image types may not display EXIF info.</p>\n<p>You might try uploading a test image with the &#8220;Image Metadata Stripping&#8221; setting disabled, and then the same image again with the setting enabled to view the difference.</p>\n<p>Here are some good sample images for testing: https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples/tree/master/jpg/gps</p>\n<p>Popular image editing applications such as Photoshop or Affinity Photo also have the capability to inspect image metadata which can prove useful.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='once%20image%20metadata%20has%20been%20stripped%2C%20is%20it%20reversible%3F'>\nOnce image metadata has been stripped, is it reversible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, removing image metadata is permanent. If you would like the metadata kept, you should keep an offsite backup copy of your images.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20file%20types%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%20for%3F'>\nWhat file types does this plugin work for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the plugin will process jpg/jpeg files.</p>\n<p>To add other file types you can use the &#8220;wp_strip_image_metadata_image_file_types&#8221; filter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20the%20plugin%20settings%20do%3F'>\nWhat do the plugin settings do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image Metadata Stripping: whether image metadata is stripped from new uploads.</li>\n<li>Preserve ICC Color Profile: whether to keep image color information which is helpful to some applications.</li>\n<li>Preserve Image Orientation: whether to keep image orientation which can help rotate images as intended.</li>\n<li>Log Errors: whether to log error output which can be helpful for debugging purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
