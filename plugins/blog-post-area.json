Fill<br />\nthat up with whatever data you want (instructions are on the form).  Then pull it through on the front end using either<br />\nthe standard data function, or the basic widget.  The widget will have new formats added in the future.</p>\n<p>To get the rall data call &#8220;$blogposts = blogpostarea_getdata();&#8221;.  To call the widget use &#8220;widget_blogpostarea()&#8221; function.</p>\n",
