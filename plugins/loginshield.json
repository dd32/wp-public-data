        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://loginshield.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LoginShield</a> is an authentication system that features one-tap login, digital signatures, strong multi-factor authentication, and phishing protection. This is a passwordless login solution. Login with one tap instead of a password!</p>\n<p>LoginShield for WordPress replaces the login page with the following secure sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prompt for username</li>\n<li>If user exists and has LoginShield enabled, use LoginShield; otherwise, prompt for password</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The LoginShield app is available for Android and iOS. <a href=\"https://loginshield.com/software/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get the app</a>.</p>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminate password and phishing attacks on user accounts</li>\n<li>Quick and secure way to log in with one-tap, passwordless login</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t need to remember a password</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t need to rotate passwords for safety</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h4>Self-service activation</h4>\n<p>After you install and set up the LoginShield plugin, users can easily activate LoginShield for themselves in their profile settings page.</p>\n<h4>One-tap login</h4>\n<p>You and your users can log in to your WordPress site with just one tap.</p>\n<p>For more information, read about <a href=\"https://loginshield.com/article/one-tap-login/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">one-tap login</a>.</p>\n<h4>Digital signatures</h4>\n<p>Some of the most common ways that accounts are hacked are weak passwords and stolen passwords. This is why so many sites require users to come up with passwords that have special characters, and to change their passwords periodically (in case a current password was reused somewhere and cracked). But this is annoying to users and doesn&#8217;t guarantee they will actually pick a secure password.</p>\n<p>LoginShield uses digital signatures for authentication instead of passwords. This makes LoginShield a passwordless authentication system.</p>\n<p>Digital signatures are far stronger protection for an account than passwords, and they don&#8217;t require the user to come up with anything or remember anything. LoginShield automatically generates and uses a separate credential for each website, so you can use the same LoginShield app to login to multiple sites.</p>\n<p>LoginShield uses strong, modern cryptographic algorithms and parameters to ensure your accounts get the best protection available.</p>\n<h4>Strong multi-factor authentication</h4>\n<p>The LoginShield app itself can be protected by a password (which never leaves the mobile device) or a fingerprint. This is far better protection than the standard two-factor authentication that many sites use.</p>\n<p>For more information, read about <a href=\"https://loginshield.com/article/authentication-factors/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">authentication factors</a>.</p>\n<h4>Phishing protection</h4>\n<p>LoginShield is the ONLY authentication solution to offer phishing protection.</p>\n<p>Many data breaches start with a phishing email, tricking the user to log in to the attacker&#8217;s website that is impersonating the real website. Any website that uses passwords to log in is vulnerable to this.</p>\n<p>Websites that use standard two-factor authentication codes are also vulnerable &#8212; whether they send the code via SMS or use an OTP app to display it, the fact that you enter that code into the website after the password prompt means a phishing attacker will also get the code.</p>\n<p>Websites that use an authenticator app with push notifications are ALSO vulnerable to this, because they don&#8217;t confirm that you&#8217;re at the correct website when you tap the &#8220;login&#8221; button in the app.</p>\n<p>Only LoginShield is able to detect that the user is not at a trusted website and route the user to the correct website, completely circumventing a credential-theft phishing attack.</p>\n<p>For more information, read about <a href=\"https://loginshield.com/article/phishing-protection/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">phishing protection</a>.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p>For current pricing and free trial details, <a href=\"https://loginshield.com/pricing/wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visit our website</a>.</p>\n<h3>Managing your LoginShield subscription</h3>\n<p>You can visit <a href=\"https://loginshield.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://loginshield.com</a> to manage your LoginShield subscription.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>The plugin shares the following information with <a href=\"https://loginshield.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LoginShield</a>. For more information, see our <a href=\"https://loginshield.com/notice/privacy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\n<h4>Site Name, Site Icon, and Site URL</h4>\n<p>When you activate and set up the plugin, it sends the site name, icon, and URL to LoginShield. This information is later displayed in the LoginShield app during login. If you deactivate or uninstall the plugin, and want to delete this information, you can visit <a href=\"https://loginshield.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://loginshield.com</a> to delete your LoginShield account where this information is stored.</p>\n<h4>User Name and Email</h4>\n<p>When a user activates LoginShield in their profile settings, their name and email address are sent to LoginShield to register the user.</p>\n<p>This information is later used by LoginShield for service-related communication with the user, such as our phishing protection feature. We DO NOT sell or share this information with anyone else, except as required by law. If the user deactivates LoginShield, and wants to delete this information, the user can visit <a href=\"https://loginshield.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://loginshield.com</a> to delete their LoginShield account.</p>\n<h4>Client ID</h4>\n<p>When you activate the plugin, the plugin registers itself with LoginShield and receives a unique client ID. This client ID is then associated with the site name, icon, and URL, and is used to identify the WordPress site to LoginShield in all further backend communication, and is required so that users will be able to continue to log in even when you change the site name.</p>\n<h4>Realm-Scoped User ID</h4>\n<p>When a user activates LoginShield in their profile settings, a unique user id is generated and sent to LoginShield to register the user. This user id is NOT the same as the user&#8217;s WordPress user id, and is required so that a LoginShield user will be able to continue to log in even when they change their email address. If the user deactivates LoginShield, and wants to delete this information, the user can visit <a href=\"https://loginshield.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://loginshield.com</a> to delete their LoginShield account.</p>\n",
