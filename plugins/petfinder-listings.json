        "description": "<p>Petfinder is a free site where shelters and rescues can post pets for adoption. The List Petfinder Pets plugin takes advantage of the Petfinder API to list your available pets on your website.  All you need is your Petfinder shelter id and free Petfinder API v2.0 API key and secret.</p>\n<p>The List Petfinder Pets plugin allows you to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Display all your shelter&#8217;s Petfinder pets on your own website</li>\n<li>Display a featured or random pet from Petfinder in a widget</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Sign up to be notified when the Petfinder plugin is updated</h4>\n<p>You can sign up to receive notices when this plugin is updated or other important changes here: (https://unboxinteractive.com/petfinder-plugin-email-list/)</p>\n<h4>Demos</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://midwestigrescue.com/adoption/available-igs-in-missouri-and-kansas/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Midwest Italian Greyhound Rescue</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Shortcode</h4>\n<p>[shelter_list] displays a list of pets from your shelter. You must enter your shelter ID, Petfinder v2.0 API key and secret on the List Petfinder Pets&#8217; settings page for this shortcode to work. You may also need to edit your Petfinder settings to enable sharing your data with third parties. See Petfinder settings under Frequently Asked Questions below.<br />\nOptional attributes for shortcode are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>shelter_id &#8211; Allows you to list adoptable pets from a shelter different from the shelter id defined in your List Petfinder Pets Settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>breed &#8211; If you wish to list only one breed on a page, or leave blank/don&#8217;t set to get all breeds. Note: adding ! before breed to exclude breeds was removed when plugin was updated to support Petfinder API v2.0 in version 1.0.13.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>count &#8211; The maximum number of pets to return. Defaults to 75 and must be a number.  Petfinder API v2.0 added ability to filter before retrieving results so you can set the count to the real number you want to list on the page now.

If you have over 100 pets, or want to break up your pets into multiple pages, you can put the shortcode on multiple pages, each with a different page number.

Sorting only sorts the pets returned on the current page. Petfinder does not provide a way to sort by pet&#8217;s name. It can only sort by recent and distance in the initial call.

Perhaps you want to remove/replace special characters that are not displaying correctly, or want to add a paragraph to the end of all pets&#8217; descriptions? You can do so with the following filter. Add it to your functions.php file. The filter name is petf_replace_description and it acts on all pets&#8217; descriptions.</p>\n<p>function replace_pet_description( $description ) {<br />\n    return $description . &#8221; Add me to end of all pets&#8217; descriptions&#8221;;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter( &#8216;petf_replace_description&#8217;, &#8216;replace_pet_description&#8217; );</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload expanded petfinder-listings folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Set your Petfinder v2.0 API Key and Secret, Shelter Id, Thumbnail and Large image size under WordPress Settings -&gt; List Petfinder Pets. You will need to generate a free Petfinder API key on Petfinder here: https://www.petfinder.com/developers/. You&#8217;ll need to create an account on Petfinder first if you don&#8217;t already have one. You do not need to use your shelter&#8217;s Petfinder account to generate these keys, you can use your own. Your shelter ID is your Shelter&#8217;s Petfinder username, usually your state abbreviation and a number.</li>\n<li>Place the shortcode [shelter_list] in a Page or Post content to display your pet list on a page. The list includes all pets&#8217; name, description and photos uploaded to Petfinder.</li>\n<li>If the list is not working after correctly entering all your List Petfinder Pets Settings, make sure your Petfinder account is set up to share data through Petfinder&#8217;s API. To do this, log into your Petfinder account and click on the Organization Info tab. Look for the box labeled &#8216;Share Pet List&#8217; and make sure all checkboxes within this box are selected: Please share my pet list with all third parties, Partner sites &amp; Petfinder API users. (As of 12/1/2019, I do not know if these instructions need to be changed after Petfinder updated its interface. I do not currently have a shelter Petfinder account to view this information. If these instructions need to be changed, please contact me so I can update them. )</li>\n<li>Add the List Petfinder Pets Featured Pet widget (Appearance -&gt; Widgets) if desired.</li>\n</ol>\n",

To do this, log into your Petfinder account and click on the Organization Info tab. Look for the box labeled &#8216;Share Pet List&#8217; and make sure all checkboxes within this box are selected: Please share my pet list with all third parties, Partner sites &amp; Petfinder API users.

If your page listing pets is cached, it will lower the number of API calls the site makes to Petfinder. You might be able to increase the amount of time pages are stored in cache.</p>\n<p>If your site is still going over your API limit, contact Petfinder and ask to increase your API daily limit. Caching saves on server processing power, which saves electricity, which saves trees, so please try caching your site first.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20change%20the%20petfinder%20list%20styles%3F'>\nHow do you change the Petfinder list styles?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin generates generic HTML and includes a stylesheet to position the elements. To style, override the CSS in your theme&#8217;s stylesheet. You might need to add !important to some styles, or use greater specificity.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20video%20in%20petfinder%20but%20it%20isn%27t%20showing%20on%20my%20site.'>\nI have a video in petfinder but it isn&#8217;t showing on my site.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Petfinder does not return video information through their API, however if you have a video on YouTube you can paste the video embed code in your pet&#8217;s description to display the video through the Petfinder plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

The contact value should match your contact&#8217;s first and last name. For example, contact=&#8221;Bill Smith&#8221;. When adding an animal you can set the contact person in the Contact/Location box. The location information is not available through Petfinder&#8217;s API but the Contact name is. Also added &#8220;Powered by Petfinder.com&#8221; option at request of Petfinder.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added shortcode attribute include_info</li>\n<li>Removed Setting Include Cat or Kid Safe and switched to shortcode attribute include_info</li>\n<li>Added different css classes to each info list item.</li>\n<li>Added a shortcode attribute css_class to set css class on div containing all pets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added shortcode attributes animal and count</li>\n<li>Added note on how to display video within description</li>\n<li>Switched mixed breed dogs to not display when breed is set.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fixes with repository set up</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the first version</li>\n</ul>\n"
