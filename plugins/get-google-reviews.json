Usually we can get the first 8 reviews that Google shows. That doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s it. In time, Google will switch reviews so that others will be featured. When that happens, we can get new ones. The old reviews will remain in your database. Eventually the total amount of reviews will grow. You just have to be a little patient.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20be%20notified%20when%20new%20reviews%20are%20found%3F'>\nCan I be notified when new reviews are found?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Just check the plugin settings. When this option is enabled, you will receive an email each time our plugin has found new Google Reviews for your connected company.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20wpml%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with WPML?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Our plugin checks if WPML is enabled. When it is, we loop through all your active languages. For each language we are checking Google for review translations. There is zero extra configuration needed to get your translated reviews.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
