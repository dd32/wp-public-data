        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I wanted a quick and easy way to add styles to my posts without having to make a tag, create a category, or use post formats.  Those solutions are great, but they&#8217;re not ideal for every situation.  By using a custom class, I have complete control over post styles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A meta box named &#8220;Classes&#8221; gets added to the edit post screen in the admin.  From there, you can input a custom post and/or body class for individual posts.  On the edit/new term (category, tag, etc.) screen, a new field labeled &#8220;Body Class&#8221; is also available.</p>\n<p>Of course, you actually have to style the class in your theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code> file for anything to actually change on the front end.  This plugin just outputs the classes for you.  It&#8217;s up to you to decide how to use them.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
