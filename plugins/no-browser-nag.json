Activate this plugin and be bothered no more!</p>\n<p>In most cases, your browser will already actively alert you to new releases if it doesn&#8217;t already update your browser for you in the background.</p>\n<p>Benefits over simply clicking &#8220;dismiss&#8221; on the browser nag notice yourself when it appears:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin prevents WordPress from making the network request to check if the browser is out of date.

Or maybe you don&#8217;t feel WordPress should be nagging you about your browser. Either way, you can save precious dashboard screen real estate otherwise taken up by a browser update nag.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20will%20i%20know%20if%20my%20browser%20has%20been%20updated%20if%20the%20nag%20doesn%27t%20appear%3F'>\nHow will I know if my browser has been updated if the nag doesn&#8217;t appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Heretofore you haven&#8217;t relied on WordPress to alert you to browser updates. In most cases, the browsers themselves will alert you to updates. And maybe you&#8217;re tuned into tech news enough to learn of browser release updates. If you need/prefer for WordPress to alert you to browser updates then of course don&#8217;t use this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20just%20simply%20hide%20the%20nag%20using%20css%20or%20javascript%3F'>\nDoes this plugin just simply hide the nag using CSS or JavaScript?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it does not make use of CSS nor JavaScript to disable the nag. It more efficiently prevents the check from being performed in the first place, which saves a network request to the Browse Happy service to check if your browser is out of date or not.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%27t%20i%20just%20click%20the%20%22dismiss%22%20link%20at%20the%20bottom%20of%20the%20nag%20and%20be%20done%20with%20it%20without%20using%20a%20plugin%3F'>\nCan&#8217;t I just click the &#8220;Dismiss&#8221; link at the bottom of the nag and be done with it without using a plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Clicking the &#8220;Dismiss&#8221; link at the bottom of the browser nag admin dashboard widget only hides the nag for the person clicking it; you cannot otherwise proactively prevent other users from seeing the browser nag. Also, even if the nag is dismissed, WordPress still routinely performs the check, which incurs a network request.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20include%20unit%20tests%3F'>\nDoes this plugin include unit tests?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
