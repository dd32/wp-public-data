If you still have this issue:</p>\n<p>While the author link ideally should go to the authors web page, your guest author posts will show up as one of your posts. You can get around the list problem by creating a new user called Guest Author. Create your guest author posts under this user or use an author switch plugin to change the registered author. That way, guest author posts will show up under the user &#8220;Guest Authors&#8221; instead of your account.</p>\n<p>Please visit the FAQ page on our site at <a href=\"http://www.shooflysolutions.com/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.shooflysolutions.com/faq/</a></p>\n<p>Our premium version handles this seamlessly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20plugin%20used%20to%20substitute%20title%20name%20with%20author%20name%20when%20using%20jetpack%20publicize.%20how%20do%20i%20get%20it%20back%3F'>\nThis plugin used to substitute Title Name with Author Name when using Jetpack Publicize.
