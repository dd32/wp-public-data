With the Front-End Managed Files Block plugin you can make file lists that clients can manage easily via the frontend of the website.</p>\n<h4>MATCHES YOUR THEME</h4>\n<p>File blocks inherit style from whichever theme your site is using. This means they will look great with minimal or no CSS tweaking required.</p>\n<h4>CREATE WITH CLASSIC &amp; GUTENBERG EDITORS</h4>\n<p>The Front-End Managed Files Block plugin supports the creation of blocks via both the Classic and Gutenberg editors. The Classic editor has a menu dropdown which allows for inserting a file block with ease. The Gutenberg editor has a custom block which makes adding and customising file blocks quick and easy, you can also add or remove files while inside the editor.</p>\n<h4>IT&#8217;S JUST A SHORTCODE</h4>\n<p>File blocks at their core are just a shortcode – so remain usable with third party page editors. You can even include them inside a widget.</p>\n<h4>NO MEDIA CLUTTER</h4>\n<p>Uploaded files are stored directly in the database and don’t clutter your media library with unnecessary files.</p>\n<h4>CUSTOMISE</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>List Sorting – Sort file blocks by name, upload date, size and type.</li>\n<li>Disable File Icons – File blocks will show a file type icon by default – this can be disabled per files block.</li>\n<li>Restrict User Access – Allow only specific users permission to upload and delete, these can even be non-editors. <strong>Pro Version Only</strong></li>\n<li>Restrict File Types – Allow only the file types you want to be uploaded, per files block. <strong>Pro Version Only</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>HELP &amp; PRO VERSION</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pixelhound.co.uk/frontend-managed-files-block/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Visit our website</a> to find tutorial videos and consider upgrading to the pro version of the plugin.</p>\n",
