Had invalid selector (left a , in there somewhere).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.8.4</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Class is now simpul-events and ID is simpul_events. Updated JS to reflect.</li>\n<li>Updated jquery-ui to load from WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.8.3</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Wrapped Calendar to prevent movement instead. For real this time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.8.2</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Changed append to prepend in JS to prevent Calendar events from popping up above the Calendar.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.8.1</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed critical Ajax bug that broke jQuery.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.8</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Added Ajax for indefinite movement between months. This is triggered by the click event on: .simpul-calendar-header-right or .simpul-calendar-header-left</li>\n<li>Added support for multiple events on hover, added attributes to element for debugging, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.7.3</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Updated script queuing for efficiency and to prevent any conflict with other plugins, including other simpul plugins.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.7.2</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Added control to change Title Element. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.7.1</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed Issue with Number of Events not Limiting. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.7</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Added Calendar Event Rollover Option to Rollover Disabling.</li>\n<li>Organized Rollover Settings better.</li>\n<li>Added Linkable Calendar Day which works with rollover or without.</li>\n<li>Added class simpul-calendar-link for Calendar Day Links.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Used wp_plugin_basename() to load files. The name of the file folder on WordPress.org was different than the file folder on our development install, which caused issues. This was causing all jQuery custmizations to not load on install, including the Drop Down Calendar on both the back and front end.</li>\n<li>Enqeued jQuery before our custom jQuery script so that the calendar would load properly on the front end and backend. </li>\n<li>Removed Duplicate &#8220;Calendar&#8221; Checkbox.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First Upload</li>\n</ul>\n"
