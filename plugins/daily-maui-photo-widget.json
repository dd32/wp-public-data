        "installation": "<p>Installation and usage is easy, you&#8217;ll be up and running in no time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <code>daily-maui-photo-widget.zip</code> plugin file, and unzip the file.</li>\n<li>Upload the files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the &#8216;Widgets&#8217; page under the &#8216;Apperance&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Find the &#8216;Daily Maui Photo Widget&#8217; under the &#8216;Available Widgets&#8217; section, and drag to any sidebar on the right.</li>\n<li>Once in a sidebar, expand the settings to provide an optional Title and select the Style you&#8217;d like to use (see<br />\nScreenshots section or support page for examples).</li>\n<li>Click &#8216;Save&#8217; and visit your page to view the results.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What do the different stlyes look like?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Examples are included in the Screenshots tab on the WordPress Plugin details page. The <a href=\"http://www.webnelly.com/wordpress/daily-maui-photo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support page</a><br />\nalso has screenshots as well as links to blogs using this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the colors in the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently this is not supported by the plugin yet. If you&#8217;d like a customized style or display, please contact<br />\nme and I&#8217;ll do what I can to accomodate (time permitting).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is part of the widget cut off?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each display style has a fixed width and height as specified in the Widgets settings pane. If you sidebar has<br />\na width or a height that is smaller than the display style you chose, the &#8216;overflow&#8217; is not displayed.</p>\n<p>Try selecting a different display style or contact me with the dimensions that you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to change something with the display style, where are the code files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The code to generate the display of these widgets is actually hosted on a remote server and not saved to your<br />\nserver as part of the installation. That&#8217;s good because it keeps the code processing off of your server and<br />\nwon&#8217;t slow down your page display.</p>\n<p>It also mean, however, that you can&#8217;t edit the display yourself. One reason this is done is for design and<br />\nstyle compatibility, but it also done to protect the content and copyrights from being removed.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like something to be customized through the Widgets settings, contact me with a feature request and<br />\nI&#8217;ll take a look.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use my own photos instead of yours?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These photos are all taken from my <a href=\"http://www.dailymauiphoto.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Daily Maui Photo</a> website and are not<br />\neditable in the plugin itself. The code for managing the daily photos is part of a custom API I am developing<br />\nand may release for public use in the future (once it&#8217;s finished).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you&#8217;re a developer looking for a head start, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.photonelly.com/blog/2008/12/flickr-idea-making-an-online-photo-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this blog post</a><br />\nwhich describes how I&#8217;m using the Flickr API and a tagging convention to power my Daily Maui Photo offerings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I add this Widget to my theme template, a page, or a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now, adding this Widget directly to a page or post is not supported. I have considered supporting this by<br />\nadding a shortcode feature, so if you have a need for that, please contact me.</p>\n<p>As for adding directly to a theme, I am working on a non-WordPress version of this widget that will<br />\nsupport any static html page or code file. Look for a link on the plugin <a href=\"http://www.webnelly.com/wordpress/daily-maui-photo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support page</a><br />\nonce that&#8217;s available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a feature request, how can I contact you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easist way is to leave a comment on the plugin <a href=\"http://www.webnelly.com/wordpress/daily-maui-photo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support page</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also track me down on Twitter as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/DailyMauiPhoto\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@DailyMauiPhoto</a> or on my development <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/webnellydotcom\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I really enjoy your Maui photos, where can I see more?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maui is beautiful, isn&#8217;t it? ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see more about these daily Maui photos, head on over to <a href=\"http://www.dailymauiphoto.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.dailymauiphoto.com</a>.
