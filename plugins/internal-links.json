        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20internal%20linking%20and%20what%20is%20it%20good%20for%3F'>\nWhat is internal linking and what is it good for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An <strong>internal link</strong> is a link that is placed on a page which links to another page within the same domain. Internal links have an <strong>extremely high value</strong> when it comes to <strong>SEO</strong> and also the general <strong>optimization</strong> of websites.</p>\n<p>Internal links&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have an immense influence on SEO</li>\n<li>help search engines find new content quickly</li>\n<li>help search engines to better interpret and classify the content of a page</li>\n<li>can distribute traffic to well converting subpages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On our website we created a <a href=\"https://www.internallinkjuicer.com/internal-links-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">comprehensive guide about internal linking</a>, where you will find a lot of knowledge and useful tips.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill the plugin slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not. The <strong>Internal Link Juicer</strong> was explicitly designed for <strong>fast loading times</strong> and maximum performance. It solves the problem of generating links using its own index. This prevents additional delays while loading the frontend.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20improve%20my%20search%20engine%20rankings%3F'>\nWill the plugin improve my search engine rankings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course no guarantee can be given for this. But building <strong>internal links</strong> within a website is a basic discipline for onpage SEO. Internal links help search engines to find your content faster and understand it better. Both are important parts for <strong>good rankings</strong>. We help you to massively improve the structure of intern links and even automate the whole process stress-free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20change%20my%20content%3F'>\nDoes the plugin change my content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>No</strong> &#8211; the plugin has its own index, where links that need to be created are efficiently stored. Whenever a page is rendered, the links are generated before output and your existing content is enriched with them. The content itself is not manipulated by the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20content%20generated%20from%20shortcodes%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with content generated from shortcodes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong> &#8211; the plugin works with content (within posts or pages) that gets generated through shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20disable%20linking%20on%20specific%20pages%3F'>\nCan I disable linking on specific pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, at any time!  With our <a href=\"https://www.internallinkjuicer.com/docs/whitelist-blacklist/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blacklist feature</a> you can easily disable the generation of links on individual pages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20style%20of%20the%20auto%20generated%20links%3F'>\nCan I change the style of the auto generated links?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yeah, definitely. With the help of our <a href=\"https://www.internallinkjuicer.com/docs/link-templates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">templating system</a> you can change the output of your generated links in no time at all.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20internal%20link%20juicer%20compatible%20with%20translation%20plugins%3F'>\nIs Internal Link Juicer compatible with translation plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong> &#8211; we provide an own compatibility mode for WPML and Polylang as this has been requested by many users. We are planning to support more 3rd party plugins soon &#8211; requests always appreciated!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20automate%20the%20setting%20of%20keywords%20if%20i%20have%20a%20lot%20of%20posts%3F'>\nHow can I automate the setting of keywords if I have a lot of posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We understand that, depending on the size of your website, it can be <strong>difficult to enter keywords manually</strong>. For this reason, we implemented the possibility to export all linkable content in the import/export area, <strong>enrich it with your own sources, and re-import</strong> it afterward.</p>\n<p>The Pro version also provides a direct import of <strong>post (and term) titles</strong> or, if installed, <strong>Yoast SEO and RankMath &#8220;focus keywords&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
