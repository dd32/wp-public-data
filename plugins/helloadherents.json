This option might be coming if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20separate%20members%20into%20different%20google%20groups%20%3F'>\nCan I separate members into different Google groups ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you have set multiple prices (&#8220;tarifs&#8221;) for your HelloAsso campaign, you will be able to divide members into different groups based on that criterion. More options might be coming if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20the%20mailchimp%20merge%20fields%20%3F'>\nWhat about the Mailchimp Merge Fields ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Mailchimp merge fields are useful for quickly displaying data in your audience, and filter your contacts into specific segments.<br />\nDefault merge fields include First Name (FNAME), Last Name (LNAME), Address (ADDRESS), Phone number (PHONE NUMBER) and Birthday (BIRTHDAY), but these are customizable, and you can add more of them.</p>\n<p>For now, the Address and Birthday merge fields are not supported by HelloAdherent. This option might be coming if needed.</p>\n<p>Any other merge field, including custom ones that you created, are supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20to%20use%20the%20members%27%20data%20for%20something%20else.%20is%20that%20possible%20%3F'>\nI need to use the members&#8217; data for something else. Is that possible ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes ! With the custom function part, you can write your own PHP function, register it where you like (child theme, your own plugin&#8230;) and use it to do whatever you want with the HelloAsso data. You could write anything to fit exactly your needs !</p>\n</p>\n\n",
