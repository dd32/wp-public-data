        "description": "<p>Our plugin makes it possible for you to accept Swish as payment method in your webshop. This payment method suits you if you want to offer your customers fast, simple and safe mobile payments.</p>\n<p>As addition to the plugin you need the service Swish e-commerce that you order from one of the Swedish banks offering the service. Ask your bank if it does. Swish e-commerce is a special service developed for e-commerce and differs from the normal private &#8220;Swish&#8221; service and the corporate Swish corporate. Some banks have made it possible to order the service online in their internet bank but most of the banks still require a filled in and signed form to be sent in.</p>\n<p>The plugin supports three connection methods described below:</p>\n<h3>Technical supplier</h3>\n<p>Swish offers the possiblity to use a technical supplier when connecting your webshop to your bank.</p>\n<p>This is the easiest way to use the plugin. You select BjornTech as Technical Supplier in your internet bank and configure the plugin to use a technical supplier.</p>\n<p>Read more about the status of Technical Supplier in your bank and how to configure it in our <a href=\"https://bjorntech.com/sv/swish-teknisk-leverantor?utm_source=wp-swish&amp;utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_campaign=product\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">guide</a></p>\n<h3>Local certificate</h3>\n<p>If your bank is not supporting the choice of technical supplier you can create a certificate of your own and place it on your webserver. You will find instructions for doing this in our installation description.</p>\n<h3>Simulator</h3>\n<p>If you just want to see how the plugin will look like in your webshop or if you need to test payments in your staging or test environment you can configure the plugin to simulate payments.<br />\nA payment done via the simulator is done by a pre-configured fictive mobile number and will be automatically approved by the system. Because of this you can not see how the payment will look like in the Swish App</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h3>Installation instructions for technical supplier</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate and add the plugin in wordpress by searching for &#8220;Swish&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Order the &#8220;Swish handel&#8221; service from your local Swedish bank.</li>\n<li>Select BjornTech as your Technical provider. This is done in your bank website.</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;BjornTech as Technical Supplier&#8221; as Connection type.</li>\n<li>Enter your merchant Swish-number in the field &#8220;Swish-number&#8221; and your mail address in the &#8220;Account mail address&#8221; field. Save the settings.</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Connect to service&#8221;.</li>\n<li>When the confirmation mail arrives in your inbox open it and click on the activation link.</li>\n<li>Make a test payment to confirm that everything is working.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q:  I have a private Swish-number (using my mobile number). Can I use this number as merchant number in the plugin?<br />\nA:  No, you need the service &#8220;Swish handel&#8221;. Contact your bank to order it.<br />\nQ:  I have a corporate Swish-number (starting with 123). Can I use this number as merchant number in the plugin?<br />\nA:  No, you need the service &#8220;Swish handel&#8221;. Contact your bank to order it.<br />\nQ:  The plugin installation page tells me that my system is using NSS. What does that mean?<br />\nA:  A small number of installations are using NSS as mechanism for certificate handling rather than OpenSSL. Your installation is one of theese. The plugin can be configured to work with NSS but this requires deep NSS knowledge. If you do not have this knowledge we do recommend to use our service as Technical supplier.</p>\n",
