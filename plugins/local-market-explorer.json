        "description": "<p>This plugin allows WordPress to load data from a number of neighborhood-related APIs to be presented on a single page or within<br />\nyour own pages / posts.</p>\n<p>Info is recovered by calling the following APIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real Estate Market Stats (via <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/webservice/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Zillow</a>)</li>\n<li>StreetAdvisor (via <a href=\"http://www.streetadvisor.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">StreetAdvisor</a>)</li>\n<li>Walk Score (via <a href=\"http://www.walkscore.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Walk Score</a>)</li>\n<li>Google Maps (http://maps.google.com./maps/api) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>To use the modules on the pre-generated Local Market Explorer &#8220;virtual pages,&#8221; you don&#8217;t need to do anything other than link to<br />\nor visit the specially-crafted URLs that Local Market Explorer intercepts. The formats of these URLs look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/<em>city</em>/<em>state</em>/&gt;</li>\n<li>&lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/<em>neighborhood</em>/<em>city</em>/<em>state</em>/&gt;</li>\n<li>&lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/<em>zip</em>/&gt;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, to load the Local Market Explorer for Seattle, WA, you&#8217;d simply need to point your browser to<br />\n&lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/seattle/wa/&gt;. If you have spaces in your city name, you can use hyphens for the spaces in<br />\nthe URL, like so: &lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/laguna-beach/ca/&gt;. You DO NOT need to pre-initialize these<br />\nURLs to work; simply having Local Market Explorer installed is enough to get any of these URLs to load the appropriate data.</p>\n<p>To use the modules with your own pages and posts, you only need to insert the Local Market Explorer shortcode text via the<br />\npage / post editor. There&#8217;s a small map icon in the toolbar editor that can help you do this.</p>\n<p>More information and help can be found in the &#8220;Help&#8221; tab in the admin once the plugin is installed.</p>\n<p>This plugin is open-source donationware. Weâ€™re willing to accept and integrate well-written patches into the code, but the<br />\ncontinued development of the plugin (new features, bug fixes, etc) by the plugin author is funded by either donations or<br />\ncompanies willing to pay a fee to have their data integrated. You can thank Zillow, and <a href=\"http://www.streetadvisor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">StreetAdvisor</a> for funding the<br />\nvast majority of the development thus far.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Go to your WordPress admin area, then go to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; area, then go to &#8220;Add New&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;local market explorer&#8221; (sans quotes) in the plugin search box.</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Install&#8221; on the right, then click &#8220;Install&#8221; at the top-right in the window that comes up.</li>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Local Market Explorer&#8221; area.</li>\n<li>Visit each of the API key links and get your API keys. After you put in each API key, the data will load for the corresponding modules.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I customize the styling and display format?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. All of the styles are controlled via an external CSS stylesheet named client.css (located in the &#8216;css&#8217; folder). You can<br />\neasily override any of the styles in there. Be aware, however, that the default styles were created to be compliant with all of<br />\nthe branding requirements of the different APIs. It&#8217;s possible that overriding any of the styles could put you out of compliance<br />\nwith the API provider(s).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I draw attention to the pages for my target markets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a number of pre-built images you can use to use as calls to action on your sidebar or anywhere else. The images are<br />\navailable in the following colors: black, blue, green, orange, and red. The images can be found in the following folder:<br />\n/wp-content/plugins/local-market-explorer/images/badges</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add a sidebar module listing my target markets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From your WordPress admin interface, simply navigate to Appearance -&gt; Widgets, then you can drag + drop the &#8220;Local Market<br />\nExplorer Areas&#8221; from the &#8220;Available Widgets&#8221; to a sidebar on the right (such as &#8220;Sidebar 1&#8221;). Once the widget is placed, you can<br />\nclick the down-arrow on the newly placed widget to customize the title.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The Market Activity module is not getting populated with recent sales data &#8211; why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The module is driven by a private API call that needs permissions to be granted to a specific Zillow API key.<br />\nTo request access to this API, simply fill out the API upgrade form located<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/webservice/APIUpgradeRequest.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and select &#8220;Local Market Explorer WordPress Plugin&#8221; in the API<br />\nrequest type field. Once the request is processed, your market activity module should populate automatically with recent sales<br />\ndata.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
