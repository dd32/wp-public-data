Additionally, you can override the main settings per post or page by using the provided shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20don%27t%20provide%20an%20api%20key%3F'>\nWhat happens if I don&#8217;t provide an API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin requires an OpenAI API key to function.
