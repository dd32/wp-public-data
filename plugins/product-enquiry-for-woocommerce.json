The WISDM Product Enquiry for WooCommerce works for Simple and Variable Products.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20assign%20the%20incoming%20inquiry%20or%20quotation%20request%20emails%20to%20other%20team%20members%3F'>\nCan I assign the incoming Inquiry or Quotation request emails to other team members?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. With the Product Enquiry for WooCommerce, you can delegate the responsibility of the incoming Inquiry or Quotation requests to other team members as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20the%20inquiry%20button%20on%20the%20shop%20page%3F'>\nCan I display the Inquiry button on the Shop Page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Free version allows you to display the Inquiry button on the Products page only.

However, the Pro version enables the customers to save time by placing the Inquiry or Request Quotations for multiple products at once.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%2Fcustomize%20the%20inquiry%20form%20to%20fit%20my%20needs%3F'>\nCan I modify/customize the Inquiry Form to fit my needs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You have to use the default inquiry form. Having said that, the Pro version comes with an in-built custom form builder that allows you to add custom fields in the Inquiry form as per your needs.
