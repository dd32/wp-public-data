        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20edit%20transcriptions%20generated%20by%20wubtitle%3F'>\nCan I edit transcriptions generated by Wubtitle?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, requesting a transcription will generate an editable paragraph block in WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20edit%20subtitles%20generated%20by%20wubtitle%3F'>\nCan I edit subtitles generated by Wubtitle?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but we are working to add this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20languages%20does%20wubtitle%20support%3F'>\nWhat languages does Wubtitle support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wubtitle currently supports english, italian, spanish, chinese, french, Gulf Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Dutch, Australian English, British English, Indian English, Irish English, Scottish English, Welsh English, US Spanish, Canadian French, Farsi, Swiss German, Hebrew, Indian Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Tamil, Telugu, Turkish. However, free plan only supports english and italian languages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20wubtitle%20automatically%20translate%20transcriptions%3F'>\nCan Wubtitle automatically translate transcriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Wubtitle canâ€™t automatically translate transcriptions, but we are working to add this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20request%20a%20transcription%20twice%20for%20the%20same%20youtube%20video%3F'>\nWhat happens if I request a transcription twice for the same Youtube video?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you request a transcription twice for the same video, you will be charged only for the first transcription. The following transcribe requests will return the already processed transcription. Note that &#8220;same video&#8221; means the same media library file in WordPress or &#8220;the same Youtube url&#8221;: instead, if you upload the same video twice in your WordPress, the second one will be marked as a different video, and you will be charged every time you request a transcription for a &#8220;different&#8221; video.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20maximum%20length%20for%20the%20videos%20i%20can%20transcribe%3F'>\nIs there a maximum length for the videos I can transcribe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the maximun lenght for the videos you can transcribe depends on your subscription type. For example, if you have an Elite plan, you can transcribe videos for at least 10 hours of lenght, regardless of the lenght of individual files. For example, you can transcribe a single 10-hour video or ten 1-hour videos.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20maximum%20weight%20for%20the%20videos%20i%20can%20transcribe%3F'>\nIs there a maximum weight for the videos I can transcribe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you can transcribe videos of any weight. However, make sure they meet the time limits of your plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20video%20formats%20does%20wubtitle%20support%3F'>\nWhat video formats does Wubtitle support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wubtitle supports every video format which is already supported by WordPress. However, free plan only supports MP4 video format.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20purchased%20a%20professional%20plan.%20what%20happens%20if%20i%20upgrade%20to%20elite%20before%20the%20professional%20period%20has%20expired%3F'>\nI purchased a Professional plan. What happens if I upgrade to Elite before the Professional period has expired?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you upgrade to Elite before Professional has expired, Elite limits are immediately applied and you will be charged only for the difference between Elite and Professional with no changes to your billing period. For example, if you purchase a Professional plan on 1 January and upgrade to Elite on 15 January, you will only be charged for the price difference between the two plans and your new plan will be renewed on 1 Febrauary.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20purchased%20an%20elite%20plan.%20what%20happens%20if%20i%20downgrade%20to%20professional%20before%20elite%20has%20expired%3F%3F'>\nI purchased an Elite plan. What happens if I downgrade to Professional before Elite has expired??\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you downgrade to Professional before Elite has expired, Professional limits are immediately applied to your account and you will be refunded for the Elite subscription period left via a bonus credit you can spend in paid plans. However, you can only downgrade if you haven&#8217;t exceeded yet Professional limits. For example, if you have an Elite plan and you already processed more than 10 videos or more than 3 hours of video, you can&#8217;t do the downgrade.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20downgrade%20from%20a%20paid%20plan%20to%20the%20free%20plan%3F'>\nWhat happens if I downgrade from a paid plan to the free plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you downgrade from a paid plan to the free plan, you will be able to use your paid plan until its expire date, and then free limits will be applied.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20my%20plan%20automatically%20renewed%20at%20the%20end%20of%20the%20subscription%20period%3F'>\nIs my plan automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, paid plans are automatically renewed at the end of the subscription period.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20an%20annual%20subscription%3F'>\nIs there an annual subscription?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently we do not offer annual subscriptions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
