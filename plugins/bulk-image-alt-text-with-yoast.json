After that, you can simply let it do its work.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the recommended practices?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s advisable to keep the text (keyword) short to maximize its effectiveness. Shorter alt texts, and thus keywords, are more likely to be efficiently indexed by Google and other major online search engines. For more information, please refer to our FAQ.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the role of alt tags?</strong></p>\n<p>Search engines and other web crawlers cannot understand images. However, images can significantly influence how people interpret a specific web page. Alt texts address this issue by providing text that can be read by search engines.</p>\n<p>When a Google bot or another search engine crawler examines a page, images with properly formatted alt text contribute to the indexing of the page and its ranking on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP).</p>\n<p><strong>Alt text or Alt tag?</strong></p>\n<p>The term that might immediately come to mind when thinking about image alt text is &#8220;alt tag&#8221;. However, &#8220;alt tag&#8221; is a misnomer and doesn&#8217;t actually exist. The correct term is alt text, or alternative text, which is the alternate text attribute of the image tag.</p>\n<p>This can lead to confusion in SEO communication, as most people are familiar with the term &#8220;alt tag&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s technically incorrect.</p>\n<p>Alternative text (or Alt text) is primarily used by screen readers for the visually impaired to understand what an image is about. It allows you to provide an image description that is read out by an audio prompter, informing visually impaired users about the content on the page as they navigate through it.</p>\n<p>According to the W3C Accessibility Guidelines, it&#8217;s important to include both image alt text and image title text in the image for important images on the page to ensure that the code is W3C-valid.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is Alt Text Important?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google&#8217;s article</a> about images includes a section titled &#8220;Use descriptive alt text&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t a coincidence, as Google places a high value on alt text to determine not only the content of the image but also its relation to the surrounding text.</p>\n<p>Using alt text (or the Alt attribute) on your images can improve user experience and potentially provide SEO benefits. Along with implementing best practices for image title and file naming, including the alt attribute can also contribute to image SEO.</p>\n<p>Currently, Google&#8217;s search engine results pages (SERPs) provide as many image results as text-based results. Therefore, one of the key benefits of image alt text is that it can turn your images into hyperlinked search results, providing another avenue for your website to attract organic visitors.</p>\n<p>Despite significant improvements in search engine image recognition technology over the years, search crawlers still can&#8217;t &#8220;see&#8221; the images on a website page in the way humans can. Therefore, it&#8217;s not advisable to leave the interpretation entirely up to them. If they don&#8217;t understand, or get it wrong, you could potentially rank for unintended keywords or miss out on ranking altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>About Google&#8217;s Image Recommendations?</strong></p>\n<p>To enhance the visibility of your content in Google Images, prioritize the user by offering an excellent user experience: design pages primarily for users, not for search engines. Here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure good context: Ensure that your visual content is pertinent to the page&#8217;s topic. We recommend displaying images only where they contribute unique value to the page. We strongly advise against pages where neither the images nor the text are original content.</li>\n<li>Optimize positioning: When feasible, place images near relevant text. If it makes sense, consider positioning the most important image near the top of the page.</li>\n<li>Avoid embedding crucial text within images: Refrain from embedding text in images, particularly important text elements like page headings and menu items, because not all users can access them (and page translation tools won&#8217;t work on images). To ensure maximum accessibility of your content, keep text in HTML and provide alt text for images.</li>\n<li>Develop informative and high-quality sites: Good content on your webpage is just as crucial as visual content for Google Images &#8211; it provides context and makes the result more actionable. Page content may be used to generate a text snippet for the image, and Google considers the quality of the page content when ranking images.</li>\n<li>Develop device-friendly sites: Users search on Google Images more from mobile than on desktop. For this reason, it&#8217;s important that you design your site to accommodate all device types and sizes. Use the mobile-friendly testing tool to assess how well your pages work on mobile devices, and receive feedback on what needs to be fixed.</li>\n<li>Develop a good URL structure for your images: Google uses the URL path as well as the file name to help it understand your images. Consider organizing your image content so that URLs are constructed logically.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20alt%20text%3F'>\nWhat is alt text?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Alt text (alternative text), also known as &#8220;alt attributes&#8221;, “alt descriptions,” and technically incorrectly as &#8220;alt tags,” are used within an HTML code to describe the appearance and function of an image on a page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20alt%20text%3A'>\nHow to use Alt text:\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>• Adding alternative text to photos is first and foremost a principle of web accessibility. Visually impaired users using screen readers will be read an alt attribute to better understand an on-page image.<br />\n• Alt tags will be displayed in place of an image if an image file cannot be loaded.<br />\n• Alt tags provide better image context/descriptions to search engine crawlers, helping them to index an image properly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='appropriate%20length%3F'>\nAppropriate length?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google seemed to count the first 16 words in the ALT tag and interestingly in the snippet Google uses, it does seem to completely cut off the rest of the ALT and from the 17th word. Having 16 words to work with might prove very useful if you are using ALT tags to describe more complex images. There is potentially plenty of available space to describe images properly for accessibility purposes AND SEO impact.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20image%20alt%20tags%20and%20meta%20data%20help%20seo'>\nHow Image Alt Tags and Meta Data Help SEO\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Optimizing your images for SEO helps crawlers better index your web pages, which in turn can give you a rankings boost because it can make the page more relevant to users. Let’s say a searcher needs plumber repairs for a clogged bathroom drain. Google has to choose between two web pages from different companies, both of which have equal ranking factors. As the crawler reads through the first page, it doesn’t identify any image alt-tags, therefore, it assumes the images (if there are any) do not add page-specific value. On the second page, however, the crawler locates five images, each one with a full description of what the image is showing. All five images’ alt tags supplement the rest of the text on the page. Since Google is all about spitting out the results you’ll most likely jive with, it’s going to go with the article that it thinks is more relevant.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Alt texts address this issue by providing text that can be read by search engines.</p>\n<p>When a Google bot or another search engine crawler examines a page, images with properly formatted alt text contribute to the indexing of the page and its ranking on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP).</p>\n<p><strong>Alt text or Alt tag?</strong></p>\n<p>The term that might immediately come to mind when thinking about image alt text is &#8220;alt tag&#8221;. However, &#8220;alt tag&#8221; is a misnomer and doesn&#8217;t actually exist. The correct term is alt text, or alternative text, which is the alternate text attribute of the image tag.</p>\n<p>This can lead to confusion in SEO communication, as most people are familiar with the term &#8220;alt tag&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s technically incorrect.</p>\n<p>Alternative text (or Alt text) is primarily used by screen readers for the visually impaired to understand what an image is about. It allows you to provide an image description that is read out by an audio prompter, informing visually impaired users about the content on the page as they navigate through it.</p>\n<p>According to the W3C Accessibility Guidelines, it&#8217;s important to include both image alt text and image title text in the image for important images on the page to ensure that the code is W3C-valid.</p>\n<p><strong>Why is Alt Text Important?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google&#8217;s article</a> about images includes a section titled &#8220;Use descriptive alt text&#8221;. This isn&#8217;t a coincidence, as Google places a high value on alt text to determine not only the content of the image but also its relation to the surrounding text.</p>\n<p>Using alt text (or the Alt attribute) on your images can improve user experience and potentially provide SEO benefits. Along with implementing best practices for image title and file naming, including the alt attribute can also contribute to image SEO.</p>\n<p>Currently, Google&#8217;s search engine results pages (SERPs) provide as many image results as text-based results. Therefore, one of the key benefits of image alt text is that it can turn your images into hyperlinked search results, providing another avenue for your website to attract organic visitors.</p>\n<p>Despite significant improvements in search engine image recognition technology over the years, search crawlers still can&#8217;t &#8220;see&#8221; the images on a website page in the way humans can. Therefore, it&#8217;s not advisable to leave the interpretation entirely up to them. If they don&#8217;t understand, or get it wrong, you could potentially rank for unintended keywords or miss out on ranking altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>About Google&#8217;s Image Recommendations?</strong></p>\n<p>To enhance the visibility of your content in Google Images, prioritize the user by offering an excellent user experience: design pages primarily for users, not for search engines. Here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure good context: Ensure that your visual content is pertinent to the page&#8217;s topic. We recommend displaying images only where they contribute unique value to the page. We strongly advise against pages where neither the images nor the text are original content.</li>\n<li>Optimize positioning: When feasible, place images near relevant text. If it makes sense, consider positioning the most important image near the top of the page.</li>\n<li>Avoid embedding crucial text within images: Refrain from embedding text in images, particularly important text elements like page headings and menu items, because not all users can access them (and page translation tools won&#8217;t work on images). To ensure maximum accessibility of your content, keep text in HTML and provide alt text for images.</li>\n<li>Develop informative and high-quality sites: Good content on your webpage is just as crucial as visual content for Google Images &#8211; it provides context and makes the result more actionable. Page content may be used to generate a text snippet for the image, and Google considers the quality of the page content when ranking images.</li>\n<li>Develop device-friendly sites: Users search on Google Images more from mobile than on desktop. For this reason, it&#8217;s important that you design your site to accommodate all device types and sizes. Use the mobile-friendly testing tool to assess how well your pages work on mobile devices, and receive feedback on what needs to be fixed.</li>\n<li>Develop a good URL structure for your images: Google uses the URL path as well as the file name to help it understand your images. Consider organizing your image content so that URLs are constructed logically.</li>\n</ul>\n",
