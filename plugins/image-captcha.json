The best place to put this tag is before the comment textarea, you can move it up if it is below the comment textarea.</p>\n<p>(WP3 series) WP3 has a new function comment_form inside of <code>/wp-includes/comment-template.php</code>.<br />\nYour theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from comments.php.<br />\nWP3 theme does not need the code line <code>do_action('comment_form'</code>&#8230; inside of <code>/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php</code>.<br />\nInstead it uses a new function call inside of comments.php: <code>&lt;?php comment_form(); ?&gt;</code><br />\nIf you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has <code>&lt;?php comment_form(); ?&gt;</code><br />\ninside of <code>/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php</code> (please check the Twenty Ten theme&#8217;s comments.php for proper example)</p>\n</p>\n\n",
