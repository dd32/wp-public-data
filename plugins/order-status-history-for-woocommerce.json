Unobtrusive visual cues in all the orders screens show when someone has ordered from your shop before, your (most) repeating customers, and spurts of unusual activity (like  customers with due payments and cancellations).</p>\n<h4>Main features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A graphical add-on for WooCommerce. Simply install and you&#8217;re ready to go</li>\n<li>For each Order in the <em>Orders</em> table, get additional data displayed, like: has a customer ordered before, repeatedness, and unusual behavior (e.g. due payments and cancellations)</li>\n<li>The newly added <em>Order history column</em> is also sortable. The Shop Manager now can easily discern their most repeating customers, or those with the most issues, for example</li>\n<li>Shows Order history statuses as color swatches in 3 different places: the <em>Orders</em> page, the <em>Edit Order</em> page, and the <em>Users</em> page </li>\n<li>Status colors are fully customizable, including the default WooCommerce statuses. Many color themes also available, inspired from major shopping carts</li>\n<li>Can work in conjunction with, or replace altogether, the default WooCommerce status swatches</li>\n<li>Fully supports Guest, registered Customer, and mixed Guest / Customer Orders</li>\n<li>Detailed reports of past Orders,  purchased Products, and all notes sent to Customer or private, for any registered or Guest Customer </li>\n<li>CSV export of Orders, Products, and Notes reports</li>\n<li>Support of composite products within Reports</li>\n<li>Multi-currency support, with some extra usability features</li>\n<li>Translation-ready</li>\n<li>Completely free, with no limitations. Donations welcome.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Installing <em>Order Status History for WooCommerce</em> is straightforward. As with any other WP plugin, installation can be done either by searching the WP plugin repository, or via the &#8220;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8221; screen in your WP Dashboard using the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin from wordpress.org</li>\n<li>Upload the ZIP file through the &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload&#8217; screen in your WordPress Dashboard</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",

What&#8217;s going on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 1.8, the history queries are cached via transients, which dramatically improves speed and lowers DB calls during the display of the Orders and Users screens. The trade-off though is that the Orders history column information might be at times inaccurate, as is now rebuilt with some delay of up to 1 hour. If that&#8217;s an issue to you, the <code>Bulk action -&gt; Rebuild history cache</code> allows updating the history cache manually.</p>\n<p>Additionally, filter <code>oshwoo_cache_ttl</code>, (goes into <code>functions.php</code>), can help control the baseline of how long the cache stays fresh before going stale and rebuilding itself (default is 1h). Example usage: <code>add_filter( 'oshwoo_cache_ttl', function(){ return 0.5; });</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20this%20plugin%20and%20for%20whom%20is%20it%20for%3F'>\nWhat is this plugin and for whom is it for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>Order Status History for WooCommerce</em> enhances the Orders &amp; Users screens. It can bring some useful customer historical data in a graphically intuitive way. Targeted toward Shop Managers in their daily decision-making and order fulfillment tasks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20everything%20work%3F%20is%20it%20there%20a%20%27pro%27%20version%3F'>\nDoes everything work? Is it there a &#8216;Pro&#8217; version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no &#8216;Pro&#8217; version, nor a planned one. Everything works with no limitations, completely free of charge. No strings attached.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20supported%3F'>\nIs this plugin supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s supported in the WP forums, when time permits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='acknowledgments'>\nAcknowledgments\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wish to thank the <em>Woocommerce Customers Order History</em> plugin for becoming a motivational point to write this one from the ground up, with the hope of offering a better alternative in various aspects that felt lacking, according to this author.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
