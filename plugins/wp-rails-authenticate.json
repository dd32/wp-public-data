Can I share sessions between them (single sign-on)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to ruby and PHP using different serialisation approaches we&#8217;ve not (yet) got an easy way to share<br />\nsessions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My blog runs on a different server from my rails app. How do I share accounts between them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Providing your blog server can access the database, you simply need an appropriate database.yml file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there other approaches to this problem?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since this plugin was developed, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rails-integration-api/\" rel=\"ugc\">Rails Integration API</a><br />\nplugin has been released. That requires you to add some API code to your rails app, but<br />\nmay be easier if you want to keep all the encryption logic solely in rails or can&#8217;t add an extra<br />\nmodule to PHP.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
