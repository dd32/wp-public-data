The email includes details such as the successful login username, IP address, and browser information. The &#8216;send_login_failed_notification&#8217; function sends a similar email to the admin, but for failed login attempts.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses the wp_mail function to send the emails, and the messages are formatted as HTML for easy readability. The plugin ensures that the data being displayed, such as the username and IP address, is escaped using PHP&#8217;s built-in escape functions. This is done to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).</p>\n<p>In summary, this plugin provides an easy way for website administrators to stay informed of user login activity on their site, while also ensuring that sensitive information is displayed securely.</p>\n",
