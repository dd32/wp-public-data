        "description": "<p>iRobots.txt SEO (IRSEO) is a fully customizable robots.txt virtual file generator. IRSEO creates a highly optimized and secure robots.txt file straight out of the box. Users may choose to enable or disable specific user agents, directories or files using intuitive options all of which include detailed instructions.</p>\n<p>The robots.txt file is a text file located in the root directory of a website. It&#8217;s purpose is to direct user-agents (AKA bots) away from or towards specific files or directories. Inhibiting a bot from indexing specific pages will ensure your website remains keyword optimized and all indexed pages are relevant to your potential customers.</p>\n<p>IRSEO also inhibits several WordPress system directories and files by default. Doing this ensures that the search bots do not include security sensitive pages within search results. For example, searching for &#8220;inurl:wp-content name size description&#8221; in Google will produce a list of sites with indexed and open content directories.</p>\n<p>Note that IRSEO creates a virtual robots.txt file. This robots.txt file is displayed whenever access to the robots.txt file is requested.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin from <code>http://markbeljaars.com/download/current/plugins/irobotstxt-seo.zip</code>.</li>\n<li>Extract and upload the plugin to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory and activate it.</li>\n<li>Edit the plugin settings using the admin page located under <code>Settings</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Does iRobots.txt SEO create or modify any files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The robots.txt file serverd by IRSEO is virtual only. Your site will remain unmodified once the plugin is removed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I learn more about robots.txt?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The official robots.txt information site is <a href=\"http://www.robotstxt.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.robotstxt.org/</a>. The Google robots.txt extensions are documented <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=156449\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the robots.txt file not display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you type http://blog-name/robots.txt into a browser and are not presented with the IRSEO virtual robots.txt file, there may be several causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another plugin is creating its own robots.txt file. In this case, it is first in best dressed. Ensure that &#8220;Add sitemap URL to the virtual robots.txt file&#8221; option is not selected in XML Sitemap Generator.</li>\n<li>You have a physical robots.txt file. In this case the physical file is displayed instead of the virtual file.</li>\n<li>Your theme is not virtual file friendly. This is unfortunately the case for the excellent Arclite theme.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I edit the robots.txt file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. In the &#8220;View Robots.txt&#8221; admin setting panel, select the &#8220;Enable free form editing&#8221; option. You will now be able to directly modify the robots.txt file from within this pane.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add Belorussian translation by <a href=\"http://pc.de/\" title=\"Marcis G.\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Marcis G.</a>. Thank you Marcis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed file close bug in irseo_file_exists function that has caused an error on some blogs.</li>\n<li>Added option to allow or filter duplicate content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is now possible to free edit the robots.txt file from within the plugin admin panel.</li>\n<li>The robots.txt file is now served if the URL does or does not contain the &#8216;www&#8217; prefix.
