For this, the following measures are taken:</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I have to make my website accessible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The reasons can be many and it will always depend on the importance that you give to your target audience. We show only the most significant advantages.</p>\n<p>Make our communication reach all types of public, regardless of their condition, age or culture.<br />\nMore than 1,000 million people in the world have some kind of disability, around 15% of the world population, and it is increasing due to the aging of the population.<br />\nEveryone at some point in our lives, we suffer some disability and we need help.<br />\nBy SEO positioning, search engines reward accessibility with a better indexing of your page.<br />\nThe international treaties, the UN and the community and local legislations make our contents accessible to all kinds of diversities.<br />\nFor RSP, corporate social responsibility.<br />\nTo preempt its competitors.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the accessible multimedia library? Advantage.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Inclusive Study puts at your disposal more than 2,000 concepts or words (and increasing every day), with its corresponding pictograms, audios and videos in 3 languages (English, Spanish and Valencian (Catalan).) However, this library is open to the contribution and rise of new concepts by the users of the global community, increasing day by day significantly concepts in different languages.</p>\n<p>When a user uses the library instead of local files, he benefits from the following advantages:</p>\n<p>A considerable saving of server space<br />\nHosting of your files in a global network of fast response servers of the CDN type.<br />\nAudio and video service in “adaptive streaming”, achieving maximum load optimisation.<br />\nAutomatic playback of videos in gif format when they are requested from a mobile.<br />\nMenu customisation system<br />\nSystem customisation of blocks and sidebars of the web.<br />\nPossibility of friendly url to achieve maximum natural positioning in search engines.<br />\nApp or mobile application.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do Deaf people need Sign Language if they can see and therefore read?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are many reasons for the use of Sign Language, but these are the most relevant:</p>\n<p>People who are deaf at birth may have difficulties in reading comprehension.<br />\nSign language is not only used by deaf people, but also by some people with cognitive diversity.<br />\nSign language in many places is considered official language.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
