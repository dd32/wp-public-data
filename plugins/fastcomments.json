        "installation": "<p>Installing FastComments is easy. There are two main steps &#8211; installing the WordPress plugin and then connecting it with FastComments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to &#8220;Plugins&#8221; &gt; &#8220;Add Plugin&#8221;</li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;FastComments&#8221;</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;</li>\n<li>Activate the Plugin</li>\n<li>Click FastComments in the left admin panel.</li>\n<li>Follow the steps to set up and connect your WordPress installation to our servers. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s just a couple clicks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can expect the sync to take several minutes if you have tens of thousands of comments or more.</p>\n<p>FastComments has performance as a top priority and is designed to ensure it does not put significant load on your site during setup. We use WordPress&#8217;s default indexes to perform the sync, and even for large<br />\nsites the load should be very little and is designed to be spread out as much as possible.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20use%20fastcomments%3F'>\nWhat does it cost to use FastComments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FastComments has different tiers available. Whether you&#8217;re an individual creator or a larger businesses, there&#8217;s a tier for you.<br />\nSee our pricing page here: https://fastcomments.com/traffic-pricing</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20fastcomments%20faster%20than%3F'>\nWhat is FastComments Faster Than?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FastComments aims to be the fastest commenting system for you and your users. User experience and performance are very high<br />\non the list of priorities for us.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20lose%20any%20comments%20when%20i%20switch%20to%20fastcomments%3F'>\nWill I lose any comments when I switch to FastComments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fear not, your comments will not disappear! Your site will experience zero loss of data even during the transition as we won&#8217;t enable FastComments until the sync is done.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20switch%20back%20to%20default%20wordpress%20comments%3F'>\nCan I switch back to default WordPress comments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, FastComments keeps your WordPress installation in sync with our servers. We send very small updates, at most once a minute if needed, for any new comments.</p>\n<p>Simply cancel your account and deactivate the plugin to switch back, but we don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll want to!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20how%20fastcomments%20looks%3F'>\nCan I customize how FastComments looks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You sure can! After installing click the Customize button in the FastComments admin area to configure how your comment threads should look and function, as well as adding your own CSS if desired.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
