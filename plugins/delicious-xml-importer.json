(It&#8217;s shown at the top of your Delicious page, and it&#8217;s near the top of the XML file as well.) If the importer stops before it reaches that number, you can edit your XML file to remove all the bookmarks up to that point and try again.</p>\n<p>The importer cannot handle bookmarklets (links that begin with <em>javascript:</em>). If you come across one in your export file, you can remove the bookmarklet&#8217;s entire  line from your XML file and re-import.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you would like to send me a translation, please write to me through <a href=\"http://sillybean.net/about/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my contact page</a>.
