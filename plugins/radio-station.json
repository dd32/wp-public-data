For <strong>PRO Support</strong>, please <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Submit a Support Ticket</a>.</p>\n<h4>QUICKSTART GUIDE</h4>\n<p>Once you have installed and activated the <strong>Radio Station</strong> plugin on your WordPress site, your WordPress Admin area will now have a new menu item titled Radio Station with submenu page items. Note if you have a specific question, you can check out the <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> as you may find the answer there.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you can visit the Plugin Settings screen to adjust the default <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/options/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Options</a> to your liking. Here you can set your Radio Timezone and Language, along with your Streaming URL and Station Logo, as well as other global plugin settings. Also from this Settings page you can assign <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/display/#automatic-pages\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Automatic Pages</a> and Views for your Program Schedule display and for other plugin post type archive displays. But first you will want to add some Shows to display in your Schedule!</p>\n<p>To do this, click on Shows in the admin submenu, then on &#8220;Add a New Show&#8221; at the top. Give it a Shift timeslot and a description and then click Publish. Then view the Show page by clicking the Show Permalink under the show title. (Depending on your Theme, you may wish to adjust the <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/display/#page-templates\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Templates</a> used.) You can also assign different <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/display/#images\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Images</a> to Shows.</p>\n<p>Next, have a look at your Program Schedule page to see the Show displayed there also. Keep adding Shows until you have your Schedule filled in! You can also add schedule Overrides for specific date and time blocks only. For ease of use they can be fully or partially linked to an existing Show. You can further <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/manage/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Manage</a> your Shows and other Station data via the WordPress Admin area.</p>\n<p>Now you may want to give some users on your site some plugin <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/roles/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Roles</a>. (Note that while the default interface in WordPress allows you to assign a single role to a user, it also supports multiple roles, but you need to add a plugin to get an interface for this.) Giving a user role of Host/DJ or Producer to a user will allow them to be assigned to a Show on the Show Edit Page and allow them to edit that Show. You can also assign the Show Editor role if you have someone who needs to edit all plugin post types without being a site Administator.</p>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/widgets/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Widgets</a> you can add to your site via your <em>Appearance -&gt; Widgets</em> admin submenu. These are also available as <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shortcodes</a> and <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/widgets/#radio-station-blocks\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Blocks</a>. There are widgets for the Current Show or Playlist, and another to display Upcoming Shows. In this way you can also add a Stream Player, Radio Clock, Schedule View or Show List anywhere you like.</p>\n<p>Radio Station has several in-built <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data</a> types. These include <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/data/#custom-post-types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Post Types</a> for Shows, Schedule Overrides and Playlists. There are <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/data/#taxonomies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Taxonomies</a> for Genres and Languages. You can override most data values and display output via custom <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/filters/#data-filters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data Filters</a> throughout the plugin. We have also incorporated a <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data API</a> in the plugin available via REST and/or WordPress Feeds, and this data is accessible in JSON format.</p>\n<p>This plugin is under active development and we are continuously working to enhance the free version available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/radio-station/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.Org</a>, as well as creating new feature additions for <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Radio Station Pro</a>. Check out the <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/roadmap/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Roadmap</a> if you are interested in seeing what is coming up next!</p>\n<h4>CONTRIBUTION</h4>\n<p>We are grateful to Nikki Blight for her contribution to creating and developing this plugin for as long as she could maintain the codebase.

This option allows you to use additional shortcode attributes to control what is displayed in your Schedule (see <a href=\"./Shortcodes.md#master-schedule-shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Master Schedule Shortcode Docs</a> )</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20want%20to%20schedule%20a%20special%20event%20or%20one-off%20schedule%20change%3F'>\nWhat if I want to schedule a special event or one-off schedule change?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have a one-off event that you need to show up in the Schedule and Widgets, you can create a Schedule Override by navigating to WordPress Dashboard &gt; Radio Station &gt; Schedule Overrides &gt; Add New. This will allow you to set aside a block of time on a specific date, and when the Schedule or Widget is displaying that date, the override will be used instead of the normally scheduled Show. You can also link an Override to an existing Show, and partially update any Show information to be overridden. (Note that Schedule Overrides will not display in the old Legacy Table/Div Views of the Master Schedule.) In the Free version, if an Override needs to apply to multiple dates, you must schedule each time slot individually. In the PRO version, you can repeat the Override via day periods or monthly recurrences. To enable recurring overrides, <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to Pro here</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20show%20image%20displayed%20in%20the%20widgets%20and%20schedule%3F'>\nHow do I change the Show Image displayed in the widgets and schedule?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The schedule, widgets and show page will display whichever avatar is assigned to the show on the Show Edit screen. Navigate in the WordPress Dashboard to Radio Station -&gt; Shows and locate the Show you want to add/edit the Avatar for in the Shows list. Edit the Show then simply set a new image for the Show.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20style%20how%20the%20plugin%20displays%20content%20on%20the%20front%20end%20of%20my%20site%3F'>\nHow do I style how the plugin displays content on the front end of my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default styles for Radio Station have intentionally kept fairly minimal so as to be compatible with most themes, so you may wish to add your own CSS styles to suit your site&#8217;s look and feel. You can add these styles via Theme Customizer&#8217;s Additional CSS setting. You can also add your own <code>rs-custom.css</code> file to your Child Theme&#8217;s directory, and Radio Station will automatically detect the presence of this file and enqueue it. Either way you can add more specific selectors with rules that modify or override the existing styles. You can find the base styles in the <code>/css/</code> directory of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20widgets%2Fblocks%20are%20available%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat Widgets/Blocks are available with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The following Widgets are available to add via the WordPress Appearance -&gt; Widgets page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Streaming Player</li>\n<li>Current Show</li>\n<li>Upcoming Shows</li>\n<li>Current Playlist</li>\n<li>Radio Clock</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since 2.5.0, these widgets are now also available as Gutenberg Blocks.

Search for or navigate to the User you want to assign as a Host or Producer, then click Edit to open the Edit screen for that User. Find the Roles dropdown menu and select from the Role options provided. Choosing either Host or Producer grants the User that role. You can then assign that User to single or multiple Shows via the Show Edit page. A Host or Producer only has permissions to Edit the Show(s) they are assigned to. The Pro version includes an additional Role Editor interface where you can assign the plugin Roles to any number of users at once.

Assigning a user as a Host or Producer to a Show will allow that User to edit it (and it&#8217;s Playlists.) You could also assign a single User as the Author of a Show/Playlist. If you’d like to give a user that isn&#8217;t a site Administrator permissions for all Radio Station records, you can assign them the Show Editor role that was created for this purpose.

If a Show is not marked active, the plugin assumes that it&#8217;s not currently in production and it is not shown on the Schedule.

You can export your data using WordPress Dashboard -&gt; Tools -&gt; Export feature, or use Radio Station PRO’s Export feature located at WordPress Dashboard -&gt; Import/Export. Our import/export feature works with YML and not XML, which is the standard WordPress format.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20show%20hosts%20or%20producers%20can%27t%20edit%20a%20show%20page%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t Show Hosts or Producers can&#8217;t edit a Show page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The only Hosts and Producers that may Edit a Show are the ones assigned as Host(s) or Producer(s) to that specific Show in the respective user selection menus. This is to prevent Hosts/Producers from editing other Shows managed by different Hosts/Producers without permission. If you need a user other than Administrator to be able to edit all Shows you can assign them a Show Editor role.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20for%20podcasts%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin for Podcasts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While the plugin is not specifically geared toward Podcasting, which is not live programming, some podcaster&#8217;s have used Radio Station to let their subscribers know when they publish new shows.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20for%20twitchtv%2C%20facebook%20live%2C%20youtube%20or%20clubhouse%20shows%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin for TwitchTV, Facebook Live, YouTube or Clubhouse shows?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, there&#8217;s no reason why you couldn&#8217;t use the plugin to display a show schedule on a WordPress site for those services. Unfortunately, we are not currently syncing events from these platforms, but may do so in the future.

It is recommended you do this on a staging site. Instructions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the <code>develop</code> branch of the Radio Station Github repository at:<br />\nhttps://github.com/netmix/radio-station/tree/develop/</li>\n<li>Click on the green &#8220;Code&#8221; button and select Download a ZIP.</li>\n<li>Unzip the downloaded file on your computer and upload it via FTP to the subdirectory of your WordPress install on your web server: <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/</code></li>\n<li>Rename the subdirectory <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station/</code> to <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-old/</code></li>\n<li>Rename the subdirectory <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/</code> to <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station/</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then upload to WordPress via the plugin installer as normal.<br />\nNote that it will install to /wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/, and because of this won&#8217;t overwrite your existing installation, so you&#8217;ll need to deactivate that before activating the development version.</p>\n<p>You can now visit your site to make sure nothing is broken. If you experience issues you can reverse the folder renaming process to activate the old copy of the plugin. If the new development version works fine, at your convenience you can delete the <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-old/</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to do this from your WordPress Plugin area, you can upload the development Zip file from your Plugins -&gt; Upload page. This will install it to <code>/wp-content/plugins/radio-station-develop/</code>. You can then deactivate the existing Radio Station plugin from you Plugins page and then activate the development version. (You can tell them apart on the plugins page via their version numbers. Official releases are 2.x.x, only development releases have the extra digit 2.x.x.x) Again, if you experience issues, you can deactivate the development version and reactivate the old version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20pro%20beta%20version%20testing%3F'>\nWhat about Pro Beta Version Testing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are constantly improving and adding new features to <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Radio Station Pro</a>. Periodically we will release a Beta version to test out a new feature (or fix) out before it is officially released. If you have a Pro license, you can access these cutting edge Pro Beta version releases in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the Beta versions by logging in to your <a href=\"https://users.freemius.com/login\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Freemius User Dashboard</a>. and navigating to the &#8220;Downloads&#8221; section. You will see a dropdown list of all the Radio Station Pro releases, including beta ones.</li>\n<li>Enable the Beta program option from your Radio Station Account page in your WordPress site&#8217;s Admin area, and the latest Beta version will then be available as an update.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: As we are developing the Free and Pro versions in tandem, the latest Pro Beta may require you to install a development version of the Free plugin for it to work. Please see the previous section for how you can install the development version from Github (if the required version is not yet available via the WordPress repository.)</p>\n<p>We recommend you test these on a Staging site (or a development copy of your live site.) This way you can make sure there are no significant bugs before using it on a production site. Of course, please be willing to <a href=\"https://github.com/netmix/radio-station/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">report any bugs</a> that you do find so we can ensure they are not present in the next official release.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Documentation for PRO Features can be found within the existing documentation, as well as indexed separately <a href=\"http://radiostation.pro/docs/pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can see some example displays from the plugin via the Screenshots section below, and <em>full live examples</em> for both Free and PRO features are available on the <a href=\"https://demo.radiostation.pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Radio Station Plugin Demo Site</a>.

For <strong>PRO Support</strong>, please <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Submit a Support Ticket</a>.</p>\n<h4>QUICKSTART GUIDE</h4>\n<p>Once you have installed and activated the <strong>Radio Station</strong> plugin on your WordPress site, your WordPress Admin area will now have a new menu item titled Radio Station with submenu page items. Note if you have a specific question, you can check out the <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> as you may find the answer there.</p>\n<p>Firstly, you can visit the Plugin Settings screen to adjust the default <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/options/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Options</a> to your liking. Here you can set your Radio Timezone and Language, along with your Streaming URL and Station Logo, as well as other global plugin settings. Also from this Settings page you can assign <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/display/#automatic-pages\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Automatic Pages</a> and Views for your Program Schedule display and for other plugin post type archive displays. But first you will want to add some Shows to display in your Schedule!</p>\n<p>To do this, click on Shows in the admin submenu, then on &#8220;Add a New Show&#8221; at the top. Give it a Shift timeslot and a description and then click Publish. Then view the Show page by clicking the Show Permalink under the show title. (Depending on your Theme, you may wish to adjust the <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/display/#page-templates\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Templates</a> used.) You can also assign different <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/display/#images\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Images</a> to Shows.</p>\n<p>Next, have a look at your Program Schedule page to see the Show displayed there also. Keep adding Shows until you have your Schedule filled in! You can also add schedule Overrides for specific date and time blocks only. For ease of use they can be fully or partially linked to an existing Show. You can further <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/manage/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Manage</a> your Shows and other Station data via the WordPress Admin area.</p>\n<p>Now you may want to give some users on your site some plugin <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/roles/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Roles</a>. (Note that while the default interface in WordPress allows you to assign a single role to a user, it also supports multiple roles, but you need to add a plugin to get an interface for this.) Giving a user role of Host/DJ or Producer to a user will allow them to be assigned to a Show on the Show Edit Page and allow them to edit that Show. You can also assign the Show Editor role if you have someone who needs to edit all plugin post types without being a site Administator.</p>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/widgets/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Widgets</a> you can add to your site via your <em>Appearance -&gt; Widgets</em> admin submenu. These are also available as <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shortcodes</a> and <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/widgets/#radio-station-blocks\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Blocks</a>. There are widgets for the Current Show or Playlist, and another to display Upcoming Shows. In this way you can also add a Stream Player, Radio Clock, Schedule View or Show List anywhere you like.</p>\n<p>Radio Station has several in-built <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data</a> types. These include <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/data/#custom-post-types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Post Types</a> for Shows, Schedule Overrides and Playlists. There are <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/data/#taxonomies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Taxonomies</a> for Genres and Languages. You can override most data values and display output via custom <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/filters/#data-filters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data Filters</a> throughout the plugin. We have also incorporated a <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data API</a> in the plugin available via REST and/or WordPress Feeds, and this data is accessible in JSON format.</p>\n<p>This plugin is under active development and we are continuously working to enhance the free version available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/radio-station/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.Org</a>, as well as creating new feature additions for <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Radio Station Pro</a>. Check out the <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/docs/roadmap/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Roadmap</a> if you are interested in seeing what is coming up next!</p>\n<h4>CONTRIBUTION</h4>\n<p>We are grateful to Nikki Blight for her contribution to creating and developing this plugin for as long as she could maintain the codebase. As of June 22, 2019, Radio Station is managed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/tonyzeoli/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tony Zeoli</a> with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majick/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tony Hayes</a> as lead developer and other contributing committers to the project.</p>\n<p>If you are a WordPress developer wanting to contribute to Radio Station, please join the team and follow plugin development on <a href=\"https://github.com/netmix/radio-station\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a> and submit Issues and Pull Requests there.
