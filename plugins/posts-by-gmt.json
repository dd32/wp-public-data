People who switch time zones frequently. People running a network installation of WordPress where they want to be able to aggregate posts from all their network blogs easily, and in the right order. I don&#8217;t know. I wrote it for FreeThoughtBlogs.com, so their &#8220;most recent posts&#8221; sidebar would stop showing only posts from a few blogs in early time zones. If it works for you, great.</p>\n<p>I have every hope that this plugin will be made obsolete by the default sort order being changed in the WordPress core. I can think of no good reason why comments are sorted by GMT but posts by local time.</p>\n<p>For all I know, this plugin works with older versions than 3.0.
