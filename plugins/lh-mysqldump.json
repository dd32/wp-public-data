I am a big believer in simple plugins that do one job well</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20tell%20me%20more%20about%20the%20ongoing%20backup%20feature%20%3F'>\nCan you tell me more about the ongoing backup feature ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, on a weekly basis this plugin will export the databse to a zip file and email it to the admin email address. This is done in the backgound via cron. The email address that this backup is sent to can be filtered (see the code to do so)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='any%20caveats%2C%20or%20things%20i%20should%20be%20aware%20of%3F'>\nAny caveats, or things I should be aware of?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin may not work for very large large databases and/or very poor hosting. I run it on shared hosting, exporting a database which is over 70 mb and it works fine.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Mysqldump, and all <a href=\"https://lhero.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LocalHero</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-mysqldump/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-mysqldump/</a>. I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
