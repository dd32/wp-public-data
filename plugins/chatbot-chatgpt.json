These models are trained to understand and respond to user queries in a natural, conversational manner. They&#8217;re not just chatbots; they&#8217;re intelligent conversational partners that can engage, inform, and assist your visitors in real time. Whether it&#8217;s providing detailed answers to complex queries or engaging in casual conversation, these models are equipped to elevate the user experience on your website.</p>\n<p><strong>🌟 Assistants: Tailored Conversational Experiences</strong><br />\nUnlock the potential of personalized digital interaction. Use the Assistants you develop, trained with your specific knowledge and skills, to revolutionize your website. From handling FAQs to managing bookings and offering customized suggestions, these Assistants are seamlessly integrated into your WordPress site, promising a dynamic and engaging user experience.</p>\n<p><strong>🔀 Multiple Assistants, Multiple Roles</strong><br />\nThe latest version of the plugin allows for virtually unlimited Assistants, allowing you to deploy a unique assistant wherever you placed the shortcode.  Simply pass the &#8220;asst_&#8221; ID to the shortcode as one of the parameters.  Discover more about these innovative features at <a href=\"https://kognetiks.com/wordpress-plugins/kognetiks-chatbot/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Kognetiks.com</a> and <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/assistants\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI&#8217;s Playground</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>🔄 Choose Your Style: Embedded or Floating Chatbots</strong><br />\nFlexibility is key. Display your AI-powered chatbot as an embedded feature on pages or let it float across your site. With simple shortcodes, adapt the chatbot&#8217;s presence to match your website&#8217;s design and user needs.</p>\n<p><strong>🔍 Knowledge Navigator: Unearthing Your Content&#8217;s Essence</strong><br />\nAt the heart of the plugin lies the Knowledge Navigator. This powerful tool delves deep into your website, mapping its architecture and content, enabling the chatbot to deliver precise and contextually relevant responses. Enhanced by TF-IDF analysis, the Knowledge Navigator ensures your content&#8217;s unique keywords shine through, making interactions more meaningful.</p>\n<p><strong>🗎 Conversation Logging</strong><br />\nConversation Logging in this plugin records and stores chat interactions between users and the chatbot, providing valuable insights for enhancing user experience and chatbot performance. Visit the privacy policy on the Settings Support tab for details on data handling.</p>\n<p><strong>🎭 Personalize with Custom Avatars</strong><br />\nAdd a creative touch with customizable avatars. Reflect your site&#8217;s personality through these visual companions, enhancing user engagement and adding a unique flair to your digital space.</p>\n<p><strong>📊 Direct Traffic with Customizable Buttons</strong><br />\nGuide your visitors where you want them. Customizable buttons can link directly to specific pages, forms, or contact information, facilitating smoother navigation and enhanced user engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>🤖 Tailored Audience Engagement</strong><br />\nCustomize accessibility with three audience settings: All Audiences, Logged-in Only, or Visitors Only. Additionally, control presentation to specific audiences. Whether floating or embedded, tailor the chatbot&#8217;s visibility for a seamless user experience across platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>🎭Personalized Greetings:</strong><br />\nUsers now have the option to personalize both initial and subsequent greetings for the chatbot, enhancing the user experience with a more individualized interaction. Just add any field from your _users or _usermeta table in WordPress to the Initial Greeting or Subsequent Greeting, such as: &#8220;Hello [first_name], how can I help you today?&#8221;. This can be found under Settings &gt; Kognetiks Chatbot &gt; Settings.</p>\n<p><strong>🤖Display Assistant&#8217;s Name:</strong><br />\nWe&#8217;ve introduced a feature that allows the display of the Assistant&#8217;s name, which is sourced directly from the OpenAI platform. This can be found and adjusted under Settings &gt; Kognetiks Chatbot &gt; GPT Assistants &gt; Display GPT Assistant Name.</p>\n<p><strong>🌟Support for Additional Models:</strong><br />\nOur support model range has been expanded to include not just text but also image and speech functionalities. This broadens the chatbot&#8217;s application in various interactive scenarios. You can call the Chatbot using the &#8220;model&#8221; parameter in the shortcode.</p>\n<p><strong>🌟Image Generation with DALL-E:</strong><br />\nThe chatbot is now equipped to generate images using OpenAI&#8217;s DALL-E models, offering users a new dimension of creativity and visual interaction. To generate images using the &#8220;dall-e-3&#8221; model, use the shortcode <strong>[chatbot style=embedded model=dall-e-3]</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>🔄Text-to-Speech Conversion:</strong><br />\nWith the integration of Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, the chatbot can now convert text inputs into spoken word, making it accessible for auditory communication and enhancing user engagement through speech.

If this key falls into the wrong hands, it can be misused in a variety of detrimental ways, including unauthorized usage, potential data leaks, and the improper application of AI models. It&#8217;s crucial, therefore, to implement the following protective measures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Secure key storage: Ensure your API keys are stored in a safe and secure manner.</li>\n<li>Monitor and review usage: Frequently scrutinize and evaluate the usage of your API key. OpenAI provides handy usage data and records that can assist in detecting unusual activity. For insightful usage statistics, visit <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/usage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://platform.openai.com/account/usage</a>.</li>\n<li>Establish usage limits: Initially, implement a low hard limit to ensure that if the limit is reached at any point during the month, any further requests will be denied. You can set up both hard and soft limits at <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits</a>.</li>\n<li>Regular key rotation: Frequently changing your API keys can reduce the risk of misuse. If you observe any unexpected activity, it&#8217;s important to immediately revoke your API keys. As a preventative measure, you might want to regularly revoke them to avert misuse.

If this key falls into the wrong hands, it can be misused in a variety of detrimental ways, including unauthorized usage, potential data leaks, and the improper application of AI models. It&#8217;s crucial, therefore, to implement the following protective measures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Secure key storage: Ensure your API keys are stored in a safe and secure manner.</li>\n<li>Monitor and review usage: Frequently scrutinize and evaluate the usage of your API key. OpenAI provides handy usage data and records that can assist in detecting unusual activity. For insightful usage statistics, visit <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/usage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://platform.openai.com/account/usage</a>.</li>\n<li>Establish usage limits: Initially, implement a low hard limit to ensure that if the limit is reached at any point during the month, any further requests will be denied. You can set up both hard and soft limits at <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits</a>.</li>\n<li>Regular key rotation: Frequently changing your API keys can reduce the risk of misuse. If you observe any unexpected activity, it&#8217;s important to immediately revoke your API keys. As a preventative measure, you might want to regularly revoke them to avert misuse. Manage your API keys at <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, wielding AI power requires immense responsibility — it&#8217;s incumbent upon us all to ensure its careful and secure use.</p>\n<h3>Your Journey Towards an Interactive Website Begins!</h3>\n<p>With the Kognetiks Chatbot installed, you&#8217;re now equipped to offer a more dynamic, engaging, and responsive experience to your website visitors.</p>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>OpenAI, ChatGPT, and related marks are registered trademarks of OpenAI.
