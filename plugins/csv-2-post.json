However many improvements will be done free.<br />\nPlease post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable<br />\nwithin my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system. The tasks<br />\npriority can be increased based on your WebTechGlobal subscription status, donations or contributions you have made.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I import CommissionJunction affiliate feeds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Download .csv files from Commission Junction then upload them or paste a URL directly to a .csv file on any domain to import it that way.<br />\nCommission Junction and all other affiliate networks are supported.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a limit to the number of posts I can create?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no limits others than what your server will allow you to do in a single request.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will CSV 2 POST help me with SEO?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes CSV 2 POST allows the creation of post meta (custom fields) which are used by most SEO solutions. More support can be added on<br />\nrequest for free. The plugin also offers text-spinning without limits and there is more planned on that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When was CSV 2 POST released?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The project started in 2009 and was quickly backed by large businesses including Ryanair Ltd. I created the plugin while technically still at University so<br />\nit didn&#8217;t take long for a re-development to happen. I found myself re-developing it again in 2014 with the aim of making more use of the WordPress core.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
