I was looking for a simple gallery where you can<br />\nselect a thumbnail, see the complete picture in a acceptable size but also have<br />\nthe oppertunity to see the details of the image. I searched the web for a way<br />\nto do this and found the AnythingZoomer, a jQuery Plugin by Chris Coyier. I<br />\noriginally used this jquery plugin for this WordPress plugin.</p>\n<p>In version 0.5 the plugin was completely re-written. The generated HTML is completely different, the JavaScript was re-designed and the CSS was created from scratch. Also inner zoom was introduced.</p>\n<p>It works well for e-commerce sites like webshops or as a photo gallery.</p>\n<p>It is easy to adapt if you would want to, but the default behaviour should be<br />\nvery much usable by anybody.</p>\n<p>There is a settingspage to customize the images used and wheter or not to over-<br />\nwrite the default gallery shortcode.</p>\n<p>If you want to use this gallery, simply use the [superzoomgallery] shortcode in<br />\nyour post or page, or enable the overwriting of the gallery shortcode and use<br />\nthe default wordpress [gallery] shortcode in your post or page.</p>\n<p>Since this is still an early version, I recommend to test it out first before taking<br />\nit to a production site.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or problems, I would be happy to hear from you and help<br />\nyou if I can!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Unzip and activate. There is a settingspage which allows you to select which<br />\nimage sizes you would like to use and wheter or not to use this gallery as the<br />\nmain gallery.</p>\n<p>(pro) If the default sizes of the images (thumb, medium, full) don&#8217;t look very good,<br />\nyou can add image sizes via your theme. This way you can customize the image sizes.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I change the look of the gallery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, most of style information is in szg-style.css. If you want to<br />\nchange the HTML, then look in the superzoomgalley.php for the function<br />\n&#8216;generate_gallery&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have some problems with my theme. It works great with the default theme.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hmm, possible a CSS problem. Do not hesitate to contact me on the forum!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
