        "faq": "\n<h4>How the high score works?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 0.3, the plugin can store each logged-in users high score is enabled in the settings. Previous version only keep a single high score for the site.</p>\n<p>When someone ended a game (either won or game over) and if their high score more than your site\\&#8217;s high score or their personal high score record, the game will save the new score. It is automatically saved for any logged-in users. If you enable to allow guest users to submit high score, an email field will appear to them before the score submission. The email address is required to notify them of new high score updates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Tips on using custom image for tiles</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Minimum image dimension is 107px width and height. The game tiles resizes to 58px on smaller screens. Recommended to use a perfect square image. The plugin will force your image to appear in perfect square anyway. Do not use transparent PNGs as you will see overlapping image tiles when merging tiles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How the use the custom shortcode generator?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the <em>Custom Features</em> tab of plugin settings page, make the changes you wanted to customized colors, tiles text and font size, or using image as tiles. Check or uncheck the <em>Enabled Features</em> as required. Without saving the changes, click the <strong>Generate</strong> button and a textarea will be shown with the custom shortcode. Copy the shortcode and paste it on your page or post. Publish/save it to see the game in custom appearances.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it work if I insert the shortcode into text widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, technically it will work. Depends on your theme, your widget width may not fit the game board thus may cause unexpected result. It is always recommended to have the game board on its own page or post.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
