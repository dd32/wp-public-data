With powerful features that are effortlessly accessible, it&#8217;s user-friendly for those new to web application security. The 1-Click Setup simplifies complex settings, instantly blocking most malicious traffic. Whether you&#8217;re a novice or a guru, GENIUS PLUGIN Firewall ensures seamless website security, letting you focus on your tasks.</p>\n<h4>N°1 Saas Multi-Cloud WAF</h4>\n<p>Our Firewall is like no other. No need for complex server, proxy, or DNS changes, or a solution hosted on the same server (vulnerable to exploitation). Genius Plugin is a SaaS and multi-cloud firewall. It’s not hosted on your website, nor is it just a cloud solution or dependent on complex DNS or server settings. It does not relay on a single cloud provider. It’s multi-cloud, powerful yet easy to use. It’s as if it’s omnipresent yet elusive.</p>\n<h4>Mobile Dashboard</h4>\n<p>Accessible from anywhere, anytime, our mobile dashboard offers easy monitoring and adjustment of settings and security rules. With your world cyber-security map and history panel, keep track of live access from legitimate users, administrators, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.</p>\n<h4>Website Firewall Privacy Revolution</h4>\n<p>With traditional CDN/DNS website firewalls, the provider has the capability to inspect and manipulate all your data passing through the firewall, including sensitive information like passwords, client details, invoices, and emails. Users typically can just try to rely on the trustworthiness and integrity of the WAF provider. We are the FIRST solution to offer unparalleled granular user control over data transmission by allowing transparent and direct filtering of each POST and HEADER variable within the plugin code, in addition to allowing users to selectively activate or deactivate the transmission of various data types, such as POST, HEADER, SESSION ID.</p>\n<h4>Simple Access Sharing</h4>\n<p>Token-based authentication simplifies access management to the admin website side (backoffice) by providing administrators with unique links instead of complex keys. These links grant quick and secure access to sensitive resources without requiring static IPs, dedicated VPNs, or direct access to the firewall dashboard. This approach streamlines access distribution, allowing for easy sharing, revocation, and renewal of access privileges as needed.</p>\n<h4>Free for all</h4>\n<p>Our commitment to democratizing website security is unwavering. We not only strive to provide free firewall protection to as many sites as possible but also offer our Pro plan free of charge for at least one year to non-profit organizations in need of securing their websites. Despite the significant costs involved, we’re continually expanding our server nodes globally to serve more website owners effectively. Our goal is to increase the percentage of secured websites from the current 83% and combat the surge in cybercrime, which has risen by 600% since the start of the pandemic.</p>\n<h4>IP Behavior Monitoring</h4>\n<p>GP Website Security Firewall actively monitors millions of IP behaviors, allowing you to restrict access based on country, network, single IP, VPN, proxy, Tor, relay, and IPs with a bad reputation. Ensure risk-free access for search engines and well-known websites.</p>\n<h4>Groundbreaking Protection Features</h4>\n<p>Experience groundbreaking and exclusive protection features worldwide: Safeguard precisely the data you choose, ensuring the security of your sensitive information without sharing it. Our cloud firewall operates seamlessly without requiring changes to your domain&#8217;s DNS or hosting it with us.</p>\n<p>About 50 Features:<br />\nAutomatic Traffic Filtering<br />\nEnhanced Privacy and Data Protection<br />\nCustom Firewall Rules<br />\nPage Requests Rate Limiting by Time<br />\nSearch Engines Whitelisting/Blacklisting<br />\nHost Whitelisting/Blacklisting<br />\nReal-Time Traffic Monitoring<br />\nSecurity Notifications/Alerts<br />\nSecurity Analytics/Reporting<br />\nLive World Cyber Attack Map<br />\n&#8230;and much more</p>\n<p>For those interested in exploring all features in detail, they can visit this link. https://www.geniusplugin.com/features/</p>\n<h3>Genius Plugin Firewall Service</h3>\n<p>Genius Plugin Firewall leverages a powerful Multi-Cloud Software as a Service (SAAS) platform to enhance the security of your WordPress website.

It serves as a comprehensive overview, allowing users to understand the overall picture of their web traffic and take necessary measures to ensure the security and stability of their online presence.</p>\n<h4>Captcha human challenge</h4>\n<p>This function can be enabled for visitors which are about to be denied access by your ruleset, but still you give them a chance to visit your website, only if they have not tried to cross your website firewall &#8220;red lines&#8221;. CAPTCHAs are used to weed out bots with a test meant to be easy for humans and hard for bots. We use hCaptcha as it’s the only one with privacy focus and complies with GDPR, LGPD, PIPL, CCPA.

This is one of the red lines you can trace, so that malicious behaviors are ambushed.<br />\nHow many times a visitor can try to access pages that does not exist, or that you don’t want him to access to, before you ban him temporarily?<br />\nHow many times a visitor attempts to make bad requests, you previously determined as being bad requests, for example, because the url address contains prohibited words or requests, before he is denied access?<br />\nWhat is the ultimate number of bad behaviour records, beyond which, the visitor is &#8220;killed&#8221; permanently?<br />\nWe made red lines ambush so fast and easy to use, yet so powerful, that you will enjoy seeing malicious persons and robots fell into ambushes.</p>\n<h4>Data Privacy and Encryption</h4>\n<p>The Website Firewall is specifically crafted to prioritize privacy, confidentiality, and data protection, offering an array of features and actions to secure sensitive information.<br />\nContrary to the majority of competitors, clients maintain control over the data sent from the WAF setting console (dashboard) and the plugin code before actual transmission, distinguishing Genius Plugin from its counterparts. Users can selectively activate or deactivate the transmission of various data types, such as POST content, often containing sensitive information. Additionally, they have the ability to enable or disable the sending of HEADER data associated with each request, along with the option to activate or deactivate user intelligence tracking.<br />\nGenius Plugin stands out as the first Firewall providing the capability to transparently and directly filter each POST and HEADER variable within the plugin code, offering unparalleled granular user control over the data sent to the firewall.<br />\nTo ensure privacy compliance, we leverage hCaptcha as the human challenge system. hCaptcha adheres to privacy-focused regulations such as GDPR, LGPD, PIPL, and CCPA, assuring the protection of user data.

For more information about its terms of use and privacy policies, please visit respectively https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy and https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms.<br />\nA pivotal privacy-enhancing measure is that GP Firewall does not retain any POST, HEADER, or user tracking intelligence data. It analyzes the data on the fly, storing only the visitor&#8217;s IP and the URL request, minimizing the risk of data exposure. Only a few essential fragments of attacks are retained to empower users to enhance their website protection.</p>\n<p>In an additional layer of data safeguarding, rulesets, which may contain fragments of visitor data (IP &amp; URL), are not retained for more than 60 days. This ensures that potentially sensitive information is not stored longer than necessary.<br />\nPlease visit our <a href=\"https://www.geniusplugin.com/privacy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a></p>\n<h4>Beyond the crucials</h4>\n<p>3 crucials facts about firewalls:<br />\n• A website or service protected by a firewall, where the entire code is open and hosted on your website, can be easely analyzed. However, this approach may be vulnerable, as hackers may have already bypassed the code, or it may have limited capabilities due to resource consumption&#8230; logic!<br />\n• If you rely on a WAF solution that requires you to use a CDN or change your domain nameservers, you could be sending sensitive information such as passwords, client details, invoices, and emails, and relying solely on the trustworthiness and integrity of the WAF provider.<br />\n• Security experts shun CDNs as firewalls due to various risks. Avoid being misled by marketing tactics and try to google &#8220;public cdn risks&#8221; for more details.</p>\n<h4>Service Terms of Use</h4>\n<p>Please visit our <a href=\"https://www.geniusplugin.com/terms/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Use</a> for detailed information about the terms and conditions.</p>\n",
