It also includes an image editor that can modify images by using AI-based technology to add or change elements in the image, both for images that were previously AI generated and for non-AI photos and graphics that you upload to your media library. This plugin brings the power of similar tools like <strong>Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 2, and Midjourney</strong> and integrates seamlessly with your WordPress websites. For more on <strong>editing existing images with AI</strong>, see <a href=\"https://wpzone.co/blog/how-to-improve-your-ai-generated-images-and-edit-photos-with-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>The AI Image Lab plugin works with nearly every editor and page builder (like Divi, Elementor)  that integrates with the default WordPress media picker for image selection, including the <strong>block editor (Gutenberg, Kadence Blocks, etc.), the classic editor, and <a href=\"https://wpzone.co/blog/generate-photos-and-artwork-in-the-divi-builder-with-our-free-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the Divi builder</a></strong>. It also includes a <strong>Gutenberg block</strong> for seamless image generation within the WordPress block editor that can transform to various core blocks and Kadence Blocks after a generated image is selected.</p>\n<h3>100% free</h3>\n<p>Our baseline service is <strong>100% free to use, with unlimited image previews (within reasonable limits!) and up to 3 downloaded images per day, no paid third-party API keys required!</strong> Once your download quota is used up, you&#8217;ll need to wait until the current 24 hour quota period has passed before you can generate more previews. <a href=\"https://wpzone.co/product/ai-image-generator-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrading to AI Image Lab Pro</a> removes the 3 image download limit, supports higher output resolution, and more!</p>\n<p>The plugin needs to be connected to a WP Zone account before it can start sending requests to the AI. Signing up for an account is free if you don&#8217;t have one yet!</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h4>Free version</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg) and other popular page builders</li>\n<li>Includes a Gutenberg block for AI Image generation with transform compatibility to various core blocks and Kadence Blocks</li>\n<li>Unlimited AI image previews per day (within reasonable limits)</li>\n<li>6 preview images per generation request</li>\n<li>3 image downloads per 24-hour quota period</li>\n<li>Up to 768&#215;768 resolution with a variety of aspect ratios</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pro version</h4>\n<p>Everything in free, plus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited image downloads (within reasonable limits)</li>\n<li>10 preview images per generation request</li>\n<li>Up to 2048&#215;2048 resolution with a variety of aspect ratios</li>\n<li>Preview images do not have visible watermarks</li>\n<li>Image generation requests are prioritized over free requests</li>\n<li>Premium technical support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpzone.co/product/ai-image-generator-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Purchase an AI Image Lab Pro plan on our website!</a></p>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>AI Image Lab generates custom graphics based on text you enter to describe the images you are looking for (known as a &#8220;prompt&#8221;). You can provide one or more prompt phrases (or choose from some provided examples), which <strong>play an important role in the quality and usefulness of the output image</strong>. You can also specify some additional parameters related to the style and specifications of the image you want to create. Style types include Photo, Painting, Illustration, and Digital Art, each of which has multiple sub-options to further refine the type of image to be generated.</p>\n<p>Each time you run a prompt, you&#8217;ll get six images to preview and choose from (or 10 images if you have <a href=\"https://wpzone.co/product/ai-image-generator-lab/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AI Image Lab Pro</a>. In the free version, these previews have watermarks, but <strong>the visible watermarks are removed when you choose an image to download to your site</strong>. The plugin allows you to select an image to automatically add to your media library for use on your site. Running the generation process again provides a new set of preview images.</p>\n<h3>Known issues and limitations</h3>\n<p>AI image generation is still an emerging technology and <strong>it is not perfect</strong>. There are some things it struggles with, such as human faces and features (especially for images with multiple people) and images containing text. You can generate multiple sets of images until you receive a suitable image, or use the built-in AI image editor to improve generated images.</p>\n<h3>Important Notice</h3>\n<p>The AI Image Lab plugin makes requests to using the AI Image Lab API, which is an external service provided by WP Zone (https://wpzone.co). You will need to set up a free account with WP Zone in order to use the service. Use of the service is subject to the terms and conditions displayed on the plugin admin page, and any other applicable terms and policies that may be published on the WP Zone website from time to time.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>To help you get the most out of our plugin, we offer a comprehensive documentation that contains step-by-step instructions for installation and usage.
