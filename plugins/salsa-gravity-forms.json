Follow this knowlege base article for detailed instructions</p>\n<p>https://help.salsalabs.com/entries/23473682-Where-s-my-organization-key-</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What level of access does the Salsa credentials need to be?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to use the Salsa API you must add super user credentials for your Salsa instance. This is a super user, campaign manager account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add groups?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add groups by dragging the group field from the standard fields list into your gravity forms, or you can map groups to checkboxes or dropdown field items by using the appropriate gravity forms group item.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I map fields?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You map fields at the field level, simply edit the field, and select the appropriate Salsa element that your field matches to, for example First Name would map to f_name in the list, if you do not map fields, then no data will flow into salsa.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>No data is going into salsa, what gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You likely forgot to enable Salsa for the form. There is a Salsa form option dropdown at the form level with a single checkbox that tells the form, this is a salsa form and it should transmit mapped fields and data to salsa.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
