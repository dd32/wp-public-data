So if you&#8217;d like content that can only be seen by users with the &#8220;editor&#8221; role, you would use: [isAdmin roles=&#8221;editor&#8221;][/isAdmin].</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20specify%20more%20than%20one%20role%3F'>\nCan I specify more than one role?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just provide a comma-separated list to the <em>roles</em> attribute. For example: [isAdmin roles=&#8221;editor,administrator&#8221;][/isAdmin]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20%2Arole%2A%20and%20%2Aroles%2A%20attributes%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between the *role* and *roles* attributes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no difference; both are available as a convenience as I expected that if I wanted to change it I wouldn&#8217;t remember if I needed it to be plural or not and it would seem<br />\nodd to specify a plural attribute for a singular condition (and vice versa.) Basically, choose one or the other (if you want something other than checking for administrator) and<br />\nit will work as expected. If you specify both, then the <em>roles</em> attribute takes precedence unless you set it to the default, in which case it will use the <em>role</em> attribute.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
