The button label, colour, position is configurable from the plugin settings page.</p>\n<p>The plugin also provides the option to add the request form to an existing WordPress page instead of opening a lightbox, if preferred.

Note: you need this code if using lightbox mode (default). If &#8220;<code>Display mode</code>&#8221; is set to use an existing page, adding the button code is optional.</li>\n<li>Make any required CSS and style modifications to meet your needs.</li>\n<li>Test and enjoy ðŸ™‚</li>\n</ol>\n",

If emails aren&#8217;t sending and your email address has been configured in the plugin options, it is likely that your entire WordPress site is unable to send emails. This could be due to an incorrectly set up mail server, or emails getting lost in your spam folders.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still having trouble then you will have to get in contact with your server host.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want to use the lightbox, how do I add the request form to an existing WordPress page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In plugin settings &#8220;<code>Settings &gt; Request Call Back</code>&#8220;, scroll down and set &#8220;<code>Display mode</code>&#8221; to &#8220;<code>Display form on an existing page</code>&#8220;, then select the page you want to attach it to.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
