This can be useful, for example, with events that have associated dates in the future. Such future posts can, with this plugin, be displayed, both individually and in archive lists. This plugin also adds functionality to the built-in calendar widget.

For example: &#8220;http://example.com/?cat=7&amp;future=true&#8221; or &#8220;http://example.com/blog/2013/?future=true&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alternatively (and easier in many cases), in the menu editor, select &#8220;Display only future posts&#8221; for any category pages in your menu structure.</p>\n<p>This displays all future posts in ascending order of date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to display both past and future posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On your page call, set the variable &#8216;future&#8217; to all. For example: &#8220;http://example.com/?cat=7&amp;future=all&#8221; or &#8220;http://example.com/blog/2013/?future=all&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alternatively (and easier in many cases), in the menu editor, select &#8220;Display both past and future posts&#8221; for any category pages in your menu structure.</p>\n<p>This displays all posts (both published and scheduled) in descending order of date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want my WordPress calendar widget to display my future/scheduled posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin modifies the WordPress calendar widget so it now has a checkbox to &#8220;Include Future Posts.&#8221; Simply check this box and the calendar will display all posts, including future/scheduled posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I only want future posts from one category to show up in my calendar. How do I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With this plugin, the WordPress calendar widget also has a dropdown box to select a single category. You can select a category with or without checking the &#8220;Include Future Posts&#8221; option, and the calendar will limit the posts it shows to this category.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
