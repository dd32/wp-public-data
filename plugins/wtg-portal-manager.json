There is nothing wrong with skipping versions if changes do not<br />\nhelp you &#8211; look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want<br />\nto avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version &#8211; do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation<br />\n(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different<br />\nenvironment for WTG Task Manager &#8211; possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common<br />\nin software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Please install WTG Portal Manager from WordPress.org by going to Plugins &#8211;&gt; Add New and searching &#8220;WTG Portal Manager&#8221;. This is safer and quicker than any other methods.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why does portal does not display my chosen custom sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your theme may not support dynamic sidebars. The theme author may need to add the dynamic_sidebar() function<br />\nto the sidebar.php file in your themes folder. See more information here:<br />\nhttps://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/dynamic_sidebar</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I display multiple custom/dynamic sidebars in one portal?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; it is possible but I may need to add support for your theme. It depends on the custom ID values being passed<br />\nto the dynamic_sidebar() function. Adding support for your theme will not take long at all so please drop a comment in the plugins<br />\nforum.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>As a WebTechGlobal subscriber can I get higher priority support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; subscribers are put ahead of my Free Workflow and will not only result in a quicker response for support<br />\nbut requests for new features are marked with higher priority.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I hire you to customize the plugin for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; you can pay to improve the plugin to suit your needs. However many improvements will be done free.<br />\nPlease post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable<br />\nwithin my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system. The tasks<br />\npriority can be increased based on your WebTechGlobal subscription status, donations or contributions you have made.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Did WTG Portal Manager change one of my posts sidebars that I already set manually?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I added this FAQ while creating the plugin because I&#8217;m allowing it to force a change to sidebar<br />\nthat may have been done manually. Some users will want this but I&#8217;m ready to work with the users<br />\nwho want something else. If you selected a special sidebar for your post/page manually on the Edit Post<br />\nscreen. You may find that it is changed by WTG Portal Manager if you then assign that post or page to<br />\na portal with a different main sidebar set. This scenario would indicate that you want/need the post to<br />\ndisplay widgets from two different sidebars. There may be a solution so please raise your situation on<br />\nthe plugins forums.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
