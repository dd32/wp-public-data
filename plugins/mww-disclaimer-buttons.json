We have included the 3 most frequently used disclaimers: Affiliate Links, PR Sample, and Sponsored.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20how%20the%20buttons%20look%3F'>\nCan I modify how the buttons look?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We have added an option to update the button color, text color, and padding in the settings. If you want to modify any other style, just update buttons.css in the plugin’s directory.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20put%20the%20buttons%20somewhere%20else%2C%20like%20at%20the%20bottom%20of%20the%20post%3F'>\nCan I put the buttons somewhere else, like at the bottom of the post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. FTC regulations state that they must be at the top of the post. The best place for the buttons are at the top of the post text. I didn’t have them attached to the post meta (date/author), because some themes allow you to hide those elements.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20create%20a%20full%20disclaimer%20page%3F'>\nDo I have to create a full disclaimer page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission requires that you link to a page that fully describes your various relationships and compensation for posts.
