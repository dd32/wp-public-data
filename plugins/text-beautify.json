        "description": "<p>This plugin will automatically parse through the contents of each blog post and/or comment when displayed and look for bad casing and other common grammatical/aesthetic faux pas, like sloppy punctuation.

Double and single quotation marks, as well as commas, are automatically made into their attractive curly form. You can also provide a custom list of tweaks you&#8217;d like the plugin to make, such as uppercasing select words or disabling some of the plugin&#8217;s default replacements.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the following text as a comment&#8217;s contents:<br />\n  AMAZING!!!!! THIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING STORY AND I KNOW MY FRIEND,, DR.

This is such an amazing story and I know my friend, Dr. Bobby would think so too&#8230; Don&#8217;t you agree?!</p>\n<p>The full feature list is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use proper sentence casing instead of all capitals in comments and post body</li>\n<li>Capitalize each word in blog titles except for user-editable list of exceptions</li>\n<li>Remove user-editable list of excessive punctuation; by default: exclamation marks, question marks, asterisks, commas</li>\n<li>Replace standard quotation marks, apostrophes, and commas with their curly equivalents</li>\n<li>Preserve case (in blog posts, blog titles, and comments) of user-editable list of terms</li>\n<li>Execute user-editable list of specific string replacements (in blog posts, blog titles, and comments)</li>\n</ul>\n",

You can enable or disable the plugin on each of blog contents, blog titles, and comments.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will the blog title capitalization override my custom uppercase terms?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. You customizations will always take precedence over any of the default text processing.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Thanks to James Burnby who alerted me to this issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin will now automatically leave any text contained within square brackets untouched. Example: if [some plugin=&#8221;CODE&#8221;] is in your body of text, it will be passed through as-is. This is because it&#8217;s very common for other WordPress plugins to use such special bracket tags to do their own special processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modified and corrected the way the new disabling of automatic case manipulation is processed; some automatic case adjustment was still executing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Forcing new default options to be merged into existing options upon upgrade</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed warning message on line 291</li>\n<li>Added default case preservation for days of week, full month names, and short month names</li>\n<li>Added ability to disable automatic case manipulation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrected preg_match_all bug with invalid starting delimiter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fixes in plugin package</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed handling of URL and HTML entity strings</li>\n<li>Allowed for compatibility with &lt;!&#8211;start_raw&#8211;&gt;&lt;!&#8211;end_raw&#8211;&gt; tags</li>\n<li>Better processing of multi-line HTML tags</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
