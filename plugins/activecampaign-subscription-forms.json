        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20activecampaign%20subscription%20forms%20to%20use%20in%20wordpress%3F'>\nHow do I create ActiveCampaign subscription forms to use in WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to be using <a href=\"http://www.activecampaign.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ActiveCampaign email marketing platform</a> to use this widget. Create new subscription forms in the platform by going to the &#8220;Integration&#8221; section, then they will be available through this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20differ%20from%20copying%20and%20pasting%20the%20subscription%20form%20onto%20my%20site%20manually%3F'>\nHow does this plugin differ from copying and pasting the subscription form onto my site manually?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin makes it much easier to do without requiring you to know which theme (or core WordPress) files to modify. Also, copying and pasting HTML into WordPress can often cause odd display issues (depending on your WordPress theme).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20after%20someone%20submits%20the%20subscription%20form%20on%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nWhat happens after someone submits the subscription form on my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The same thing that would happen if they submitted it from another site: it redirects back to the ActiveCampaign confirmation message, or a custom URL if you have that set up for the subscription form in ActiveCampaign (modify your forms under the &#8220;Integration&#8221; section).</p>\n<p>If you enable the &#8220;Ajax&#8221; option of the plugin settings, you can have the form submitted without the page reloading (so the viewer never leaves the page).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20my%20form%20require%20an%20opt-in%20email%20confirmation%20be%20sent%3F'>\nCan my form require an opt-in email confirmation be sent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you would just make sure that your form settings (in ActiveCampaign) have the Opt-in confirmation setting checked.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20live%20chat%20work%3F'>\nHow does live chat work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Live chat is a feature of Conversations, an add-on available to ActiveCampaign users that enables multi-channel communication with your customers through a unified inbox. To activate live chat for your WordPress website you must first start a trial or purchase Conversations. Learn more <a href=\"https://www.activecampaign.com/customer-messaging/conversations\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20will%20i%20know%20i%20have%20received%20a%20live%20chat%20message%20from%20a%20visitor%3F'>\nHow will I know I have received a live chat message from a visitor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All live chat messages will display in the Conversations inbox in your ActiveCampaign account. You can receive desktop and audio notifications when the messages are received, or use our Conversations mobile app (available for iOS and Android) to get push notifications on your phone and respond on the go.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20a%20%22connection%20failed%22%20message.%20what%20does%20this%20mean%3F'>\nI get a &#8220;Connection failed&#8221; message. What does this mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure that your login information is correct, and that you have at least one Integration form already created in the ActiveCampaign system.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20activecampaign%20send%20transactional%20emails%20for%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nCan ActiveCampaign send transactional emails for my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://postmarkapp.com/?utm_source=activecampaign&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=activecampaign_wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ActiveCampaign Postmark</a> — that’s ActiveCampaign’s transactional email provider — you can make sure your transactional emails (including password reset emails, form notifications, or account setup emails) are getting delivered, every time. With WordPress’ default mailer, crucial transactional emails often end up in the spam folder or aren’t delivered at all. With Postmark, deliverability issues are a thing of the past. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmark-approved-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">Learn more about Postmark for WordPress <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span></a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
