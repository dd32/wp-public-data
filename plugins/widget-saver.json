Layout choice is now a manual step since it is possible to save multiple widget layouts for a given theme.<br />\nOnce a theme has been activated, use the &#8220;Layouts&#8221; drop-down to select a previously saved layout that matches the<br />\ncurrent theme.</p>\n<p>The reset button has been removed as it was too easy to remove all widgets with one click.</p>\n<h4>Typical Usage</h4>\n<p>This plugin is useful for trying different widget layouts, making it easy to revert back to a previous layout if the<br />\ncurrent layout is not working. It can also be useful when switching between themes. Different themes will offer different<br />\nsidebar areas, and often there is not a direct mapping from one theme&#8217;s sidebars to another. This plugin can be used<br />\nto save a widget layout for each theme. When the themes are switched, the appropriate widget layout can then be restored<br />\nsaving the time it usually takes to drag each widget from an inactive sidebar into the correct sidebar.</p>\n<p>A typical process would be as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type your own layout name into the text field, and click &#8220;Add&#8221; to add and save the current widget layout. This name<br />\nis now available in the &#8220;Layouts&#8221; drop-down.</li>\n<li>Rearrange the widgets, move them to different sidebars, or move them into the inactive widgets box.</li>\n<li>Type a new layout name, and click &#8220;Add&#8221; to add a second widget layout.</li>\n<li>Select the layout name you created in step 1 from the drop-down, and click &#8220;Restore&#8221;. Your widgets will be<br />\nrepositioned to match this layout.</li>\n<li>Select your layout name from step 3, and click &#8220;Restore&#8221;. Your widgets will now be repositioned to match your<br />\nsecond layout.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install and activate the plugin as usual.</li>\n<li>Go to Appearance &#8211; Widgets, the add, save, restore and delete buttons should now be available at the top of the page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that there are no plugin-specific settings, all configuration is done via the widget configuration page.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Is widget content saved</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Only widget layout is saved. Widget layout is the widget&#8217;s sidebar location, as well as its order within the sidebar.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I removed a widget from a sidebar, and now it is not being restored</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Widgets that are deleted can not be restored because widget content/settings are not saved. Dragging a widget back into<br />\nthe &#8220;Available Widgets&#8221; area effectively deletes the widget. In order to remove a widget<br />\nfrom view, but keep its content, drag it into the &#8220;Inactive Widgets&#8221; area. This will ensure that the widget &#8216;instance&#8217;<br />\nis not deleted, and can be restored in different layouts.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
