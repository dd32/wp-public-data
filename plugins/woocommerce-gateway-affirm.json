        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To<br />\nautomatically install WooCommerce Gateway Affirm, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click <strong>Add New</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;WooCommerce Gateway Affirm&#8221; and click <strong>Search Plugins</strong>. Once you&#8217;ve found our plugin you can install it by clicking <strong>Install Now</strong>, as well as view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",

Go to: WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Currency.</li>\n<li>Customers have a U.S.-based billing address to use Affirm.</li>\n<li>SSL is enabled.</li>\n<li>Your site is in Live (not Test) mode.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='nothing%20happens%20when%20customer%20attempts%20to%20pay%20with%20affirm.'>\nNothing happens when customer attempts to pay with Affirm.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This error may be caused by non-standard/poorly coded themes and JavaScript (JS) issues. Common issues include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript errors on checkout page – To view the error, open your browser error console (in Chrome: View &gt; developer &gt; JavaScript console) and look for red errors. This should indicate where the error is located and lead you to the problem, e.g., Loading jQuery incorrectly</li>\n<li>Failing to load scripts – Affirm loads JavaScript which it needs to function. If these are not loaded, you will see errors. Most common reasons are:\n<ul>\n<li>Theme is missing wp_head() or wp_footer() calls.</li>\n<li>Old overridden template files from WooCommerce inside your theme.</li>\n<li>Loading headers/footers in a non-standard way. WooCommerce uses get_header()’s get_header action to init the checkout and load scripts. If you are not using get_header() you either need to do so, or you need to trigger the get_header action manually using: do_action( ‘get_header ); in your custom header loader.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20override%20templates%20on%20the%20affirm%20pages%3F'>\nIs it possible to override templates on the Affirm pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. These are fixed/static pages from Affirm.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20the%20enhanced%20analytics%20box%20be%20unticked%3F'>\nWhy should the Enhanced Analytics box be unticked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time the feature is inactive on stores.
