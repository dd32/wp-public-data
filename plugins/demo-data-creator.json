ONLY USE THIS PLUGIN ON A SITE WHERE YOU KNOW THE DATABASE CAN BE WIPED.</p>\n<p>If you develop WordPress websites it&#8217;s useful to have some demo data in your system while it&#8217;s being built. This allows you to check that lists of things are displaying as they should, and that themes are working when they get data in them.</p>\n<p>Historically it&#8217;s been a pain to add that data in. Either you need to take a backup of another site and use that data, or you need to tediously create multiple users and blogs yourself. No more, not now my Demo Data Creator is in town!</p>\n<p>This WordPress, WPMU/MultiSite and BuddyPress plugin gives you a new admin screen where you can enter some parameters, click a button and (after a short wait) random demo data will be created. The parameter options include:</p>\n<pre><code>* Number of users to create\n* Number of blogs per user (for WPMU/MultiSite)\n* Whether users must have a blog\n* Number of categories in each blog\n* Number of posts in each blog\n* Number of paragraphs in each blog post\n* Number of pages in each blog\n* Number of top-level pages\n* Number of levels to nest pages\n* Number of comments per post for each blog\n* Number of links in blogroll for each blog\n</code></pre>\n<p>For BuddyPress you also have:</p>\n<pre><code>* Number of groups\n* Number of members per group\n* Number of wire posts for each group\n* Number of friends per user\n* Number of statuses for each user\n* Number of wire posts for each user\n</code></pre>\n<p>Post content and comment text is automatically generated from Lorem ipsum text, for post content it&#8217;s even HTML-formatted.</p>\n<p>Thanks to derscheinwelt for the suggestion and code to create random dates for posts, and Steve at http://slipfire.com/ for the wp_insert_user() code.</p>\n",

Activate from the plugin admin screen.</p>\n<p>You can find the Demo Data Creator admin menu option in the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu. If you are using WordPress MultiSite (version 3.0 or above) you can find the Demo Data Creator admin menu option in the &#8220;Super Admin&#8221; menu.</p>\n<p>If using WPMU (NOT WordPress 3.0 MultiSite): The plugin should be placed in your /wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory (<em>not</em> /wp-content/plugins/) and requires no activation. So the path to the file should be /wp-content/mu-plugins/demodata.php. Access the form from the &#8220;Site Admin&#8221; menu in the Dashboard.</p>\n",
