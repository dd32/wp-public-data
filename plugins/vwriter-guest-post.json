You can use the plugin for as many blogs as you want. <em>Please ensure you authorize your blog in this way to use the plugin &#8211; otherwise other bloggers won&#8217;t be able to request a version of your blog post.</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Via <em>Settings &gt; vWriter Guest Post</em> again, you can set the Scope &#8211; this allows you to choose whether to add the guest post link to all your posts, or not.

        "faq": "\n<h4>How Do I Know The Guest Post Requests Are Genuine?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Requests can only come through from blogs you have authorized and registered with us via your <a href=\"https://clients.vwriter.com/login.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">vWriter.com account</a> (<a href=\"https://clients.vwriter.com/register.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bloggers have to verify ownership of the blog on which they intend to publish your Guest Post &#8211; this is quick and simple, ensures the requests are genuine, and helps prevent time wasters and tyre kickers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>You decide whether to authorize the request or not &#8211; you remain in complete control.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Who Pays For The Guest Post Content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You pay for the original post to be rewritten by a professional writer, enabling the whole process to be quick, simple and pain free. For a small investment in the content, you get invaluable links to your site, and all the other benefits guest posting gives you.</p>\n<p>For the prospective publisher, it is completely free &#8211; this means you attract the maximum amount of interest and potential links for your site. You also maintain full control over which blogs publish your content, by choosing which Guest Post requests to approve.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s Wrong With Traditional Guest Posting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with traditional guest posting, and it&#8217;s widely recognized as one of the most powerful online marketing strategies you can use.</p>\n<p>However, for all the benefit, it is also recognized as requiring a lot of time and hard work both finding suitable blogs which may accept your guest posts, and then attempting to build a relationship with the blog owner so that they may at some point accept a Guest Post from you.</p>\n<p>vWriter.com&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.vwriter.com/guestpostplugin.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Guest Post Plugin</a> gives you a far more time-efficient and easy solution, with the whole process largely automated for you &#8230; it&#8217;s a no-brainer for any business owner who has a blog and wants all the advantages of guest posting, but without all the usual hassles and hard work.</p>\n<p>That said, there&#8217;s no reason why you can&#8217;t do traditional guest posting as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is It &#8216;Google-Safe&#8217;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not only safe, it&#8217;s highly beneficial, recommended, and fully in line with Google&#8217;s guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You&#8217;re not paying for any links, which is against their Webmaster Guidelines &#8211; you&#8217;re simply providing a unique, professionally-written Guest Post for an individual blogger to publish.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s not part of any automated link building scheme, which again is against their Webmaster Guidelines &#8230; the links build up gradually and completely naturally. The plugin simply allows you to attract suitable blogs which you can then Guest Post on in an individualized way, giving you exactly the type of link building Google encourages and recommends.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The links you get back will be mostly from sites within your own industry, and therefore highly relevant and of high value &#8230; ultimately it&#8217;s completely up to you to decide which blogs you want to Guest Post on and link back to your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your links will come from high quality content, written by professional writers, on quality blogs you approve of &#8211; you maintain full control at all times.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, there are no gimmicks or shady SEO practices involved, it&#8217;s all completely above board and in line with practices Google approves of and recommends. The links you get back are exactly the type of links Google and other search engines want to see in determining the value of your site and ranking it accordingly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What If I Don&#8217;t Have A Blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, if you don&#8217;t have a blog, you not only won&#8217;t be able to use this plugin, but you are also missing out on what could be an extremely effective marketing strategy for your website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.vwriter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Content marketing</a> is one of the most effective forms of online marketing, and having your own blog where you can publish your own content on a regular basis to inspire, inform and educate your community is central to that, including allowing you to tap more effectively into social media channels.</p>\n<p>Of course, you don&#8217;t have to create all the content yourself &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.vwriter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">vWriter.com</a> can help create all that content for you on a regular, ongoing basis.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Can I Be Sure The Blogger Will Publish The Content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have approved the content that&#8217;s been written for the Guest Post, the blogger (i.e. the prospective publisher) is immediately notified and provided with the content ready for them to publish on their blog.</p>\n<p>They are requested to publish your Guest Post on their blog and notify us accordingly (by providing us with the link) within thirty days.</p>\n<p>We automatically send them helpful reminders during this time at appropriate intervals to ensure they don&#8217;t forget to do so.</p>\n<p>As soon as we are notified of publication, we&#8217;ll send you the link so you can see your published Guest Post!</p>\n<p>In the rare occurrence that they fail to publish it, their right to do so is revoked, we let them know accordingly, and they may be prevented from making further requests.</p>\n<p>We then reserve the Guest Post content in your vWriter.com account so it is available to immediately supply a future Guest Post request for the same original post on your blog. Alternatively, you can choose to release the content and have it available for your own purposes if you wish.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
