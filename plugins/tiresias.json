        "installation": "<p>Before proceeding please make sure that you are running WordPress 3.5 or above and WooCommerce 2.0.0 or above.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the WordPress documentation on how to get the plugin to appear in your installation admin section.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin appears in your installation, you must activate it. Navigate to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; section and locate the<br />\n&#8220;WooCommerce Tiresias Tagging&#8221; plugin. The activation is done simply by clicking the &#8220;Activate&#8221; link next to the plugin<br />\nname in the list.</p>\n<p>The activation procedure will create a new page called &#8220;Top Sellers&#8221;. This page can be found and edited under the<br />\n&#8220;Pages&#8221; section in the backend. The page contains a single div element that is used to show product recommendations. A<br />\nlink to the page should appear in the shops main navigation menu.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses the WordPress Action API to add content to the shop. However, there are a few actions that will have to<br />\nbe added to the shops theme in order for the plugin to function to its full extent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wcnt_before_search_result\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called above the search result list on the on search pages</li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_before_search_result'); ?&gt;</code> in your themes search page template at the<br />\nappropriate location</li>\n<li>Please note that this only applies to the WordPress search and not the WooCommerce search\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using the WooCommerce search, you do not need to add any actions to the templates</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>wcnt_after_search_result\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called below the search result list on the on search pages</li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_after_search_result'); ?&gt;</code> in your themes search page template at the<br />\nappropriate location</li>\n<li>Please note that this only applies to the WordPress search and not the WooCommerce search\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using the WooCommerce search, you do not need to add any actions to the templates</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>wcnt_before_main_content\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called at the beginning of every page in the shop</li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_before_main_content'); ?&gt;</code> in your themes header template, inside the main<br />\ncontent section</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>wcnt_after_main_content\n<ul>\n<li>This action should be called at the end of every page in the shop</li>\n<li>You need to add <code>&lt;?php do_action('wcnt_after_main_content'); ?&gt;</code> in your themes footer template, inside the main<br />\ncontent section</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have activated the plugin and added the necessary actions, you need to configure the plugin. The plugins<br />\nconfiguration page can be found under the &#8220;Settings-&gt;Store&#8221; section, in the tab called &#8220;Tiresias Tagging&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The configuration page consists of three settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server address\n<ul>\n<li>This is the server address for the Tiresias marketing automation service</li>\n<li>It will have the default value of &#8220;connect.tiresias.com&#8221; and you do not need to change this</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Account name\n<ul>\n<li>This is your Tiresias marketing automation service account name that you got when registering for the service</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use default Tiresias elements\n<ul>\n<li>This setting controls if the plugin should create and output the default Tiresias elements for showing the product<br />\nrecommendations</li>\n<li>You can disable the defaults if you want to use your own elements in your theme</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the above settings are needed for the plugin to work.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Tiresias Tagging&#8221; widget added by the plugin for showing Tiresias elements in the shops sidebars, needs to be configured<br />\nif you wish to use it. The widget can be found under the &#8220;Appearance-&gt;Widgets&#8221; section and it works like any other<br />\nWordPress widget. After dropping the widget in the appropriate sidebar container, you need to configure its Tiresias ID.<br />\nThis ID is used as the Tiresias element div ID attribute and can be whatever you decide.</p>\n",
