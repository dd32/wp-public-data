It supports semantic syntax you would use when using the Prism highlighter for example. If a code tag sits immediately within a pre tag it will not be escaped.</p>\n<p>Code is escaped before it is displayed which gives you easy editing access in the backend as you will always see the unescaped version.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Since this a WordPress plugin just search for &#8220;Smart Code Escape&#8221; in the plugins section in the admin and install it from there. If you would rather install it manually you can do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and extract the plugin</li>\n<li>Copy the resulting directory into your WordPress plugins directory</li>\n<li>Go to your WordPress admin and activate the plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Where are the settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no settings at the moment. The plugin will escape your code for you within pre tags, not setup needed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How should I format my code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The whole reason for the plugin is so you don&#8217;t need to add any special formatting. You can type any characters you like, they will show up as you&#8217;d expect in the admin and will be escaped on the front-end.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin work with syntax highlighters</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have only tested it with Prism but I imagine it should work with a number of others as well. Prism requires you to create a semantically correct markup. The plugin does not escape a code tag if it is directly within a pre tag for this reason.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
