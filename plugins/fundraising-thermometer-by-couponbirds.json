Imagine you are fundraising for a new school building. You could probably just say how much youâ€™ve raised so far. Just the number. On a page. But according to psychology, your site visitors are far more likely to donate if they can see a visual representation of how far you have until you reach your target.</p>\n<p>Visual representations of goal progress get people motivated. It really is as simple as that. And the result of having a fundraising thermometer on your page is more donations. More support. More purchases. More conversions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
