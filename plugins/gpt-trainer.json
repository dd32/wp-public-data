        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20gpt-trainer%3F'>\nWhat is GPT-trainer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GPT-trainer is a powerful no-code/low-code framework that lets you build advanced AI chatbots trained on your own data. It is simple to set up but also versatile. You have countless customization options and can integrate your chatbot with many popular platforms like WhatsApp, FB Messenger, Instagram, Zapier, Make.com, Shopify, Zendesk, etc.</p>\n<p>With GPT-trainer, you can upload various types of documents such as PDFs, Word files, and simple Excel tables. You can also specify static websites to scrape content from directly. This allows you to leverage your own data to create hyper-personalized conversational interactions.</p>\n<p>One of the unique features of GPT-trainer is its support for function-calling capabilities, which means you can integrate it with custom business logic to enable advanced workflow automations. If you need assistance with custom integrations, you can reach out to our support team directly <a href=\"mailto:&#x68;&#101;&#x6c;&#108;&#x6f;&#064;&#x67;&#112;&#x74;&#045;&#x74;&#114;&#x61;i&#x6e;e&#114;&#x2e;&#099;&#x6f;&#109;&#x3f;&#115;&#x75;&#098;&#x6a;&#101;&#x63;&#116;&#x3d;&#072;&#x65;&#108;&#x70;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hello\\@gpt-trainer.com.com</a> and we&#8217;d be happy to help.</p>\n<p>Another key differentiator of GPT-trainer is its multi-agent approach to AI architecture. Rather than rely on a single fixed Large Language Model (LLM) for generative capabilities, GPT-trainer uses a combination of different LLMs and advanced routing/chaining techniques to produce the best responses or sequence of actions. Human agents can also be seamlessly integrated into this AI-supervised multi-agent orchestration.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20free%20to%20use%3F'>\nIs it free to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, GPT-trainer offers a free plan.

We also support common images and YouTube videos. You can also provide an URL for automatic scraping of text content or input your own text directly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20any%20coding%20knowledge%20required%20to%20use%20gpt-trainer%20and%20embed%20the%20chatbot%20onto%20my%20website%3F'>\nIs any coding knowledge required to use GPT-Trainer and embed the chatbot onto my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all! GPT-Trainer is designed to be a no-code solution. You can train and customize your chatbot without any coding knowledge, and the WordPress plugin simplifies the embedding process, making it accessible to users without technical expertise.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20appearance%20and%20behavior%20of%20the%20chatbot%20on%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nCan I customize the appearance and behavior of the chatbot on my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely!
