        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20is%20the%20title%20for%20a%20post%20determined%3F'>\nHow is the title for a post determined?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tumblr does not allow all post types to have a formal title defined. For<br />\nthose post types (such as photos), either the first HTML header in the caption<br />\nwill be used (h1 to h3) or, if none can be found, the first sentence.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20see%20strange%20characters%20instead%20of%20quotes%3F'>\nWhy do I see strange characters instead of quotes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your tumblr posts contain &#8216;smart quotes&#8217;, these can sometimes be rendered<br />\nas strange characters to some users. The plugin will attempt to convert these<br />\nto plain quotes, unless the &#8216;Replace &#8220;special&#8221; characters&#8217; option is unticked.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20blog%20has%20an%20ssl%20certificate%20%28https%3A%2F%2F%29%20and%20i%27m%20getting%20%27unsecured%20content%27%20warnings%3F'>\nMy blog has an SSL certificate (https://) and I&#8217;m getting &#8216;unsecured content&#8217; warnings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, this widget pulls data from Tumblr over http; this results in<br />\ndisplayed images also using this protocol. If you have an SSL certificate<br />\ninstalled on your blog, you may see warnings from your browser about &#8216;unsecured<br />\ncontent&#8217; which refers to the images from Tumblr.</p>\n<p>If you change your Tumblr URL setting to be preceded by &#8216;https://&#8217;, the widget<br />\nwill access Tumblr over https and the resulting images will also be served<br />\nsecurely.</p>\n<p>This will one day become the default approach, but for now is left up to the<br />\nuser as it can potentially cause problems on badly configured web servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20widget%20is%20empty%21'>\nMy widget is empty!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to some changes to Tumblr&#8217;s API, the data can be interrupted by a GDPR consent notice. From version 2.12, there is an advanced setting to change the &#8216;user-agent&#8217; string sent to Tumblr &#8211; this currently defaults to a value which works, but as Tumblr may change things at any time it remains configurable by the user.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing an empty widget, please post on the widget support page, and we will work out what it needs to be set to!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.2.16</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed deprecated &#8216;create_function&#8217; call, which can cause failures for later PHP versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed to accomodate changes in the Tumblr data (they have changed the case in the post type field, for some reason!)</li>\n<li>Updated the WordPress version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Images included in tumblr posts marked as &#8216;text&#8217; will now be displayed, when the content type is set to &#8220;Whole Post&#8221;. These images will be limited to 100% of the widget.</li>\n<li>Posts without titles or slugs will no longer have the post type used as a &#8216;stand in&#8217; title when the whole post is set to clickable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Merged all latest changes; this should force an update to become available via WordPress.org</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an option to specify the user-agent used to fetch data from Tumblr. This defaults to &#8216;Wget/1.18&#8217;, which prevents Tumblr from disrupting their API with a GDPR consent notice. This has been set to be configurable, in case Tumblr makes further changes to their servers.</li>\n<li>Added an option to make the entire Tumblr post clickable, rather than just the title.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppressed large volumes of XML warnings, generated by Tumblr hiding their v1 API behind a GDRP warning page. This doesn&#8217;t actually resolve the issue, but will stop your error log filling up with masses of messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new option to make the whole post clickable, rather than limiting the link to just the displayed title or media. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased the maximum number of posts displayed from 20 to 50, which is<br />\nthe maximum that the Tumblr V1 API will provide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Will how honour the HTTP protocol of the source tumblr, if provided. This<br />\nmeans that if you have an SSL certificate on your blog, you can avoid<br />\nthe widget generating &#8216;unsecured content&#8217; warnings by providing your Tumblr<br />\nURL with a &#8216;https://&#8217; prefix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in the caching code, which resulted in excessive calls to<br />\nTumblr.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new Content Tpe of &#8216;Media Only&#8217;, which shows photos / videos without<br />\ndisplaying post titles.</li>\n<li>Added a new Display Type of &#8216;Horizontal List&#8217; &#8211; this will show posts side<br />\nby side if the widget has sufficient space. Works best with media-only<br />\nposts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed some bad comments in the stylesheet which prevented some styling from<br />\ngetting properly applied. Thanks to jchriscook for spotting this!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an option to replace &#8220;special&#8221; characters such a smart quotes, which<br />\ncan cause display problems for some users. This is on by default, but can<br />\nbe unchecked if for some reason desired.</li>\n<li>Added a &#8216;Title And Media&#8217; content type option; this shows just the title<br />\nand any media &#8211; essentially it&#8217;s &#8216;Post Excerpt&#8217; but with no text. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix, to prevent the widget failing when processing a Tumblr photo post<br />\nthat contains no caption.</li>\n<li>Moved the widget script loading into the footer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the option to adjust the width of the player in audio posts to match<br />\nthe chosen media width. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added CSS to ensure that media posts with short text are properly separated.</li>\n<li>Improved handling of the provided Tumblr URL to be less picky.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First public release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Internal version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
