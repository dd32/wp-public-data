Universal Passkeys never leave the device on which they are created. This makes them much more secure.<br />\n2. Universal Passkeys work everywhere. Some browsers (Firefox) do not support passkeys. Universal Passkeys work everywhere, even on Firefox.</p>\n<p><strong>Coming soon:</strong> Vanilla WebAuthn FIDO2 passkeys. These passkeys allow syncing between devices and work with passkey managers.</p>\n<p>As a Beyond Identity admin, you will have several configuration options including selecting passkey flavors and customizing the login page.</p>\n<h3>Admin Set Up</h3>\n<p>First, sign up for a free developer account by visiting: https://www.beyondidentity.com/developers</p>\n<p>Once you have a developer account you will need to set several values for the OIDC server. Follow the steps below to configure a Beyond Identity application. Most defaults are fine. However make sure the following are set:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your Beyond Identity Console, navigate to the <strong>Apps</strong> tab under Authentication</li>\n<li>Tap <strong>Add an application</strong></li>\n<li>Set <strong>Protocol</strong> to <strong>OIDC</strong></li>\n<li>Set <strong>Client Type</strong> to <strong>Confidential</strong></li>\n<li>Set <strong>PKCE</strong> to <strong>Disabled</strong></li>\n<li>Set <strong>Redirect URIs</strong> to include <code>https://${your-website-domain.com}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=openid-connect-authorize</code></li>\n<li>Set <strong>Token Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>Subject</strong> to <strong>id</strong></li>\n<li>At the top of the page, navigate to your application&#8217;s <strong>Authenticator Config</strong> tab</li>\n<li>Set <strong>Configuration Type</strong> to <strong>Hosted Web</strong></li>\n<li>The recommended defaults for <strong>Authentication Profile</strong> are fine but feel free to modify</li>\n<li>Tap the <strong>Submit</strong> button to save your changes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, go to your WordPress dashboard and find the Beyond Identity Settings page. You will need three generated values from your newly created application. You can find the <strong>Issuer URL</strong>, <strong>Client ID</strong>, and <strong>Client Secret</strong> in the Beyond Identity Console&#8217;s application that you just created.</p>\n<p>For more information on how Beyond Identity works, visit the <a href=\"http://developer.beyondidentity.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>For help, reach out on <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/byndid/shared_invite/zt-1anns8n83-NQX4JvW7coi9dksADxgeBQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<h3>Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>This plugin also provides shortcodes that can be used on any page or post.
