        "description": "<p>This plug-in allows users to very quickly incorporate Lucidel software into their WordPress webpage. It automatically goes through your web pages and adds all the javascript tags that are necessary for you to start analyzing your web traffic.</p>\n<p>Lucidel software combines the power of google analytics with its own software and allows users to access demographic data of their website&#8217;s visitors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age  </li>\n<li>Gender   </li>\n<li>Income Level  </li>\n<li>Educational Level</li>\n<li>Political Affiliation </li>\n<li>High Level Geographic Segmentation </li>\n</ul>\n<p>in addition to the basic metrics that google analytics provides. More importantly, however, using Lucidel&#8217;s automated algorithm, users will be notified of changes, trends, etc that occur over time allowing them to save time doing the analysis and jump right to the insights.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Method 1: Download zip package from Lucidel.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to http://lucidel.com/wordpress/. </li>\n<li>At the top of the page, you will see a &#8220;Download here&#8221; link. If you are using Google Chrome, you can simply click this link. If you are using Safari, right click the link and click download link as. Select the place to save the zip package. It is extremely important that you download the plugin as a zip file rather than the individual php file. </li>\n<li>Now go to the dashboard for your wordpress website. Click the link on the left sidebar menu which says Plugins. </li>\n<li>By the Plugins title at the top (with the plug icon), you should see a button that says &#8220;Add New&#8221;. Click it.</li>\n<li>Across the top of the box you should see &#8220;Search&#8221;, &#8220;Upload&#8221;, &#8220;Featured&#8221;, &#8220;Popular&#8221;&#8230;. Click the &#8220;Upload Button&#8221;. </li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Choose File&#8221; button and navigate to the directory on your computer which has the lucidel.zip file. Select the zip file and upload it. Then hit &#8220;Install Now&#8221;. </li>\n<li>You will know everything is done successfully if you see &#8220;Plugin installed successfully.&#8221; after &#8220;unpacking the package&#8221; and &#8220;installing the plugin&#8221;.</li>\n<li>If this is the case, click the &#8220;Activate Plugin&#8221; button by Actions. if the plugin failed to install, please email support@lucidel.com. </li>\n<li>Once you activate the plugin you will see a red bar across the top of the screen which says &#8220;Lucidel plugin is not active. You must set your Lucidel ID before it can work&#8221;. Click &#8220;set your Lucidel ID&#8221;. If you already know your Lucidel ID, simply type your ID in, hit set and you are all done!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Method 2: Search for our plugin on the directory</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Much like Method 1, you will go to the wordpress dashboard. Click the link on the left sidebar menu which says Plugins. </li>\n<li>By the Plugins title at the top (with the plug icon), you should see a button that says &#8220;Add New&#8221;. Click it.</li>\n<li>Across the top of the box you should see &#8220;Search&#8221;, &#8220;Upload&#8221;, &#8220;Featured&#8221;, &#8220;Popular&#8221;&#8230;. Click the &#8220;Search&#8221;. Search and find the Lucidel Plugin. You will merely need to hit install. After this everything should follow Method 1 from steps 7 &#8211; 9.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Where do you get information about my visitors?</h4>\n<p>A) We buy it from the same sources that ad networks that target us based on our demographic information and surfing habits.</p>\n<h4>Does that have a negative impact the privacy of my users?</h4>\n<p>A) Not really. Nothing is known about us personally, just that we fall into large &#8216;buckets&#8217; like &#8220;middle aged man who likes cars&#8221;. These data marketplaces still know less about us than the guys who send us junk mail. And they aren&#8217;t annoying like them.</p>\n<h4>What metrics do you look for?</h4>\n<p>A) We look at every standard metric out there plus a few KPIs we have created.</p>\n<h4>Can I get more reports?</h4>\n<p>A) If there is information you want but aren&#8217;t seeing send us an email (ideas@lucidel.com) and we will try and include it in a future version.</p>\n<h4>Can i access the demographics information in my google analytics account?</h4>\n<p>A) Not at the moment. In order to be able to include as many dimension to our reports as possible we compress the data in a way that only our algorithms can understand. But we are working on it.</p>\n<h4>Can I control what metrics I receive and how frequently I get them?</h4>\n<p>A) We are working on more personalization features. If you have any specific requests please send us an email (ideas@lucidel.com) and we will try and make it happen for you.</p>\n<p>See lucidel.com/faq for additional FAQs.</p>\n",
