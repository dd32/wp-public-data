        "description": "<p>For Credly Pro members: Easily creates a page on your site for displaying official Credly Badge Assertions. Just add the shortcode to any page or post.</p>\n<p>The page will then dynamically embed the official badge information for any of your issued Credly badges, when a visitor is redirected to your site from a recipient&#8217;s shared badge.</p>\n<p>This shortcode provides WordPress support for the Credly &#8220;Custom Assertion Location&#8221; feature, available to Pro members in their Credly &#8220;Account Settings.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>What is Custom Assertion?</h4>\n<p>The Custom Assertion Location feature allows Credly Pro and Premium members to redirect accepted badges they issue to their own website.  This means that badges shown on a user’s Credly profile or that they share on social networks will redirect when clicked to the website URL the issuer provides, instead of to Credly. In this manner, issuers can enjoy several benefits, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extra Validity</strong>: The validity and authenticity of the credit is reinforced, as the badge assertion is displayed on your domain.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Branding</strong>: White label the badge assertion page by placing it on your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Context</strong>: Customize where and how you display credit on your site, offering additional information about your programs and offerings, enrollment opportunities, or other information for observers when they click through to learn about earned badges.</li>\n<li><strong>Your Analytics</strong>: With badges redirected to your site, you can leverage your own web site analytics to track traffic directly to your site from badges you issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What does a Custom Assertion Location look like in action?</h4>\n<p>First let’s look at the default behavior when an accepted badge is clicked. Without a Custom Assertion Location activated, badges link to the standard Credly assertion page.  Here is an example: <a href=\"https://credly.com/credit/10318\" title=\"Standard Assertion\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://credly.com/credit/10318</a></p>\n<p>When a Custom Assertion Location is in place, click-throughs from accepted badges that you have issued are redirected to the website you specify in your Account Settings. Credly appends the ID number of the badge to the URL you provide in your Account Settings. Here is an example of a Custom Assertion Location, whereby a badge is redirected to a non-Credly website: <a href=\"http://aaslhcommunity.org/cert/?ID=26312\" title=\"Credly Custom Assertion Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://aaslhcommunity.org/cert/?ID=26312</a></p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s very easy. Essentially, all you do is place a shortcode on any page on your WordPress site. Here are the details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Put the shortcode on any page or post on your site:  [credly_assertion_page]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy the permalink of the page you used and append &#8220;/?CID={id}&#8221; to the end of it.  For example, if the link to your page is www.yoursiteurl.com/certificate, your link format would be:  www.yoursiteurl.com/certificate?CID={id}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paste the full link into the &#8220;Custom Assertion Location&#8221; field in the Account Settings area of your <a href=\"https://credly.com/\" title=\"Credly web site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Credly</a> Pro account. Save your Account Settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! All of your Credly badges will be re-routed to your designated WordPress page and will display the official badge information automatically. You don&#8217;t need to do anything else.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://credly.com/credit/26312\" title=\"Credly Custom Assertion Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://credly.com/credit/26312</a> automatically redirects to <a href=\"http://aaslhcommunity.org/cert/?ID=26312\" title=\"Credly Custom Assertion Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://aaslhcommunity.org/cert/?ID=26312</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This shortcode is already available in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/\" title=\"BadgeOS\" rel=\"ugc\">BadgeOS</a> plugin. So if you already have BadgeOS activated, you do not need this standalone plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: Custom Assertion Location requires a <a href=\"http://credly.com/upgrade\" title=\"Credly Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro</a> or higher level membership to Credly.</p>\n<h4>Resources / Helpful Links</h4>\n<p>Learn more about how Custom Assertion Location works:<br />\n<a href=\"http://blog.credly.com/custom-assertion-location/\" title=\"Background on Custom Assertion Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Background on Custom Assertion Location</a></p>\n<p>This plugin is made available by <a href=\"https://credly.com/\" title=\"Credly web site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Credly, LLC</a>.
