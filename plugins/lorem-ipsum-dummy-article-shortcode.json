        "description": "<p>This shortcode plugin does not simply generate dummy text but tries to mimic what a WordPress page or post might look like in real life. This includes paragraphs, commas, headings, hyperlinks and images. The output is easily adjustable through the shortcode attributes.<br />\nThe generated code is also <strong>seeded</strong>, meaning that the dummy html on page-x will always look the same (unless you specify your own seed).<br />\nThe plugin also adds the shortcode filter to the title, so you can also use [lll h] in your post title.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode attributes</h4>\n<p>You can adjust the shortcode by adding the following attributes. Some attributes have a single character alias for quick use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>paragraph (alias p): Number of paragraphs. Defaults to 12.</li>\n<li>sentence (alias s): Number of sentences per paragraph. Defaults to 5.</li>\n<li>word (alias w): Number of words per sentence. Defaults to 12.</li>\n<li>header (alias h): Indicates a header. If attribute is set the other attributes will be ignored. Defaults to null.</li>\n<li>seed: The random seed used for generating the article. Defaults to the post ID.</li>\n<li>deviation: The random deviation used to determine the number of paragraphs, sentences and words. Defaults to 0.5.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>To use the shortcode simply add <code>[lll]</code> to a post or page.<br />\nAttributes are used like so; <code>[lll p=8 seed=76432]</code>.<br />\nWhen used as a post title make sure to add the &#8216;header&#8217; attribute; <code>[lll h]</code>.</p>\n<h3>Versioning and issues</h3>\n<p>The main CVS repo for this plugin is on Github. The version up on WordPress is a distilled build of the major tags.<br />\nIf you have any issues or suggestions please put them on <a href=\"https://github.com/Sjeiti/Lorem-ipsum-dummy-article-shortcode/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</p>\n",
