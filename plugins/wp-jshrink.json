If you there are like 20 of them &#8211; then probably you do.</p>\n<h4>What gets minified?</h4>\n<p>Scripts from the current theme, wp-includes &amp; plugins.</p>\n<h4>Why only footer scripts?</h4>\n<p>To encourage people put their javascript in the footer.</p>\n<h4>Does it minify css?</h4>\n<p>No. Initially it was a small plugin for personal usage in conjunction with wp-less. Consider using LESS or SCSS to put your css together in a single file or use any other css minifier.</p>\n<h4>Does it uglify my javascript?</h4>\n<p>No. Only minifies and combines into a single file.</p>\n<h4>Grunt, Gulp, xxx and yyy already do this</h4>\n<p>This is yet another tool which you may either use or not use, it&#8217;s up to you ðŸ™‚</p>\n",
