Why do I need yours?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you regularly maintain your own access list, you will already know that tracking agents by the agent string or IP address isn&#8217;t effective or reliable as both can change without notice.<br />\nWe proactively check each and every bot agent, ensuring it is valid, and perform multi-factor authentication to verify each bot, <strong>24/7</strong>, updating our live definitions constantly so you don&#8217;t have to.<br />\nAdditionally trying to manage unwanted automated traffic requires hours of reactive analysis, and by the time you block the ASN, IP or UA the attacker has re-tooled and you’re back to square one.<br />\nWith VerifiedVisitors we automatically detect and can mitigate other automated traffic immediately saving you the time and headache.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20do%20this%20from%20robots.txt%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I do this from robots.txt?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although well-behaved industry standard bots do respect robots.txt (or tell you when they won&#8217;t), the cybercriminals certainly don&#8217;t.<br />\nAs soon as you identify a bot agent and IP and disallow it, the bot will simply ignore your entry, or come back again with a new agent string and IP address.<br />\nThe robots.txt entry is going to be out-of-date as soon as it&#8217;s written and this quickly becomes unmanageable.<br />\nThey may also use your robots.txt file as a guide to sensitive paths on your site. Our new Virtual CISO allows you to enforce your robots.txt file in real-time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20you%20different%20to%20other%20bot%20management%20solutions%3F'>\nHow are you different to other bot management solutions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>VerifiedVisitors focuses on finding and protecting the good bots you do want, not the thankless and never ending task of trying to identify the bad guys.<br />\nOnce we’ve done this for you our automated blocking rules can reduce or mitigate all your other bot traffic with confidence.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20we%20apply%20your%20verifiedvisitors%20list%20to%20our%20api%20endpoint%3F'>\nCan we apply your VerifiedVisitors list to our API endpoint?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can apply our list to any endpoint that accepts HTTP connections, such as API&#8217;s, search systems or mobile endpoints.<br />\nWe successfully defended an API based business against unwanted visitors taking system resources and degrading their services.<br />\nRead more about this in <a href=\"https://www.verifiedvisitors.com/blog\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our blog</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20verifiedvisitors%20protect%20our%20credit%20card%20gateway%20from%20bot%20attacks%3F'>\nCan VerifiedVisitors protect our Credit Card gateway from Bot attacks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we can automatically defend against carding bot attacks on your payment gateway.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20custom%20crawlers%2C%20can%20i%20add%20those%20to%20my%20access%20list%3F'>\nI have custom crawlers, can I add those to my access list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We recognize that you may have created a bespoke bot for your business, or use tooling that creates a &#8216;unique&#8217; bot for you.<br />\nVerifiedVisitors supports this, in our portal you can add your own custom bot definition to your VerifiedWatchList.<br />\nIf it&#8217;s a commercial bot you believe we should know about and support you can contact us on support@verifiedvisitors.com and let us know.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20your%20terms%20of%20service%20and%20privacy%20policies%3F'>\nWhat are your Terms of Service and Privacy Policies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our Terms of service can be found here: https://www.verifiedvisitors.com/terms-of-service whilst our Privacy Policy can be found here: https://www.verifiedvisitors.com/cookie-privacy-policy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20out%20more%3F'>\nWhere can I find out more?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can visit our website at https://www.verifiedvisitors.com where we have an overview of our product, our blog FAQs which we hope will help you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
