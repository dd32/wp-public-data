This plugin shouldn&#8217;t be used if your permalinks include dates since those dates will change when a post is republished.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20post%20slugs%20change%20upon%20republishing%3F'>\nWhy do post slugs change upon republishing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t alter post slugs. It changes the post date and, depending on the settings, changes the post&#8217;s status. If you have other plugins that take actions when a post&#8217;s date or status change, you may see some unexpected results. There isn&#8217;t much I can do about the behavior of other plugins.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
