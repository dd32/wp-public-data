        "description": "<p>What is Sound Beat?</p>\n<p>Got 90 seconds?</p>\n<p>Then you&#8217;ve got time for a trip through the history of recorded sound!  Sound Beat is a<br />\ndaily, 90 second show highlighting  the holdings of the Belfer Audio Archive.  The Belfer<br />\nis part of the Syracuse University Library, and with over half a million recordings, is<br />\none of the largest sound archives in the United States. Each SB episode focuses on one<br />\nparticular recording from the Archive, and provides a back story detailing its place in<br />\nrecording history.</p>\n<p>What kinds of recordings? Popular and classical music performances, film scores those from<br />\ndistinctly American musical forms like jazz, bebop, country, and bluegrass. Old<br />\nfavorites, rare gems, and some we guarantee you&#8217;ve never heard before… from Cab Calloway<br />\nto the castrated stars of Italian opera, you&#8217;ll hear it all on the Sound Beat!</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s not just music. Sound Beat episodes also feature speeches and spoken word<br />\nperformances from some of the great thinkers, political figures and luminaries from the<br />\nlate 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries. People like Thomas Edison, George Bernard<br />\nShaw, Amelia Earhart, Albert Einstein, and Theodore Roosevelt.</p>\n<p>Who is Sound Beat?</p>\n<p>Brett Barry is a voice-over performer whose long list of credits includes national<br />\ntelevision and radio commercials, promos, and audiobook narration. He is the owner of<br />\nSilver Hollow Audio, an independent production company and audiobook publisher. Brett and<br />\nhis wife, Rebecca, live with their two daughters and an adopted greyhound in New York&#8217;s<br />\nCatskill Mountains.</p>\n<p>Jim O&#8217;Connor is the producer of Sound Beat, and has written professionally in many<br />\ndifferent capacities. He is an avid appreciator and player of music. His consuming love<br />\nfor both is tolerated daily by his wife Kelly.
