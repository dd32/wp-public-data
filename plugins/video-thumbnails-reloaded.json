If you don&#8217;t know the name of the field your video is being saved in, please contact the developer of that theme or plugin.</li>\n<li>Copy and paste your embed code into the &#8220;Test Markup for Video&#8221; section of the Debugging page. If this doesn&#8217;t find the thumbnail, you&#8217;ll want to be sure to include the embed code you scanned when you request support.

If a video is not in HD, a fullscreen thumbnail is used. This can result in letterboxing when the video is actually widescreen. Users of the <a href=\"https://refactored.co/plugins/video-thumbnails\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro version</a> can select an aspect ratio in the settings if this is a constant problem. <a href=\"https://refactored.co/blog/remove-black-bars-youtube-thumbnails\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More info</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20get%20thumbnails%20from%20a%20specific%20time%3F'>\nCan I get thumbnails from a specific time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Video Thumbnails only uses thumbnails provided by the source. If you&#8217;re posting videos from your own account, many providers allow you to choose the thumbnail.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20it%20get%20thumbnails%20for%20my%20self-hosted%20videos%3F'>\nCan it get thumbnails for my self-hosted videos?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it will only fetch thumbnails for videos from the list of supported sites. Decoding local video files to create thumbnails would require server resources and packages unavailable to most users, so we only focus on supporting major video sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20theme%20isn%27t%20showing%20thumbnails%2C%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nMy theme isn&#8217;t showing thumbnails, what&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most likely problem is that your theme doesn&#8217;t support post thumbnails. If thumbnails are supported, you should see a box titled &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; on the edit post page. If thumbnails aren&#8217;t supported, your theme will have to be modified to support Featured Images or to support one of our custom functions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20video%20thumbnails%20if%20i%20use%20a%20custom%20field%20to%20store%20the%20video%3F'>\nHow can I use Video Thumbnails if I use a custom field to store the video?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the Video Thumbnails settings page just enter the name of the custom field and the plugin will scan it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20functions%20outside%20of%20a%20loop%3F'>\nCan I use the functions outside of a loop?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but be sure to include the post ID as a parameter. For example: <code>&lt;?php $thumbnail = get_video_thumbnail(25); ?&gt;</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20video%20service%2Fembedding%20plugin%20isn%27t%20included%2C%20can%20you%20add%20it%3F'>\nMy video service/embedding plugin isn&#8217;t included, can you add it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the service allows a way to retrieve thumbnails, I&#8217;ll do my best to add it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20with%20custom%20post%20types%3F'>\nHow do I use this plugin with custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The settings page includes a checklist of all your post types so you can pick and choose.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20editing%20my%20theme%20and%20only%20want%20to%20display%20a%20thumbnail%20if%20one%20is%20found.%20how%20do%20i%20do%20this%3F'>\nI am editing my theme and only want to display a thumbnail if one is found. How do I do this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>&lt;?php if( ( $video_thumbnail = get_video_thumbnail() ) != null ) { echo &quot;&#8221;; } ?&gt; will only display a thumbnail when one exists, but I recommend using the Featured Image setting and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_post_thumbnail\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the_post_thumbnail</a> template tag.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20edited%20my%20theme%20and%20now%20i%27m%20getting%20huge%20thumbnails%2C%20how%20can%20i%20resize%20them%3F'>\nI edited my theme and now I&#8217;m getting huge thumbnails, how can I resize them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The best solution is to use the Featured Image setting and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_post_thumbnail\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the_post_thumbnail</a> template tag.</p>\n<p>As an alternative you could assign a class to the element and style it with CSS.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20edited%20my%20theme%20and%20now%20i%27m%20seeing%20the%20thumbnail%20and%20the%20video%2C%20how%20do%20i%20only%20display%20the%20thumbnail%3F'>\nI edited my theme and now I&#8217;m seeing the thumbnail and the video, how do I only display the thumbnail?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every theme is different, so this can be tricky if you aren&#8217;t familiar with WordPress theme development. You need to edit your template in the appropriate place, replacing <code>&lt;?php the_content(); &gt;</code> with <code>&lt;?php the_excerpt(); &gt;</code> so that only an excerpt of the post is shown on the home page or wherever you would like to display the video thumbnail.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20it%20stop%20finding%20thumbnails%20for%20vimeo%3F'>\nWhy did it stop finding thumbnails for Vimeo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Vimeo API has a rate limit, so in rare cases you may exceed this limit. Try again after a few hours.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
