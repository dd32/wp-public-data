I&#8217;ve been using the original/classic editor for over 10 years now and the experience has always been 100% smooth. I&#8217;ve tried Gutenberg and yes, it&#8217;s much better now than previous versions, but for me it&#8217;s not as comfortable or streamlined as the classic editor. So I think a lot of people, like me, are familiar with that and want to use it for a long time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
