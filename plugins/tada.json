This means that heavy pages, and slow web hosts may not appear instantly. In addition, I have found that the WordPress admin interface can be quite slow and so the best experience happens for users who are logged out. I use the Incognito mode in my browser to test this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20wordpress%20themes%20work%20with%20instant%20pages%3F'>\nWhat WordPress Themes work with Instant Pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most WordPress themes will work fine with Instant Pages, however there are a few that may not. These are themes that use javascript to link to internal pages. For instance if the theme is built with React or Vue (or similar) then it may not work (but equally &#8211; probably isn&#8217;t needed). Also if the theme applies transitions to page loads (such as fading in and out) then you may not see an improvement. However these are specialist cases, and most themes will work great.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
