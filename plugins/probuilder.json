        "faq": "<p>What happens if I destroyed some part of my website?</p>\n<p>If you did some changes and now your website looks like a mess you can simply click on &#8216;All Probuilds&#8217; on the right side of your screen (in front end). This will give you an overview over all changes you have made. You can then simply edit a change by clicking on it or click on the trash icon to completely delete the styling for that element.</p>\n<p>Will Probuilder work with my theme?</p>\n<p>We have tested Probuilder on several WordPress installs with several different themes and it did work for all of them. However since Probuilder is still very young we can not guarantee the functionality in every theme. If you experience problems please write us: probuilder@lingulo.com</p>\n<p>I added a value in the editor but nothing happens on my website, why?</p>\n<p>This sounds like another CSS rule is more specific and therefore stronger than the one you just created. You can try to add &#8216;!important&#8217; just after the value you entered. In the future we will take care of this problem by determining whether a rule you added applies or not and if not add the &#8216;!important&#8217; automatically.</p>\n<p>Probuilder is not working as expected or looks messed up, what can I do?</p>\n<p>Please send us a link to your site or a screenshot so we can investigate what the problem might be. Also please make sure to update to the latest WordPress version and to use a modern browser. Please don&#8217;t use Internet Explorer ðŸ˜‰</p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/probuilder</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the front end of your website and click on the blue button in the top right corner saying &#8216;Activate Probuilder&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Once activated you can select an element with your mouse and click on it to open up the editor.</li>\n<li>Do changes as you wish and click &#8216;Save Changes&#8217; to save your newly created CSS code.
