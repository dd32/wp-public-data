        "faq": "\n<h4>Is it REALLY free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, FluentChat is 100% free.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There are so many live chat plugins. Why is FluentChat better?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FluentChat is sleek and modern. Design is very important to us, and we made sure the chat widget looks awesome. We didn&#8217;t want to clutter your dashboard, so we made it minimal. We want you to have options, so we made it feature-packed. Basically, we worked hard and made it awesome in every way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it slow down my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The chat widget is lightweight, and adds very little load time to your pages. It doesn&#8217;t put much load on your server either. We made sure of that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I choose the pages on which the chat widget should appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can configure this on the Settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will I lose my data if I upgrade to FluentChat Pro?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. FluentChat Pro is a separate plugin, but it will have all your data if you choose to migrate over from FluentChat Basic.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is FluentChat developer friendly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It definitely is. Check out our <a href=\"http://ncrafts.net/fluent-chat/help/hooks/?source=repo_desc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">developer docs</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you have any documentation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
