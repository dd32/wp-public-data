The SyncPostWithOtherSite for Content needs to be installed on the local or Staging server (the website you&#8217;re moving the data from &#8211; the Source), as well as the Live server (the website you&#8217;re moving the data to &#8211; the Target).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20it%20be%20tested%20on%20localhost%20first%3F'>\nCan it be tested on localhost first?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, As long as the sites can reach every other, WP Remote User Sync will do the job.<br />\nThis implies that two sites in localhost can convey. But if one of those sites is on localhost and the other one isn&#8217;t, token exchange can&#8217;t occur and the sites won&#8217;t have the ability to communicate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20synchronize%20all%20of%20my%20content%20%28posts%29%20at%20once%3F'>\nDoes this plugin Synchronize all of my content (Posts) at once?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. WPSiteSync for Content will just synchronize with the one Post content which you&#8217;re editing. And it is going to only Synchronize the content once you let it. This Permits You to control Just What content is transferred between sites and when It&#8217;ll Be transferred</p>\n</p>\n\n",
