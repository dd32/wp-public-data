So a big thanks to the authors of Prologue, Joseph Scott and Matt Thomas.</p>\n<p>A few notes about the plugin&#8217;s behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In WordPress 2.7 and higher, you can select which fields you want to appear in the form and what pages you want the form to appear on. Settings are in &#8220;Settings -&gt; Writing -&gt; Posthaste Settings&#8221;.</li>\n<li>If you leave the &#8220;Title:&#8221; field blank, it takes the first 40 characters of the post content and makes that the title.</li>\n<li>If you leave the &#8220;Category:&#8221; box at its default setting (&#8220;Category&#8230;&#8221;) it posts to your default category. <em>However&#8230;</em></li>\n<li>If you have a category named &#8216;asides&#8217;, it will put posts with empty titles into the &#8216;asides&#8217; category even if you do not explicitly specify the &#8216;asides&#8217; category in the dropdown. You can then <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Asides\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">style them as asides</a>.</li>\n<li>The included CSS is deliberately simple. If your theme already styles forms, it will probably inherit your theme&#8217;s styling. If you want to customize the appearance of the form, just customize your own css files.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Just upload the <code>posthaste</code> directory to <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> and activate. No settings or anything.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I customize the automatic &#8216;asides&#8217; behavior?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you call your &#8216;asides&#8217; category something other than &#8216;asides&#8217; or if you just don&#8217;t like this behavior at all, you can change it. There&#8217;s no administration interface for this plugin (for now), so you&#8217;ll have to edit the <code>posthaste.php</code> file directly, but fortunately its very easy. Just find the line right at the top of the plugin that says <code>\"asidesCatName\" =&gt; \"asides\"</code> and change the <code>\"asides\"</code> to whatever you call asides, or, to get rid of this behavior entirely, just type in anything that <em>is not</em> the name of a category on your blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help! I activated the plugin but the form isn&#8217;t showing up!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible your theme has <code>get_sidebar()</code> placed <em>before</em> the loop at the top of your theme (Most themes call <code>get_sidebar()</code> after the loop, but some do it before). This plugin attaches the form at the start of the loop, which usually works fine. In order to prevent the &#8220;Recent Posts&#8221; widget (or any other widgets which call <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop#Multiple_Loops\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">multiple loops</a>) from <em>also</em> causing the form to display, the plugin deactives the form once <code>get_sidebar()</code> is called. So if <code>get_sidebar()</code> runs first, the form won&#8217;t appear in the &#8220;real loop&#8221; either.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re willing to edit your theme&#8217;s <code>index.php</code> file, the fix is easy. Just place the following where you want the form to appear on your page (probably right before <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the loop</a>):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if(function_exists(posthasteForm)) { posthasteForm(); } ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another option, if you have no other loops called on a page and would rather edit the plugin instead of your theme, is to comment out the action that removes the loop at <code>get_sidebar()</code>. Find the following line near the bottom of the plugin:</p>\n<pre><code>add_action('get_sidebar', removePosthasteInSidebar);\n</code></pre>\n<p>and comment it out by adding two slashes at the beginning of the line:</p>\n<pre><code>//add_action('get_sidebar', removePosthasteInSidebar);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Developers: if there&#8217;s a better way to handle this, I&#8217;d be very appreciative if you&#8217;d let me know because this is an annoying workaround.</em></p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: hierarchical categories now work properly (thanks: @twocolddogs)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: pages now redirect properly after posting with Draft checkbox disabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now choose where you want the form to appear in Settings &gt; Writing &gt; Posthaste Settings. You can display the form on your Front Page (default), Front Page and all archive pages, all pages or only on the archive pages for a specific category.</li>\n<li>You can also now choose whether or not to display the &#8220;Hello&#8221; greeting and admin links.</li>\n<li>Category selection works a little different now. By default, the category dropdown selects your default category, unless you&#8217;re showing the form on a category archive page, in which case it selects the category for that page. If you aren&#8217;t displaying the category dropdown at all, it will post to your default category <em>unless</em> you&#8217;re posting from a category archive page, then it will post to the category of the category archive page you&#8217;re on.</li>\n<li>Tag selection is similar: if you show the form on a tag archive page, that tag is auto-filled in the tag field (if it&#8217;s visible) or auto-added to a new post from that page (if the tag field is not visible).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed gravatars </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added auto-suggest feature to Tags field </li>\n<li>Optional avatar display. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now choose which fields you want to show up under Settings -&gt; Writing -&gt; Posthaste Settings (WP 2.7 only). </li>\n<li>Also adds a checkbox to save your post as a Draft. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Filters HTML out of title field. Just a one-line change. For blogs with a small, private groups of trusted authors who don&#8217;t care about this, feel free to skip this update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
