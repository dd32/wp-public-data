        "description": "<p>Login with Vipps and MobilePay offers super-easy registration and login from the leading smart-payment app in Norway with more than 4.2 million users. MobilePay is used by more than 75 % of Denmark&#8217;s population (4.4 million users), and more than 36 % of Finland&#8217;s population (2.6 million users). There is no easier login. No more usernames or passwords.</p>\n<p>The users need only remember their phone number. They are also able to provide information that websites often require, like e-mail, phone numbers and addresses, from their Vipps MobilePay profile with no tedious data entry.</p>\n<p>The plugin is easy to modify for your own applications.</p>\n<p>This solution is great for all websites that wants to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get more logged-in users</li>\n<li>All Vipps and MobilePay-users can create a profile on your website with just one click, and can be logged in directly on the next visit</li>\n<li>You can modify content, messaging and retrieve stored shopping carts for the user</li>\n<li>Your customers can see order histories and potentially register product returns</li>\n<li>More logged-in users gives you better overview and better conversion rates</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Get started</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a user of Vipps and MobilePay for E-Commerce, you can add Login with Vipps and MobilePay to your account on https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com and find your API-keys there &#8211; see &#8220;Installation&#8221; for more details.</li>\n<li>If you do not have an account with Vipps Mobilepay, you can order this here: https://vippsmobilepay.com/no/priser/logg-inn . When the order has been processed, you will be notified and you will be able to retrieve the API-keys on https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com . Then see &#8220;Installation&#8221; for the next steps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress version 4.9 or above</li>\n<li>PHP version 7.0 or above</li>\n<li>Your website must have an SSL certificate and be available through HTTPS</li>\n<li>OpenSSL must be configured for your PHP installation</li>\n<li>For WooCommerce, the version requirement is 3.3.4 or above</li>\n<li>The port 443 must be open for outward traffic on your servers firewall</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Feature Highlights</h3>\n<h4>Fully integrated with WooCommerce</h4>\n<p>Allows login and registration on your account pages, cart, checkout and via shortcodes. Addresses automatically synchronized with Vipps MobilePay on login.</p>\n<h4>User can register with one click</h4>\n<p>Login with Vipps and MobilePay is the easiest way to create a new account. The user can easily share high-quality data from the user&#8217;s Vipps profile with the site owner. Available information includes name, email, address, phone number, and birth date. The identity of all Vipps users is verified using BankID, Norway&#8217;s leading electronic ID, so rest assured that these are real people with correct name and information. (Please note: Standard WordPress does not register information other than name and email, so apart from WooCommerce, you will need to write code to use this information for your particular application.)</p>\n<h4>Link existing account</h4>\n<p>Already registered users can link their current accounts when signing in with Vipps or from their account page. Users can choose to update their address information from Vipps MobilePay.</p>\n<h4>Customizable for your application</h4>\n<p>You can use the framework of this plugin to implement other solutions that require verified users, without actually requiring login. For example, you might create a system for having users sign their comments with Vipps MobilePay so as to avoid spam issues.</p>\n<h3>Shortcodes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[login-with-vipps text=\"Log in with Vipps (or MobilePay)\" application=\"wordpress\"]</code> &#8211; This will print out a Login with Vipps button that will log you into the given application, which by default can be either WordPress or WooCommerce.</li>\n<li><code>[continue-with-vipps text=\"Continue with Vipps\" application=\"wordpress\"]</code> &#8211; This is the same, except for a different default text</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Customizing the Plugin</h3>\n<p>To use &#8216;Continue with Vipps/MobilePay&#8217; in your application, there are two levels of customizations available, except for a mass of filters and hooks.</p>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;application&#8217; to log into</h4>\n<p>Logging into basic WordPress and into an application like WooCommerce is different in the details, especially with regards to<br />\n  * what page to redirect to (the profile page, or your account page, or maybe the checkout page),<br />\n  * handling of user data (for WooCommerce you want to update the users&#8217; address)<br />\n  * and for error handling.</p>\n<p>For your own application, you may well have other actions you want done after new user registration, logins etc. We aim to provide support for as many applications as possible in time, but to create your own, these are the main steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your application with a name. It should be a simple slug, like &#8216;wordpress&#8217; or &#8216;woocommerce&#8217;</li>\n<li>Create your login button, and make it call the supplied Javascript function &#8220;login_with_vipps&#8221; with your application name as argument.</li>\n<li>To customize, you can now modify several filters and hooks, the most important of which would be:</li>\n<li>&#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your application</em>_login_redirect&#8217;. This takes and returns an error-page redirect, the error string, and the login session data as an array. You can here return your own error page.</li>\n<li>&#8216;continue_with_vipps_before_<em>your application</em>_login_redirect&#8217;. This takes your logged-in user and a session (which can be called as an array) and is called right before the user is redirected. This would be a good place to add a filter to &#8216;login_redirect&#8217; for instance.</li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application</em>_users_can_register&#8217;. Takes a truth value, an array of userinfo from Vipps MobilePay and a session, and should return true only if you allow the user to register</li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application</em>_create_userdata&#8217;. For newly registered users, takes an array to be passed to wp_update_user, an array of userinfo from Vipps MobilePay, and a session. You can here add your extra meta fields</li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application</em>_allow_login&#8217;. Takes a truth value, a user object, userinfo from Vipps MobilePay and a session, and returns true only if the user is allowed to log in</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;action&#8217; apart from logging in</h4>\n<p>You may want to do other things than logging in with the users&#8217; confirmed Vipps MobilePay identity, and this plugin absolutely allows this. This might be submisssions of comments, reviews and so forth without requiring logins, or even just as a convenient way of letting users input their address.</p>\n<p>These are the main steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your own action, like &#8216;submitaddress&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Create your button. The handler should call the static method <code>ContinueWithVipps::getAuthRedirect($action)</code> (you can also provide an array of sessiondata which will be available in your handlers, and restrict the scope of the data to retrieve from Vipps MobilePay. The return value is an URL to which you should redirect your user.</li>\n<li>Create your error handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your action</em>&#8216;. It will receive an error string, a description of the error, sometimes an error hint, and the contents of your session (which will no longer be active). You will need to redirect to your error page here, and show your user the error. The redirect is important, you should not output content in this action.</li>\n<li>Create your succes handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your action</em>&#8216;. It will receive an array of user information from Vipps MobilePay, and a live session. This handler too should end with a redirect to your success page. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rest is a simple matter of programming.</p>\n",

This would be a good place to add a filter to &#8216;login_redirect&#8217; for instance.</li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application</em>_users_can_register&#8217;. Takes a truth value, an array of userinfo from Vipps MobilePay and a session, and should return true only if you allow the user to register</li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application</em>_create_userdata&#8217;. For newly registered users, takes an array to be passed to wp_update_user, an array of userinfo from Vipps MobilePay, and a session. You can here add your extra meta fields</li>\n<li>Filter &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your application</em>_allow_login&#8217;. Takes a truth value, a user object, userinfo from Vipps MobilePay and a session, and returns true only if the user is allowed to log in</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Adding another &#8216;action&#8217; apart from logging in</h4>\n<p>You may want to do other things than logging in with the users&#8217; confirmed Vipps MobilePay identity, and this plugin absolutely allows this. This might be submisssions of comments, reviews and so forth without requiring logins, or even just as a convenient way of letting users input their address.</p>\n<p>These are the main steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your own action, like &#8216;submitaddress&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Create your button. The handler should call the static method <code>ContinueWithVipps::getAuthRedirect($action)</code> (you can also provide an array of sessiondata which will be available in your handlers, and restrict the scope of the data to retrieve from Vipps MobilePay. The return value is an URL to which you should redirect your user.</li>\n<li>Create your error handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_error_<em>your action</em>&#8216;. It will receive an error string, a description of the error, sometimes an error hint, and the contents of your session (which will no longer be active). You will need to redirect to your error page here, and show your user the error. The redirect is important, you should not output content in this action.</li>\n<li>Create your succes handler. This should be hooked to &#8216;continue_with_vipps_<em>your action</em>&#8216;. It will receive an array of user information from Vipps MobilePay, and a live session. This handler too should end with a redirect to your success page. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rest is a simple matter of programming.</p>\n",
