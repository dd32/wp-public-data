Use as many as you like.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20sub-sub%20menu%20items%3F'>\nCan I create sub-sub menu items?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently the plugin works for top-level menu items only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20categories%20and%20pages%3F'>\nWhat about categories and pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are other available solutions for that, but if there is demand I could incorporate it in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20existing%20custom%20post%20type%20posts%20to%20the%20menu%3F'>\nCan I add existing custom post type posts to the menu?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some users have many existing cpt&#8217;s and want to change them to a new menu. This can be done by selecting all your custom post types<br />\nand setting them to &#8216;draft&#8217; status, then back to &#8216;publish&#8217;. The plugin will detect them as new, and they will be added.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20post%20types%20have%20to%20be%20public%3F'>\nWhy do post types have to be public?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Custom post types must be set to public for the plugin to see them. This is because one of the assumptions of not setting a post type<br />\nto public is that &#8216;show_in_nav_menus&#8217; will be false. Obviously this is not the desired outcome of a plugin that automatically adds items<br />\nto a menu.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
