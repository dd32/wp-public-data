        "faq": "\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Custom Field Widget displays the custom field values of a specified custom field key in your sidebar.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have no idea what your answer means.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s fine. Read the <em>Use</em> section for more information on using custom fields and possible applications of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Fine. Can you give me one example of what I could do with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You could use it to display a graphic in the sidebar that you set on a per-post and/or per-page basis. Say you want certain posts/pages to include a graphic that aren&#8217;t necessarily categorized together. Create a custom field with a common key and this widget will display the corresponding values in the sidebar.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>That&#8217;s pretty slick. Give me another example.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. See the <em>Use</em> section and let your imagination run wild.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;d like to modify this plugin in some way unavailable through the widget options panel. Will you help me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. I apologize as I am unable to help with modifications with any of my plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Well, thanks for nothing.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not even thanks for the plugin?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Sure. Thanks for the plugin.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;re welcome. Enjoy.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
