        "installation": "<ul>\n<li>Go to <strong>WordPress Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Plugins</strong> &gt; <strong>Add New</strong> from the left-hand menu</li>\n<li>In the search box type <strong>Bictorys Payment Gateway for WooCommerce</strong></li>\n<li>Click on Install now when you see <strong>Bictorys Payment Gateway for WooCommerce</strong> to install the plugin</li>\n<li>After installation, <strong>activate</strong> the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bictorys Setup and Configuration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Settings</strong> and click on the <strong>Payments</strong> tab</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll see Bictorys listed along with your other payment methods. Click <strong>Set Up</strong></li>\n<li>On the next screen, configure the plugin. There is a selection of options on the screen. Read what each one does below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enable/Disable</strong> &#8211; Check this checkbox to Enable Bictorys on your store&#8217;s checkout</li>\n<li><strong>Title</strong> &#8211; This will represent Bictorys on your list of Payment options during checkout. It guides users to know which option to select to pay with Bictorys. <strong>Title</strong> is set to &#8220;Debit/Credit Cards&#8221; by default, but you can change it to suit your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong> &#8211; This controls the message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page. Use this space to give more details to customers about what Bictorys is and what payment methods they can use with it.</li>\n<li><strong>Test Mode</strong> &#8211; Check this to enable test mode. When selected, the fields in step six will say &#8220;Test&#8221; instead of &#8220;Live.&#8221; Test mode enables you to test payments before going live. The orders process with test payment methods, no money is involved so there is no risk. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Payment Option</strong> &#8211; Select how Bictorys Checkout displays to your customers. A popup displays Bictorys Checkout on the same page, while Redirect will redirect your customer to make payment.</li>\n<li><strong>API Keys</strong> &#8211; The next two text boxes are for your Bictorys API keys, which you can get from your Bictorys Dashboard. If you enabled Test Mode in step four, then you&#8217;ll need to use your test API keys here. Otherwise, you can enter your live keys.</li>\n<li><strong>Additional Settings</strong> &#8211; While not necessary for the plugin to function, there are some extra configuration options you have here. You can do things like add custom metadata to your transactions (the data will show up on your Bictorys dashboard) or use Bictorys&#8217;s <a href=\"https://bictorys.com/docs/payments/split-payments\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Split Payment feature</a>. The tooltips next to the options provide more information on what they do.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> to update the settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To account for poor network connections, which can sometimes affect order status updates after a transaction, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you set a Webhook URL on your Bictorys dashboard. This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we&#8217;ll send a notification to the Webhook URL, which will update the order and mark it as paid. You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your Bictorys dashboard under <strong>Settings &gt; API Keys &amp; Webhooks</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>If you do not find Bictorys on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ve checked the <strong>&#8220;Enable/Disable&#8221;</strong> checkbox</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve entered your <strong>API Keys</strong> in the appropriate field</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve clicked on <strong>Save Changes</strong> during setup</li>\n</ul>\n",
