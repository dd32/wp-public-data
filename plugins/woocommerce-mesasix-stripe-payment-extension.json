        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I use this plugin in a test mode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Stripe is made for developers and testing is a huge part of that. Just be sure to get your api and publishable keys at Stripe.com.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need SSL in test mode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. But you can use ssl while in test mode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need SSL in production mode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We recommend using SSL to safeguard your users from additional risks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any filters for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, all frontend texts can be managed via the backend settings and frontend images (payment form icons and images) can changed by using these two filters: mesasix_stripe_checkout_icon and mesasix_stripe_cards_icon. We will be adding more features in the next release.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this safe?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. We take security seriously and if you find holes, let us know by emailing us at matthew[at]mesasix.com.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
