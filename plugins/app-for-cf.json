        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20guest%20page%20caching%20work%3F'>\nHow does the Guest Page Caching work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s done by using a Cloudflare Cache Rule that makes HTML pages eligible to be cached. Making a page eligible doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it always cached (for example if a user is logged into the site or the request is a POST, you wouldn&#8217;t want the page to be cached). No need for any kludgey cache busting mechanism that alters your URLs.</p>\n<p>This allows it to be done in a &#8220;clean&#8221; way, without the need for Cloudflare&#8217;s Automatic Platform Optimization (APO) plugin/subscription (normally $5/month for Cloudflare Free plans). It also does not require the added complexity or expense of Workers (Workers are billed per request). Additionally it does not require the use of a Page Rule slot on your Cloudflare zone.</p>\n<p><strong>This plugin can do Guest Page Caching for free, for everyone.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20test%20improvements%20on%20my%20site%20when%20using%20guest%20page%20caching%3F'>\nHow can I test improvements on my site when using Guest Page Caching?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An easy way to test it is with a testing tool like <a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GTmetrix</a>. Test it without Guest Page Caching enabled and test it again with Guest Page Caching enabled and compare the results.</p>\n<p>If you are a little more technical, you can look at the <code>cf-cache-status</code> HTTP header on the page request. If you see a value of <code>HIT</code>, the request is being successfully being served from Cloudflare&#8217;s edge cache.</p>\n<p>If you want to compare the speed of WordPress sites from different cities, try these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://speedvitals.com/ttfb-test?url=https://ma.tt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Matt Mullenweg</a> (not using this plugin)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://speedvitals.com/ttfb-test?url=https://shawnhogan.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shawn Hogan</a> (using this plugin)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20multisite%20networks%3F'>\nDoes this work with multisite networks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Not only does it work as a standard plugin on any site within the network, it can be deployed as a &#8220;network activated&#8221; plugin (automatically available to all sites within the network). Additionally, there are settings available to the network admins where you can optionally set a default API token (that is used, but not disclosed to the individual sites). Individual sites can set a different API token to override the network-wide token if needed. This is useful in a scenario where all (or most) of the sites in the network are on the same Cloudflare account and can share the same API token.</p>\n<p>The Pro version allows a single Cloudflare R2 bucket to be used for storing the media for all sites in the multisite network.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20locked%20myself%20out%20of%20settings'>\nI locked myself out of settings\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an option to allow settings to be changed only by one specific admin account. If you use that setting, and then lose or change the admin account you assigned to that role, it can be problematic. If you need to bypass that option, you can by adding the following to your WordPress <strong>wp-config.php</strong> file:</p>\n<pre><code>define('CLOUDFLARE_BYPASS_USER_LOCK', true);\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20an%20idea%20for%20this%20plugin%2C%20can%20i%20make%20a%20suggestion%3F'>\nI have an idea for this plugin, can I make a suggestion?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, please do!

Viewing (and editing) settings is significantly faster now (it&#8217;s as fast as the single slowest API call, rather than as slow as all 10 API calls added together).</li>\n<li>Raised timeout for Cloudflare API calls from 5 seconds to 15 seconds</li>\n<li>For multisite/network installations, there is a new settings page that allows you to set some network-side settings (for example the API token to use) across all sites without specifically setting it for each site.  See Network Admin -&gt; Settings -&gt; Cloudflare</li>\n<li>If there&#8217;s a multisite network API token set, an individual site can still override that API token (allows a situation where most sites are on a single Cloudflare account can use the network-side API token, but the ones that aren&#8217;t can still specify a different one)</li>\n<li>Added info page about using R2 in a multisite setup (using a single bucket for all sites)</li>\n<li>Added sanity check (make sure it exists) when attempting to display an actioned template</li>\n<li>Added more sanity checks for unexpected Cloudflare API results</li>\n<li>The intel tools (IP address details, Domain details, WHOIS) can&#8217;t be used (and are removed from the navigation) if a site doesn&#8217;t have their own API token (in a scenario where they are using a default multisite network API token). This is because there is a <em>very</em> small monthly quota for API calls for the entire Cloudflare account/API token (around 100 per month).</li>\n<li>Fixed issue with HTTP Request Trace tool</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.7 (2023-11-03)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added link for info about why each Cloudflare token permission is needed</li>\n<li>Increased the number of URLs being purged per API call from 8 to 30</li>\n<li>Suppress API rate limit error message when using guest page caching and the backend is purging individual URLs from Cloudflare&#8217;s cache (if there are a ton of posts being added at once, or edited quickly over and over, a site might hit rate limits after about 40 new posts/edits/comments in a single minute). Since it&#8217;s not catastrophic if a cache purge didn&#8217;t successfully run, we are just going to ignore the failure and let the cache expire on its own.</li>\n<li>Better handling of situation where Cloudflare API is down/unavailable</li>\n<li>Changed how menus are built (old method was deprecated in PHP 8.x)</li>\n<li>Removed &#8220;Security -&gt; Privacy Pass Support&#8221; setting (it&#8217;s been deprecated by Cloudflare and is no longer used)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.6.1 (2023-10-25)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean up some layout anomalies when using a right-to-left language</li>\n<li>The Cloudflare Fonts option ID has changed. This addresses that (it&#8217;s what I get for giving the ability to toggle options that Cloudflare has deemed &#8220;beta&#8221;&#8230; they are subject to change).</li>\n<li>Added a sanity check so if future option IDs change, it won&#8217;t throw an error (along with not being able to change them). Instead, that option won&#8217;t change until the ID is updated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.6 (2023-10-22)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue where boolean settings wouldn&#8217;t always be parsed to boolean values</li>\n<li>Fixed issue where HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings wouldn&#8217;t always be changeable</li>\n<li>Added support for Super Bot Fight Mode settings: Likely Automated, Definitely Automated, Verified Bots, Static Resource Protection, Optimize For WordPress, JavaScript Detections</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.5.1 (2023-10-21)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Better handling of unexpected Cloudflare API changes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.5 (2023-10-19)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with modal confirmation dialog not scrolling when it goes off the screen (mainly an issue when enabling R2 for media from a mobile devices)</li>\n<li>Cloudflare made a change to the bot management API (but only for paid plans), this version addresses that.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.4 (2023-10-12)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue where a settings page redirect would fail because WordPress had already output HTML in some cases</li>\n<li>Cosmetic clean-up here and there</li>\n<li>Notice in Media section about using/setting up R2 is dismissible</li>\n<li>Added support for new Cloudflare setting: Speed -&gt; Optimization -&gt; Content Optimization -&gt; Cloudflare Fonts</li>\n<li>&#8220;Easy config&#8221; enables Cloudflare Fonts</li>\n<li>Settings that are deemed beta by Cloudflare, are shown with a beta label</li>\n<li>Better handling of cases where there&#8217;s an error when making an API request</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.3 (2023-10-05)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release of App for Cloudflare® for WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WordPress version is kept in feature parity with the XenForo version.
