        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Extract the randomquotes.zip archive into a temporary folder on your PC.  It should extract to a folder named &#8220;randomquotes&#8221;.  If it doesn&#8217;t, create a folder named &#8220;randomquotes&#8221; and move randomquotes.php and quotes.txt into it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I recommend using the default quotes to get your plugin running.  Then when it&#8217;s running fine, replace the quotes in quotes.txt with your favorite quotes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each quote in quotes.txt is made up of the text of the quote, a delimiter character, and the quote&#8217;s author.  The delimiter is the character &#8220;#&#8221; by default, but you can choose a different delimiter character if you know how to edit randomquotes.php and change the corresponding character there.  I recommend not changing the delimiter if you don&#8217;t have to.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t use the &#8220;#&#8221; character in the text of your quote.</p>\n<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t leave any blank lines in the very bottom of the quotes.txt file.  randomquotes.php will try to display those also and you might get an error message on your page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Copy the entire folder named &#8220;randomquotes&#8221; from your PC into the folder named &#8220;plugins&#8221; in your WordPress site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through WordPress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Place &#8220;&#8221; in your WordPress HTML page where you want the quotes displayed.  For example, in the http://www.amorian.org site I put my random quotes at the bottom of my right-side sidebar in sidebar.php.  I created a category of &#8220;Quotes&#8221; and put the quote generator under it like this:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Recent Entries</h3>\n<ul></ul>\n<h3>Connect</h3>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quotes</h3>\n<p>           <!-- I added this line, and --><br />\n         <!-- I added this line --></p>\n"
