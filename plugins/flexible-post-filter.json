Using the General Options Menu, you have the option to filter Posts by some or all of the Categories assigned to your Posts.</p>\n<p>CSS Options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Top Menu Alignment &#8211;  Choose the alignment of the Top Filter Menu at the top of the screen &#8211; Left, Right &amp; Center.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thumbnail Border &#8211; Select the Border Color that surrounds each Post Thumbnail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Button Colors &#8211; Change the following Top Filter Menu button colors: Background, Selection, Hover &amp; Text Color.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Click &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; to update the plugin.</p>\n<p>Caption Options &#8211; Within the Captions Options Menu, you have the ability to choose what fields (if any) are displayed below the Post Thumbnail.

        "faq": "<p>Q: Why Don&#8217;t All of my Categories Appear in the Flexible Post Filter &#8220;General Options&#8221; Menu?</p>\n<p>A: Only the Categories assigned to Posts will appear in the General Options Menu. For example, if you created the category &#8220;Summer,&#8221; but have not assigned the &#8220;Summer&#8221; category to any Posts, it will not appear in the General Options Menu.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I filter based on multiple category levels?</p>\n<p>A: No, Flexible Post Filter only filters at one level such as Post &gt; Categories. It does not filter at multiple levels such as Post &gt; Parent Categories &gt; Child Categories.</p>\n<p>Q: Can Flexible Post Filter filter correctly if multiple categories are assigned to the same Post?</p>\n<p>A: Yes, Flexible Post Filter will display the single Post in all of the category filters. For example, if Post 1 is categorized as both &#8220;Summer&#8221; and &#8220;Spring,&#8221; the plugin will display Post 1 within both the &#8220;Summer&#8221; and &#8220;Spring&#8221; category filters.</p>\n<p>Q: Everything in Flexible Post Filter was working correctly, and then a Category field disappeared. What happened?</p>\n<p>A: If you are using Flexible Post Filter and you change the name of a selected Category &#8211; you must go back to the WordPress Dashboard &gt; Post Filter and reselect the newly named Category for the plugin to continue operating correctly.</p>\n",
