The plugin will not generate new summary posts until you select a posting frequency and click on Save Settings at the bottom. </li>\n<li>The plugin will automatically create a new post and publish it at the begining of the next month, next week, or next day depending on the frequency you chose, so theres nothing more to do \ud83d\ude42</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What benefit does a summary post provide?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For bloggers, it provides many benefits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When will the first post be created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Best Posts Summary will create the first summary post on the next date for the given frequency. If you install it on October 2nd, 200X and choose a frequency of Monthly, the first post will be created automatically at 12:01 AM on November 1st, 200X. For Weekly, Sunday is considered the &#8220;first&#8221; day of the week.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have a summary post created for previous time periods?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time, Best Posts Summary only works AFTER the date you install it. It will not create summary posts for previous months, weeks, or days.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the title of the summary post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. On the plugin Settings page, you&#8217;ll see a list of dynamic tags that you can insert into the Title box to fully customize your summary post title. By default, it is set to Best posts on [blog-name] from [month] [year].</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is strict criteria?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Strict Criteria is an option to be used in case you choose Comments as your criteria for selecting the best posts for a particular period and the number of posts returned does not equal the number of posts you specify that you want in your summary post. For example, if a summary post is created in November for the previous month based on the number of comments and 10 posts are to be included in that post, then the situation where there are only 5 posts with comments and the rest with no comments can occur. In that case, selecting Strict Criteria will only show those 5 posts with comments. Un-selecting Strict Criteria will also include posts without any comments in order to get up to 10 posts in the summary post.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
