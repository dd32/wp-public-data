You can see <code>PUSH PROMISE</code> signals from the server and the pushed resources after the main page is sent.</li>\n<li>In Google Chrome, <a href=\"//net-internals/#spdy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">chrome://net-internals/#spdy</a> will show a history of server connections from the browser. Clicking on a connection will show the discussion between the browser and the server. Within that text, you can see <code>PUSH PROMISE</code> packets and the pushed resources.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t some css styles in the head of thye document pushed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin relies on all assets being enqueued by the time the wp_enqueue_scripts action is run. However css styles can be enqueued and still appear in the head as late as the wp_print_styles action. This is porr design but IU can&#8217;t control other plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I modify the urls that are pushed to the browser by this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes there is a filter lh_htt2_server_push_urls. This filter takes the input of an associaytive array with the urls being the key and the file type being the value. By using this filter you can add, remove or modify all the pushed urls.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
