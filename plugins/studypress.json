You have just to add it into your site menu as a menu element. Go to &#8220;Appearance&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Menus&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Course&#8221;, check your course and click &#8220;Add to Menu&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you have not activated yet the course option in the menu dashboard, you have to go to &#8220;Dashboard&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Appearance&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Menus&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Screen options&#8221; -&gt; and check &#8220;Course&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n\n"
