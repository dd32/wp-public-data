If you install one of these, your security module will send out an email alert and give you a warning in WordPress.</p>\n<p>SecuPress takes security further by limiting plugin activation, deactivation, installation and removal in your production (live) website. Plugin and theme uploads via .zip files will be on lockdown as well to block off this easy hacking route.</p>\n<p><strong>WordPress Core</strong><br />\nSecuPress reinforces the WordPress Core to keep it safe.

The plugin backs up your database and files and lets you download them to guarantee you peace of mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Anti Spam</strong><br />\nDid you know that 60% of the traffic on the Internet is generated by bots? Most of them happen to be spam bots. We developed our own anti-spam system that works quietly in the background. Just activate it and enjoy a spam free experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Alerts</strong><br />\nAlerts are an essential tool when your website is under attack.

This lets you keep an eye on what’s going on in your WordPress at any time. You can also control banned IPs from this option.</p>\n<p><em>(1) Available in the <a href=\"https://secupress.me/features/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Version</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>(SecuPress est une extension de sécurité WordPress française)</em></p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20secupress%20do%2C%20exactly%3F'>\nWhat does SecuPress do, exactly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SecuPress is a WordPress plugin that enhances security without compromising usability or performance. It&#8217;s user-friendly for you and resilient against hacking attempts. Initially, SecuPress scans your site to identify vulnerabilities and provides a report with suggestions for strengthening your WordPress security. Most recommendations can be easily implemented by checking a box, with only a few requiring manual setup.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20sets%20secupress%20apart%20from%20other%20security%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat sets SecuPress apart from other security plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SecuPress safeguards your website from various threats, with its standout feature being its user-friendliness. You don&#8217;t have to be a seasoned technician to effectively use and secure your WordPress site like a pro!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20secupress%20compatible%20with%20multisites%20installation%3F'>\nIs SecuPress compatible with multisites installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, SecuPress can be activated for all your sub-sites, just activate it from your main network site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20secupress%20compatible%20with%20all%20web%20hosters%3F'>\nIs SecuPress compatible with all web hosters?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, SecuPress is compatible with all web hosters like o2switch, Hosterra, 1and1, OVH, Siteground, BlueHost, PlanetHoster, WP Engine or GoDaddy? If you encounter an issue, do not hesitate to contact our support team.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20secupress%20compatible%20with%20all%20caching%20plugins%20like%20wp%20rocket%2C%20wp%20fastest%20cache%2C%20w3%20total%20cache%2C%20wp%20super%20cache%3F'>\nIs SecuPress compatible with all caching plugins like WP Rocket, WP Fastest Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, SecuPress is compatible with all WordPress caching plugins. If you encounter an issue, do not hesitate to contact our support team.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20secupress%20compatible%20with%20all%20multilingual%20plugins%20like%20weglot%2C%20polylang%2C%20wpml%2C%20qtranslate%3F'>\nIs SecuPress compatible with all multilingual plugins like WeGlot, PolyLang, WPML, qTranslate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, SecuPress is compatible with all multilingual WordPress plugins. If you have an issue, please get in touch with us and let us know!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20secupress%20compatible%20with%20all%20server%20engines%20like%20apache%2C%20nginx%2C%20iis7%3F'>\nIs SecuPress compatible with all server engines like Apache, Nginx, IIS7?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, SecuPress is compatible with all server engines. If you encounter an issue, do not hesitate to contact our support team.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20secupress%20compatible%20with%20other%20security%20plugins%20like%20wordfence%2C%20solid%20security%2C%20sucuri%20security%2C%20bullet%20proof%20security%3F'>\nIs SecuPress compatible with other security plugins like WordFence, Solid Security, Sucuri Security, Bullet Proof Security?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The answer is yes and no. A security plugin should work alone. Just like two caching plugins do not make your website faster, two security plugins do not make your WordPress more secure. Security rules tend to be overwritten or conflict with other rules if two security plugins are installed. This can cause errors on your website and is not recommended. So, you can try, but we do not recommend it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
