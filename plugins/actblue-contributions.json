Look for hosts that have a dedicated support team, provide SSL, manage WordPress updates, and proactively scan for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and attacks.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/https-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"ugc\">HTTPS</a> URLs for your entire site, especially WordPress core files (starting with <code>wp-</code>). <strong>ActBlue embeds won’t work on non-HTTPS URLs</strong>.</li>\n<li>Protect access to the WordPress Dashboard by using <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/password-dos-and-donts/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">strong passwords</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/\" rel=\"ugc\">Two-Factor Authentication</a> (2FA)</li>\n<li>Limit the number of admin users by <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/wordpress-user-roles-and-permissions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">using user roles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts-reloaded/\" rel=\"ugc\">Limit login attempts</a> to prevent account credential brute force attacks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/hardening-wordpress/#disable-file-editing\" rel=\"ugc\">Disable file editing</a> from within the WordPress Dashboard</li>\n<li>Keep a WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-security-audit-log/\" rel=\"ugc\">activity log</a> and web request logs and review them regularly for unexpected events. These may be an indication that an admin is behaving maliciously, or that an attacker has gained access to an admin account.</li>\n<li>Be wary of email messages requesting that you log into your WordPress account (i.e. <a href=\"https://securityintelligence.com/news/new-wordpress-phishing-campaigns-target-user-credentials/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">phishing attacks</a>) and/or upload plugins manually</li>\n<li>Protect against denial-of-service and other attacks by putting up a Web Application Firewall (WAF) such as <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cloudflare</a> in front of your site.</li>\n<li>Set up routine audits of your site codebase using a malware scanning plugin such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordFence</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/\" rel=\"ugc\">iThemes Security</a>, or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/\" rel=\"ugc\">Sucuri Security</a>.</li>\n<li>Continuously back up up your site through your hosting provider or a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/vaultpress/\" rel=\"ugc\">VaultPress</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/\" rel=\"ugc\">UpdraftPlus</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Be careful when installing third-party themes or plugins</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Only install plugins from trusted sources like the official WordPress.org plugin repository.</li>\n<li>Do your due diligence — does it work with the latest version of WordPress?

All of these questions are easily answered by reviewing the WP.org plugin listing and support forum.</li>\n<li>Minimize the number of installed plugins on your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Keep it up-to-date</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/updating-wordpress/#automatic-background-updates\" rel=\"ugc\">automatic updates</a> for WordPress core and third-party plugins or themes.</li>\n<li>Make sure custom theme or plugin components are tested against new WordPress releases.</li>\n<li>Make sure your server OS and system packages like PHP and MySQL are up-to-date.
