For example if your site contains some posts featuring<br />\nadult humour or profanity, family friendly allows you to present a &#8216;pg&#8217; or &#8216;u&#8217; version to younger users of the site. It also allows users to view the site safely at work, or in a public environment.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>It is recommended that you fully back up your site before attempting to add a new plugin.</p>\n<p>Copy the plugin folder, named &#8216;family-friendly&#8217; to the plugins folder of your WordPress installation, located at wp-content/plugins.</p>\n<p>Next have a look in the settings section of your WordPress admin panel. You should see Family Friendly listed. Click this to adjust the words filtered by<br />\nfamily friendly at the &#8216;u&#8217;, &#8216;pg&#8217; and &#8217;18&#8217; levels.</p>\n<p>If a user selects the &#8216;u&#8217; level, the plugin will filter posts using the words at the &#8216;u&#8217;, &#8216;pg&#8217; and &#8217;18&#8217; levels. Selecting the &#8216;pg&#8217; level will ignore &#8216;u&#8217; level<br />\nwords, but use words in the &#8216;pg&#8217; and &#8217;18&#8217; levels. Selecting the &#8217;18&#8217; level uses just the words in the &#8217;18&#8217; level. These are effectively always banned.<br />\nPosts, post titles and comments are filtered.</p>\n<p>Posts are filtered for normal users only. They are not filtered for admin use<br />\nand will all still be fully visible within the admin area.</p>\n<p>You can choose which settings to make available to users via the widget.<br />\nYou can also choose to hide the widget from users should you wish by changing<br />\nthe appropriate setting.</p>\n<p>To change the images used for the level settings, replace the images in the<br />\nfamily-friendly/img folder with others of your choice. Ideally these should<br />\nclosely match the size and aspect ratio of the original images, or be resized<br />\nas needed.</p>\n<p>Adding the Widget</p>\n<p>Family friendly allows users to select filtering levels via a widget. To add the widget to your page, first look at the appearance section of the WordPress<br />\nadmin panel. Select widgets from the options available. On the left half of the screen you should see Family Friendly listed among the available widgets. On the<br />\nright of the screen should be titles of the areas of the page which use widgets.<br />\nTo add the Family Friendly widget, drag it from the left of the screen to the area on the right you wish to add it to. If there are multiple widgets in this<br />\narea, you can drag it up or down to fine tune its position relative to other widgets. After doing this, you should now be able to see the widget on your<br />\nmain page (after refreshing).</p>\n<p>Once the widget has been added, users can select the levels to filter the site according to their preference.</p>\n",
