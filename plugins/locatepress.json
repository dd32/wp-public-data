        "description": "<p>The all-new Locatepress is a WordPress-based plugin that is set to handle directories based on a geographic location. Working on many WordPress platforms this plugin is highly versatile in creating and managing one&#8217;s directory. It includes extensive new shortcodes which are supported by the TinyMCE and Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZIwl6slpgE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>THE BEST LOCATION-BASED DIRECTORY PLUGIN</h3>\n<p>Locatepress allows the user to create a location-based directory easily. This is compatible with any theme and page builders. Similar to the GeoDirectory plugin, Locatepress is a powerful and comprehensive tool for WordPress.</p>\n<h3>EASY SCALING- MANAGING DIRECTORIES GLOBALLY</h3>\n<p>Having a highly optimized database, Locatepress functions well in managing large-scale listings and tackles massive traffic. Creating a directory on the basis of location which comprehends the globe is easy with this plugin.</p>\n<h3>VERSATILITY, EFFICIENT, AND EASY TO USE</h3>\n<p>Being a shortcode-based plugin LocatPress works in every WordPress-based theme and page builder. Creating and managing directories for multiple businesses is made easier as it keeps track of the directories based on address and image. Your new directory is a few clicks away.</p>\n<h3>SHORTCODES AND API KEYS</h3>\n<p>Locatepress uses the shortcode [locatepress_search_bar] to create a search field for your directory, enabling you to easily create or locate your business on the map. A shortcode is something that replaces content into a more dynamic form, produced by a PHP function. It is located as macros “[ ]” in WordPress. Also, using the API key gives access to all the places included in the google map. So, now it is easy for the user to create their desired database and set up an efficient directory.</p>\n<h3>FEATURES</h3>\n<p>Create a local directory, based on geographic location.<br />\nEasy search and management capability.<br />\nWorks great on TinyMCE, Gutenberg, and many more themes and page builders.<br />\nDynamic</p>\n",
