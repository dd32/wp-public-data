We no longer support Simplecast V1 API. If you haven&#8217;t upgraded your Simplecast account, then this plugin will not work. Made various other improvements and accommodations for the new Simplecast API. Also &#8211; clear your cache to reflect the new updates.</p>\n<h4>0.2.2</h4>\n<p>Removed podcasts in draft mode from being visible.</p>\n<h4>0.2.1</h4>\n<p>Re-added the ability to add links directly to the episode.</p>\n<h4>0.2.0</h4>\n<p>Support for API V2 is here! Couple of notes: because the new API change, the link to view the full episode is disabled in this version (support for that is coming soon). Control over the amount of episodes shown and pagination is coming soon too. This had to be reconfigured due to the new API as well.</p>\n<h4>0.1.4</h4>\n<p>Small bug fixes.</p>\n<h4>0.1.3</h4>\n<p>Two new shortcode attributes: hide_player and link_text. hide_player optionally hides the embedded player (use &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221;) while link_text changes the text that links to your Simplecast page for that podcast.</p>\n<h4>0.1.2</h4>\n<p>Added the ability to limit the amount of podcast episodes shown through the use of the limit attribute.</p>\n<h4>0.1.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed compatible WordPress version.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>Initial Revision</p>\n"
