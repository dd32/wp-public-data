        "description": "<p><strong>Password Sentry</strong> (PS) is the <strong>must-have</strong> application for every membership site! We developed and released Password Sentry in 1999. Password Sentry was groundbreaking as the first application of its kind. Password Sentry continues to be groundbreaking as we grow and re-invent Password Sentry to continue to be the leader in the industry &#8211; exceeding anything our competition offers. Password Sentry is an affordable and reliable tool used by thousands of clients to secure and protect thousands of websites from password trading and dictionary / brute force attacks: saving webmasters hundreds or thousands of dollars each year in extra bandwidth, and lost sales. Password Sentry is a free Open Source App.</p>\n<p>WordPress (WP) has become a CMS (Content Management System) for many webmasters. In particular, paysite webmasters who offer paid memberships. To that end, we have seen an explosion of apps and WP plugins that enhance the membership functionality of WP. Our plugin is the perfect fit to WP and those plugins. PasswordSentry Plugin hooks into the WP Login to track and log logins to detect and block password sharing and compromised passwords. The PasswordSentry Plugin protects your members and your WP from hackers trying to access your members WP accounts. It also protects your bottom line if you run a paysite by blocking members from sharing their passwords with others. The PasswordSentry Plugin depends on the Password Sentry App: <a href=\"https://www.password-sentry.com/\" title=\"Password Sentry\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Password Sentry</a>. The Password Sentry App includes a standalone, web-based control panel (PS AdminCP) to manage Password Sentry App and logged WP users.</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> Detect and block password sharing via UserTracking and GeoTracking technology</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> Web-based control panel to administer Password Sentry App, and monitor / manage users</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> Priority Support [Fee-Based]</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> FREE Regular Forum Support</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> FREE updates</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> Unlimited Domains</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> Capability to block logins from specified countries, and/or IP addresses</p>\n<p><strong>o</strong> Monitor and throttle per-user bandwidth</p>\n<p>Before you use this plugin, you must FIRST install the Password Sentry App. Once the Password Sentry App is fully installed and configured, you can then activate and configure the PasswordSentry Plugin. This plugin monitors WP logins, checking for password sharing. If password sharing is detected for a given user, that user is automatically suspended, and you are emailed. Suspended users can either be manually restored via PS AdminCP, or you can setup a cron job to automatically restore suspended users after XX minutes.</p>\n",

Configure remaining settings, and click on the <strong>[Save Preferences]</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install the PasswordSentry Plugin using the built-in WordPress Plugin Installer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From WP Admin Dashboard, click on <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong> menu link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find PasswordSentry Plugin, and click on the <strong>Activate</strong> link.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on the <strong>Settings</strong> link. Then check the <strong>{Enabled}</strong> checkbox. Enter <strong>{API URL}</strong> which is the URL to your sentry.php PS tracking script (located in your Password Sentry App installation directory). Then, click on the <strong>[Save]</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that the plugin will only be active when (1) Password Sentry App is installed, (2) {PS API Endpoint URL} is defined, and (3) {Status} is set to Enabled.</p>\n",
