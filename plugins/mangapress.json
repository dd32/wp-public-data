        "faq": "<p><em>I&#8217;m using the bundled theme for TwentyEleven, -Twelve, or -Thirteen but the Custom CSS and/or Insert Navigation options have no effect? Or they add a second navigation bar</em></p>\n<p>This is because the navigation for the comics is built into the theme. Using a different theme or overriding the default theme&#8217;s template will allow you to use the options. (however, see <a href=\"https://github.com/jesgs/mangapress/issues/17\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #17</a> for additional issues)</p>\n<p><em>Does Manga+Press work on WordPress Multi-site?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, it does. However, a few steps must be taken to make Manga+Press&#8217; child-themes available to your network. See the question below on the steps to take to enable the child-themes on Multisite.</p>\n<p><em>The bundled themes aren&#8217;t available in WordPress Multi-site. What&#8217;s going on?</em></p>\n<p>This is because the plugin hasn&#8217;t been activated for the entire MS network. In order for the child-themes to be available, Manga+Press must be available to the entire network. This can be done by going to <strong>Network Admin &gt; Plugins</strong> and clicking the <em>Network Activate</em> link for Manga+Press. Once this is done, then both the parent- and child-themes need to made available to the network as well. This can be accomplished by going to <strong>Network Admin &gt; Themes</strong>, selecting the themes in question, choosing <strong>Bulk Actions &gt; Network Enable</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press responsive?</em></p>\n<p>Not by itself. However, Manga+Press doesn&#8217;t really output markup other than the comic navigation. Responsiveness depends on the theme that is being used. The themes bundled with Manga+Press — the TwentyEleven thru TwentyFourteen child-themes — all have some level of responsiveness that is dependent on their parent themes.</p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press compatible with Advanced Custom Fields</em></p>\n<p>Yes, it is! Manga+Press is simply a stripped down custom post-type with a custom Featured Image meta-box. Like any other post-type, you can add a new field group using ACF — however, you <em>will</em> have to configure your theme to display these custom fields.</p>\n<p><em>Is Manga+Press compatible with the WPML plugin?</em></p>\n<p>I have never had the chance to test Manga+Press with the WPML plugin so I can&#8217;t really guarantee compatibility. Since Manga+Press works like a standard WordPress post, and WPML <em>is</em> compatible with custom post-types, this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>\n<p><em>Do you take feature requests?</em></p>\n<p>I do take feature requests, but I also judge each request on the basis of how well the new feature fits into Manga+Press&#8217; current functionality and also how feasible the new feature is to implement into Manga+Press&#8217; core.</p>\n",
