        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I edit the design</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you just want to change the colours, fonts, padding etc you can use your theme&#8217;s own style.css file to override the styles used in the plugin.<br />\nIf you want to edit the design even more navigate to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/wp-testimonials-and-reviews/templates/</code> directory. Copy this folder and paste it in to your theme&#8217;s folder. Now rename your newly pasted folder &#8220;wpurf&#8221;. You are now able to edit all the files within the &#8216;wpurf&#8217; folder. Please take care not to remove or rename div elements with ID and Name tags as these may be required for the plugin to work correctly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin support Schemas or Microdata?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This FREE version does not support Schemas or Microdata.<br />\nThe PRO version provides Schemas (mircodata) for Products and Brands, and allows you to create multiple review types, for the entire website, one specific web page and/or a specific product.<br />\nTo download the full version go to https://www.jamestibbles.co.uk/wp-ultimate-reviews-pro/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I target the reviews to a specific page or product on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This FREE version does not support this.<br />\nThe PRO version allows you to create multiple review types, for the entire website, one specific web page and/or a specific product.<br />\nTo download the full version go to https://www.jamestibbles.co.uk/wp-ultimate-reviews-pro/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I need help</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please leave a message in the comments area of the official page at https://www.jamestibbles.co.uk/wp-ultimate-reviews/ and I&#8217;ll get back to you.
