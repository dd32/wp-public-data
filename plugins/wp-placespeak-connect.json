        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.placespeak.com/connect/about/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PlaceSpeak Connect</a> is a geographic digital identity authentication application programming interface, or GeoID API. It allows third party applications and websites to verify the location of its users. PlaceSpeak Connect tests a user&#8217;s address or location against a predetermined area of interest, producing geographically relevant results.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows organizations to use PlaceSpeak connect in conjunction with the WordPress commenting system to geo-verify commenters, without the need to write any code.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>Your domain must use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HTTPS</a> in order for the plugin to work. Communication with the PlaceSpeak server happens according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OAuth2</a> authorization protocol, and OAuth2 requires that network communication happen over encrypted HTTPS (which is just a good idea anyway).</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Admin can add apps using app key, app secret, and a standard redirect_uri</li>\n<li>&#8220;Connect With PlaceSpeak&#8221; button available as shortcode or as part of a commenting form</li>\n<li>Commenters that authorize PlaceSpeak will also have verification information, names, and region labels relative to app saved as meta information with comment</li>\n<li>Allows admin to store user information in <code>WP_USERS</code> table or custom <code>placespeak_user</code> table</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<h4>Creating a PlaceSpeak Connect app and connecting it to WordPress</h4>\n<p>To use PlaceSpeak Connect to verify your WordPress commenters, you must first create one or more new API &#8220;apps&#8221; within PlaceSpeak, and update the WordPress plugin to be aware of them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t have one, create a new (free) user account on PlaceSpeak.com.</li>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t have one, create a new (free) organization account on PlaceSpeak.com. (Currently this requires clicking on the <em>Start a Consultation</em> link and following through to the organization creation step.</li>\n<li>In your organizational dashboard, click on the <em>PlaceSpeak Connect</em> tab, and create a new API client instance (better documentation for this step to come).</li>\n<li>In your WordPress admin interface, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>PlaceSpeak</em></li>\n<li>Copy the <em>Redirect URL</em> from the top of the page. Back in PlaceSpeak, paste the URL into the <em>Redirect URI</em> field in the settings page for your new API app, and press save.</li>\n<li>Copy and paste the app key and app secret from PlaceSpeak into the <em>Add New PlaceSpeak App</em> form in WordPress. Also give the app a name (presumably the same one you used when creating it in PlaceSpeak).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that you can choose to have PlaceSpeak verification information added directly onto the normal WordPress users table, or you can set the plugin to save that information is a separate table.</p>\n<h4>Using PlaceSpeak connect to verify commenters</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new page or post. Ensure commenting is turned on.</li>\n<li>From the <em>Select PlaceSpeak App</em> dropdown in the editor, choose the app you just added.</li>\n<li>Save your post and view it. There should now be an optional button for verifying PlaceSpeak users who submit a comment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Using PlaceSpeak connect to verify form submissions</h4>\n<p>In addition to the standard PlaceSpeak commenting function, WP-PlaceSpeak-Connect can work with form plugins. Currently this has only been tested with Contact Form 7.</p>\n<p>The usage with forms is the same as for regular post comments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" rel=\"ugc\">Contact Form 7</a> plugin.</li>\n<li>Create a new page or post.</li>\n<li>From the <em>Select PlaceSpeak App</em> dropdown in the editor, choose the app you just added.</li>\n<li>Save your post and view it.
