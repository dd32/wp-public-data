Simply insert the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> quicktag while editing a post, and WordPress will display the text that comes before it as a teaser followed by a Read More link to the rest of the post. When a reader follows the link, the single-post page is loaded and the browser jumps to the unread text.</p>\n<p>This jump can be disorienting, and some bloggers prefer to link their teasers to the full posts instead of the unread text.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where the StripTease plugin comes in. It automatically strips the #more fragments from the end of your teaser links and turns them into links to your full posts.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>The StripTease plugin automatically changes your teaser links from this:</p>\n<pre><code>http://guyfisher.com/2005/09/striptease/#more-6\n</code></pre>\n<p>To this:</p>\n<pre><code>http://guyfisher.com/2005/09/striptease/\n</code></pre>\n",

Once it&#8217;s activated, it will immediately begin stripping the #more fragments from the end of your teaser links.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20use%20%22pretty%20permalinks%22%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I have to use &#8220;pretty permalinks&#8221; with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you don&#8217;t. The StripTease plugin will work with WordPress&#8217;s default querystring permalinks as well as its rewrite-based pretty permalinks.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
