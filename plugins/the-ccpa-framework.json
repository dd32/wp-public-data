Please test if your site sends out emails at all using the Forgot Password form, for example.<br />\nIf you get the forgot password email but not the identification email, please make a post in the support forums.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='help%2C%20the%20link%20in%20the%20identification%20email%20doesn%27t%20work%21'>\nHelp, the link in the identification email doesn&#8217;t work!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Are you using SendGrid or another email delivery service? This might corrupt the link in the email.<br />\nIn case you&#8217;re using SendGrid, make sure to turn off &#8220;click tracking&#8221;. Otherwise, please post in the support forum!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='help%2C%20the%20privacy%20tools%20page%20acts%20weirdly%20or%20always%20displays%20the%20%22link%20expired%22%20message%21'>\nHelp, the Privacy Tools page acts weirdly or always displays the &#8220;link expired&#8221; message!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check if you&#8217;re using any caching plugins.

However, the CCPA framework allows visitors to automatically download and export data to reduce administrative work load.<br />\nIn addition to that, we provide tools to manage and track custom consent types and also a privacy policy generator.<br />\nWe are also planning to add other important privacy-related features missing from WordPress core over time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
