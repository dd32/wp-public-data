Once installed, you will have three options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Default sync behavior: Amenities will be imported from your software and assigned to properties. Taxonomy terms will be created for you to add content and build landing pages.</li>\n<li>Unassociate amenities before sync: All amenities will be removed from properties but will remain on your site. This can help keep property amenity lists clean in situations where amenities are frequently updated, renamed, or removed.</li>\n<li>Delete all amenities before sync: All amenity terms will be deleted on every sync before being re-imported. This will ensure that your properties will always show the most up-to-date version of your amenities list. Note that any content added to amenities via WordPress will be deleted as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Be Specific</h3>\n<p>You can also fine tune the visibility of amenities and choose to block them from displaying altogether. Easily add an amenity to the blocked list and never worry about it again. Or if you change your mind, you can remove it from the block list.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>This add-on requires <a href=\"https://via.30lines.com/UOKUNU9_\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RentPress for Websites</a> version 7.5.2 or later along with an active RentPress subscription to sync property data.
