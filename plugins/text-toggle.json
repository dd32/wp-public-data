Text areas by default are hidden.</p>\n<p>This shortcode series uses jQuery functionality to a) determine which text areas are to be toggled and b) toggle them.</p>\n<h4>Use</h4>\n<p>Basic use is to surround a block of text with the &#8220;[tt]&#8221; shortcode and specify a title parameter within the shortcode. The title will be shown on the page, preceeded by an indicator whether the associated text area is hidden (►) or shown (▼). Clicking the title link will toggle the display of the dependant text area, as well as toggle the indicator.</p>\n<p>Groups of text areas can be shown or hidden at once through the &#8220;[tt_part]&#8221; and &#8220;[tt_all]&#8221; shortcodes.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;[tt_part]&#8221; shortcode uses a required parameter named &#8220;class&#8221; that links it to all &#8220;[tt]&#8221; shortcodes and their associated text areas with the same class parameter. Clicking the &#8220;[tt_part]&#8221; title link will toggle all associated text areas and any &#8220;[tt_part]&#8221; shortcode links with the same class according to the status of the parent shortcode. Text areas of this section that are already displayed when the parent link is clicked will remain displayed, and vice versa with hidden text areas.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;[tt_all]&#8221; shortcode will toggle all &#8220;[tt]&#8221; shortcode text areas, any intermediate &#8220;[tt_part]&#8221; links and any mirrored &#8220;[tt_all]&#8221; links, according to the status of the particular title link.

Style components are limited to anything that applies to the area surrounding and including the area to be displayed and are limited to the following: background-color, border, border-color, border-radius, border-size, border-style, and color.
