        "description": "<p>WP Roster is a unique roster plugin designed for WordPress. WP Roster comes with a fully-fledged application interface and is designed to take up the whole window of your site &#8211; the plugin comes with a custom page template to make this easily achievable so you can still maintain the existing look on your other pages. However, for most use cases, and what I recommend, is using the plugin on a barebones WordPress install on a subdomain. The plugin has been tested with the free Twenty Sixteen theme so for best results it is recommended to use this theme as otherwise additional CSS work may be required.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/wp-roster/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check out WP Roster in action (pro version)</a></p>\n<p>WP Roster has been designed specifically for church service rostering however the plugin can be used for a wide range of team and event applications. Maybe if you run an event company this could be handy or perhaps you have a team or business that has daily/weekly/monthly tasks or roles.</p>\n<p>The plugin takes a table approach to presenting data as oppose to the more traditional calendar interface. This might not work for you but for certain contexts where each event has a bit going on this table view makes a lot more sense. With WP Roster you can create multiple dates, teams, members and lists and then on your main roster page allocate members to dates and teams with ease.</p>\n<p>For churches and other organisations, WP Roster creates a great middle-ground option which sits between having a full-blown CRM system which can be clunky and can require a lot of resources to maintain &#8211; and not to mention typically high ongoing fees and not having true ownership of your data; and DIY Excel spreadsheets which are hard to share, don&#8217;t look and work too great and aren&#8217;t the best solution to organise teams and events. Although WP Roster isn&#8217;t a full CRM system, it does use the built-in WordPress user system so you could extend the plugin however you want to! For example, it would be very easy to install a WordPress MailChimp user sync plugin to add all your members to MailChimp for ongoing emails etc.</p>\n<p>Every aspect of the plugin has been meticulously designed to present a truly beautiful and simple frontend and backend interface which is mobile friendly.</p>\n<p>Creating and deploying rosters is incredibly fast and easy. The plugin also comes with a setting restoration page so if you make a mistake you can easily roll back changes. The plugin has been made translation friendly except for popups &#8211; which I will make translatable based on demand.</p>\n<h4>Upgrade to pro</h4>\n<p>WP Roster is great but it is very limited compared to WP Roster Pro &#8211; in many respects this free version should be considered as a taster for those that need a really great roster system. WP Roster Pro comes with the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to create multiple rosters</li>\n<li>Ability to send conditional and dynamic automated notifications including SMS and email notifications (SMS charges are not included)</li>\n<li>Ability to upload members from a CSV file</li>\n<li>Add multiple dates with a click of a button</li>\n<li>Unavailable rows so users can add in their unavailability for those creating the roster with roster clash highlighting</li>\n<li>A dynamic run sheet template for each roster</li>\n<li>Take attendance of groups and rosters/services</li>\n<li>Custom member fields</li>\n<li>Super awesome support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For most teams and organisations these are must-have features so <a href=\"https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/wp-roster-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">upgrade to pro today</a></p>\n",
