No ajax popup? Error in console?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is dependant on jQuery and Bootstrap Datatable. If you experience any issue like above then the reason is most likely there is either missing jQuery and/or Bootstrap Datable plugin or because of its conflict due to multiple version. Go to plugin Settings page Admin &gt;&gt; Metaphone Search and try loading/unloading the jQuery and Bootstrap. By default, the plugin expects that jQuery is already loaded in the site and bootstrap is not loaded.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Search Result Popup looking very small?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try adding the following css rule in your css file: .gc_dmetaphone_ajax #suggestions.suggestionsBox{ right:0 }. You can customize and position the search result popup with the above selector as you like depending on your search box position.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
