        "faq": "<h4>What is Burnbit?</h4>\n<p>Burnbit is an automated torrent metadata creation and management service. You give us a file, we burn your file to a special torrent file powered by the origial server and the peers sharing your torrent. Your torrent is faster, more reliable and easy to share (through our exclusive Download Buttons).</p>\n<h4>Are torrents illegal?</h4>\n<p>No, torrents are not illegal. Torrent files merely contains the metadata information which allow you to download the actual files. As such, torrents are not copyrighted.

It can&#8217;t get faster than this!</li>\n<li><strong>More ways to share:</strong> Every torrent on our site automagically receives an exclusive Download Button complete with live statistics of your torrent file that you can put up on your site allowing easy access for your users.</li>\n<li><strong>We make servers happy:</strong> By burning the files on your server to torrents, you substantially reduce the load on your servers since the users downloading your file through your torrent are downloading the file from both their peers and your server.

This increases the availability and the redundancy of your file as your torrent is powered by multiple fast mirror servers and regular users.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How can I customize the look of the burnbit buttons?</h4>\n<p>Use one of the 3 style options for the button: * [burnbit style=&#8221;normal&#8221;] * [burnbit style=&#8221;compact&#8221;] * [burnbit style=&#8221;custom&#8221;]</p>\n<p>If you use the custom entry you will want to add the following styles to your theme with customizations you desire:</p>\n<p>      .burnbit_torrent     {     /* styles */     }     .burnbit_seeds     {     /* styles */     }     .burnbit_peers     {     /* styles */     }     </p>\n<h4>I have another question not answered in this FAQ</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit <a href=\"http://burnbit.com/faq/\" title=\"If a file exists, there is torrent of it.
