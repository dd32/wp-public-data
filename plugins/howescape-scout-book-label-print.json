Currently the tool<br />\nbeing recommended for recording scout advancement is ScoutBook. ScoutBook only has the ability to print full sheets of award cards.</p>\n<p>The ScoutBook.com web site provided the ability to print onto a sheet of 8 advancement cards. HoweScape ScoutBook LabelPrint Plugin is<br />\nconfigured to use Avery 6570 labels.<br />\nA sheet of labels contains 32 labels. The Plugin provides the ability to skip label positions so that you can print a single label<br />\nor a whole sheet, starting at any label on the sheet. After the labels are printed a list is printed. The output from the plugin<br />\nis a PDF file which is displayed in a new tab. This tab can be saved or printed using the features of the browser. Some of the<br />\nmerit Badge names do not fit on the label with the other text. A list of abbreviated for Merit Badges has been included. The information<br />\nis loaded from an XML file. There are 3 settings Drawn Border, Presentation Card and Merit Badge / Rank Images. The only active control is<br />\nDraw Border. This feature was used to help verify that the information was positioned correctly in the label.<br />\nThe other fields are for future features. The settings page also displays a table of the original and abbreviated name of merit badges and awards</p>\n",
