This plugin fixes that issue.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the settings for the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no settings. If you have WooCommerce and WP Retina 2x installed it will just work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don&#8217;t I just use the Retina.js method?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Retina.js results in the loading of both the standard and retina image. Picturefill only loads the image best suited for the display.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this work with my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely yes. As long as your theme keeps the WooCommerce product image convention of a wrapper div with the &#8216;.images&#8217; class it will work.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
