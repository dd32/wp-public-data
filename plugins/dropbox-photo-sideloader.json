These only need to be followed one time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those configuration instructions are reproduced here, for clarity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps and Click &#8220;Create an App&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Give it a name and description.</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Full Dropbox&#8221; so that it can access all your files.</li>\n<li>After the app has been created, copy the App Key and App Secret into the plugin config screen.</li>\n<li>Note: You can leave the App in &#8220;Development&#8221; status unless more people than just you need to access their Dropboxes using the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I just see a blank screen with a Sideload button on the Dropbox Images tab</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 0.4, the Dropbox listing is displayed using Javascript and loaded via AJAX requests. This makes navigation simpler and faster.</p>\n<p>So if you don&#8217;t see the loading message appear and then have the directory structure loaded for you, then something else may be interfering with the javascript on the page. Try disabling other plugins and/or switching to the default theme and seeing if it works there.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Ref: https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16330</li>\n<li>TODO: Support new media library properly with JS, instead of using the backwards-compatibility functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add preview panel on the right hand side of the screen for WordPress 3.5 users (who now have a bit of extra width to play with)</li>\n<li>Fixed ordering of directories and items</li>\n<li>Added uninstall script to remove the dbsideload settings on uninstall</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add new jsTree based file browsing and image icons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add error handling and error checking to the setup process (test for an invalid key/secret before saving them).</li>\n<li>Change to use mobile version of the auth screen (looks better, IMO)</li>\n<li>Add check for HTTPS/SSL support (Dropbox requires it, won&#8217;t work without it).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix issues with spaces and other url-encoded characters in image filenames not being sideloaded properly.</li>\n<li>Add config screen</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First version</li>\n</ul>\n"
