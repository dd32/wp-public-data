This plugin utilizes the WebPageTest.org API to run speed tests against your site. This plugin will display the results of the speed tests, including the first view and repeat view load times as well as the respective grades for Time to First Byte, Keep Alive, GZip Compression, Compress Images, Cache Static and CDN values.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin give me advice on how to speed up my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. While this plugin provides a means of communication between WebPageTest.org and your website, there are no recommendations provided directly in the plugin. However, you can use the results of the speed tests to make alterations to your site to improve load times. These can be minor things such as adding cache or no-expiry headers, to compressing/minifying javascript and CSS files and deferring them to the footer.</p>\n<p>Site Speed Monitor was developed to provide you with solid data that can be used to make changes to your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the WebPageTest.org API parameters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! On the Site Speed Monitor settings page, you will want to head into the &#8216;Test Parameters&#8217; tab. From here, you can add any of the available <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/advanced-features/webpagetest-restful-apis#TOC-Parameters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">test parameters</a> that you see fit.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are a number of actions and filters built into Site Speed Monitor to allow you to customize things as you need. For a full list, please see the &#8220;Actions &amp; Filters&#8221; sub-section on the &#8220;Documentation&#8221; tab on the settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are any WP-CLI commands available?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we have setup a number of WP-CLI commands to make your life easier.</p>\n<p>Run a speed check on the current site.</p>\n<pre><code>$ wp site-speed-monitor\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run a speed check on the current site and send the results to an email address.</p>\n<pre><code>$ wp site-speed-monitor --notify=info@codeparrots.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>Run a speed check test on a separate URL and send the results to an email address.</p>\n<pre><code>$ wp site-speed-monitor --site_url=https://www.codeparrots.com --notify=info@codeparrots.com\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
