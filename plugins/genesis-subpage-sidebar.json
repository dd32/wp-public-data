        "faq": "\n<h4>So how does this work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, the plugin detects whether a page either has subpages or is itself a child page. If your page is in a child-to-parent relationship, it replaces your primary sidebar with a styled, unordered list of the parent page, then all of that parent&#8217;s child pages. (You can turn off default styling.)</p>\n<p><em>tldr: This makes it nearly automatic to create &#8220;sections&#8221; for your website</em></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin have a settings page or anything that needs to be set up before using it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep, but only to customize the functionality. You can use it without touching the settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is this plugin different from Bill Erickson&#8217;s Genesis Subpages as Secondary Menu plugin or his BE Subpages Widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Those plugins each do something kind of similar, but with your secondary menu for the former or with a widget for the latter. I like to put these sorts of things in the sidebar, and I especially like it if they scroll down as the user does. So this plugin does those bits automatically instead of the things each of those do automatically.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
