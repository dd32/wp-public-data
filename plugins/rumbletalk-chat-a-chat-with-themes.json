Note, that you can limit private chat for admins only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20%22group%20chat%22%2C%20%22moderated%20chat%22%20and%20%22experts%20chat%22%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between &#8220;group chat&#8221;, &#8220;moderated chat&#8221; and &#8220;experts chat&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have several chat types, you can set it up and change it at any time.

Moderation is done when a user misbehaves (ban, delete, disconnect).<br />\n2) Moderated chat &#8211; A chat room where every message needs to be approved by the admin before it shows to all participants, this is perfect for live events.<br />\n3) Experts chat &#8211; this is for Experts (admin), who can talk in multiple private only chats with chat participants.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20talk%20in%20video%20and%20audio%20with%20others%20in%20the%20chat%3F'>\nCan I talk in video and audio with others in the chat?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, you can have private audio and video calls.
