        "faq": "\n<h4>What version of Seriously Simple Podcasting does this plugin require?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to use this plugin you need to have at least v1.15 of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/\" rel=\"ugc\">Seriously Simple Podcasting</a>. If you do not have Seriously Simple Podcasting active or you are using a version older than v1.15 then this plugin will do nothing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What site is linked to for the actual Bible passage?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Bible readings link to biblegateway.com and are displayed on that site using the version selected in ther settings. You can use the <code>ssp_bible_readings_url</code> filter to modify the URL for the link if you would like it to point it to a different site. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/hlashbrooke/68d2f2e88cc50fbafbce1b6688117d97\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See some example code here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the Bible version in use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will find a new setting at the bottom of the &#8220;Podcast &gt; Settings&#8221; page where you can select which Bible version is used &#8211; it defaults to the New International Version (NIV). You can filter this to use <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">any version that biblegateway.com offers</a> using the <code>ssp_bible_readings_version</code> filter. This filter includes the episode ID as an additional parameter, so you can use it to specify a different version for specific episodes. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/hlashbrooke/42df1ebaec9adf4c2f09350b6f7e1e47\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See some example code here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I include multiple readings in one episode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can! Just separate each passage with a comma (<code>,</code>). The following formats (and their combinations/variations) will all work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16:1-9&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16:1-9</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16:1-9,+12-14&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16:1-9, 12-14</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16:1-9,+acts+17:22-31&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16:1-9, Acts 17:22-31</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16:1-9,+acts+17:22-31,+mark+1:1-5&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16:1-9, Acts 17:22-31, Mark 1:1-5</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16-17&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16-17</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16:12-17:5&amp;version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Proverbs 16:12-17:5</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can string any amount of passages together like that and they will all display on the same page when opened, in the order that you added them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the media player in the screenshot look different to the normal WP media player?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is the same media player that is built into WordPress itself, but I have styled it using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-player-style-kit/\" rel=\"ugc\">Media Player Style Kit plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
