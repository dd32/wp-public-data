        "description": "<p>Take control of your CRON jobs by restricting them to your website&#8217;s low traffic hours. From the admin screen, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify a daily window of when recurring CRON events should be triggered.</li>\n<li>Optionally limit events that run multiple times a day to only once a day.</li>\n<li>Optionally restrict events that run multiple times a day to only during your off-hours.</li>\n<li>Target specific schedules, including custom ones created by other plugins.</li>\n<li>Exclude specific CRON hooks from being affected</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Benefits</h4>\n<p>Restricting your recurring CRON events to only run after hours helps with two (2) things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Automatic updates for WordPress core, plugins, and themes are prevented from running during your highest-traffic times so users aren&#8217;t shown a maintenance page when it&#8217;s the most visible.</li>\n<li>Less stress is placed on your server when automatic maintenance occurs during low traffic times.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Ensuring CRON Events Always Run</h4>\n<p>WordPress CRON is based on traffic, which means if your site does not see a lot of traffic, CRON events may not be triggered at the time that they are scheduled. Limiting your website&#8217;s CRON events to off-hours while also depending on site traffic to trigger them may not produce the intended results. There are two (2) solutions I recommend:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use Server CRON.</strong> It is recommended in the WordPress developer resources to set up your system&#8217;s task scheduler to run on the desired intervals and to use that to make a web request to <code>wp-cron.php</code>. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View WordPress Documentation</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Cron-Job.org.</strong> If you can&#8217;t set up your system&#8217;s task scheduler, I recommend outsourcing that job to cron-job.org to automatically ping your website&#8217;s <code>wp-cron.php</code> file. It is a free service from the German-based developers. Go to <a href=\"https://cron-job.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cron-Job.org</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "installation": "<p>There are three (3) ways to install my plugin: automatically, upload, or manually.</p>\n<h4>Install Method 1: Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li>\n<li>Where it says &#8220;Keyword&#8221; in a dropdown, change it to &#8220;Author&#8221;</li>\n<li>In the search form, type <code>TessaWatkinsLLC</code> (results may begin populating as you type but my plugins will only show when the full name is there)</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve found my plugin in the search results that appear, click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and wait for the installation process to complete.</li>\n<li>Once the installation process is completed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to activate my plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Install Method 2: Upload via WordPress Admin</h4>\n<p>This method involves is a little more involved. You don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser, but you&#8217;ll need to download and then upload the files yourself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/crontrol-hours/\" rel=\"ugc\">Download my plugin</a> from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.</li>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Upload Plugin</strong> button at the top of the screen.</li>\n<li>Select the zip file from your local file system that was downloaded in step 1.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and wait for the installation process to complete.</li>\n<li>Once the installation process is completed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to activate it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Install Method 3: Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>This method is the most involved as it requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/crontrol-hours/\" rel=\"ugc\">Download my plugin</a> from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.</li>\n<li>Unzip the contents; you should have a single folder named <code>crontrol-hours</code>.</li>\n<li>Connect to your WordPress server with your favorite SFTP client.</li>\n<li>Copy the folder from step 2 to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> folder in your WordPress directory. Once the folder and all of its files are there, installation is complete.</li>\n<li>Now log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong>. You should now see my plugin in your list.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Activate</strong> button under my plugin to activate it.</li>\n</ol>\n",
