Some of the features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy install</li>\n<li>Support for most major payment methods</li>\n<li>Payment status pages</li>\n<li>Automatic payment status updates via Mollie webhooks and the WordPress REST API</li>\n<li>High quality support</li>\n<li>Built by Pronamic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recurring payments</h3>\n<p>The plugin supports Woo Subscriptions. So you can accept recurring payments with Mollie. Therefore you can set your own schedule for the recurring payments, like every day, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, month or year.</p>\n<h3>Payment methods per country</h3>\n<p>When you sell international it’s a good practise to offer local payment methods. Therefore you can set payment methods per country. Like Bancontact for Belgium and Giropay for Germany.</p>\n<h3>Surcharging</h3>\n<p>You can set surcharging fees for payment methods. Please note that for most countries surcharging is not allowed for most payment methods.</p>\n<h3>External services</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses a number of external services to initiate payments. These are documented below with a link to the service&#8217;s Terms of Use.</p>\n<h4>Mollie API</h4>\n<p>This plugin provides the link between the forms plugin Ninja Forms and payment provider Mollie. To communicate with Mollie, this plugin connects to the Mollie API via <a href=\"https://api.mollie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://api.mollie.com/</a>. The documentation for the Mollie API can be found at <a href=\"https://docs.mollie.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://docs.mollie.com/</a>, Mollie&#8217;s user agreement can be found at <a href=\"https://www.mollie.com/gb/user-agreement-v9\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.mollie.com/gb/user-agreement-v9</a>. From your WordPress website, customer and payment data can be passed on to Mollie for setting up and processing payments.</p>\n<h4>VIES VAT number validation</h4>\n<p>If a payment via this plugin is initiated with a VAT number, this plugin will attempt to validate this VAT number via the VIES VAT number validation. The VIES VAT number validation is an online service provided by the European Union that allows businesses to verify the validity of VAT numbers issued by EU Member States. This is important for businesses that are trading with companies in other EU countries, as it helps to ensure that they are only dealing with legitimate businesses.
