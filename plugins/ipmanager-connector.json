In LOCKDOWN mode the follow options are disabled:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unregister Server</li>\n<li>Update Settings</li>\n<li>Uninstall</li>\n<li>Deactivate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This can make it more affective in synchronising changes that occur in your site.</p>\n<h4>How do I enable LOCKDOWN mode?</h4>\n<p>open ipm.php and find the line (near the top) that says:</p>\n<pre><code>    define('IPM_LOCKDOWN', FALSE); </code></pre>\n<p>and change it to:</p>\n<pre><code>    define('IPM_LOCKDOWN', TRUE); </code></pre>\n<p>Remember to upload the file if you edited it locally.</p>\n<h4>What limitations does LOCKDOWN mode have?</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Please be aware that LOCKDOWN mode is NOT a guarantee that IPMC will say active if you site is hacked.</li>\n<li>An extra layer of security is added but there are many other ways to disabled IPMC.  </li>\n<li>It is recommended that ipm.php is NOT writable so that the file cannot be editted from within WordPress.</li>\n<li>Please be aware that LOCKDOWN mode is NOT a guarantee that IPMC will say active if you site is hacked.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>IPMC has a bug and/or I want to suggest some new features. How?</h4>\n<p>Please contact Dalegroup Pty Ltd here: http://www.dalegroup.net/contact/</p>\n",
