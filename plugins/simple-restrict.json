Administrators can create/assign new permissions from the Edit Page screen (you can also use the Quick Edit link). You can add/edit/delete permissions from the Permissions sub-menu under the Pages menu. Pages with no assigned permissions can be seen by everyone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Permissions:</strong> Administrators can add/remove permissions from a user using the checkboxes on the Edit User screen. The All Users page has a column that shows the permissions assigned to each user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Restriction Message:</strong> If a page has permissions assigned, the content will only be visible to users that have one of those same permissions assigned. Otherwise, the content will be replaced by a generic message or a custom message which can be defined in the plugin settings using the standard WordPress editor (including the ability to add media and formatting).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Redirect to login:</strong> Instead of a restriction message, you can choose to have users get redirected to the login page.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20restrict%20access%20to%20a%20page%3F'>\nHow do I restrict access to a page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the Edit Page screen for the page you want to restrict, and find the new &#8220;Permissions&#8221; section. Create and assign a new permission (e.g. &#8220;Gold subscriber&#8221;) and update your page. Now this page content will only be viewable by users who have this same permission assigned to them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20allow%20a%20user%20to%20see%20a%20restricted%20page%3F'>\nHow do I allow a user to see a restricted page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a page is restricted, it&#8217;s content will only be viewable by users who have this same permission assigned to them. To assign a permission to a user, go to the Edit User page and you will see all possible permissions listed. Put a checkmark beside the Permissions you want to assign to this user. Save the changes, and the user will be allowed to see the page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20a%20page%20has%20multiple%20permissions%20assigned%2C%20does%20a%20user%20need%20to%20have%20all%20those%20permissions%20assigned%20to%20her%2Fhim%20in%20order%20to%20see%20the%20page%3F'>\nIf a page has multiple permissions assigned, does a user need to have all those permissions assigned to her/him in order to see the page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A user only needs to have one of the page permissions assigned to her/him in order to see that page. For example, if a page is assigned the permission &#8220;Gold subscriber&#8221; and another permission &#8220;Silver subscriber&#8221;, a user who is assigned the permission &#8220;Silver subscriber&#8221; will see the page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20pages%20with%20no%20permissions%20assigned%20to%20them%3F'>\nWhat about pages with no permissions assigned to them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They are visible to everyone.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20restrict%20posts%3F'>\nWill this plugin restrict posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin is only for pages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20restrict%20pages%20that%20use%20custom%20page%20templates%3F'>\nWill this plugin restrict pages that use custom page templates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends. If your page template uses the_content() to retrieve the main content, and does not loop through any posts, then yes this plugin will restrict the page. Otherwise, see the answer below.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20restrict%20pages%20that%20show%20posts%20%28archive%20pages%29%3F'>\nWill this plugin restrict pages that show posts (archive pages)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin hides the main content of the page (the_content()). Any page template that loops through posts, be they default posts or custom post types, will continue to show those posts. A more advanced content restriction plugin (usually paid) would be required for your needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20wordpress%20user%20capabilities%20are%20required%20for%20the%20different%20functionalities%20of%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat WordPress user capabilities are required for the different functionalities of this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#manage_options\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">manage_options</a> capability is required to edit plugin settings.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#edit_users\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">edit_users</a> capability is required to assign permission to users.</p>\n<p>Any user who has the rights to edit a page also has the rights to assign permissions to the page and create new permissions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20contribute%20to%20the%20code%3F'>\nHow can I contribute to the code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/GitHubGreg/SimpleRestrict\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>, feel free to submit a pull request.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20languages%20does%20this%20plugin%20support%2C%20and%20how%20can%20i%20help%20translate%20it%3F'>\nWhat languages does this plugin support, and how can I help translate it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was released in English and French, and anyone can add additional translations <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/simple-restrict\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">from here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
