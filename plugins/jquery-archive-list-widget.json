        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20there%20are%202%20widgets%3F'>\nWhy there are 2 widgets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 6.0 the widget was migrated to a Gutenberg block. So there will be a Gutenberg block with the most modern code and compatibility and a legacy version that is 100% made in PHP to keep compatibility with older installations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20this%20plugin%20is%20not%20working%3F'>\nWhy this plugin is not working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By support experience, like 99% of problems are due to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There&#8217;s a Javascript error caused by other plugin, and it stops any further code execution, check your browser&#8217;s logs to find the problem and deactivate the conflict plugin.</li>\n<li>Your template doesn&#8217;t have a wp_footer() function, this plugin requires this function to load JS code at the end of the website to improve speed.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20using%20custom%20permalinks%2C%20how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20links%3F'>\nI&#8217;m using custom permalinks, How can I change the links?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, there&#8217;s no function in WP API for getting link for date archives when using custom permalinks. So, you&#8217;ll need to modify/hack the source code to support your custom link structure, you can do this by changing the lines where I call <strong>get_month_link</strong> and <strong>get_year_link</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20exclude%20some%20categories%20from%20navigation%3F'>\nHow can I exclude some categories from navigation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin only shows the posts from included/excluded categories. It does not remove them from the navigation. If you want to do it you have to install a 3rd party plugin like <em>Ultimate Category Excluder</em> or <em>Simple Exclude Categories</em></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20i%20can%20send%20you%20a%20translation%3F'>\nHow I can send you a translation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Send me the translated .mo file to migueluseche(a)skatox.com and indicate the language, I can read english or spanish, so please write me on these languages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20images%20as%20bullets%20or%20trigger%20symbols%3F'>\nCan I use images as bullets or trigger symbols?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, select &#8216;Empty Space&#8217; as trigger symbol and Save, then you can add any custom background using CSS,<br />\njust play with the widget&#8217;s classes: .jaw_symbol, .jaw_year, .jaw_month.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20show%20this%20list%20inside%20posts%3F'>\nCan I show this list inside posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just add the <em>JS Archive List</em> block or add a shortcode block and write <em>[JsArchiveList]</em> anywhere inside a post<br />\nor page&#8217;s contest and it will be replaced for the archive list when rendering the content. You can add the following<br />\nparameters to change its behavior:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>showcount</strong> ( boolean ): select if you want to show the count post inside that month/year.</li>\n<li><strong>showpost</strong> ( boolean ): show post&#8217;s titles under months.</li>\n<li><strong>expand</strong> (&#8220;none&#8221;, &#8220;never&#8221;, &#8220;expand&#8221;): never expand by default, current year only and always expand.</li>\n<li><strong>month_format</strong> (&#8220;short&#8221;, &#8220;full&#8221;, &#8220;number&#8221;): the format of the date.</li>\n<li><strong>ex_sym</strong>: the expansion symbol.</li>\n<li><strong>con_sym</strong>: the collapse symbol.</li>\n<li><strong>only_sym_link</strong>: only expand/collapse when clicking the bullet.</li>\n<li><strong>effect</strong> (&#8220;&#8221;, &#8220;slide&#8221;, &#8220;fade&#8221;): the JS effect to implement.</li>\n<li><strong>exclude</strong>: IDs (comma separated) of the categories to exclude.</li>\n<li><strong>type</strong>: ID of the type of the posts to show, this is if you&#8217;re using custom type posts. By default will show posts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So for example:</p>\n<p><em>[JsArchiveList month_format=number showpost=1 showcount=1 ex_sym=+ con_sym=- effect=slide type=page]</em></p>\n<p>Will show a widget with months as numbers, show posts under months and their count, the symbols are + and &#8211; and the effect is fadeIn. You can check source code for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20i%20contribute%20to%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow I contribute to this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By using it, recommending it to other users, giving it 5 starts at plugin&#8217;s WordPress page, suggesting features or coding new features and finally by <strong>DONATING</strong> using plugin&#8217;s website&#8217;s donate link.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20add%20multiples%20instances%3F'>\nHow can I add multiples instances?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since 2.0 you can add as many instances as you want, but there&#8217;s another way to do it, just add a new Text widget only with the shortcode [JSArchiveList] then it will have a new copy of the widget.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20have%20different%20instances%20with%20different%20configuration%3F'>\nCan I have different instances with different configuration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since 2.0 it&#8217;s possible. Each instance has its own configuration. Shortcode widgets are controlled by shortcode attributes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
