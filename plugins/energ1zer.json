Do I have to do some processing to my images before uploading?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no special processing needed. If you want to re-center the part that is in the circle &#8211; that is re-position it &#8211; you can use WordPress built-in function to re-position the thumbnail.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20you%20so%20awesome%20at%20making%20plugins'>\nWhy are you so awesome at making plugins\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thank you. It is just something you get born with. &#8230; seriously I appologize for the early version and poor documentation of this plugin it is just a side-project but with time I hope it will become a swiss army knife for wordpress development and reducing the amount of plugin needed to create interesting pages for both developers and users.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
