        "description": "<p>Want to lose weight?  Need help?  Use WordPress? (of course you do!)</p>\n<p>The Hacker&#8217;s Diet is a simple way to count calories and track your weight to make sure you are really losing the pounds.  By calculating your average weight, you don&#8217;t have to be scared of those days when you &#8220;gain&#8221; 2 pounds overnight.  You&#8217;ll see exactly your rate of weight loss and be able to predict when you will hit your weight goal.</p>\n<p>This plugin serves to provide a web-based version of the Excel spreadsheets provided by the diet plan.  This lets you use the familiar interface of your blog to keep up-to-date on your diet.  After you hit your weight goal, it helps you maintain your weight by keeping you within a set window around your goal.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Extract and upload the contents of the zip file to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Click the menu link on the Dashboard home page</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I *have* to weigh myself everyday?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope.  If you skip a day (or 6) your trend will just be calculated based off whenever your last weigh-in was.  Obviously, weighing yourself everyday will give you the most accurate trend.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can multiple users log their weights?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Weight entries are saved per user, so anybody that has access to your blog&#8217;s dashboard can log their weights.  Note: edit the <code>$hackdiet_user_level</code> variable at the top of <code>hackersdiet.php</code> to restrict access.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the sidebar widget do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing yet.  Got a good idea?  Let me know.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t the plugin version 1.0 yet?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t consider my plugin complete until I have a story in place for viewing and editing historical weight entries.  Once I have that, I can consider it &#8220;feature complete&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
