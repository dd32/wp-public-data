        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow much does BrandApp cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out our website for a complete view of our princing. BrandApp is free to try, and there are some limits within our free try out version. You can upgrade to a Paid Plan inside BrandApp once you feel ready.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I need a BrandApp account to try this WordPress Plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you need to sign up with your email and password, or by using your Google or Facebook as authentication.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI have multiple BrandApp brand accounts. Does this plugin support switching?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. In fact, this plugin opens a regular BrandApp browser window inside WordPress as a normal browser window. So switching between brands can be done using the same method.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhen changing designs in BrandApp, will they get updated on my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, and there are reasons for it. When sending a design image from BrandApp to WordPress (ie. Post), it will be copied into your WordPress Media Library and handled as any WordPress media object.<br />\nEven if you Deactivate or Delete this plugin, all images coming from BrandApp are still safely stored on your WordPress site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
