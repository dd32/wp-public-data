This plugin comes with a widget called &#8216;Emma for WordPress Subscription Form&#8217;. The Widgets are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode</strong><br />\n   If you would like to add the form to another area on your site, you can use the Emma shortcode. Simply type [emma_form] in the HTML view in the post editor. For more information on shortcodes, check the almighty codex: [Shortcodes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode&#8221; WordPress Codex &#8211; Shortcodes&#8221;).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add members to a specific group?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve configured the plugin, and entered your account ID, Private and Public API keys, navigate from the Dashboard to Settings -&gt; Emma for WordPress. Under the “Account information” tab there is a dropdown menu under “Add New Members to Group.” From here, you can select the group to which new members should be added.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I set up an automated workflow using my WordPress form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You sure can. You can have an email send when:</p>\n<pre><code>   1. someone subscribes to a specific group from a specific signup form (both configured on the WordPress side)\n\n   2. someone subscribes to a specific group from any signup form (also both configured on the WordPress side)\n\n   3. someone subscribes to any group from any signup form\n\nScenarios that won't work are when:\n\n   1. no group is specified in your WordPress plugin (that field isn't required, though we recommend specifying a group so your contacts are added where you can easily send to them)\n\n   2. you don't have any groups in your account (which won't allow you to activate the plugin)\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
