This is the second item on the list to get taken care to make sure<br />\nthe website was mobile compatible. They let me test things out while I fix things up.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will I maintain/update this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It looks like I will. If anyone brings an issue to my attention, it will get resolved<br />\nquickly as this is still my first plug-in and I want to make it a good one. Hopefully<br />\nI have done that now. Also I am now thinking of writing a full add-on pack for LinkWithin<br />\nfor any ideas that come to me. Like, images in the Title Text area!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where should we go if we need for more support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out http://www.Not-Literally.com. They have a bunch of fun stuff there to take your<br />\nmind off your troubles. Then when your done buy a t-shirt.</p>\n<p>Actual support should be referenced with the creators of LinkWithin<br />\n(http://www.linkwithin.com/support).<br />\nIf you need help with my plug-in, hit my support page here on WordPress.org<br />\n(https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/linkwithin-mobile-downsizer)</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.0.5</h4>\n<p>There was a bug that prevented the owner of a site to import pictures into the &#8220;Set Featured<br />\nImage&#8221; in certain(or all) themes. This has been resolved by delaying the loading of this<br />\nplugin until after all items in the admin panel have loaded first. Also the script will<br />\ndetect if running in the wp-admin panel and not load the script as to not bog down the<br />\npanel.</p>\n<h4>0.0.4</h4>\n<p>Updated readme again for new features.<br />\nAdded support for the screen to be of any size and get the largest size it can from the<br />\nlinks. i.e. if the original request from LinkWithin was for 5 links but the device used<br />\nto load the page only has room for 4 links then this plugin will resize LinkWithin to<br />\nshow 4 links. Or 3 or 2 or 1. This will also effect the Title Text above the links and<br />\nword wrap it and also move the link for LinkWithin to a visible area.<br />\nLet&#8217;s keep the link to continue to give them some love!</p>\n<h4>0.0.3</h4>\n<p>Updated original readme file.</p>\n<h4>0.0.2</h4>\n<p>First release that did what it was supposed to.</p>\n"
