Yoast would attempt to execute the shortcodes in order to get text for the SEO description, but the load of the Machform javascript would fail because the shortcodes were not visible on the page (hidden in the page builder blocks).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a note to make it clear that this plugin doesn&#8217;t provide a form builder interface, it only allows the 3rd Party app MachForms to be used on a site easily.</li>\n<li>Added text asking for the user to leave a review for the plugin on the WordPress Plugin Directory &#8211; this text is on the settings page, unobtrusive (we hate plugins that plaster admin banners for that type of stuff).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added URL Parameters support</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
