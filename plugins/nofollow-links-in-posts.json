        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin written?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nofollow Links in Posts plugin was originally written to help &#8220;paid bloggers&#8221; add nofollow to links in sponsored post after a set amount of days. With so many &#8220;Paid to Blog&#8221; companies such as PayPerPost, ReviewMe and SponsoredReviews, there are a lot bloggers doing sponsored posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am doing sponsored posts with PayPerPost.com. Is it ok to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! It is ok to add nofollow to links after 30 days. But if the advertisers finds out that you&#8217;ve added nofollow to their links, <em>they have the right to place a BAN on you</em>. So, use it at your own risk!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about other Paid To Blog companies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on Terms of Service. You should always <em>read their Terms of Service/Rules &amp; Regulations</em> to see whether they have any specific rules about nofollow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is &#8220;nofollow&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>nofollow</strong> is an HTML attribute value used to instruct some search engines that a hyperlink should not influence the link target&#8217;s ranking in the search engine&#8217;s index. It is intended to reduce the effectiveness of certain types of search engine spam, thereby improving the quality of search engine results.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work by adding the rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; in the database or it works when loading the post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin works on the fly (dynamically) and does not alter the wp_posts database table structure</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin add nofollow to a link in existing (old) posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n</p>\n\n"
