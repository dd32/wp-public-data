        "faq": "<p>The main problem that people have been reporting is that the plugin doesn&#8217;t show up in their plugin list once they&#8217;ve uploaded it:<br />\n&#8211; The solution to this problem is to make sure to check that the file permissions on the plugin is set correctly. You need &#8220;CHMOD&#8221; the files to 755, or 777 just to be safe (That&#8217;s if you&#8217;re hosted on a Linux server, If you&#8217;re hosted on the Windows server you shouldn&#8217;t experience this problem)</p>\n<p>Which versions of PHP do I need?<br />\n&#8211; The community cloud will work on both php4 and php5, but it works best on php5. On php4 the cloud uses some web services.</p>\n",
