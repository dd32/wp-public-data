Instead, you assign which site the content should be published on when placing a content order. And when the content is ready, it will automatically be published on that site. You can also set which date the article should be published.</p>\n<p>This is an extremely useful plugin if you manage several WordPress sites and need to create long term content plans. For example, if you want to publish one article a week over a year, you can place an order for 52 articles and specify different publishing dates.
