This plugin makes this possible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To use this plugin, first install the plugin as normal. Then go to menu &#8220;Settings&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;Google Maps Search Tool for ACF&#8221; to set plugin settings. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Anything else I should know ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, for the moment, the plugin can not handle more than one Advanced Custom Fields Type &#8216;Google Map&#8217; in your website.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
