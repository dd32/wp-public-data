The servername in the example above is:</p>\n<pre><code>server.blueconic.net\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20script%20tag%20does%20not%20appear%20in%20the%20page%3F'>\nThe script tag does not appear in the page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may need to empty all caches before the script tags start appearing on your pages.</p>\n<p>If this doesn&#8217;t help, the problem might lie in the theme that you are using. The plugin works by virtue of the &#8220;wp_head&#8221; filter being called. If this filter is not being used in the theme, nothing will be inserted.
