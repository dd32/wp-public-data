This plugin uses a 3rd party IP-lookup API (which you can self-host should you desire) which gets location data based on the IP Address passed to it. If a user is using a VPN to mask where they are coming from, it is quite likely that the user will see content restricted to the country of their VPN connection.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20store%20cookies%20in%20a%20user%27s%20browser%3F'>\nDoes this store cookies in a user&#8217;s browser?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It does this in order to stop hitting an API for every page load. A cookie is stored for 1 week with information about where the person is visiting from.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20with%20the%20logo%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s with the logo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a chameleon. A cool little creature which can change the way it appears &#8211; to make itself more or less visible. Seemed appropriate! Also, your suspicions are correct; a designer, I am not.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='got%20a%20question%3F'>\nGot a question?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Let me know: <a href=\"https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-geolocation/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-geolocation/issues/new</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
