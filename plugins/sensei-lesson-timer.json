Now, timer will not allow quiz to be taken until time runs out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to work with most recent version of Sensei, 1.9.5.</li>\n<li>Fix missing post-type selector setting, which broke with new version of Sensei.</li>\n<li>Fix missing user-role selector setting.</li>\n<li>Fix form button element javascript selector, which also broke with new version of Sensei.</li>\n<li>Fix a few bad variable names to clean up notices in the debug log.</li>\n<li>Fix issue with plugin not working when installing plugin from Github (https://github.com/Automattic/sensei).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved logic to disable click on &#8216;Complete Lesson&#8217; and &#8216;View the lesson quiz&#8217; button while the timer is active.</li>\n<li>Removed previous logic to imply Quizzes were supported. This is being rewritten and will be added in a later release.</li>\n<li>Added / Improved logic to prevent timer from showing when users has already completed Lesson.</li>\n<li>Added / Improved logic to prevent timer from showing when users has not registered for Course.</li>\n<li>Rewrote logic to determine post types to use with timer. Previous logic loading all registered post_types and really only needed to check if the Sensei lesson post type is registered.</li>\n<li>Add check to ensure Sensei plugin is installed and active before Sensei Lesson Timer plugin initialization.</li>\n<li>Reduced the timer placement options via Settings.

Included in this array is a single item &#8216;show_timer&#8217; set to true. If returned value of false the timer will not be shown.</li>\n<li>Also as part of the settings filter array are three new items &#8216;form_element_cursor&#8217; CSS cursor value added to the lesson submit button. Default is &#8216;not-allowed&#8217;.  &#8216;form_element_title&#8217; if not empty will add a title element to the button. &#8216;form_element_class&#8217; if not empty well add this custom class to the button. Not the timer already adds the class &#8216;slt-active-timer&#8217; to the button.</li>\n<li>Cleanup unused and commented out code</li>\n<li>Added proper documentation block on all functions</li>\n<li>Rework plugin initialization to not use global variable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Restructured plugin code to be more in line with WordPress plugin coding standards. Moved inline JavaScript and CSS to external files loaded properly through wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style.</li>\n<li>Added support for i18n translations. see /languages directory content.</li>\n<li>Moved plugin settings to be within Sensei &gt; Sensei Settings.
