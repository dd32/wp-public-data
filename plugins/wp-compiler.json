        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I combine multiple JavaScript files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to compile your JS is to store it all in a single directory. If you set your compilation source to be the directory path, all JS files in the directory will be combined and minified.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I make sure JavaScript files are minified in a specific order?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Compiler supports <code>.manifest</code> files for JavaScript. This is a custom file format in which each line consists of a relative file path to a JS file, a relative path to a directory containing JS, or a relative path to another <code>.manifest</code> file. for clarity, lines beginning with a hash symbol (#) are treated as comments.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a manifest file:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p># &lt;js.manifest&gt;<br />\n     # This is a sample JavaScript manifest file for WP Compiler<br />\n     # all paths are relative to the current manifest file<br />\n     # First we are going to load specific files that have to come first<br />\n     test-script.js<br />\n     test-script2.js<br />\n     # Now let&#8217;s load a sub-manifest<br />\n     partials/js.manifest<br />\n     # Finally, let&#8217;s load a folder whose contents<br />\n     # don&#8217;t need to be in a specific order<br />\n     external-scripts/</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>What about AutoPrefixing, JS Transpiling, NPM includes, Require.js, Custom Task Runners or ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is a limit to how many of the immense number of node.js build processes available can be replicated in native PHP. Please let us know about which features you&#8217;d most like to see tackled next.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

WP Compiler supports both SCSS and LESS precompilers for CSS, to suit anyone&#8217;s preference.</p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re ready to launch a new site, just turn off Dev Mode, and your styles and javascript will be compiled &amp; minimized and comments &amp; source maps will be removed.
