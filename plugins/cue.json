        "installation": "<p>Install <em>Cue</em> like any other plugin. <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check out the codex</a> if you have any questions.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>After installing and activating <em>Cue</em>, a new menu item labelled <em>Playlists</em> will be available in your admin panel. Create a new playlist and add tracks by uploading or selecting existing audio files to add (remote sources can be used as well). Track details are populated automatically using tags in the audio file, but the details may also be managed manually.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode</h4>\n<p>To display a playlist in a post, page or CPT, insert the <code>[cue]</code> shortcode into the editor and specify the playlist id as an attribute.</p>\n<p>When editing a playlist, the shortcode is available for copying in a meta box just under the <strong>Publish</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Integration for inserting shortcodes in an editor is also included in the Media Manager modal. Click the <strong>Add Media</strong> button when editing a post or page, then choose the <strong>Insert from Cue</strong> option to select your playlist and insert it into the editor.</p>\n<h4>Widget</h4>\n<p>Visit <em>Appearance &rarr; Widgets</em> and add the Playlist widget to a sidebar. Enter a widget title if desired and select the playlist you want to display. That&#8217;s it!</p>\n<h4>Template Tag</h4>\n<p>For more fine-grained control over where the playlist appears, a template tag is available.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php cue_playlist( $id ); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20disable%20the%20track%20list%3F'>\nHow do I disable the track list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add a <code>show_playlist</code> attribute to your <code>[cue]</code> shortcode and set the value to <code>0</code>. Something like this should do it:</p>\n<pre><code>[cue id=\"1\" show_playlist=\"0\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20my%20playlists%20get%20truncated%20when%20they%27re%20saved%3F'>\nWhy do my playlists get truncated when they&#8217;re saved?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve heard reports that this may happen around 70 tracks on some hosts, but it could occur with fewer tracks. First off, 70 tracks seems a bit excessive and may introduce other performance issues, so we recommend limiting the tracks to a more reasonable number.</p>\n<p>The root cause of this is a PHP configuration setting called <code>max_input_vars</code>, which is typically set to 1000 by default. You will most likely need to contact your host to increase that limit if you need to save more tracks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20see%20the%20%22add%20tracks%22%20button%20in%20the%20admin%20panel%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I see the &#8220;Add Tracks&#8221; button in the admin panel?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s fairly common for plugins to introduce issues that may prevent other plugins from functioning correctly. If you&#8217;re not seeing the <strong>Add Tracks</strong> button on the Edit Playlist screen, <a href=\"https://audiotheme.com/support/kb/troubleshooting-plugin-conflicts/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">determine if there&#8217;s a conflict with another plugin</a> first.</p>\n<p>Cue also requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser, so be sure it&#8217;s not disabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20protect%20my%20audio%20files%3F'>\nHow can I protect my audio files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anything that&#8217;s publicly visible online can be downloaded or recorded, so it&#8217;s not really possible to protect your audio files.</p>\n<p>Your best bet is to upload a lower quality file for online streaming. This also has the benefit of reducing bandwidth on mobile devices and making the audio load more quickly on slower networks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20audio%20format%20works%20best%3F'>\nWhich audio format works best?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Browsers, devices, and platforms have varying levels of support for different audio formats, but at this time, MP3 provides the best compatibility across platforms.</p>\n<p><em>Cue</em> uses the MediaElement.js library bundled with WordPress, which attempts to smooth out inconsistencies across browsers, so you may have some success with other formats like AAC or Ogg.</p>\n<p>Mozilla Developer Network maintains a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">browser compatibility chart here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20make%20the%20player%20start%20automatically%3F'>\nCan I make the player start automatically?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s for your own good.</p>\n<p>And the good of humanity.</p>\n<p>Aside from that, mobile platforms like iOS and Android make it impossible to start playing audio automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20cue%20work%20with%20soundcloud%3F'>\nDoes Cue work with SoundCloud?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time. SoundCloud URLs don&#8217;t point directly at audio files, so support would require integrating with their API and complying with their <a href=\"https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use#branding\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">attribution and branding requirements</a>. If there is enough demand, we might consider adding support in a future release.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
