In some situations your browser might time out before the process is complete.</p>\n<p>2) If your site hosts more than a few dozen PDFs, the image thumbnails will start taking up a notable amount of space in your uploads directory. One full-size thumbnail for a PDF can be as large as 4mb. If you have 25 PDFs on your site, that&#8217;s 100mb of space. If you have limited disk space on your hosting account, this will bring you closer to hitting your limit. If you make regular backups, they&#8217;ll start to become significantly larger.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20disable%20thumbnails%20for%20some%20pdf%20uploads%20but%20not%20others%3F'>\nHow can I disable thumbnails for some PDF uploads but not others?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you need a thumbnail image for a PDF, deactivate the plugin, upload the PDF, and thumbnails will be generated. Then reactivate the plugin to disable them in the future. Please note, if you run a Regenerate Thumbnails plugin in the future, the thumbnail you created might be deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20my%20site%20creating%20thumbnails%20for%20pdfs%20even%20without%20this%20plugin%20installed%3F'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t my site creating thumbnails for PDFs even without this plugin installed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>According to the development team, for PDF thumbnails to work you have to have a WP_Image_Editor available on your hosting account that supports PDF. https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/15/enhanced-pdf-support-4-7/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
