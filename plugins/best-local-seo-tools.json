While the plugin is easy to set up, it also offers an enormous amount of advanced controls so you can make even the finer details of the plugin work according to your preferences.</p>\n<p>Showcase Your Work &amp; Testimonials to Dominate Local SEO with the Technology the Big Directories Use</p>\n<p>Big directories like Yelp, YellowPages &amp; Angieslist rank in lots of cities because their content is organized into an optimized directory page for each city with strong internal linking.
