Providing they are, you do not have to tell the search engine what keywords you are targeting with your article.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I really use multiple rel attributes?</strong><br />\nYes, as long as you leave a space in between each attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I use this Plug-In for Authorship markup?</strong><br />\nTheoretically, yes, if you were handy with editing the code.<br />\nHowever, we do have a similar Plug-In coming soon that will add rel=author for you.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I use the “nofollow” attribute?</strong><br />\nIf you&#8217;re not aware of the benefit of followed (DoFollow) outbound links or if you do not fully trust the reputation of the site you&#8217;re linking to, then use &#8220;nofollow&#8221; as your first rel attribute. Other attributes can be added after &#8220;nofollow&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If I add a tag to my post from the Sidebar Widget, will it still work?<br />\nYes, all of the tags, once saved, retain all of the information you enter about them.<br />\nHowever, if you change the setting of a tag to suit a particular post, those changes will be reflected everywhere you have that tag appearing on your website.</p>\n",
