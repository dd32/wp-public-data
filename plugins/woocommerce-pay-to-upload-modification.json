        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want the user to upload a file once payment has been made rather than during the checkout process?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you allowed every user to upload a file without yet making a payment then every time a payment failed or you used a payment method that waits for an IPN response, your disk space will be consumed by files you should not have received. By waiting until after payment this keeps things cleaner.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where are files stored?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Uploaded files are stored in your wp-content/uploads folder, a new folder named &#8220;wc-pay-to-upload&#8221; will be created and within that each order will have it&#8217;s own folder based on the order ID.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I access the uploaded files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once files are uploaded you can view them from the admin view of the order. A meta box is added to the side with links to the files.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
