        "faq": "<p>Q: What does Rewind WP do?<br />\nA: Rewind WP will make a snapshot of your website at a specified time and then automatically restore itself to that snapshot once the duration has been set. Basically, you are setting a demo stage for your website.</p>\n<p>Q: What can I do with Rewind WP?<br />\nA: If you are a plugin developer or a website designer, you might want your clients or potential clients to interact with your website. After they are done, you have to go in and restore everything to the way it was before. With Rewind WP, it will automatically restore itself to the way it was before.</p>\n<p>Q: Is Rewind WP free?<br />\nA: Rewind WP does require an account at rewindwp.com and an API key, but using it is completely free with limitations.</p>\n<p>Q: What makes the free version different from the pro version?<br />\nA: With the free version of Rewind WP, you can set your duration in half-hour intervals up to one hour, and only a snapshot of the database<br />\nis made. Files within the WordPress folder are not protected.</p>\n<p>With the pro version, you unlock this feature and can set your duration in 5-minute intervals up to 24 hours and<br />\nyou also have the option to protect your wp-config file and the files within your wp-content folder.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I use this as a backup service?<br />\nA: Rewind WP was not intended to be used as a backup service and will only store a single copy of your website, but can technically be<br />\nused as a manual backup &amp; restore service that can be used when the Force Rewind button is pressed.</p>\n<p>Q: Does Rewind WP protect my website from malware and viruses?<br />\nA: Rewind WP may help in restoring files, but may not eliminate new ones and should not be used as an alternative to your website malware,<br />\nvirus scanner, or automated backup service.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I just use the Rewind WP plugin?<br />\nA: The Rewind WP plugin requires registration at rewindwp.com in order to obtain an API key.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I just use the rewindwp.com website?<br />\nA: The rewindwp.com website requires instructions from the WordPress plugin and cannot work as a standalone without the plugin.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I add multiple websites?<br />\nA: You may add multiple websites on rewindwp.com.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I create multiple snapshots?<br />\nA: Only one snapshot per website at a time is possible.</p>\n<p>Q: Do I need to stop the rewind before making a new snapshot or changing the duration?<br />\nA: You can change the plugin configuration settings without stopping the cron job timer.</p>\n<p>Q: The plugin only restores the database but does not delete anything in the themes, plugins, or uploads folders.<br />\nA: The free version of the plugin only rewinds the database, while the pro version offers support for files and your wp-config file.</p>\n<p>Q: The plugin broke my website.<br />\nA: Unfortunately, there are a few things that could have gone wrong during the backup or restore point which we cannot indepdently always verify. While not an unknown issue, we urge you before setting the service as active the plugin, you should create an official copy of a backup for your website just in case.</p>\n<p>Q: Can I restore my website faster than 5 minutes or longer than 24 hours?<br />\nA: No, as rewinding a website to less than every 5 minutes may cause issues or abuse and it is unlikely that any website needs a snapshot any longer<br />\nthan 24 hours later.</p>\n",
