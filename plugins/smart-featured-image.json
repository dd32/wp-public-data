There are options to set the default featured image for each public post type.</p>\n<p><em>Smart Featured Image</em> works by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Checking if a featured image was added to the post.</li>\n<li>If no featured image was added, the plugin looks for images attached to the post (ie images uploaded to the current post). If found, the first attached image is saved as the post&#8217;s featured image.</li>\n<li>If no image was attached to the post, the plugin looks for an image inserted into the post content, but not necessary attached to the post. If found, the first local image inserted is saved as featured image.</li>\n<li>If all of the above fail, the plugin falls back to the default featured image set for the post type in question under the <em>Default Featured Image</em> section of the <em>Media Settings</em> screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You would notice that, in step 4 above, the plugin <strong>does not save</strong> the default featured image as the featured image.

This is the intended behaviour.</p>\n<p>This means, any time the default featured image changes, all posts that used the previous default featured image would automatically use the new default featured image since the old one was never saved to the database as featured image.</p>\n<p>You can disable smart featured image for any specific post by setting a <code>no_sfi</code> custom field to any value other than <code>0</code>.
