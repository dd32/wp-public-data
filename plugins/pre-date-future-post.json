If you can tell me how to add a custom post status then I<br />\nam happy to add that functionality. If you need to use &#8220;Pending Review&#8221; yourself<br />\nthen you probably can&#8217;t use this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I set the minute as well as the hour for posting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because I said so.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the post show immediately it is scheduled to appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Perhaps because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WP cron hasn&#8217;t yet run the task. Wait until a minute after the hour and<br />\nrefresh the blog main page.</li>\n<li>Something caused the WP cron process to skip the task. Wait an hour.</li>\n<li>If you have changed the timezone for your blog then you may need to<br />\ndeactivate and reactivate the plugin to reset the cron timer.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I see what posts have been processed and when?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It writes a log of activation, deactivation and posting of entries.<br />\nSee the file &#8220;pre-date-future-post.php.log&#8221; created in the same directory<br />\nas the plugin PHP file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
