You can customize the Live Chat window (the Live Chat widget) to replicate your corporate branding. Here’s how:</p>\n<li>1. Get yourself to the Admin Site</li>\n<li>2. Next, press on &#8216;channels’</li>\n<li>3. Go to &#8216;Chat&#8217; and click on ‘Appearance’ from the left-hand menu</li>\n<li>4.

Set the color of your title text by repeating step 3.</li>\n<li>7. Create the ‘Greeting’ people will see when the live chat window appears. For example: &#8220;Welcome to Casengo Live Chat&#8221;, &#8220;Live Chat Window&#8221;, &#8220;Invitation&#8221;, &#8220;Pre-Chat Window&#8221;, &#8220;Offline Message Window&#8221;, &#8220;Live Chat Window&#8221;, &#8220;Live Chat Interface&#8221;,&#8221;How may we help you?&#8221;</li>\n<li>8.

Hit ‘Save’ to lock it in.</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How can I hide, deactivate or disable the live chat button on my website when I am offline?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It might indeed be a good idea to disable the live chat functionality temporarily, for instance when you’re not available to accept chat requests.

Choose your new language template from the &#8220;Language&#8221; dropdown menu, and your new script will be waiting for you at the bottom of the page. Copy this script and paste it where you want it to be. Your new custom language chat is now set up!</li>\n<p>NOTE: This live chat feature is only for Premium live chat users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How can I view my live chat history?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All your live chat records and offline messages are stored in our database.
