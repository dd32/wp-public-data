Put this code in the function.php of your theme :</p>\n<pre><code>function theme_force_featured_image( $options ){\n    $options['post'] = array(\n        'width'  =&gt; 400,\n        'height' =&gt; 400,\n    );\n\n    return $options;\n}\nadd_filter( 'force_featured_image_post_type', 'theme_force_featured_image' );\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
