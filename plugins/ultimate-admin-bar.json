The admin menu is &#8216;fixed&#8217;, like the admin bar so that it will appear no matter how far you have scrolled down, keeping it easily accessible and consistently in the same spot.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What version of WordPress do I need?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically this was designed to work with WordPress 3.3, it sort of works in 3.2.1, but the admin bar in 3.2.1 is a little different than it is in 3.3, so it may cover up some things in the admin bar (in 3.2.1). Also, the flyouts appear a little differently in 3.2.1 than 3.3. I think they&#8217;re usable, but not ideal. Again when 3.3 is officially released, this plugin will look better.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work in Internet Explorer?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not 100%. I have tested it in IE8, however you have to switch to be in IE8 mode, and not be in compatability mode or IE7 mode. My version of IE8 is 8.0.6001.18702. I have also tested it in: Chrome 15.0.874.106m, Firefox 6.0 + 8.0, Safari 5.0.3, I have not tested in IE9 yet.</p>\n<p>As of v1.1 this should work in IE7, it might look a little off, but it should generally work.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
