Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-log-queries/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-private-content-login/</a> . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20an%20enhancement%20or%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need an enhancement or feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20text%20explaing%20the%20need%20to%20login%3F'>\nHow do I change the text explaing the need to login?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently if a visitor tries to access content that is private the visitor is redirected to the login page and the message: &#8220;This content is private you will need to login and have appropriate access.&#8221; is displayed. This string itself is fully translatable but translations files are not icluded in the plugin itself. You can translate or modify the entire message (including the html) directly using the &#8220;lh_private_content_login_display_login_message&#8221; filter.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
