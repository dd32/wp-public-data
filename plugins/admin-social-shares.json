This is how the &#8216;shares&#8217; are collected. So, if you don&#8217;t see any number appearing (like those in the screenshot), try to check that your javascript works.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I contribute to this &#8216;wonderful&#8217; plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course and you are welcome.<br />\nIf you are a programmer you can fork me on : https://github.com/tanzaho/wp-admin-social-shares</p>\n<p>If you have any recommendations, feel free to use the the &#8216;support&#8217; page on WordPress to submit them (https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/admin-social-shares)<br />\nYou can also rate the plugin if you like it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
