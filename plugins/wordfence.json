        "installation": "<p>Secure your website using the following steps to install Wordfence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Wordfence automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. </li>\n<li>Activate the Wordfence through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress. Wordfence is now activated.</li>\n<li>Go to the scan menu and start your first scan. Scheduled scanning will also be enabled.</li>\n<li>Once your first scan has completed, a list of threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.</li>\n<li>Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.</li>\n<li>Optionally, change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual scanning and protection options for your site.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Live Traffic&#8221; menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To install Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Wordfence via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.</li>\n<li>Network Activate Wordfence. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option disappears. </li>\n<li>Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site&#8217;s menu. </li>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;Scan&#8221; menu and start your first scan. </li>\n<li>Wordfence will do a scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. </li>\n<li>Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. </li>\n<li>Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you&#8217;re accessing the system.</li>\n</ol>\n",
