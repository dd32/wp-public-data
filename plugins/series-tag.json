All post<br />\ntitles are links to the permalink of the post except for the current post which just has its title displayed.</p>\n<p>For help or more info, visit <a href=\"http://www.nutt.net/tag/series-tag/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nutt.net</a></p>\n",

Be sure to use the tag slug.</li>\n<li>max &#8211; <em>Optional</em> &#8211; Max number of posts to pull. Defaults to 0 so that all posts with that tag are pulled.</li>\n<li>divider &#8211; <em>Optional</em> &#8211; The HTML tag to separate the posts. Defaults to ol, but ul and p also work well. Any tag should work though, as whatever you put in this argument will open before the link and close after it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>CSS, Styling, and Customization</h4>\n<p>Two CSS classes are used on the tag that wraps the link.</p>\n<pre><code>st_current is the current page in the list of pages. \n st_other is all of the other pages. There is an anchor tag inside this wrapper </code></pre>\n<p>that can also be styled if needed.</p>\n<p>The plugin itself does not load any CSS files so if you want to use these CSS classes you&#8217;ll need to add them to your main CSS file. It just didn&#8217;t make sense to load an entirely new stylesheet just for two classes that you may not even want to use.</p>\n",
