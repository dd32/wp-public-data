Can I still use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can! At least if youâ€™re ok with opening up some of your theme files and adding a bit of code to where you want the widget to appear. Adding the following where you want the Dooodl-widget to appear should get you going: <code>if (function_exists(\"Dooodl_widget\")) Dooodl_widget();</code></p>\n<p>Or, use a shortcode that comes with the plugin. You&#8217;ll find them in the settings. Alternatively, use any plugin that lets you show custom post types.</p>\n<p>Dooodl is not compatible on touch screen devices at this time due to scrolling issues. A fix should come in a future version.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
