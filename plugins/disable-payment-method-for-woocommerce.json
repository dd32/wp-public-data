Suppose the customer order total is $1000 and you have configured plugin to take min $10 as advance payment then customer can place that order by making a $10 payment and remaining payment he can do when the product is delivered to him. this way you can avoid fake cash on delivery orders.</p>\n<p>You can restrict what payment option to be available when Partial payment for the order is selected.</p>\n<p>you can exclude product from partial payment, there are two way to exclude, first way is by adding a condition so it wont give partial payment option when specific product is in the cart. Second way is to exclude the product such that partial payment option will be given but user will have to pay full amount for those excluded product in the cart and he can pay partial payment for other products.</p>\n<h3>PRO version features</h3>\n<p>&#9989; Create unlimited payment disable rule</p>\n<p>&#9989; Create unlimited payment fees</p>\n<p>&#9989; Create unlimited partial payment rules</p>\n<p>&#9989; create conditional partial payment rules</p>\n<p>&#9989; In multi currency website you can give partial payment option based on the currency selected by the customer</p>\n<p>&#9989; Create conditional cod rule, so cod option will only be shown when the condition is met</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://piwebsolution.com/product/disable-payment-method-cod-fees-advance-cod-or-partial-payment-for-order-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Buy pro version</a></p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Partial cod for WooCommerce</strong> : Allow customers to pay a portion of the order amount and complete the order and pay remaining amount on delivery.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce disable/remove payment method for shipping</strong> : Disable or remove specific payment methods based on the selected shipping method.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable payment method WooCommerce</strong> : Easily disable certain payment methods from the checkout page based on condition.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce disable payment method for specific category</strong> : Restrict payment methods based on the product categories in the cart.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce disable payment method for specific country</strong> : Limit payment methods based on the customer&#8217;s country.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce disable payment method for specific product</strong> : Restrict certain payment methods for individual products.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce disable payment methods based on cart conditions</strong> : Customize available payment methods based on various conditions in the cart.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce remove payment option from checkout</strong> : Remove specific payment options from the checkout process.</li>\n<li><strong>Cash on delivery fee WooCommerce</strong> : Add an extra fee for using the cash on delivery payment method.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce add fee to payment method</strong> : Apply additional fees to specific payment methods.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce cash on delivery extra fee</strong> : Charge an extra fee for cash on delivery orders.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce payment method fee</strong> : Implement additional fees for different payment methods.</li>\n</ul>\n",
