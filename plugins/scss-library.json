If you are looking for a fast site then you should also add a cache or optimization plugin to your production environment, although it is very likely that you have already done so. Personally I have worked with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/comet-cache/\" rel=\"ugc\">Comet Cache</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/\" rel=\"ugc\">Autoptimize</a> without any inconvenience. Any problems you encounter with another cache plugin don&#8217;t hesitate to write down the details to replicate the error. Remember that the more information you include in the report the easier it will be to fix it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='then%20what%20are%20you%20looking%20for%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nThen what are you looking for with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>What I want is to emulate for the style files the ease of development offered by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/\" rel=\"ugc\">Timber</a>. Let <strong>SCSS-Library</strong> be to <strong>SCSS</strong> what <strong>Timber</strong> is to <strong>Twig</strong>.</p>\n<p>My goal with this plugin is to be able to change the SCSS file directly and see the result immediately. No previous compilations or commands in a terminal. It is intended for development teams that include graphic designers who understand <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> but prefer not to have to open a terminal; and to support lazy programmers who like me prefer to leave repetitive tasks to the machines.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20bug%20free%3F'>\nIs this plugin bug free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think so. Feedbacks would be appreciated.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
