Any special system requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>EMS is a cloud-based service, only requires a browser and a printer (to print shipping labels). We recommend you to use a thermal label printer to print shipping labels. However regular ink or laser printer works too. We recommend Google Chrome.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20install%20browser%20plugins%20in%20order%20to%20print%20the%20label%20on%20my%20zebra%20label%20printer%3F'>\nDo I need to install browser plugins in order to print the label on my Zebra label printer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you don&#8217;t need to install any browser plugin, you can print the labels directly from your browser.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20supported%20carriers%3F'>\nWhat are the supported carriers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We currently support Stamps.com, EShipper, EasyPost, Spee-Dee, Stallion Express, Chitchats, UPS, Purolator and Canada Post. More carries to come!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20in%20canada%2C%20but%20i%20use%20usps%20to%20ship%20my%20packages%2C%20can%20i%20use%20ems%3F'>\nI am in Canada, but I use USPS to ship my packages, can I use EMS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can register a Stamps.com or easypost account, which allows you to print USPS labels, then register a ChitChats or Stallion Express account, when you print shipping labels, we automatically submit the shipment information to either ChitChats or Stallion Express, no more manual uploads.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20support%3F'>\nHow do I get support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We provide live chat and ticket support.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20schedule%20a%20demo%3F'>\nCan I schedule a demo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Certainly!
