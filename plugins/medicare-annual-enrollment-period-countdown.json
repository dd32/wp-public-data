        "faq": "<h4>Does the countdown plugin need any configuration?</h4>\n<p>No, the plugin retrieves the start and stop dates from our server. The plugin checks once a day, to see if there are any updates. Given the nature of the start and stop dates being totally arbitrary, the dates had to be retrieved from somewhere. We respect the privacy of others, and in no way does the plugin send any data outbound, it only retrieves the start/stop date.</p>\n<h4>Why did you write the plugin?</h4>\n<p>We wrote it for a specific use case, but thought we&#8217;d share it. We think most software should be Free!</p>\n",
