To the left of that bar you will see a / button, once pressed this will add a marker at the start of the title. Now by clicking on a character in the title, the marker will move to that position and that is where the page break will occur in the title. You can add as many markers as needed to the title.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20move%20a%20breakpoint%20marker%20in%20my%20title%3F'>\nHow do I move a breakpoint marker in my title?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on the marker that sits below the title text field, that marker will then highlight.

If you look to the left of the grey bar underneath the text field you will see a “x”, if click on that button it will delete the marker.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20cancel%20the%20highlight%20state%20on%20a%20marker%3F'>\nHow do I cancel the highlight state on a marker?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on the marker that is currently highlighted in the grey bar underneath the title text field and it will remove the highlighted state from the marker. This will allow you to select a different marker and not worry about it moving if you click on a character in the title text field.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
