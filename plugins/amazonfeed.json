You\u2019ll be given an AWS key to use in all your web service requests after you register.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the Plugin Files</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8211; Unzip and upload the /amazonfeed/ folder and files to your WordPress plugins folder, located in your WordPress install under /wp-content/plugins/</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Activate the Plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8211; Browse in the WordPress admin interface to the plugin activation page and activate the AmazonFeed plugin.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure Management Options</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8211; The plugin should now be installed and activated however no products will be displayed on your site quite yet.  The first time you visit management page, the appropriate tables will be created in the database if necessary.<br />\n&#8211; On this page you will need to enter the Amazon Associates Tag and Amazon Web Services Access Key you registered for above.

In WordPress versions before 2.7 it is located on the AmazonFeed page under the Management TAB along the top of the admin navigation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tell Us What You Think</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8211; Ok, this part is optional, but we would love to hear how AmazonFeed is helping you.
