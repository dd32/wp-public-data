        "description": "<p>Ultrapress is a suite of integrated tools for WordPress developers and users to design and build plugins, features, and circuits without writing a line of code. You can use ultrapress to update post data, add comments, create Shortcodes, and whatever you want.</p>\n<p>Ultrapress for plugins is like Elementor for themes, it lets you create plugins and circuits without the need to write any code because it uses a visual scripting system. Instead of writing codes, just bind components inside circuits to create the features you want.</p>\n<p>You can create plugins with ultrapress in minutes and upload them to WordPress directory, and they will work normally even if ultrapress is not installed. Ultrapress is useful for WordPress developers, as they can leverage the power of ultrapress to develop websites for their clients within days, sometimes even hours.</p>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>No prior programming Knowledge is required. If you have worked with WordPress before, you will discover that it is very easy to add your own custom features, and build plugins.</p>\n<h3>Why ultrapress?</h3>\n<p>WordPress is a content management system, one of WordPress&#8217;s biggest features, is that it can be expanded with plugins to add new features and functionalities in the areas of SEO, security, search, and more.</p>\n<p>This is a powerful feature, especially with the huge WordPress Library, which contains more than 50,000 plugins. On the other hand, there is a problem that all WordPress developers know, which is the integrability of plugins.</p>\n<p>WordPress plugins are separate pieces of software composed of multiple scripts. When you have two plugins each performing a different function, you may want to combine them and make them work together as if they were a single plugin.</p>\n<p>Linking two plugins and making them work together as one plugin is a very complex process and takes too much time. Sometimes it is easier to create a new plugin rather than trying to combine two plugins.</p>\n<p>Some developers try to address this issue by inserting hooks at certain points of the workflow. While this may provide a partial solution and allow programmers to connect plugins, this solution cannot be relied on because not all plugins have hooks that can be used to integrate with other plugins. And even if these plugins have hooks, to link plugin, you will have to spend a considerable amount of time studying them, trying to understand them, and guessing which hooks are best suited to work with. It is impossible for non-programmers, and annoying and time consuming for WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>The developer will eventually find himself spending days, or even weeks, trying to link plugins to get the features he wants. If you have tried this like me, you have probably wasted a lot of time before finally give up and start developing the plugin that you want from scratch. This is annoying, especially that you know that all the features you want already exist in other plugins, but you cannot combine them.</p>\n<p>ultrapress solve this problem by introducing a new approach to develop in wordpress. Ultrapress is like a logo game. You can build the features that you want with circuits and components without writing code.</p>\n<p>Please refer to  <a href=\"https://ultra-press.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a> for all the technical information and support documentation on the ultrapress plugin. or to <a href=\"https://www.roukman.com/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b3-ultrapress-%d9%85%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%a8%d8%a9-%d8%ab%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d8%aa%d8%b7%d9%88%d9%8a%d8%b1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d9%88%d8%a7/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a> for arabic informations.</p>\n<h3>Support us</h3>\n<p>Ultrapress is a free plugin, there is no paid version, and no paid add-ons.
