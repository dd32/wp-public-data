This is why our divi plugins extend the Divi Builder capabilities to make it even greater.</p>\n<p>Our first plugin is <strong>Responsive Divi Candy</strong>, a super lightweight plugin that helps you master rows &amp; columns layouts with Divi. Fully compatible with the last version of the Divi Builder.</p>\n<p>üìå How it works</p>\n<p>First, activate the wordpress plugin (no other configuration needed!). It will integrate directly into the Divi Builder.</p>\n<h4>Choose the number of Columns</h4>\n<p>With Divi you cannot choose if you want to have two, three or four columns side-by-side on mobile or tablet&#8230; Not anymore! You can now choose the number of columns that stack side-by-side on mobile and tablet directly into the Divi Builder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up your Divi Builder and edit a Row. Go to the Advanced tab in the Rows Settings.</li>\n<li>Toggle the option &#8220;CSS ID &amp; Classes&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Here you will see two new options called <strong>Number of Columns on Tablet</strong> and <strong>Number of Columns on Mobile</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can now choose from the dropdown list how many columns do you want to have on mobile and tablet.</li>\n<li><strong>That&#8217;s all</strong>. Congratulations!</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Set Column stacking order</h4>\n<p>With Divi you cannot choose if you want to change the column stacking order on mobile or tablet&#8230; Not anymore! You can now choose which column will be the first and which one will be the second on mobile and tablet. No need to change your design layout or duplicate it just for mobile and tablet directly into the Divi Builder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open up your Divi Builder and edit a Row. Go to the Advanced tab in the Rows Settings.</li>\n<li>Toggle the option &#8220;CSS ID &amp; Classes&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Here you will see two new options called <strong>Stacking Order on Tablet</strong> and <strong>Stacking Order on Mobile</strong>. You can choose to activate just for Tablets or Mobiles or both.</li>\n<li>After that, go to the Content tab in the Rows Settings, and go inside the first Colums Settings by clicking the gear icon.</li>\n<li>Go to the Advanced tab in the Columns Settings.</li>\n<li>Toggle the option &#8220;CSS ID &amp; Classes&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Here you will see two new options called <strong>Stacking Order on Tablet</strong> and <strong>Stacking Order on Mobile</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can now choose from the dropdown list the stacking order (from 1 to 6) on mobile and tablet.</li>\n<li>You need to assign an order to EACH column!</li>\n<li><strong>That&#8217;s all</strong>.
