Very useful if you have many WordPress installations across several servers and IP addresses.</p>\n<p>2) The memory usage and total available memory to the WordPress installation is shown in the admin footer. If memory usage is over 75% the percentage is shown in a light red and if the memory usage is over 90% the percentage is shown in red. So you can allways control with one look if there is enough memory available or if action has to be taken. It also displays the WordPress memory limit to give you more information.</p>\n<p>3) Besides the IP address and the memory you can also see the PHP version and the type of Operating System where it&#8217;s running.</p>\n<p>4) You can translate the plugin into your own language. So far English and Spanish translations are included.
