        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use the new authorization?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The old username/password paradigm can still be used, but will result in a <code>X-Deprecated</code> header being returned by the server.</p>\n<p>From now on, you will send an <code>Authorization</code> header.  This header will be the publishing application&#8217;s public key, two pipe (<code>|</code>) characters, and a hash of the application&#8217;s secret key concatenated with the body of the request.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I generate the message hash?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Say your application has the following information:<br />\n* Public Key: b730db0864b0d4453ba6a26ad6613cd4<br />\n* Secret Key: 7647a19f5bf3e9fd001419900ad48a54</p>\n<p>And you want to make the following request (whitespace/indentation added for readability, but is removed when calculating hashes):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;methodCall&gt;\n  &lt;methodName&gt;wp.getPosts&lt;/methodName&gt;\n  &lt;params&gt;\n    &lt;param&gt;\n      &lt;value&gt;&lt;i4&gt;1&lt;/i4&gt;&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/param&gt;\n    &lt;param&gt;\n      &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/param&gt;\n    &lt;param&gt;\n      &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/param&gt;\n  &lt;/params&gt;\n&lt;/methodCall&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the second and third parameters (traditionally <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>) are empty.  Usernames and passwords can still be specified, but will result in the server returning an <code>X-Deprecated</code> header.</p>\n<p>Your Authorization header would thus become:</p>\n<pre><code>b730db0864b0d4453ba6a26ad6613cd4||3fac15f99f7a178f922bcc4942e62dc9001b2a45118fc3a6f3aebd77d25f4d58\n</code></pre>\n<p>The second part of the header is generated in PHP by calculating:</p>\n<pre><code>hash( 'sha256', '7647a19f5bf3e9fd001419900ad48a54' . hash( 'sha256', '7647a19f5bf3e9fd001419900ad48a54' . {request_body} ) )\n</code></pre>\n<p>WordPress will read the header and log you in as usual, but you never need to send your password across the wire.</p>\n<p>In this paradigm, application secret keys should <em>also</em> be treated as passwords &#8211; they are sensitive information!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are we using the secret key twice?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some developers raised concerns about <a href=\"https://blog.whitehatsec.com/hash-length-extension-attacks/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">length extension attacks</a> in previous editions of the plugin. While length extension isn&#8217;t strictly necessary when dealing with XML-based messaging, a double hash helps end the discussion around potentially-related vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The double-hash is similar to but simpler than HMAC and is fairly easy to implement in any programming language. Just note, PHP&#8217;s <code>hash()</code> function returns a base64-encoded string, not a raw hash of the data passed in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to copy/paste my application keys into remote systems?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not necessarily.</p>\n<p>The latest version of the plugin adds a new XML-RPC method to the system that allows for the generation of user-specific application keys remotely. <em>Please only ever call this method over a secure/trusted network connection</em> when setting up an application for the first time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
