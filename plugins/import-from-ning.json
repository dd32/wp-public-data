        "faq": "\n<h4>What if I&#8217;m not running BuddyPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Version 2.0+ of Import From Ning does not support WordPress standalone. Use version 1.1: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/import-from-ning/download/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What content will Import From Ning import?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Import From Ning currently imports the following items from a Ning export: members, member profiles, member avatars, members comments (the &#8220;wall&#8221;), groups, discussions, and blogs. The plugin attempts to recognize inline images and copy them to the BuddyPress installation, so that you don&#8217;t lose the images you&#8217;ve put in your blog posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about my images, movies, and music?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>BuddyPress by itself does not currently support photo, movie, or music galleries. The best plugin available for images right now is BuddyPress Album+ https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-album/, which is in the process of being adapted to support video and audio galleries as well. In the future, I hope to expand this plugin to import content for display with Album+, but in the meantime you can import your multimedia content manually.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do if I have a gargantuan network?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is most reliable when working with relatively small sets of data, though I have tested it with a network import of over 1300 users. There are various safeguards built into Import From Ning, so that if a particular step fails to complete because your hosting environment runs out of memory, you can simply refresh the page to pick up from where you&#8217;ve left off.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s with all these new groups?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In BuddyPress, each forum must be associated with a group. In cases where your Ning discussion thread was not part of a group, Import From Ning creates a group corresponding to the discussion category and places the discussion topic there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>You rule!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not really a question, but thanks. You are pretty cool yourself.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
