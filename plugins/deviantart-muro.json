        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this plugin secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Security is a complicated question, the deviantART muro plugin uses WordPress&#8217; standard upload mechanisms for adding items to your Media Library, so that part is as secure as core WordPress.</p>\n<p>For comments upload there&#8217;s an inherent risk caused by the fact that you&#8217;re accepting a file upload from a potentially untrusted and unknown user. For this reason the deviantART muro comments are turned off for the default install, you must enable them from the settings panel.</p>\n<p>The deviantART muro plugin attempts to minimise the risk by checking that the file type uploaded is a legitimate PNG image and that it is saved under a .png file extension (to avoid image polyglot attacks).</p>\n<p>In addition to that, there is the ability to set image comments to be held for moderation even if the comment wouldn&#8217;t usually require moderation.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you just don&#8217;t like the idea of people being able to upload files to your server, you can disable the images-in-comments part of the plugin entirely.</p>\n<p>That covers server security, but there&#8217;s also the issue of client-side security.</p>\n<p>By using this plugin you&#8217;re running Javascript from within the plugin. This Javascript is hosted on your server and is under your control &#8211; you can inspect it to satisfy yourself that it is trustworthy.</p>\n<p>As part of the embedding process however, the client will fetch and run Javascript from deviantART&#8217;s webservers. Some of this fetched Javascript needs to run in the context of a site controlled by you, which could technically allow us to access cookies and other &#8220;same origin&#8221; data within that fetched Javascript.</p>\n<p>We have no intention of such access, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to take our word for it. So if you&#8217;re concerned, the <code>deviantart_muro_sandbox.html</code> file can be moved to a sandbox domain/static assets domain that has no access to your site cookies or private content. From the admin settings page for the plugin you can then configure the location of the sandbox page and the plugin will continue working normally.

Some examples of this would be JetPack comments or Disqus comments.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
