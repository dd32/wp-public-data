The name Soapberry strives to indicate this plugin is complementary to the work by the Ackee project while by unique enough to make clear that the two are not formally associated. Fun fact, the fruit of the Soapberry plant is used to make soap which is where Sapindus got its secondary name.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nThe plugin is active but I do not see the tracking code.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, make sure your theme has the <code>wp_footer()</code> function added before the closing body tag. The plugin hooks into the WordPress footer, making this template tag required.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re still not seeing the tracking code, make sure your settings have been saved, and you do not have the &#8220;Exclude Logged In&#8221; checkbox enabled. If you are excluding logged in visits, then try loading your site in a private tab or another browser.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
