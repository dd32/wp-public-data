You can track 50+ bots, crawlers, spiders etc and it has flexibility to add more.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>But I only want to track one Bot?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In Pro you can deactivate what you don&#8217;t want to track.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I upgrade from Lite to Pro?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple. First Deactivate your Lite version and activate your Pro version and that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I update Bot Info ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well you can in Pro, but I would recommend not to touch data that comes with this plugin. You can however add your own bots, spiders etc and experiment with that data instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>From where can I get Pro version ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please browse to this URL http://jaspreetchahal.org/jc-wordpress-bot-detector-plugin-pro/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
