        "description": "<p>Sync Podcast RSS feeds with your WordPress website automatically. The Podcast Importer plugin helps to easily import podcasts into WordPress. You can import your podcast into the regular WordPress posts or into a custom post type (if you have an existing one).<br />\nThe plugin fully supports popular WordPress podcasting plugins such as PowerPress, Seriously Simple Podcasting, Simple Podcast Press, and works even better with podcast themes developed by <a href=\"https://secondlinethemes.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SecondLineThemes</a></p>\n<p>The plugin supports importing episodes into existing custom post types, assign categories, import featured images and more. Additionally, the plugin enables continuous import or &#8220;Sync&#8221; of podcast RSS feeds, so every time you release a new podcast episode, it could be automatically created within WordPress. You can also set multiple import schedules and import different podcasts from separate sources at the same time. (For example, when importing separate podcasts from separate feeds into one website)</p>\n<p>To use the plugin, simply run a new import under &#8220;Tools -&gt; Podcast Importer SecondLine&#8221; via the main menu that appears in your WordPress dashboard. Set the different options and if you need a continuous import process for future episodes, make sure to hit that checkbox before running the import process.<br />\nYou can disable a schedueld import at any time by simply deleting the import entry.</p>\n<p>The plugin also supports automatic import of native / embed audio players from 15+ podcast hosting providers, including: Buzzsprout, Megaphone, Pinecast, Captivate, Transistor, <a href=\"https://anchor.fm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Anchor.fm</a>, Simplecast, Podbean, Whooshkaa, Omny, Ausha, Spreaker, <a href=\"https://podcastpage.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Podcastpage.io</a> Audioboom, Fireside, Libsyn and more.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p>The Pro version can be found here &#8211; <a href=\"https://secondlinethemes.com/podcast-importer-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://secondlinethemes.com/podcast-importer-pro</a><br />\nIt includes:<br />\n* Unlimited scheduled imports for podcasts/shows.<br />\n* Import to any Custom Post Type or Custom Taxonomy.<br />\n* Set specific import intervals / times.<br />\n* Import transcripts from RSS feed.<br />\n* Import audio player to custom fields.<br />\n* Import tags and categories from the feeds.<br />\n* Force a re-sync on all existing episodes (to update metadata)<br />\n* Set a global featured image to all imported episodes.<br />\n* Manual &#8220;Sync&#8221; button to sync on demand.</p>\n<h3>About SecondLineThemes</h3>\n<p>SecondLineThemes is developing unique WordPress themes and plugins for Podcasters. Our tools are very popular among podcasters.

Once all episodes are imported, only future ones would be imported, assuming you selected the continuous import option.<br />\nIf you import a large feed while importing featured images, it may take several runs to fully complete, so make sure to run the import process several times until all episodes were imported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20podcast%20feeds%20from%20any%20host%3F'>\nDo you support podcast feeds from any host?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. All types of podcast feeds can be imported, as long as they are in an RSS/XML format. If you feel something is missing, please reach out and we will ensure to look into it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20import%20does%20not%20work%20for%20my%20podcast%20feed'>\nThe import does not work for my podcast feed\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all, make sure you are filling in a valid URL, of a valid podcast RSS feed. Second, make sure your server is up to modern requirements &#8211; we recommend PHP 7 or above.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
