        "description": "<h4>UTM Switcher</h4>\n<p>The UTM Switcher is a powerful tool to help you track <em>where</em> your site visitors are coming from and modify page elements based upon a utm_source GET variable in a url. It notes where a site visitor first lands, and then proactively changes targeted elements across your entire website to match that source.</p>\n<h4>Keep track of your leads</h4>\n<p>In digital marketing, it can be difficult to figure out which of your channels is getting the best results: whether it’s Adwords, facebook paid advertising, blogging, or something else. For this reason, some companies use landing pages with different phone numbers to track the source of a lead. However, typical customers have multiple interactions with a site before following any call to action. They may click through several pages before making a decision. That’s where UTM Switcher comes in.</p>\n<h4>How it works</h4>\n<p>UTM Switchers uses cookies to keep your lead-specific content consistent across all pages. The cookies are only destroyed once the website is closed. It works with all WordPress sites and features integrations with Contact Form 7 and Contact Form DB. The information stored is taken from the URL&#8217;s GET variables utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign</p>\n<p>When a UTM Switcher finds a matching DOM element using jQuery, it replaces the content of that element with the value supplied in the switch. Each Switcher can be set to match a specific utm_source in the URL or stored as a cookie value to the specific DOM element. An example of this is if the utm_source value is Facebook change the value to 1234 and if the utm_source value is Twitter change the targeted element to 4321. Each Switcher can also be set to replace the value with a tel: anchor tag for use with a call tracking plugin.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the <a href=\"https://www.betoplocal.com/call-tracking-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">call tracking plugin here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Recommended PHP Version</h4>\n<p>PHP 5.4 or greater</p>\n<h4>Required plugins</h4>\n<p>None</p>\n<h4>Recommended plugins</h4>\n<p>Contact Form 7 &#8211; If you choose, the UTM information can be sent in your form email. This information will include the information gathered from the initial URL GET variables utm_source, utm_medium, and utm_campaign. These values are then passed along to the email via a shortcode, e.g. [utm-100]</p>\n<p>Contact Form DB &#8211; This extension is not required, but we do recommend it.</p>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Under UTM Switchers, click Add New</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter an Identifier &#8212; this is for internal use only. You could use it to keep track of what the switch does</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter an selector (an #ID or .classname or other selector) to target. This field uses <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery syntax</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the Type. Phone Number Element will replace the whole element with an anchor link with a tel: attribute. Text replacement replaces all text in the above element</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click &#8220;Add Switcher&#8221; under UTM Source Switchers. A matching value in the Campaign Source field to the utm_source GET variable will replace the above selector&#8217;s content with the value in the Replacement Value field. HTML can be used. You may add multple switches for different UTM Sources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Publish.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Contribute</h4>\n<p>To report any bugs, or to offer features, please use our <a href=\"https://github.com/Shamley/UTM-Switcher\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a></p>\n<h3>Updates</h3>\n<p>The basic structure of this plugin was cloned from the <a href=\"https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate</a> project.</p>\n",
