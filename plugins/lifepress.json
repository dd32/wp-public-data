With LifePress you can record unlimited daily events easily with unlimited color-coded categories separated for each user. Track back recorded events quickly with weekly and monthly calendar view.</p>\n<p>You are the creator of wonderful events, journal them with <strong><a href=\"https://ashanjay.com/lifepress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LifePress</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3>Main FEATURES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Record <strong>unlimited</strong> daily events</li>\n<li>Create unlimited color-coded event categories</li>\n<li>Edit event categories in real-time</li>\n<li>Ability to write lengthy description for entries if desired</li>\n<li>Record events by each loggedin website user</li>\n<li>Navigate through months or weeks from top navigator</li>\n<li>Easily check back and view or track recorded events and progress</li>\n<li>Weekly and monthly view of events</li>\n<li>Search previously recorded events</li>\n<li>Compatible with responsive design for veiwing from various devices</li>\n<li>Various pluggable actions and filters allow developers to extend features</li>\n<li>Quickly access any month from fast selector</li>\n<li>From any date come back easily to current date</li>\n<li>Attach images to entries</li>\n<li>Insert Calendar dashboard anywhere on your site using shortcode</li>\n<li>Ability to set timezone for entries</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>21 days to make a change in your life</h3>\n<p>Scientists have calculated that an average of 21 days are required to be established as a habit in your life, if done repeatedly on those days. LifePress offers a great platform to record your repeated attempts at learning a new talent or practice to improve for 21 days. If you record these repeated attempts in LifePress, you can easily look back and see when you started the 21 day challenge, when you fell off, and how you are making progress.</p>\n<h3>Own your personal Journal Data</h3>\n<p>With LifePress, journal entry data is all yours. Your personal data is privately saved only in your database and only you can see them. Each logged in user will have their own separate LifePress calendar.</p>\n<h3>Business Applications</h3>\n<p>LifePress is a great solution for business organizations that want to influence their members to record daily entries to track progress in a calendar format. Each user&#8217;s data is only visible to that user and admin in the calendar, which makes it a great team empowering solution. This would be an ideal solution for life coaches, fitness instructors, physical/life therapists who want their clients to record progressive data to help their clients make tangible changes in life.</p>\n<h3>LifePress Pro &#8211; Coming Soon!</h3>\n<p>As we have received several requests to improve the lifepress plugin for greater application, we are developing the Lifepress Pro, plugin as an extension to LifePress that will bring greater data metric information for calendar entries. We are also hoping in future iterations to implement data visualization for weekly and monthly data aggregates and ability to set goals and calculate progress towards them.<br />\nUpdate (Aug 2024) We are hoping to get this Pro version out as we release version 2.1 and continue to put time into LifePress development.</p>\n",
