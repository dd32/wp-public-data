        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I get a detailed report after my campaign has run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Once all of the quota of users in the order has visited the website specified in your Boost purchase, we will prepare and send a detailed report. The report usually completes within a day of fulfillment of the order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When will my campaign run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once the purchase is completed, it gets added to our queue and then it usually begins within a day and finishes when all purchased quota of users have visited the website specified in your Boost order. It usually completes within approximately a day.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens after my purchase?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Almost immediately after purchase we will send an email to the address you specify during purchase confirming your order details. Please check that the email did not go into your spam folder of your email account if you do not receive it. Then your purchase is added to our queue and scheduled to run. Usually the campaign starts within a day of purchase. Then once the campaign is finished and the number of visitors matches your order, we will send a detailed order report. That usually happens within a day of completing your order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is my payment secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Payment is powered by PayPal. Whether you pay with a credit card or with a PayPal account, we never have access to your payment data. We do not have access to your payment details so we never store it either.
