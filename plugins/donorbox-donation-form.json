Donorbox has helped us increase the contributions we receive.&#8221;</em><br />\n<strong>Sarah Gran</strong><br />\n<strong>Director of Communications at Let&#8217;s Encrypt</strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Before using Donorbox we were constantly having problems with our online donation processing. Donors contacted us monthly having problems setting up their gifts. Since transitioning to Donorbox we have not had a single donor contact us saying they were having trouble setting up a gift. In fact, we&#8217;ve had several donors tell us how easy the new process is. The Donorbox team has been extremely responsive when we need help and have already implemented suggestions for future features. I have no hesitations recommending Donorbox to you.&#8221;</em><br />\n<strong>Brandon Jernigan</strong><br />\n<strong>Grad Resources</strong></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We needed a straightforward solution to handle donations on our website and have them sync across to Salesforce. Enter Donorbox &#8211; a simple, easy to use and customisable donation solution with Salesforce integration. Set up was as simple as creating an account (and donation campaign), adding a plugin to our WordPress site and configuring the connection to Salesforce. Donorbox handles the rest. Support is always prompt to respond and provide helpful answers to our questions and queries. If you&#8217;re after a donation system for your website then we&#8217;d recommend you give Donorbox a go.&#8221;</em><br />\n<strong>Peter Sillar</strong><br />\n<strong>Logosdor</strong></p>\n<h3>DONORBOX FEES AND COMMISSION</h3>\n<p>Donorbox fees are the lowest of other funding platforms around.
