People will be able to purchase these spaces from you, and you will receive the payment directly after you approve the ad.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this look?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ad spaces are fully customizable through our web platform and also by writing custom CSS. For a demo, take a look at <a href=\"https://intravert.carrd.co/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://intravert.carrd.co/</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How will I get paid?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will ask you to connect a Stripe account to our backend. Payouts are being sent to your bank account automatically after that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who will buy these ad spaces?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Advertisers will traditionally come from your own community and see value in advertising their services on your site. We also offer a <a href=\"https://intravert.co/marketplace/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">marketplace</a> which will help you gain further visibility.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work? Why not use AdSense?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Indeed, it does! AdSense is a huge network which splits profits. Out of that, AdSense takes a huge chunk too. Out of every ad campaign, you will only receive a payment of $1 &#8211; $5 per 1,000 impressions. If you sell your own, you keep a bigger chunk. Some of our publishers have experienced payouts more than 100x bigger than what they got through AdSense.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much does this cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is free! Once you receive and accept a booking, we will receive a small portion of that. If you don&#8217;t get paid, we don&#8217;t either. Check out <a href=\"https://intravert.co/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website</a> for more info.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
