It allows you to run tests without using real credit cards or bank accounts. You must use special test credit card details when using the test environment.</p>\n<p>NB: the test environment is visible to anyone who wants to log in and perform testing. Never use real personal details or credit card details in the test environment, because they will be seen by other testers!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20dummy%20credit%20card%20details%20for%20testing%20purposes%3F'>\nWhere can I find dummy credit card details for testing purposes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find test credentials on the <a href=\"https://dev.heidelpay.com/sandbox-environment/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">heidelpay test environment developer page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20will%20the%20customer%20be%20directed%20after%20they%20complete%20their%20transaction%3F'>\nWhere will the customer be directed after they complete their transaction?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Standard Gravity Forms submission logic applies.

This is the default payment method, and is the method most websites will use for payments.</p>\n<p>Authorize checks to see that the transaction would be approved, but does not process it. Once the transaction has been authorized, you can complete it manually in your heidelpay console. You cannot complete Authorize transactions from WordPress/Gravity Forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20do%20recurring%20payments%3F'>\nCan I do recurring payments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20an%20ssl%20error%20when%20my%20form%20attempts%20to%20connect%20with%20heidelpay'>\nI get an SSL error when my form attempts to connect with heidelpay\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a common problem in local testing environments.
