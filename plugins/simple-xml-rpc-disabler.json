It uses HTTP as the transport mechanism, and XML to encode its calls.</p>\n<p>Unless you use remote technologies and mobile applications to update your WordPress site, you might not be familiar with XML-RPC. For the uninitiated, you can use xmlrpc.php to establish a remote connection to WordPress, and make updates to your site without directly logging in to your WordPress system.</p>\n<p>XML-RPC is indeed useful for enabling remote connections between various external applications and WordPress. On the other hand, disabling this feature can help improve your site’s security.</p>\n<h4>Why You Should Disable xmlrpc.php?</h4>\n<p>The problem is that xmlrpc.php poses a security risk. It creates an additional access point to your site, which could leave it vulnerable to external attacks. Every time you authenticate XML-RPC, you need to supply your username and password. As you can imagine, this isn’t exactly ideal for security purposes.</p>\n<p>For example, in order to prevent brute force attacks, you can limit login attempts on your WordPress site. However, with XML-RPC enabled, that limit does not exist. There’s no capping on login attempts, which means it’s only a matter of time before a determined cybercriminal gains access.</p>\n<p>By disabling the feature, you are closing a potential area of entry for hackers.</p>\n<p>XML-RPC functionality is turned on by default since WordPress 3.5. This plugin completely disables the XML-RPC API which can be abused by hackers on a WordPress site, providing an easy and simple way to disable/enable the XML-RPC API.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.8.1 or higher.</li>\n</ul>\n",

If security is your top priority, this may be a step you want to consider. Additionally, if remote connections aren’t something you deal with on a day-to-day basis, you likely won’t miss the feature when it’s gone. In this situation, you have nothing to lose and only an added layer of security to gain.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20know%20if%20the%20plugin%20is%20working%3F'>\nHow to know if the plugin is working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can try the <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">XML-RPC Validator</a>, written by Danilo Ercoli. Keep in mind that you want the validator to fail and tell you that XML-RPC services are disabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='plugin%20seems%20broken%20...'>\nPlugin seems broken &#8230;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin is activated, but XML-RPC appears to still be enabled or if the plugin is deactivated, but XML-RPC appears to still be disabled, then it&#8217;s possible that another plugin or the theme functions is affecting the xmlrpc_enabled filter. Additionally, server configurations could be blocking XML-RPC (i.e. blocking access to xmlrpc.php with the .htaccess file).</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Files xmlrpc.php&gt;\nOrder allow,deny\nDeny from all\nAllow from 123.123.123.123\n&lt;/Files&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20disabling%20xml-rpc%20affect%20seo%3F'>\nWill disabling XML-RPC affect SEO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The XML-RPC API or xmlrpc.php for WordPress, has nothing to do with SEO.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
