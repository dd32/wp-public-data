Maybe you&#8217;ve had the same problem, and I hope this filter helps you solve it.</p>\n<p>The filter works by hooking the &#8220;syndicated_post&#8221; action of FeedWordPress and the &#8220;save_post&#8221; action in the core of WordPress.</p>\n<p>For each potential post from a feed, the plugin attempts to find an identical SHA1 hash of the first 1024 non-whitespace characters (stripped of HTML tags) of the post content.<br />\nIf it finds a match the post is skipped. If not, the post is processed and a hash is inserted into the post&#8217;s metadata. (Stored as key _dpf.)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> No filter is going to be 100% accurate.  This filter will stop <em>most</em> or <em>some</em> duplicates, but in all likelihood, will not stop <em>all</em> of them.<br />\nIf you want a filter that stops <em>all</em> duplicates, this isn&#8217;t your solution. In my test installation I had 5 posted duplicates out of<br />\n125 syndicated posts (4% false negative) out of a corpus of about 300 duplicates. Most of those false negatives were due to slightly different HTML markup<br />\nin the post content itself. So my approach isn&#8217;t perfect, but it is &#8220;good enough&#8221; for me.</p>\n<h3>Important Note</h3>\n<p>This filter can only check future syndication posts.

        "changelog": "<p>1.5 &#8211; Remove HTML tags before computing hash.</p>\n<p>1.4 &#8211; Overhauled strategy for duplicate detection. This works better than previous strategies.</p>\n<p>1.3 &#8211; Fixed a dumb typo. Rewrote the DB query using better wpdb methods (prepare and query). Changed from htmlescape2 to esc_html WP function.</p>\n<p>1.2 &#8211; Escaping the single quote (&#8216;) character sometimes gives a conversion of &#8217; instead of &#8217; This caused a false negative and duplicate posts would be stored. Consider this release a temporary hack until I write a proper regex based title escape function.</p>\n<p>1.1 &#8211; Characters in post-titles like &#8216;&amp;&#8217; were not getting converted to HTML entities. This caused the post title comparison to register a false negative. (So duplicate posts would be added to your feed.)</p>\n<p>1.0 &#8211; initial release</p>\n"
