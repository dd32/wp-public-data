Simply install, activate and go!</p>\n<p>Ugh, this Dashboard menu is so cluttered?</p>\n<p>Where is everything?</p>\n<p>Is it in Tools? Or Settings? Or some menu of it&#8217;s own?</p>\n<p>How am I supposed to work with this clutter?</p>\n<h3>If the WordPress Dashboard is slowing you down, Turbo Admin is here to speed you up.</h3>\n<p>Turbo Admin&#8217;s main features are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A fast-action, keyboard driven command palette: Think Apple Spotlight, or Alfred, but in WordPress!</li>\n<li>The command palette is pop-up/modal by default, but has an option to be present in the admin bar.</li>\n<li>A &#8220;barkeeper&#8221; that hides non-critical admin-bar items in a slide-out panel.</li>\n<li>(Experimental) Notice hiding: Tidy your dashboard by hiding admin notices in a separate, slide-out panel.</li>\n<li>(Experimental/Beta): List table keyboard shortcuts &#8211; use vim-like keys to navigate lsit tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you love this plugin, you can get Turbo Admin on ALL your sites without needing to install the plugin, PLUS additional premium features, with <a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the browser extension version</a>!</p>\n<p>PLUS the browser extension has features not present in the plugin. Some features only make sense in the extension, others are considered &#8220;premium&#8221; and are only available in the browser extension.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce search (premium &#8211; extension only)</li>\n<li>Gravity Forms Search (premium &#8211; extension only)</li>\n<li>Full screen block editor killer</li>\n<li>Block editor welcome guide remover</li>\n<li>Live/dev site labels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, the browser extension works everywhere that it can detect WordPress, without needing a plugin. And it carries your preferences with you! It&#8217;s WordPress, your way!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check out the Browser Extension and try it for free</a></p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Install, activate and go!</p>\n<h3>Using the Command Palette</h3>\n<p>The command palette is a keyboard-driven, pop-up menu.</p>\n<p>The default keyboard shortcut to activate the command palette is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P (Linux also?)</li>\n<li>Mac: Cmd-Alt-Shift-P</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can customise the keyboard combination used in the settings in your user profile. Be careful not to choose a keyboard combination already used by your browser!</p>\n<p>Close the palette with Escape, clicking outside of it, or pressing Ctrl/Cmd-Alt-Shift-P (or your custom key combination) again.</p>\n<p>Hover over the snail in the admin bar for a reminder of your shortcut at any time.</p>\n<p>You can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>type to filter the commands</li>\n<li>use up and down arrows to select an item</li>\n<li>press enter to select an item</li>\n<li>hit escape (not too hard) to close the palette</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also select items with your mouse/trackpad.</p>\n<p>If you hold Ctrl/Cmd when selecting an item it will open in a new tab/window (you may need to allow your browser to open popups).</p>\n<h3>Search modes</h3>\n<p>As well as commands, the plugin can also search content that is made available through the REST API (as long as the REST API can be discovered).</p>\n<p>This is done using &#8220;search modes&#8221;.</p>\n<p>For example, if you type &#8220;post&#8221; and then press the tab key (or type a colon) you will switch to the &#8220;post&#8221; search mode. In this mode you are searching for posts.</p>\n<p>Turbo Admin automatically creates search modes for any public post types on your site. It also creates the following search modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user</li>\n<li>plugin</li>\n<li>site (for WordPress Multisite sites)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is full documentation of search modes on <a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/searching.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the Turbo Admin website</a></p>\n<h3>Admin bar search mode</h3>\n<p>The command palette is pop-up/modal by default. But if you forget it&#8217;s there then you can opt to have the command palette as an always-displayed search box in the admin bar.</p>\n<p>To use this mode, visit your user profile, find the &#8220;Turbo Admin settings&#8221; section and check the &#8220;Admin bar search&#8221; option. Be sure to click &#8220;Update Profile&#8221; to save the change.</p>\n<h3>Barkeeper</h3>\n<p>The &#8220;Barkeeper&#8221; hides away non-critical admin-bar items in a slide-out panel. Click the arrow to toggle the panel open and closed.</p>\n<p>The Barkeeper keeps a few items that I&#8217;ve deemed as critical, such as the site name and the updates icon/notification.</p>\n<p>To enable the Barkeeper feature, visit your user profile, find the &#8220;Turbo Admin settings&#8221; section and check the &#8220;Barkeeper&#8221; option. Be sure to click &#8220;Update Profile&#8221; to save the change.</p>\n<p>This feature pairs really well with the admin bar search mode, freeing up space for the admin-bar search box.</p>\n<h3>Using the (experimental) Notice Hiding feature</h3>\n<p>Notice hiding lets you move unwanted notices into a separate panel at the top-right of the dashboard.</p>\n<p>To turn on the Notice Hiding feature, visit your user profile, find the &#8220;Turbo Admin settings&#8221; section, and check the feature in the &#8220;Additional features&#8221; section. Be sure to click &#8220;Update Profile&#8221; to save the change.</p>\n<p>I have attempted to be somewhat &#8220;intelligent&#8221; in how I hide notices, automatically handling obvious cases, and giving you choice in other cases.</p>\n<p>This is why this feature is flagged as &#8220;Experimental&#8221; &#8211; I may not have the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; right just yet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/hide-notices.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about Turbo Admin&#8217;s Notice Hiding</a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Notices&#8221; tab in the top-right will show a red-circled number if there are notices to see.</p>\n<p>If Turbo Admin gives you the option of hiding a notice it will have a &#8220;Move to panel&#8221; button. Click this to move it to the panel. You can always move it back if you change your mind.</p>\n<h3>Using the (experimental) List Table Keyboard Shortcuts feature</h3>\n<p>This feature is documented on <a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com/list-table-keys.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the Turbo Admin website</a></p>\n<p>To turn on the List Table Keyboard Shortcuts feature, visit your user profile, find the &#8220;Turbo Admin settings&#8221; section, and check the feature in the &#8220;Additional features&#8221; section. Be sure to click &#8220;Update Profile&#8221; to save the change.</p>\n",

This filter should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Return 0 to show the icon</li>\n<li>Return 1 to hide the icon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This filter is a default and is overridden by the user&#8217;s setting.</p>\n<pre><code>// Hide icon by default for everyone\nadd_filter('turbo_admin_hide_icon_default', 'ta_hide_icon', 10, 2);\nfunction ta_hide_icon($hide, $user_id) {\n    return 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20really%20have%20to%20install%20this%20on%20every%20site%3F'>\nDo I really have to install this on EVERY site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny you ask. There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https://turbo-admin.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">browser extension</a> that will let you have Turbo Admin on every wp-admin without having to install anything!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
