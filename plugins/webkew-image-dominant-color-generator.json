In addition, to the colors palette, it generates a dominant color which can be overridden by color from the generated colors palette.<br />\nAll generated colors are hexadecimal values.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides a shortcode [webkew_dc field_name=&#8221;&#8221; override_field=&#8221;&#8221;] which can returns a dominant color of any specific image specified using the shortcode parameters.<br />\nOne use-case of this shortcode is the following: You are a web agency, and you want to create webpage for every client&#8217;s project you have built. You want to give each page a background color that&#8217;s based on the color of the client&#8217;s brand/logo or any specific color you specify.<br />\nInstead of assigning the colors manually, this plugin will generate the dominant color automatically for you and the shortcode will provide you with that color.<br />\nThe shortcode gives you also some flexibility by using parameters when using the shortcode:<br />\n1. field_name: this could be the name of image custom field or the string &#8220;featured&#8221; to select the featured image of the post/page/custom post type. The dominant color of the image specified here will be returned as a hexadecimal value.<br />\n2. override_field: ignore the dominant color provided by the previous field and use the name of another custom field in post/page/custom post type. The color specified in this field will be returned as a hexadecimal value.</p>\n<p>If the image specified in <code>field_name</code> doesn&#8217;t have a dominant color, and the <code>override_field</code> is empty, the shortcode will return the value of the fallback color which can be set in the WordPress admin panel under Settings &#8211;&gt; General section.</p>\n",
