This is useful when the sender does not wish to receive replies directly.</li>\n<li>Addition of &#8220;CC&#8221; option: &#8220;CC&#8221; stands for &#8220;Carbon Copy&#8221;. When you CC an email to someone, you send them a copy of your email. The CC&#8217;d person may not be the main recipient of the email, but they are included for their reference. Everyone who receives the email can see who has been CC&#8217;d.</li>\n<li>Addition of &#8220;BCC&#8221; option: &#8220;BCC&#8221; stands for &#8220;Blind Carbon Copy&#8221;. This works like CC, but BCC recipients are hidden from the other recipients. This is useful when you want to inform someone without letting others know that they are also receiving the same email.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Incompatible plugin detection: This feature helps identify any plugins that are not compatible and could potentially cause issues (proactive approach to prevent conflicts). It will alert you if an installed plugin is not compatible with the Custom SMTP plugin, allowing you to take necessary action.</li>\n<li>Comprehensive test email with configuration information</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<p><em>Release Date &#8211; March 14, 2024</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can test your SMTP settings before saving them.</li>\n<li>Secure SMTP option accept <code>None</code> as value.</li>\n<li>Custom CSS for Settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<p><em>Release Date &#8211; March 12, 2024</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Public launch of the plugin!</li>\n<li>Completely translated into English and French.</li>\n<li>All SMTP options are editable.</li>\n</ul>\n"
