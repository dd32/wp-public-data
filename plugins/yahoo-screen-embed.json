It just works.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I pasted a link but no video embed appears?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must paste the URL on its own line, and it must not be a link. The editor will sometimes auto-link the URL, and if this happens, you must unlink the URL using the editor toolbar.</p>\n<p>Please note: Yahoo Screen’s help pages state that ‘it may not be possible to share all videos due to licensing agreements with content partners.’</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the embed shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, [embed] shortcodes will also work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work for country-specific sites like fr.screen.yahoo.com?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
