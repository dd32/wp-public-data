        "installation": "<p>Simply install this plugin as you would any WordPress plugin. Either use the automated plugin installer in your WordPress admin area, or download/unzip this package to your computer, and FTP the /hao-hao-report-button/ folder to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins). You can enable and disable the button from the plugin&#8217;s settings page, as well as set the position, location and styles of the button.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>What is the Hao Hao Report?</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.haohaoreport.com/\" title=\"The best China news and blog stories\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Hao Hao Report</a> (HHR) is a way to quickly see what the most popular English language articles regarding China are. The HHR accepts blog posts, major news articles, photos and basically anything about China.</p>\n<p>You may have heard the term &#8216;social bookmarking&#8217; before. Basically, social bookmarking allows people to save links to good articles or sites in a way that others can view them and perhaps add them to their bookmarks as well. The HHR is that plus some. If you&#8217;re familiar with the popular Digg.com site, then you&#8217;re familiar with the Hao Hao Report, as the principle is the same.</p>\n<p>Head over to <a href=\"http://www.haohaoreport.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.haohaoreport.com</a> to see it for yourself.</p>\n<h4>My auto-populated summary text has some weird junk in it. What&#8217;s up with that?</h4>\n<p>The text for the summary is grabbed directly from the post&#8217;s content. The plugin does the best it can to remove HTML code, etc., but if you are using other tags/short code in your posts, it may not be removed by the plugin&#8217;s filters. To get around this, simply be sure to set an excerpt directly in the Excerpt box below the post editor &#8212; this overrides the auto-generated excerpt.</p>\n<h4>How can I customize the button&#8217;s location/style?</h4>\n<p>Simply use the plugin&#8217;s setting page (SETTINGS-&gt;HHR BUTTON) in your WordPress administration area. From this page you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable/Disable the plugin &#8211; a good option if you want to maintain your settings, but want to stop the button from displaying.</li>\n<li>Set which pages the plugin should be displayed on. eg. only on full-length post pages, etc.</li>\n<li>Set whether the button appears at the top or the bottom of the content.</li>\n<li>Set the style of the button&#8217;s container &#8212; have it align to the left or the right of the content, or add your own CSS styles.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the first version. The biggest change is that before this, the plugin was nothing.</li>\n</ul>\n"
