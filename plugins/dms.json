On the server, move the current document respository folder to it&#8217;s new location.  By default, prior to version 1.12, it was at wp-content/plugins/dms/repository<br />\n2.  On the Document Management System page, in WordPress, click on the &#8220;Configuration&#8221; button at the bottom of the page.<br />\n3.  Under &#8220;Document Repository&#8221;, &#8220;Document Storage Path&#8221;, change the path to the new path.  The new path will vary for your installation.  One example is /var/www/wordpress-4.5/wp-content/uploads/dms_repository</p>\n</p>\n\n",
