        "description": "<p>BigCommerce for WordPress is a plugin that allows you to scale ecommerce further than ever before on WordPress. Scale your business with WordPress on the front-end and free up server resources from things like catalog management, processing payments, managing fulfillment logistics and more with BigCommerce on the back end.</p>\n<p>Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, you get access to our native ecommerce features from a single plugin, the ability to sell across multiple channels and marketplaces from a single location, and best of all, an embedded checkout experience that takes on PCI compliance and customer security on your behalf.</p>\n<h4>Quick Start!</h4>\n<p>Look at details from the latest release, including new features and enhancements here: https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/releases</p>\n<p>Dive into how you set up and customize your site using BC4WP using our guides here: https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/getting-started/introduction</p>\n<p>Have a suggestion for how we can be better? Ping the team! wordpress-suggestions@bigcommerce.com</p>\n<h4>DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TRADITIONAL PLUGIN</h4>\n<p>We’ve taken a very different approach to ecommerce in WordPress. We set out to build our plugin the WordPress Way: deliver value to the community, build it with WordPress experts and make something developers can call their own.</p>\n<p>The BigCommerce for WordPress plugin leverages the best aspects of both platforms, allowing WordPress to manage content and BigCommerce to manage ecommerce.</p>\n<h4>SCALABLE ECOMMERCE FOR WORDPRESS</h4>\n<p>Continue to tap into the unrestricted customization of WordPress while pairing it with the most scalable SaaS ecommerce engine. BigCommerce lets you build complex catalogs, manage large volumes of concurrent traffic, orders and analytics.</p>\n<p>The BigCommerce plugin ports over a copy of your product catalog and stores products as custom post types in WordPress. It also creates pages for your cart, checkout, account profiles, sign in, shipping &amp; returns, gift certificates and order history.</p>\n<p>The key difference to our approach is that you don’t need to install additional extensions to get access to common ecommerce features. Instead, you get instant access to many common (and advanced) features, such as complex catalog support, global payment gateways, currency handling, taxation, shipping calculations and centralized channel management; all out-of-the-box.</p>\n<h4>OFFLOAD BACKEND RESOURCES</h4>\n<p>Our philosophy is that processing orders and running your store shouldn&#8217;t affect the uptime and speed of your site — which can hurt your SEO, conversion, and brand. The BigCommerce plugin does the heavy commerce lifting, letting you scale your ecommerce without losing speed or uptime.</p>\n<h4>LET US HANDLE PCI COMPLIANCE</h4>\n<p>Taking on your own PCI compliance comes with a huge amount of liability and risk. BigCommerce powers the full checkout experience, assuming the burden of PCI compliance for you.</p>\n<h4>EXTENSIVE PAYMENT GATEWAYS</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce has over <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/payments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">65 payment gateway integrations</a> available out-of-the box, serving 100+ countries and over 250 local payment methods.</p>\n<p>To help you reduce costs, we’ve <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre-negotiated special credit and debit card processing rates with PayPal</a>, our preferred payment solution. The more you grow with BigCommerce and upgrade your plan, the lower your rates can go.</p>\n<h4>HIGHLY SCALABLE PRODUCT CATALOG</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce is built for large, complex catalogs with up to 600 SKUs per product, and 250 product values for a single option. Our native catalog structure treats single products (including variants, details, SKUs, etc.) as a single API call, making inventory syncing with ERPs, PIMs (and WordPress) fast.</p>\n<h4>MULTI-CHANNEL SELLING &amp; MANAGEMENT</h4>\n<p>With the core BigCommerce platform, you now have access within the control panel to sell across multiple marketplaces simultaneously, such as eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, Square and more! Save time and eliminate errors and overselling with bulk listing, automatic inventory syncing and unified order and fulfillment management.</p>\n<h4>USE YOUR FAVORITE WORDPRESS THEME</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress will work with any WordPress theme, but it may require some styling to make it fit perfectly. Are you a theme developer? We’d love to promote your BigCommerce for WordPress compatible theme. <a href=\"mailto:&#x74;&#111;&#112;&#x68;&#x65;&#114;.&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x6f;&#x73;&#105;&#097;&#x40;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#x6d;&#x65;&#114;c&#x65;&#046;&#099;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#063;s&#x75;&#098;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#061;&#x57;&#x6f;&#114;&#x64;&#x50;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#x73;&#037;2&#x30;&#084;&#104;&#x65;&#x6d;&#101;%&#x32;&#048;&#068;&#x65;&#x76;&#101;&#108;&#x6f;&#x70;&#101;&#x72;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get in touch with us here</a>.</p>\n<p>To start, we recommend choosing a cross-browser compatible WordPress ecommerce theme, since the theme options included will better match what an online store requires.</p>\n<h4>ECOMMERCE WITH GUTENBERG</h4>\n<p>We’re big supporters of Gutenberg and built our plugin to support both the classic editor and Gutenberg. Whether you’re inserting shortcodes in classic mode or product blocks in Gutenberg, we will continue to enable support for both.</p>\n<h4>SECURED USER ACCOUNTS &amp; LOGINS</h4>\n<p>In addition to offering you peace of mind with a secure checkout experience, we also extend this level of security to your shoppers, their accounts and logins, and payment information — all managed by BigCommerce.</p>\n<h4>GLOBAL SHIPPING STREAMLINED</h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Shipping-Setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support</a> all major global carriers, offer real-time carrier quotes, allow for free shipping, flat rates, dropshipping and more. With our deep ShipperHQ integration, you can even specify rates by product, category, customer group, quantity, destination, dimensions and more.</p>\n<h4>FLEXIBLE SHOPPING CART</h4>\n<p>We are bringing over a decade of focusing on building online stores to every WordPress website. Through this we bring our flexible shopping cart, along with it&#8217;s extensive customization options, so can offer enterprise grade promotions and discounts within a fully responsive layout, without additional extensions that other WordPress ecommerce plugins require.</p>\n<h4>MULTIPLE SITES; ONE CONTROL PANEL</h4>\n<p>Even if you sell across multiple WordPress sites, you shouldn&#8217;t have to manage them all in separate places. BigCommerce gives you a single control panel to manage your catalog, orders and shipping, all from one place. Streamline your admin experience and spend less time managing ecommerce on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Beyond WordPress, the endpoints we’ve opened on our platform allow you to build commerce into any sort of experience. Looking to launch a site in React? Interested in developing a mobile app? Want to integrate with an in-house POS? <a href=\"https://developer.bigcommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All of these can be built</a> and managed from within the BigCommerce Control Panel.</p>\n<h4>COMPLEX ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS INTEGRATIONS</h4>\n<p>A huge benefit of having a SaaS ecommerce engine behind the scenes is that the core platform is already built for mid-market and enterprise use cases. Natively connect to your existing ERP suites, PIM software, OMS solutions, POS systems or marketing automation tools right out of the box.</p>\n<h4>AMP SUPPORT</h4>\n<p>Unique to most WordPress ecommerce plugins, BigCommerce for WordPress also includes support for Accelerated Mobile Pages. To activate, install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\" rel=\"ugc\">official Google plugin</a>.</p>\n<h4>SUPPORT AND SERVICES</h4>\n<p>All of our BigCommerce customers have access to our <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/247-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">24/7</a> live phone, chat, and email support, run from our headquarters in Austin, Texas. For larger enterprise customers, we offer dedicated account management and implementation management services as part of your plan. We also have an ever-growing collection of help, support, and how-to guides in our <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-for-WordPress-Resources\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center</a>.</p>\n<h4>BUILT WITH DEVELOPERS IN MIND</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress was built by WordPress developers, with developers in mind. Our plugin is open source and available for you to fork, extend and modify as your needs require.</p>\n<p>Our plugin supports WordPress’ standard method of overriding template files so you can modify out-of-the-box designs. Customize your product cards, lists and shopping cart without risking plugin updates that will undo your changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are many <a href=\"https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/extending-the-plugin/code-reference\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hooks and filters</a>, so you can manipulate content to your heart’s content.</p>\n<h4>JOIN OUR BIGCOMMERCE COMMUNITY</h4>\n<p>All BigCommerce customers get access to our ever-growing online <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/community\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">community</a> to answer questions, discuss ecommerce strategies, learn about the latest product updates, contribute ideas and more.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in contributing to BigCommerce for WordPress, head over to our <a href=\"https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n",

We’d love to promote your BigCommerce for WordPress compatible theme. <a href=\"mailto:&#x74;&#111;&#112;&#x68;&#x65;&#114;.&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x6f;&#x73;&#105;&#097;&#x40;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#x6d;&#x65;&#114;c&#x65;&#046;&#099;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#063;s&#x75;&#098;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#061;&#x57;&#x6f;&#114;&#x64;&#x50;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#x73;&#037;2&#x30;&#084;&#104;&#x65;&#x6d;&#101;%&#x32;&#048;&#068;&#x65;&#x76;&#101;&#108;&#x6f;&#x70;&#101;&#x72;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get in touch with us here</a>.</p>\n<p>To start, we recommend choosing a cross-browser compatible WordPress ecommerce theme, since the theme options included will better match what an online store requires.</p>\n<h4>ECOMMERCE WITH GUTENBERG</h4>\n<p>We’re big supporters of Gutenberg and built our plugin to support both the classic editor and Gutenberg. Whether you’re inserting shortcodes in classic mode or product blocks in Gutenberg, we will continue to enable support for both.</p>\n<h4>SECURED USER ACCOUNTS &amp; LOGINS</h4>\n<p>In addition to offering you peace of mind with a secure checkout experience, we also extend this level of security to your shoppers, their accounts and logins, and payment information — all managed by BigCommerce.</p>\n<h4>GLOBAL SHIPPING STREAMLINED</h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Shipping-Setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support</a> all major global carriers, offer real-time carrier quotes, allow for free shipping, flat rates, dropshipping and more. With our deep ShipperHQ integration, you can even specify rates by product, category, customer group, quantity, destination, dimensions and more.</p>\n<h4>FLEXIBLE SHOPPING CART</h4>\n<p>We are bringing over a decade of focusing on building online stores to every WordPress website. Through this we bring our flexible shopping cart, along with it&#8217;s extensive customization options, so can offer enterprise grade promotions and discounts within a fully responsive layout, without additional extensions that other WordPress ecommerce plugins require.</p>\n<h4>MULTIPLE SITES; ONE CONTROL PANEL</h4>\n<p>Even if you sell across multiple WordPress sites, you shouldn&#8217;t have to manage them all in separate places. BigCommerce gives you a single control panel to manage your catalog, orders and shipping, all from one place. Streamline your admin experience and spend less time managing ecommerce on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Beyond WordPress, the endpoints we’ve opened on our platform allow you to build commerce into any sort of experience. Looking to launch a site in React? Interested in developing a mobile app? Want to integrate with an in-house POS? <a href=\"https://developer.bigcommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All of these can be built</a> and managed from within the BigCommerce Control Panel.</p>\n<h4>COMPLEX ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS INTEGRATIONS</h4>\n<p>A huge benefit of having a SaaS ecommerce engine behind the scenes is that the core platform is already built for mid-market and enterprise use cases. Natively connect to your existing ERP suites, PIM software, OMS solutions, POS systems or marketing automation tools right out of the box.</p>\n<h4>AMP SUPPORT</h4>\n<p>Unique to most WordPress ecommerce plugins, BigCommerce for WordPress also includes support for Accelerated Mobile Pages. To activate, install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\" rel=\"ugc\">official Google plugin</a>.</p>\n<h4>SUPPORT AND SERVICES</h4>\n<p>All of our BigCommerce customers have access to our <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/247-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">24/7</a> live phone, chat, and email support, run from our headquarters in Austin, Texas. For larger enterprise customers, we offer dedicated account management and implementation management services as part of your plan. We also have an ever-growing collection of help, support, and how-to guides in our <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-for-WordPress-Resources\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center</a>.</p>\n<h4>BUILT WITH DEVELOPERS IN MIND</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress was built by WordPress developers, with developers in mind. Our plugin is open source and available for you to fork, extend and modify as your needs require.</p>\n<p>Our plugin supports WordPress’ standard method of overriding template files so you can modify out-of-the-box designs. Customize your product cards, lists and shopping cart without risking plugin updates that will undo your changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are many <a href=\"https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/extending-the-plugin/code-reference\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hooks and filters</a>, so you can manipulate content to your heart’s content.</p>\n<h4>JOIN OUR BIGCOMMERCE COMMUNITY</h4>\n<p>All BigCommerce customers get access to our ever-growing online <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/community\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">community</a> to answer questions, discuss ecommerce strategies, learn about the latest product updates, contribute ideas and more.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in contributing to BigCommerce for WordPress, head over to our <a href=\"https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n",
