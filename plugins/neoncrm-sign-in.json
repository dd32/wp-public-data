        "installation": "<h4>Setup</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain a NeonCRM account. <a href=\"https://www.neoncrm.com/\" title=\"NeonCRM by Z2 Systems, Inc.\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn about NeonCRM</a></li>\n<li>Ensure that OAuth is enabled for your NeonCRM system. This guide can help you determine whether the API is enabled for your system:<br />\n<a href=\"http://help.neoncrm.com/api/oauth\" title=\"OAuth Keys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OAuth Keys</a></li>\n<li>Generate an API key to be used with this plugin. This guide explains how to generate an API key: <a href=\"http://help.neoncrm.com/api/keys\" title=\"API Keys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API Keys</a></li>\n<li>Extract all files in the &#8216;neon-events&#8217; plugin to the &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory,</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Navigate to Settings -&gt; NeonSSO Settings</li>\n<li>Enter a valid API Key, Organization ID, OAuth Client ID, and OAuth Secret Key into the plugin settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Use</h4>\n<p>Once the plugin is properly configured (following the steps above), a new login button will appear on your login page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users with NeonCRM constituent accounts should click that button to log in.</li>\n<li>They will be directed to the NeonCRM login screen.</li>\n<li>After entering their credentials, they will be redirected BACK to WordPress and taken to their profile page. The sign-in process will automatically populate their WordPress profile with data retrieved from NeonCRM, including First Name, Last Name, Email, and Login name.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Menus</h4>\n<p>You can add the sign-in link to your navigation menus by going to <strong>Appearance &gt; Menus</strong>. You may need to toggle this new section in the <strong>Screen Options</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Standard Shortcode</h4>\n<p>You can use a shortcode to place a login link anywhere on your website. This shortcode will direct users to the admin dashboard upon successful login:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link]</p>\n<p>You can also include your own CSS classes in this shortcode:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link class=&#8221;btn btn-default&#8221;]</p>\n<p>And, you can override your default button text like this:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link]Member Login[/neon_sign_in_link]</p>\n<h4>Redirection Shortcode</h4>\n<p>Place this shortcode within a page or post. Users who follow this link will be redirected back to the page or post:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link_return]</p>\n<p>You can also include your own CSS classes in this shortcode:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link_return class=&#8221;btn btn-default&#8221;]</p>\n<p>You can also send users to a different page on your site:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link_return redirect_to=&#8221;https://mysite.org/specific-page&#8221;]</p>\n<p>And, you can override your default button text like this:<br />\n    [neon_sign_in_link_return]Sign In and Return to this Page[/neon_sign_in_link_return]</p>\n<h4>Caveats</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin expects that your user accounts exist in NeonCRM and <strong>do not</strong> yet exist in WordPress. If you need to link an existing WordPress user to an existing NeonCRM user, you will need to enter their NeonCRM Account ID in the appropriate field on their WordPress profile page.</li>\n<li>WordPress requires each user to have a unique email address. NeonCRM does not. This means it&#8217;s possible for multiple NeonCRM users to have the same email address. If a user tries to log in to WordPress using this plugin and their email address has already been associated with a WordPress user, the login will fail. The plugin does not yet gracefully deal with this issue, largely due to the structure of NeonCRM.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What is NeonCRM?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>NeonCRM is a web-based fundraising and membership system that provides nonprofit organizations with all the tools<br />\nrequired to increase donations and memberships while automating common processes and streamlining staff&#8217;s day-to-day tasks.

It lets you set up user access based on custom roles. Any roles you create using the Members plugin will be available for mapping and assignment in the NeonCRM Sign-In plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use this plugin to create a restricted-access forum?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I highly recommend using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/\" title=\"Members Plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">Members</a> plugin in conjunction with NeonCRM Sign-In and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbPress/\" title=\"bbPress\" rel=\"ugc\">bbPress</a>. bbPress and Members work together to create restricted-access forums. Use the NeonCRM Sign-In plugin to authenticate your users based on membership and assign them the custom roles you create.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
