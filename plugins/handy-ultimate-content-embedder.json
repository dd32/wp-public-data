This started out as a small bit of PHP code to grab external content parsed inside an HTML page, but then seemingly grew to a fully functional WordPress Plugin!</p>\n<p>With this plugin, you will be able to pretty much set up a &#8220;Feed&#8221; of other content that will help automate your site&#8217;s contents. Make a change on one blog and it can appear on your other ones. Wooey!</p>\n<p>You will be able to retrieve pages and posts from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>existing pages and posts on your website.</li>\n<li>external wordpress page/post databases.</li>\n<li>external website pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t want to pull the ENTIRE part of those retrieved pages? No worries.</p>\n<p>You will be able to set exactly the sections of content you want retrieved.</p>\n<p>Just when you thought it couldn&#8217;t get any better, you will also be able to set up search and replace phrases and those can be used as &#8220;snippets&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Great so far, but are the tags and options customizable? You bet they are! You can set your own tags and options on a set of submenu pages with instructions on each one.</p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting my plugin and I hope you enjoy it.

Options for case sensitivey are available. These can be used as &#8220;content snippets&#8221; also for frequently used search and replace phrases!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Want to embed other WordPress posts and pages inside your own posts and pages! Need a feed from one of your other websites? Heck Yeah! Go to the Embedded Databases submenu and you will be able to configure all aspects of an external database. Make note of the database number you enter the login information for &#8211; it will correspond on the PAGE / POST tag you insert into your pages and posts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Handy Reset page is available to return all plugin option values back to their factory OEM settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: Does the plugin know not to embed itself in the same page to prevent endless processing?<br />\nA: Yes! You will get a warning &#8211; &#8220;ERROR! SAME PAGE EMBEDDING!&#8221; if you do so.</p>\n<p>Q: What kind of delimiters can you use for the PAGE, POST, SECTION and DEVICE tags?<br />\nA: Please use these 3 only:</p>\n<p>Curly Brackets &#8216;{ }&#8217;, Square Brackets &#8216;[ ]&#8217;, Parentheses &#8216;( )&#8217;</p>\n<p>Others like &#8220;&lt;  &gt;&#8221; will cause parsing problems.
