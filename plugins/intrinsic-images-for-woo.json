You can also check the source code and look for intrinsicsize= in the code</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20image%20sizes%20will%20it%20use%3F'>\nWhat image sizes will it use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It will use the image sizes set for the WooCommerce shop page. These settings are usually found in the customizer under Customize &gt;&gt; WooCommerce &gt;&gt; Product images &gt;&gt; Thumbnail width</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20different%20cropping%20ratios%3F'>\nWhat about different cropping ratios?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will use the values that are set in the ooCommerce image settings to ensure that the images served are correct</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='some%20images%20make%20the%20layout%20look%20weird.%20why'>\nSome images make the layout look weird. Why\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is caused by small images. When you have an image that is smaller that the cropped dimensions it will force the width. This will cause the image to be either shorter or taller than other shop images. We sell a plugin that solves this plugin and perfectly aligns all shop elements</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20on%20the%20product%20gallery%20images%3F'>\nDoes this work on the product gallery images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Product gallery images were exlcuded by design. The vast majority of stores allow for zooming of the gallery images, so to enforce the use of the cropped version would mean that shoppers would be unable to zoom in. On mobiles this may not be as big a problem, but as the majority of cache plugins don&#8217;t cache seperately for mobile and desktop using the wp_is_mobile() function would not help in this instance. It may be something we release in the next version if enough request it, but very few cache plugins currently support seperate mobile and desktop versions</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='browser%20support'>\nBrowser support\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The intrinsicimage size attribute supports about 95% of browsers currently in use. Essentially, only IE browser doesn&#8217;t support the intrinsicimage size attribute</p>\n</p>\n\n",
