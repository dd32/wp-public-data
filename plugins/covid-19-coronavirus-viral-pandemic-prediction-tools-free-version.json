During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them. These computational methods use known statistical equations that calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness.<br />\nHow fast a disease spreads is determined by calculating a reproduction number, or R0. The WHO estimates the coronavirus R0 at somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5. WHO also reports that 12-21 percent of the people with the virus became critically ill, and 2-3 percent of those infected have died.<br />\nThe R0 refers to the average number of people a sick person will infect. So, if a virus has an R0 of 2, patient zero will likely infect two people, and then those two people will each infect two more people. The cycle repeats. If an RO is greater than 1, the infection will likely continue to spread. If it is below 1, it is unlikely to spread further.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>\n<p>This plugin was made by <a href=\"//coderevolution.ro/our-story/\" title=\"Szabi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Szabi</a> from CodeRevolution.

You will also benefit of additional charts, summary tables and data, modeling the outbreak you simulate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20pandemic%3F'>\nWhat is a pandemic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A disease doesn’t have to infect all of the globe to be a pandemic. Lots of people, over broad swaths of territory, will suffice.<br />\nThe World Health Organization defines pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a definition that is a bit more elastic, describing it as a disease that spreads across regions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20would%20declare%20a%20pandemic%3F'>\nWho would declare a pandemic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An official declaration would come from the WHO, though the agency may be reluctant to unleash this term anytime soon.<br />\nThe WHO was harshly criticized when the 2009 flu pandemic turned out to be much less severe than people had feared. Rather than feeling relieved the pandemic wasn’t causing large numbers of deaths, people felt aggrieved they’d been scared over something they later concluded was far less scary than expected. And governments that had contacts to buy pandemic vaccine — contracts that were triggered by the WHO’s declaration — were left on the hook for vaccine many people didn’t want.<br />\nIn other words, the term can be a loaded one. But if this virus is discovered to be spreading in an unstoppable fashion in countries on several continents, infectious disease experts will use the P word — whether the WHO officially declares a pandemic or not.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20outbreak%20predicted%20to%20spread%3F'>\nWhere is the outbreak predicted to spread?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Further imported cases into any location that has travelers from is occurring. Wherever there is an infected person, there is the potential for the virus to spread to people in close contact with them and local outbreaks can occur.<br />\nThe World Health Organization assesses the risk as very high within China, and high regionally and globally.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20get%20support%3F'>\nHow to get support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please create a support request in the official support forum.
