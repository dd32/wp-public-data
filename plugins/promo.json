Today we have an iOS version of Promo. You will use this app to create and manage all of the promotions created on your wordpress website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do my customers need to download the Promo Application</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. All customers and potentially customers access the promotions by viewing your wordpress website. The promo application is only used for business owners.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do Promotions live on my wordpress website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, we create a new page on every wordpress website called &#8220;/promos&#8221;. All public promotions will display an image thumbnail and link to corresponding promotion page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change how Promotions are displayed on my wordpress website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Use the promo shortcodes to manipulate how promotions are displayed. You can create a new page and bring in promotions by category. Please read the technical docs or contact our support team for more details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Today, the platform is free. At a later time we&#8217;ll introduce new features and a few different pricing packages. We will give ample notice of any price changes and always offer a free plan.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the email marketing feature work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have a few ways to capture email address form your customers. Once you have an email list, you use the Promo application to create a promtotion and determne where promotion goes, including your mailing list. Once triggered, we send an email to your entire list with a link back to your wordpress website to view the promotion details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Promo good for big ecommerce stores?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Promo is best situated for someone that wants a fast way to sell or promote a few items per month. If you have 100 different products to showcase, we recommend using woocommerce or a different ecommerce wp plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have more questions, where can I get help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;re happy to help. Check promo.co for more information or try one of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Read the long FAQ &#8211; <a href=\"http://selfserve.promo.co/faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">promo.co/faq</a></li>\n<li>Ask a question via email <a href=\"support@promo.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support@promo.co</a></li>\n<li>Post a question in the support tab within this plugin</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n"
