It will lead you to the &#8220;Embed a trip&#8221; page with the needed information.<br />\nOnce you filled the two field, you need to validate in order to save and to check if the data is valid.<br />\nThen don&#8217;t forget to save the draft.</p>\n<p>Once this step done, you will be able to have a map using either a widget or a standard map.</p>\n<h3>Use the widget</h3>\n<p>To use the widget, go to your admin widget management section and add the &#8220;TraveledMap Trip&#8221; widget.<br />\nThe widget will include a map showing all the steps of your trip at first, then it will show the different cities or steps<br />\nalong user&#8217;s reading.<br />\nYou can customise the widget using different options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Show on phones</strong> will decide if the map will appear when a user is visiting the website with a mobile (width &lt;= 576px).</li>\n<li><strong>Show on tablets</strong> will decide if the map will appear when a user is visiting the website with a tablet (576px &gt; width &lt;= 768px).</li>\n<li><strong>Show on larger screens</strong> will decide if the map will appear when a user is visiting the website with a larger screen than phone or tablet (&gt; 768px).</li>\n<li><strong>Map height</strong>: The default map&#8217;s height when it&#8217;s not expanded.</li>\n<li><strong>Widget is sticky</strong>: If checked, the widget will be sticky to the top of the screen even if he&#8217;s not expanded. This way, it will follow the user scroll even in reduced size.</li>\n<li><strong>When the map is not extended, show steps</strong>: You can decide if the name of your trip&#8217;s steps will be shown by default or not. If not checked, steps will be shown only when the mouse<br />\nis over the step marker, or the step currently scrolled.</li>\n<li><strong>Can be expanded</strong>: Choose whether the widget will keep its default size, or if user will be able to expand its size by clicking a button (like a youtube video)</li>\n<li><strong>When the map is extended, show steps</strong>: This is the same option that you can configure for the extended map.</li>\n<li><strong>When the map is extended, show pictures</strong>: You can decide that pictures will never be visible. If this option is not checked, the pictures will be visible only if users decide<br />\nto expand the pictures panel, at the bottom of the map.</li>\n<li><strong>Extend to top, right, bottom or left</strong>: First, note that those options will work only if you checked the previous one. Choosing extend to top, will resize the map to fit<br />\nthe top of the screen when the user click the &#8220;extend&#8221; button. Moreover, as soon as the button is clicked, the map will be sticky in order to be close to the user<br />\nwhen he reads the article.<br />\nWith 4 options, you can decide to expand the map whereever you want. For example, if the widget is in a sidebar on the right, you can check extend top, right and bottom.<br />\nThis way, the map will be &#8220;half full sized&#8221; on the right and you don&#8217;t have to change anything to your layout !</li>\n<li><strong>Margin top, right, bottom and left</strong>: Margins are used to let some space between the map and the borders of the screen when the map is extended. Most of the time<br />\nexpand a map to the borders of the screen will be ugly, that&#8217;s why you can use margin and make the map fit the spacing of your theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that the widget won&#8217;t show if your blog post doesn&#8217;t contain a trip id information (filled in the post editor).</p>\n<h3>use the Standard map</h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use widget, that is the recommanded way to use this plugin for a better user experience, you can use the standard map.<br />\nYou can place this map everywhere in your article thanks to a <strong>Block</strong> or a <strong>Shortcode</strong>. Its behavior is the same as the widget, it will move along the<br />\nlocation you visited while users is reading your article.<br />\nThere are multiple options to customise it.</p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Map content&#8221; section:<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Show steps name</strong>: You can decide if the name of your trip&#8217;s steps will be shown by default or not. If not checked, steps will be shown only when the mouse<br />\n is over the step marker, or the step currently scrolled.<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Show pictures</strong>: You can decide that pictures will never be visible. If this option is not checked, the pictures will be visible only if users decide<br />\n to expand the pictures panel, at the bottom of the map.<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Show overview pictures</strong>: Overview pictures are the pictures you choose as the best pictures of your trip. You can decide to show them or not with this option.</p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Map settings&#8221; section:<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Map height</strong> can be defined in pixels (px) or percentage (%) of the screen&#8217;s height. It will define the height of the map when it&#8217;s not sticky.<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Map is sticky</strong> will decide if the map sticks to the top of the screen while user scroll to read the blog post.<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Show on phones</strong> will decide if the map will appear when a user is visiting the website with a mobile (width &lt;= 576px).<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Show on tablets</strong> will decide if the map will appear when a user is visiting the website with a tablet (576px &gt; width &lt;= 768px).<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Show on larger screens</strong> will decide if the map will appear when a user is visiting the website with a larger screen than phone or tablet (&gt; 768px).<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Height of the map in its standard height</strong>: This is the height the map will take. Either you can specify a fixed height with pixels (e.g 300px)<br />\n or you can specify a percentage relative to the screen height (e.g 40%).<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Height of the map in its extended height</strong>: Users will be able to choose whether the map is hidden, in standard height or extended height. This option<br />\n corresponds to the size of the expanded height, in pixels or percentage.<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Top margin</strong>: As the widget margins, you may want to see space between the map and the top of the screen. This is the way to configure a space.<br />\n The value is in pixels, but you have to omit the &#8220;px&#8221;. For example use &#8220;18&#8221;, NOT &#8220;18px&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode example</strong><br />\n[embedded_trip show_popup=&#8221;0&#8243; show_pictures=&#8221;1&#8243; show_pictures_at_start=&#8221;0&#8243; map_height=&#8221;60%&#8221; is_sticky=&#8221;1&#8243; show_on_phones=&#8221;1&#8243; show_on_tablets=&#8221;1&#8243; show_on_large_screens=&#8221;1&#8243; standard_map_height=&#8221;35%&#8221; extended_map_height=&#8221;70%&#8221; margin_top=&#8221;10&#8243;]</p>\n<h3>Define when a step should show</h3>\n<p>This step explains how the magic happens&#8230;<br />\nA you can see in the video above, the map moves from step to step while scrolling the video.<br />\nIn order to achieve these moves, you have to specify where your steps stands along your article.
