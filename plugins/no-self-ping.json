Ever have one of those Thursdays? I restored the settings description in the last release but then managed to break some of the content of that sentence. It&#8217;s now&#8230; fixed. I hope</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug: Fixed some missing output on the settings screen. Oopsie</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved plugin meta</li>\n<li>Maintenance: Beefed up code quality even more</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Because minimum VIP standards are just not enough, it now follows their hard-as-snails, full-strength standards. Because your code is worth it</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Improved accessibility where we&#8217;ve added the new field to the admin settings, so it&#8217;s now WCAG 2.0 compliant</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Code quality enhancements to bring it in line with WordPress.com VIP coding standards</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: A second update in the same month? It&#8217;s like all our Christmas&#8217; come at once. Well, I&#8217;ve now added an (optional) field to the Discussion settings so that you can specify even more domains that should&#8217;t be pinged. You&#8217;re welcome.</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added additional security &#8211; escape all the things!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Now using <code>home_url()</code> instead of <code>get_option( 'home' )</code>, as it&#8217;s more SSL friendly</li>\n<li>Enhancement: Added plugin meta</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement: Argument removed</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
