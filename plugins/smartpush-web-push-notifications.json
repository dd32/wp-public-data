        "faq": "\n<dt id='are%20web%20push%20notification%20services%20really%20free%3F'>\nAre web push notification services really free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, they are free until you reach a certain subscriber count. Until you reach that subscriber count, you can send as many notifications as you want!</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re confident that once you start paying for an account, that means your traffic is getting bigger, and your ROI on SmartPush should easily cover the monthly fees.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20an%20apple%20or%20google%20developer%20account%20to%20sign%20up%3F'>\nDo I need an Apple or Google Developer account to sign up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope, we take care of all of that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20on%20http%20and%20https%20sites%3F'>\nWill it work on HTTP and HTTPS sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it works on both, and we will be adding additional functionality to continue to give users of both types of sites the best experience possible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20my%20subscribers%20have%20to%20create%20an%20account%20with%20me%20or%20with%20smartpush%20to%20get%20the%20push%20notifications%3F'>\nDo my subscribers have to create an account with me or with SmartPush to get the push notifications?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, they don’t have to do either. It’s a simple one-click subscription service for them, and they’re done. They can also unsubscribe any time they want through their browser.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20unable%20to%20locate%20my%20site%20id%20on%20smartpush.ai%3B%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nI am unable to locate my Site ID on SmartPush.ai; what should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your Site ID is displayed on the Install Code page. In the top menu of your dashboard, look for the small icon next to the Send Notification button. This will take you to the Install Code page. From there, look for the WordPress option and click on it. You’ll then see your Site ID under this page, and you can copy it straight from here.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20install%20it%20for%20all%20my%20websites%20separately%3F'>\nDo I need to install it for all my websites separately?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the SmartPush push notification WordPress plugin needs to be installed separately on each of your websites. If you have more than one website you manage, you will want to Add a Site on your SmartPush account or sign up for a new account with a different username.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20smartpush%20branding%20on%20the%20notifications%3F'>\nIs there any SmartPush branding on the notifications?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, push notifications sent via SmartPush do not contain any SmartPush logo, brand colors, design, icon, or other branding elements. So you are free to craft customized push messages that will best communicate your brand identity.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
