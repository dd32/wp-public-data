If you&#8217;re not sure how this works, <a href=\"https://docs.sheetmonkey.io/#three-rules-of-sheet-monkey\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">read this guide.</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20free%3F'>\nIs this plugin free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It requires a free Sheet Monkey account. Sheet Monkey has paid accounts for forms with high volumes of monthly traffic.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20store%20api%20keys%20or%20client%20credentials%3F'>\nDoes this plugin store API keys or Client Credentials?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. All API keys and client credentials are securely stored in Sheet Monkey&#8217;s cloud. This means that even if your WordPress site is compormised, you don&#8217;t have to worry about anyone getting access to your Google account data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20connect%20my%20forms%3F'>\nHow do I connect my forms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create a new connection in the <a href=\"https://dashboard.sheetmonkey.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sheet Monkey dashboard</a> and copy the &#8220;Form URL&#8221; value into the Contact Form 7 config panel.
