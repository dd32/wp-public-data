        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I add a redirect?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To manage your redirects, open your WordPress admin, and go to the Manage -&gt; GoCodes menu. From there you can remove redirects by clicking on the &#8220;Delete&#8221; button next to their entries, and you can add new ones using the form on the page. The &#8220;Key&#8221; field is where you enter the redirection string (e.g. &#8220;orange&#8221; in yourdomain.com/go/orange/). The URL field is where you enter the URL that users will be redirected to (&#8220;http://&#8221; is required). Note that the Key can only contain alphanumeric characters.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are the redirects search engine friendly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0, yes. 301 header redirects are used, as opposed to 302 redirects. This ensures that search engines will not rank the GoCode URL, and move on to the target URL, thus preventing duplicate content problems.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I often create redirects to sites that I don&#8217;t particularly trust. Can I automatically nofollow the redirects?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the GoCodes Settings page (Settings -&gt; GoCodes) and tick the Nofollow checkbox. This will instruct GoCodes to send a &#8220;noindex, nofollow&#8221; message to search engines accessing a redirect.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
