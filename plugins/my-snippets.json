        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Uzip the <code>my-snippets.zip</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Upload the <code>my-snippets</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>\n<li>Activate <em>My Snippets</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I love plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-contex\" rel=\"ugc\">Widget Context</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-logic\" rel=\"ugc\">Widget Logic</a>, which allow you to add contextual widgets.  But, the thing that those plugins don&#8217;t do is give you a way to add widget content without visiting the Widgets admin screen in WordPress.</p>\n<p>I wanted a way to add a widget on a per-post basis when writing the post itself, so this plugin was born.</p>\n<p>No, it&#8217;s not a replacement of the aforementioned plugins but, rather, a complementary plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, you need to add the &#8220;My Snippets&#8221; widget to any sidebar on your site.  It won&#8217;t appear on the front end just yet though.</p>\n<p>Any time you write a post, you can add a custom snippet title and content in the &#8220;My Snippets&#8221; meta box.  If you write something in the meta box, it will automatically be shown in place of the widget when viewing that post on your site.  If nothing is written in the meta box, nothing will be shown for the post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work for other post types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it works for all publicly-queryable post types.  Basically, if your post type has its own &#8220;page&#8221; on the front end of the site, you can add custom snippet content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What else do I need to know?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it.  This is an extremely simple plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h3>Version 1.0.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Recoded the plugin to utilize modern PHP techniques.</li>\n<li>Upgraded the widget to make sure it plays nicely with PHP 7+.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 0.2.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewrote the code base to bring everything up to current WordPress standards.</li>\n<li>Added support for custom post types.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 0.1.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin launch.  Everything&#8217;s new!</li>\n</ul>\n"
