        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20wp%20full%20picture%20compatible%20with%20page%20builders%3F'>\nIs WP Full Picture compatible with page builders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We tested it with Elementor, Bricks, Breakdance and saw no issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20support%20woocommerce%20and%20new%20woocommerce%20blocks%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture support WooCommerce and new WooCommerce blocks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Both classic WooCommerce elements and new blocks are supported in 14 different tools and Google Tag Manager.</p>\n<p>WP Full Picture tracks events like purchases, checkouts, add-to-cart events, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20display%20statistics%20in%20the%20dashboard%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture display statistics in the dashboard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WP Full Picture lets you display in your WP admin panel reports and dashboards created in Google Looker Studio, Databox and other similar services.</p>\n<p>These platforms allow you to create advanced reports with aggregated data from various analytics and marketing tools, Google spreadsheets and even WooCommerce data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20support%20google%27s%20consent%20mode%20v2%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture support Google&#8217;s consent mode v2?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Consent mode v2 is supported from version 7.1. It works with Google Analytics, Google Ads and GTM. You can enable it in the settings of the cookie notice / consent banner.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20need%20a%20consent%20management%20plugin%20or%20platform%20%28cookiebot%2C%20iubenda%2C%20cookieyes%2C%20etc.%29%20after%20i%20switch%20to%20wp%20full%20picture%3F'>\nWill I need a consent management plugin or platform (CookieBot, Iubenda, CookieYes, etc.) after I switch to WP Full Picture?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In most cases, you will not need a different consent sollution. You will however need it if you display on your website ads from platforms like Google Adsense &#8211; they require FTC certification from a cookie managment solution and WP Full Picture does not have it at the moment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20wp%20full%20picture%27s%20cookie%20notice%20block%20cookies%3F'>\nHow does WP Full Picture&#8217;s cookie notice block cookies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Full Picture doesn&#8217;t need to block cookies. Instead, it blocks scripts that install and use these cookies. The end result is the same, but the website works a little bit faster because it loads the tracking scripts only after the visitor agrees to cookies.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20full%20picture%27s%20cookie%20notice%20limited%20in%20any%20way%3F'>\nIs WP Full Picture&#8217;s cookie notice limited in any way?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Unlike consent management platforms (CMPs), we don&#8217;t limit the use of the notice in any way. It can be displayed unlimited number of times, on unlimited pages by unlimited number of visitors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20use%20the%20wp%20full%20picture%27s%20cookie%20notice%3F'>\nDo I have to use the WP Full Picture&#8217;s cookie notice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No you don&#8217;t. All the modules can be used separately.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20live%20in%20the%20eu%2C%20but%20i%20want%20to%20start%20tracking%20visitors%20right%20after%20they%20visit%20the%20page.%20can%20i%20do%20this%3F'>\nI live in the EU, but I want to start tracking visitors right after they visit the page. Can I do this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically, you can. Legally you can&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20site%20comply%20with%20all%20privacy%20regulations%20just%20by%20using%20wp%20full%20picture%3F'>\nWill my site comply with ALL privacy regulations just by using WP Full Picture?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Privacy regulations cover many areas of business. WP Full Picture helps you handle only a part of it, so you still need to be aware and act accordingly to be fully compliant with the rest of them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20using%20a%20different%20cookie%20notice.%20can%20i%20keep%20using%20it%3F'>\nI am using a different cookie notice. Can I keep using it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Please mind however that the vast majority of cookie notices do not comply with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA &#8211; even if they claim so! This is because they do not prevent loading cookies (or scripts that use them) before users agree to tracking.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20translate%20texts%20in%20the%20cookie%20notice%3F'>\nCan I translate texts in the cookie notice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WP Full Picture has been tested and works with multilingual plugins WPML and Polylang. It is possible that it also works with other plugins but we haven&#8217;t tested them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20fp%20compatible%20with%20caching%20plugins%3F'>\nIs WP FP compatible with caching plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Full Picture is compatible with W3 Total Cache, WP-Optimize, WP Rocket, WP Fastest Cache, Breeze, Siteground Cache, WP Super Cache, Cache Enabler, Litespeed Cache, Comet Cache, Hummingbird, WP Engine ceche and Autoptimize.</p>\n<p>However, it is better to avoid combining, minifying or changing the order of JavaScript files used by the plugin. Some users experienced issues when their caching solution was set to do it.</p>\n<p>In addition, we noticed that WP Multisite installations with LiteSpeed Cache plugin do not clear cache network-wide when the plugin is updated. In such case, cache needs to be cleared manually &#8211; visit every site in the network and click &#8220;purge cache&#8221; button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20full%20picture%20incompatible%20with%20any%20plugins%20or%20themes%3F'>\nIs WP Full Picture incompatible with any plugins or themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. So far we have noticed that the plugin has problems with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OceanWP theme &#8211; Consent Banner settings do not show in the Theme Customizer</li>\n<li>Kubio theme &#8211; the theme uses CSS styles that makes WP FP&#8217;s Consent Banner show in the center of the page instead of the screen. To fix it, please add to your website this custom CSS <code>body#kubio{transform: none !important;}</code></li>\n<li>Vertice theme &#8211; the same problem and solution as above</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20generate%20product%20feeds%20for%20google%20shopping%20or%20facebook%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture generate product feeds for Google Shopping or Facebook?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. WP Full Picture is focused on tracking and privacy. To generate a product catalogue you can use one of many plugins from WordPress repository or cloud platforms.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
