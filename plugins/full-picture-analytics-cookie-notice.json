        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20wp%20full%20picture%20compatible%20with%20page%20builders%3F'>\nIs WP Full Picture compatible with page builders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We tested it with Elementor, Bricks, Breakdance and saw no issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20support%20woocommerce%20and%20new%20woocommerce%20blocks%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture support WooCommerce and new WooCommerce blocks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Both classic WooCommerce elements and new blocks are supported in 14 different tools and Google Tag Manager.</p>\n<p>WP Full Picture tracks events like purchases, checkouts, add-to-cart events, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20display%20statistics%20in%20the%20dashboard%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture display statistics in the dashboard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WP Full Picture lets you display in your WP admin panel reports and dashboards created in Google Looker Studio, Databox and other similar services.</p>\n<p>These platforms allow you to create advanced reports with aggregated data from various analytics and marketing tools, Google spreadsheets and even WooCommerce data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20support%20google%27s%20consent%20mode%20v2%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture support Google&#8217;s consent mode v2?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Consent mode v2 is supported from version 7.1. It works with Google Analytics, Google Ads and GTM. You can enable it in the settings of the cookie notice / consent banner.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20need%20a%20cookie%20management%20plugin%20or%20platform%20%28cookiebot%2C%20iubenda%2C%20cookieyes%2C%20etc.%29%20after%20i%20switch%20to%20wp%20full%20picture%3F'>\nWill I need a cookie management plugin or platform (CookieBot, Iubenda, CookieYes, etc.) after I switch to WP Full Picture?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends.</p>\n<p>You may need it if you display on your website ads from platforms like Google Adsense &#8211; they require a cookie managment solution with FTC certification. WP Full Picture does not have it at the moment. We plan to obtain this certification at a later time and make it available for the Pro users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20wp%20full%20picture%27s%20cookie%20notice%20block%20cookies%3F'>\nHow does WP Full Picture&#8217;s cookie notice block cookies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Full Picture doesn&#8217;t need to block cookies. Instead, it blocks scripts that install and use these cookies. The end result is the same, but the website works a little bit faster because it loads the tracking scripts only after the visitor agrees to cookies.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20full%20picture%27s%20cookie%20notice%20limited%20in%20any%20way%3F'>\nIs WP Full Picture&#8217;s cookie notice limited in any way?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Unlike cookie management platforms (CMPs), we don&#8217;t limit the use of the notice in any way. It can be displayed unlimited number of times, on unlimited pages by unlimited number of visitors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20use%20the%20wp%20full%20picture%27s%20cookie%20notice%3F'>\nDo I have to use the WP Full Picture&#8217;s cookie notice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No you don&#8217;t. All the modules can be used separately.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20live%20in%20the%20eu%2C%20but%20i%20want%20to%20start%20tracking%20visitors%20right%20after%20they%20visit%20the%20page.%20can%20i%20do%20this%3F'>\nI live in the EU, but I want to start tracking visitors right after they visit the page. Can I do this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically, you can. Legally you can&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20site%20comply%20with%20all%20privacy%20regulations%20just%20by%20using%20wp%20full%20picture%3F'>\nWill my site comply with ALL privacy regulations just by using WP Full Picture?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Privacy regulations cover many areas of business. WP Full Picture helps you handle only a part of it, so you still need to be aware and act accordingly to be fully compliant with the rest of them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20using%20a%20different%20cookie%20notice.%20can%20i%20keep%20using%20it%3F'>\nI am using a different cookie notice. Can I keep using it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Please mind however that the vast majority of cookie notices do not comply with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA &#8211; even if they claim so! This is because they do not prevent loading cookies (or scripts that use them) before users agree to tracking.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20translate%20texts%20in%20the%20cookie%20notice%3F'>\nCan I translate texts in the cookie notice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WP Full Picture has been tested and works with multilingual plugins WPML and Polylang. It is possible that it also works with other plugins but we haven&#8217;t tested them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20support%20caching%20plugins%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture support caching plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It automatically clears cache of Rocket Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP-Optimize, Breeze, Siteground Cache, WP Super Cache, Cache Enabler, WP Fastest Cache, Litespeed Cache, Comet Cache, Hummingbird, WP Engine ceche and Autoptimize.</p>\n<p>Attention. We noticed that WP Multisite installations with LiteSpeed Cache plugin do not clear cache network-wide when the plugin is updated. In such case, cache needs to be cleared manually &#8211; visit every site in the network and click &#8220;purge cache&#8221; button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20full%20picture%20incompatible%20with%20any%20plugins%20or%20solutions%3F'>\nIs WP Full Picture incompatible with any plugins or solutions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. At the moment we have identified Bunny Fonts plugin to be incompatible (breaks the page when using with WP FP). However, you will not need this plugin since one of WP FP&#8217;s modules has the same functionality like Bunny Fonts.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, we noticed that WP Multisite installations with LiteSpeed Cache plugin, do not clear cache when it is required. In such case, cache needs to be cleared by manually visiting every site in the network and clearing it manually (by clicking a button).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wp%20full%20picture%20generate%20product%20feeds%20for%20google%20shopping%20or%20facebook%3F'>\nDoes WP Full Picture generate product feeds for Google Shopping or Facebook?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. WP Full Picture concentrates on tracking and privacy. To generate a product catalogue you can use one of multiple plugins from WordPress repository or cloud platforms.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
