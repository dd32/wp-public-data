        "description": "<p><strong>A free, lightweight and easy to use plugin that allows you to seamlessly replace an image or file in your Media Library by uploading a new file in its place. No more deleting, renaming and re-uploading files! Now fully compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Offload Media!</a><br />\nNew beta feature! You can now remove the background of your images for better integration with eCommerce solutions!<br />\nSupported by the friendly team that created <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel</a>  ðŸ™‚</strong></p>\n<h4>A real timesaver</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you find it tedious and complicated to first delete a file and then upload another one with the exact same name every time you want to update an image or other uploaded file in the WordPress media library?</p>\n<p>Well, no longer!</p>\n<p>Now you can replace any uploaded file in the Edit Media view, where it should be. Replacing Media can be done in two ways:</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s simple to replace a file</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Simply replace the file. This option requires you to upload a file of the same type as the file you want to replace. The attachment name remains the same regardless of what the file you upload is called.</li>\n<li>Replace the file, use the new file name, and update all links. If you check this option, the old file will be replaced with the name and type of the file you are uploading. All links pointing to the current file will be updated to point to the new file name. Additional options for the folder to put the new file in or the date of the new file are also available on the replace screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This plugin is very powerful and a must-have for all major websites built with WordPress. It also offers a preview of the replaced image!</p>\n<h4>New beta feature: You can now remove the background of any image!</h4>\n<p>Similar to replacing media, you can also remove the background of the images from the Media Library! The background removal feature sends the images to ShortPixel&#8217;s API, removes the background and sends them back in a preview window. If everything looks good, just replace the image with the one that has the background removed! If the source image is a PNG file, you will get a transparent background, while the other images default to a solid white background. You also have the option to choose a different color with an embedded color picker.<br />\nThe background removal feature is still in beta and will be free of charge for a reasonable usage.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use the background removal feature, add this line to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file, or use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/\" rel=\"ugc\">Code Snippets</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>`add_filter( 'emr/feature/background', '__return_false' );```\n</code></pre>\n<p>A similar filter, for the remote notification system is:</p>\n<pre><code>`add_filter( 'emr/feature/remote_notice', '__return_false' );```\n</code></pre>\n<p>To shorten the wait time before redirecting to the media editing screen, use the following filter and specify the wait time in seconds (0 means that redirection is immediate, but may cause problems in certain configurations):</p>\n<pre><code>`add_filter('emr/success/timeout', function () { return 3; });```\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Show file modification time</h4>\n<p>There is a shortcode that takes the file modification date and displays it in a post or on a page. The code is:<br />\n    [file_modified id=XX format=XXXX] where the &#8220;id&#8221; is required and the &#8220;format&#8221; is optional and defaults to your current WordPress settings for date and time format.</p>\n<p>So <code>[file_modified id=870]</code> would show the last time the file with ID 870 was updated on your site. To get the ID for a file, check the URL when editing a file in the media library (see screenshot #4)</p>\n<p>If you want more control over the format in which the time is shown, you can use the format option. So <code>[file_modified id=870 format=Y-m-d]</code> would show the date the file was modified but not the time. The format string uses <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the standard PHP date() formatting tags</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Other plugins by <a href=\"https://shortpixel.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ShortPixel</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastpixel-website-accelerator/\" rel=\"ugc\">FastPixel Caching</a> &#8211; WP Optimization made easy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Image Optimizer</a> &#8211; Image optimization &amp; compression for all the images on your website, including WebP &amp; AVIF delivery</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-adaptive-images/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Adaptive Images</a> &#8211; On-the-fly image optimization &amp; CDN delivery</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/resize-image-after-upload/\" rel=\"ugc\">Resize Image After Upload</a> &#8211; Automatically resize each uploaded image</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails-advanced/\" rel=\"ugc\">reGenerate Thumbnails Advanced</a> &#8211; Easily regenerate thumbnails</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-svg-images/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP SVG Images</a> &#8211; Secure upload of SVG files to Media Library</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-critical-css/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Critical CSS</a> &#8211; Automatically generate above-the-fold CSS for faster loading times and better SEO scores</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get in touch!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email <a href=\"https://shortpixel.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shortpixel.com/contact</a></li>\n<li>Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shortpixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/shortpixel</a></li>\n<li>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ShortPixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.facebook.com/ShortPixel</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/shortpixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/shortpixel</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wishlist / Coming attractions</h3>\n<p>Do you have suggestions?

The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment, and notify the developers of this plugin.= What does this plugin actually do? =</p>\n<p>This plugin makes it easy to update/replace files that have been uploaded to the WordPress Media Library.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A new option will be available in the Edit Media view, called &#8220;Replace Media&#8221;.

Press &#8220;Refresh&#8221; in your browser to make sure.</p>\n<p>Second, if the file really looks unchanged, make sure WordPress has write permissions to the files in your uploads folder. If you have ever moved your WP installation (maybe when you moved it to a new server), the permissions on your uploaded files are commonly reset so that WordPress no longer has permissions to change the files. If you don&#8217;t know how to do this, contact your web server operator.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Thanks again to my old friend Ulf &#8220;Ã…rsta&#8221; HÃ¤rnhammar for keeping us all on our toes! ðŸ™‚ This should also hopefully fix the problems people have been having with their installations claiming that perfectly good PDF files are not allowed file types.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The &#8220;more reliable way&#8221; of determining MIME types turned out to be less reliable. Go figure. There seems to be no perfect way of performing a reliable check for MIME-types on an uploaded file that is also truly portable. I have now made checks for the availability of mime_content_type() before using it, using the old method as a fall-back. It is far from beautiful, so if anybody has a better way of doing it, please contact me!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix &#8211; there is now a more reliable way of determining file type on your upload so you can upload PDF files without seeing that pesky &#8220;File type does not meet security guidelines&#8221; message.</li>\n<li>New translation to Danish &#8211; thanks to Michael Bering Petersen!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 3.2.1</li>\n<li>New translation to German &#8211; thanks to Martin Lettner!</li>\n<li>New translation to French &#8211; thanks to FranÃ§ois Collette!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix for WordPress 3.1 RC.

    "description": "<p><strong>A free, lightweight and easy to use plugin that allows you to seamlessly replace an image or file in your Media Library by uploading a new file in its place. No more deleting, renaming and re-uploading files! Now fully compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Offload Media!</a><br />\nNew beta feature! You can now remove the background of your images for better integration with eCommerce solutions!<br />\nSupported by the friendly team that created <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel</a>  ðŸ™‚</strong></p>\n<h4>A real timesaver</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you find it tedious and complicated to first delete a file and then upload another one with the exact same name every time you want to update an image or other uploaded file in the WordPress media library?</p>\n<p>Well, no longer!</p>\n<p>Now you can replace any uploaded file in the Edit Media view, where it should be. Replacing Media can be done in two ways:</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s simple to replace a file</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Simply replace the file. This option requires you to upload a file of the same type as the file you want to replace. The attachment name remains the same regardless of what the file you upload is called.</li>\n<li>Replace the file, use the new file name, and update all links. If you check this option, the old file will be replaced with the name and type of the file you are uploading. All links pointing to the current file will be updated to point to the new file name. Additional options for the folder to put the new file in or the date of the new file are also available on the replace screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This plugin is very powerful and a must-have for all major websites built with WordPress. It also offers a preview of the replaced image!</p>\n<h4>New beta feature: You can now remove the background of any image!</h4>\n<p>Similar to replacing media, you can also remove the background of the images from the Media Library! The background removal feature sends the images to ShortPixel&#8217;s API, removes the background and sends them back in a preview window. If everything looks good, just replace the image with the one that has the background removed! If the source image is a PNG file, you will get a transparent background, while the other images default to a solid white background. You also have the option to choose a different color with an embedded color picker.<br />\nThe background removal feature is still in beta and will be free of charge for a reasonable usage.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use the background removal feature, add this line to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file, or use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/\" rel=\"ugc\">Code Snippets</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>`add_filter( 'emr/feature/background', '__return_false' );```\n</code></pre>\n<p>A similar filter, for the remote notification system is:</p>\n<pre><code>`add_filter( 'emr/feature/remote_notice', '__return_false' );```\n</code></pre>\n<p>To shorten the wait time before redirecting to the media editing screen, use the following filter and specify the wait time in seconds (0 means that redirection is immediate, but may cause problems in certain configurations):</p>\n<pre><code>`add_filter('emr/success/timeout', function () { return 3; });```\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Show file modification time</h4>\n<p>There is a shortcode that takes the file modification date and displays it in a post or on a page. The code is:<br />\n    [file_modified id=XX format=XXXX] where the &#8220;id&#8221; is required and the &#8220;format&#8221; is optional and defaults to your current WordPress settings for date and time format.</p>\n<p>So <code>[file_modified id=870]</code> would show the last time the file with ID 870 was updated on your site. To get the ID for a file, check the URL when editing a file in the media library (see screenshot #4)</p>\n<p>If you want more control over the format in which the time is shown, you can use the format option. So <code>[file_modified id=870 format=Y-m-d]</code> would show the date the file was modified but not the time. The format string uses <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the standard PHP date() formatting tags</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Other plugins by <a href=\"https://shortpixel.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ShortPixel</a>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fastpixel-website-accelerator/\" rel=\"ugc\">FastPixel Caching</a> &#8211; WP Optimization made easy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Image Optimizer</a> &#8211; Image optimization &amp; compression for all the images on your website, including WebP &amp; AVIF delivery</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-adaptive-images/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Adaptive Images</a> &#8211; On-the-fly image optimization &amp; CDN delivery</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/resize-image-after-upload/\" rel=\"ugc\">Resize Image After Upload</a> &#8211; Automatically resize each uploaded image</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails-advanced/\" rel=\"ugc\">reGenerate Thumbnails Advanced</a> &#8211; Easily regenerate thumbnails</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-svg-images/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP SVG Images</a> &#8211; Secure upload of SVG files to Media Library</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-critical-css/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Critical CSS</a> &#8211; Automatically generate above-the-fold CSS for faster loading times and better SEO scores</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Get in touch!</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email <a href=\"https://shortpixel.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shortpixel.com/contact</a></li>\n<li>Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shortpixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://twitter.com/shortpixel</a></li>\n<li>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ShortPixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.facebook.com/ShortPixel</a></li>\n<li>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/shortpixel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/shortpixel</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wishlist / Coming attractions</h3>\n<p>Do you have suggestions?
