For example, before the <code>&lt;?php edit_comment_link(...</code> part.</li>\n<li>(optional) Go to <code>Settings -&gt; @Reply with preview</code> to see some andvanced settings and advanced uasge of <code>atrwcp_reply()</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>(optional) In the <code>extra</code> folder you will find a <code>reply.png</code> file for dark background themes, use it to replace the default file if you need.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(optional) Themes like the WP default theme Kubrick don&#8217;t have their comments wrapped up properly. For this plugin to work your theme&#8217;s code should really look somewhat like this:<br /><code>&lt;div class=\"comment-text\"&gt;</code><br /><code>&lt;?php comment_text() ?&gt;</code><br /><code>&lt;/div&gt;</code><br />if your theme only has a different class used, you can change the settings of the plugin (<code>Settings -&gt; @Reply with preview</code>) to work with that.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

I can see the reply arrows but clicking them does nothing.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either you have disabled JavaScript in your browser or your WordPress theme is not using the default id for the comments <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> (which is <code>comment</code>). In the later case, check your <code>comments.php</code> file to find your textarea id, then go set that in the Options for this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t work ! I don&#8217;t see the comment preview.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either you have disabled JavaScript in your browser or your WordPress theme is not using the default class for the comments text&#8217;s encapsulating <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> (which is <code>comment-text</code>). In the later case, check your <code>comments.php</code> file to find the id of the div containing the comments&#8217; text, then go set that in the Options for this plugin.</p>\n<p>In addition, you might have to add <code>position:relative;</code> to the stylesheet definition of the DOM-elements holding the comments in order to make the preview positioning work. You can also use the custon CSS section in the plugin&#8217;s settings (eg. <code>div.comment-text { position:relative; }</code>).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Possible conflicts with other plugins.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A plugin that filters the default WordPress comments functions, may prevent @ Reply from working. For example, WP_Identicon does this, but it also has an alternate setup for &#8220;advanced users&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t conflict with @ Reply.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>More problems?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please provide some <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/reply-w-comment-preview?forum_id=10#postform\" rel=\"ugc\">feedback @ the forums</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
