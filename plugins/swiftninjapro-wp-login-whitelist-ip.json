You can add a list of admin IP&#8217;s to this plugin, where you want to allow usage of wp-login.<br />\nEven if you have other users that login, its better to use another plugin for a more secure front end login, and this plugin will only allow a specific list of IP&#8217;s to access the wp-login page.<br />\nYou can also (optionally) have this plugin attempt to redirect anyone to 404 page, if they try and access wp-login without the right IP.<br />\nYou can also choose to disable the 404 redirect, and instead tell users there IP is not whitelisted, and that they should contact the admin if this is in error.<br />\nThe plugin does Not block wp-admin, so once logged in, you can still edit your site on the go.<br />\nThe plugin also has an option to whitelist your favorite common browsers to wp-login. This means you can keep users from accessing the wp-login page, simply because there using Internet Explore, and not what you chose to allow.<br />\nThere is another option (which may return false positives), that attempts to check if the source of an IP is commonly used by a proxy server, and can block proxy IP&#8217;s to try and reduce spoofing.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload plugin to the /wp-content/plugins</li>\n<li>Important: Make sure you have cpanel or filezilla working and connected to your website, so if you forget to add your IP and get locked out of wp-login, you can disable the plugin</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Add your IP to the list of whitelisted IP&#8217;s in Swiftninjapro wp-login Whitelist IP settings (the admin settings page will tell you your Current IP)</li>\n<li>Check the setting &#8220;Plugin Enabled&#8221; To Enable wp-login Whitelist IP And Click Save</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat do I do if I forgot to add my IP to the whitelist and can Not access wp-login\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To reactivate the plugin: (requires version 1.10 or later)<br />\n 1. on your site, go to: /admin-login-whitelist-recovery<br />\n 2. enter the page password &#8220;gHxXeVwvuz6Cez3&#8221; (You will still need to verify disabling the plugin through an admin email)<br />\n 3. follow the directions on that page<br />\nAfter that, the plugins &#8220;Enabled&#8221; setting will be disabled, and the plugin will not run, and settings will still be accessible.<br />\nNote: The email must be an admin users email. The email will also be rejected if the account is less than a week old.</p>\n<p>If that fails, you can do 1 of 2 things:<br />\n 1. Contact your host, and ask them to disable the plugin manually<br />\n 2. Use FTP, Filezilla, or cpanel, then (click &#8220;File Manager&#8221;, if using cpanel) navigate to public_html/wp-content/plugins, then find the folder &#8220;swiftninjapro-wp-login-whitelist-ip&#8221; and rename it to &#8220;swiftninjapro-wp-login-whitelist-ip-off&#8221; to disable the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this work on wp-login even if I change the name with other plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>yes, this plugin uses wordpress functions wp_login_url(), wp_registration_url(), etc. to get an accurate url based on what your website uses.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this block plugins from logging in users through front-end\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>no. only the backend wp-login is blocked, you can still use a front end login for your users if you want to.<br />\nnote: if your front end login plugin uses wp-login, you will need to enable a setting in this plugin, for your front end login plugin to work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nwhat happens to a user if there IP is not whitelisted\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will kill the wp-login url for non-whitelisted IP&#8217;s, and (optional by the admin) display a message saying there IP is not whitelisted, or redirect them to the 404 page.<br />\nThe plugins displayed message will also suggest a blocked user contact the admin if the block was in error.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
