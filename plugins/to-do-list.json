Now fully compatible with WordPress 3.4.</li>\n<li>Each to-do list is now edited on a users profile page rather than directly on the WordPress dashboard. However, the current to-do list is still displayed on the dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Text no longer coloured by default when TinyMCE editor is &#8216;active&#8217; but the html tab is selected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can now use the TinyMCE editor included with WordPress to format their To-Do List! There is an option to use the plain and simple editor from the previous version. Infact, this is still the default. If you wish to drag the To-Do List to a new position in the dashboard you MUST enable the simple editor first. Otherwise it will not work properly.</li>\n<li>Many minor updates to the plug-in code, mainly just tidying things up and updating some links.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.21</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that caused an error for some users: removed call to unefined function &#8216;gc_todo_admin_actions()&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for multiple users. Every user of the blog can maintain their own list! Plugin automatically monitors who is logged in and displays the appropriate to do list.</li>\n<li>To Do List is now available as a dashboard widget for convenience, and accessibility.</li>\n<li>List saved in the database not as a text file.</li>\n<li>When a user is deleted from the blog, their to do list is deleted too, automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.02</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To Do List now located under the Dashboard top level menu. Makes more sense to put it here.</li>\n<li>Changed the way the Plugin gets the path to the To Do List folder. Now using &#8216;WP_PLUGIN_DIR&#8217; constant rather than &#8216;PLUGINDIR&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed message when update button clicked. Used to display &#8216;Options Saved&#8217;, now displays &#8216;To Do List Updated&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Removed test code that shows magic quotes status.</li>\n</ul>\n"
