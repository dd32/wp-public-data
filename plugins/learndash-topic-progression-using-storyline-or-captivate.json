As long as you can activate JavaScript code you can use this plugin with other authoring tools, or advanced multimedia development software such as Adobe Animate CC.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20articulate%20rise%3F'>\nWhat about Articulate Rise?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The latest version of our plugin does support content produced in Articulate Rise! Your content must include a Storyline block which contains a button that triggers the required JavaScript.
