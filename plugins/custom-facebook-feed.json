        "faq": "<p>For a full list of FAQs and help with troubleshooting please visit the <strong><a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/faq/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ &amp; Troubleshooting</a></strong> section of the Smash Balloon website</p>\n\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20limitations%20on%20which%20facebook%20page%20feeds%20i%20can%20display%3F'>\nAre there any limitations on which Facebook page feeds I can display?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Facebook feed you&#8217;re trying to display has to be from a publicly accessible Facebook page. This means that you can&#8217;t display the feed from your own personal Facebook profile. This is to do with Facebook&#8217;s privacy policies. You can&#8217;t display a non-public Facebook feed publicly.</p>\n<p>If your Facebook page has any restrictions on it (age, for example) then it means that people have to be signed into Facebook in order to view your page. This isn&#8217;t desirable for most Facebook pages as it means that it isn&#8217;t accessible by people who don&#8217;t have a Facebook account and that your Facebook page can&#8217;t be crawled and indexed by search engines.</p>\n<p>An easy way to determine whether your Facebook page is set to public is to sign out of your Facebook account and try to visit your page. If Facebook forces you to sign in to view your page then it isn&#8217;t public. You can change your Facebook page to public in your Facebook page settings simply by removing any age or location restrictions you have on it (<a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/facebook-page-restrictions.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">screenshot</a>), which will then allow the Custom Facebook Feed plugin to access and display your feed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20feeds%20from%20multiple%20facebook%20pages%3F'>\nCan I display feeds from multiple Facebook pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep! Create as many feeds as you like from different Facebook pages. Just click &#8220;Add New&#8221; to create a new feed and then embed it anywhere on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20feeds%20from%20a%20facebook%20group%3F'>\nCan I display feeds from a Facebook Group?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of April of 2024 the plugin is no longer able to display posts from a Facebook group. This is due to changes on Facebook&#8217;s end.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20the%20feed%20from%20a%20personal%20facebook%20profile%3F'>\nCan I display the feed from a personal Facebook profile?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to Facebook&#8217;s privacy policy you&#8217;re not able to use the plugin to display all of your posts from a personal profile, only from a public page, as posts from a personal profile are protected for privacy reasons. You may have limited success in displaying certain posts from a personal profile but most posts are not able to be displayed.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the profile to represent a business, organization, product, public figure or the like, then we&#8217;d advise converting your profile to a page per <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/175644189234902/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook&#8217;s recommendation</a>, as there are many advantages to using pages over profiles.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done so, the plugin will be able to retrieve and display all of your posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20facebook%20oembeds%3F'>\nDoes the plugin work with Facebook oEmbeds?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Support was added to allow the plugin to power your Facebook oEmbeds as official support for these is no longer available in WordPress core. Just connect your account on the oEmbeds settings page inside the plugin and the plugin will power all Facebook embeds on your site, old and new. No developer app or account required.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20show%20photos%20and%20videos%20in%20my%20custom%20facebook%20feed%3F'>\nCan I show photos and videos in my Custom Facebook feed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This free plugin only allows you to display text from your Facebook posts. To display photos and videos in your feed you would need to upgrade to the Pro version of the plugin. Try out a demo of the Pro version on the <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/demo/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=media\" title=\"Custom Facebook Feed Demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom Facebook Feed website</a>, and find out more about the Pro version <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=pro\" title=\"Custom Facebook Feed Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>. <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/differences-between-the-free-version-and-pro-version-of-the-custom-facebook-feed-plugin/\" title=\"Differences between free and Pro version of Custom Facebook Feed plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here</a> for a full list of all differences between the free version and Pro version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20show%20the%20comments%2C%20shares%20and%20likes%20associated%20with%20each%20facebook%20post%3F'>\nCan I show the comments, shares and likes associated with each Facebook post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a feature of the <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=comments\" title=\"Custom Facebook Feed Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version of the plugin</a>.

Unlike other Facebook plugins which use iframes to embed your feed into your page once it&#8217;s loaded, the Custom Facebook Feed uses PHP to embed your Facebook feed content directly into your page. This adds dynamic, search engine crawlable content to your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20embed%20the%20custom%20facebook%20feed%20directly%20into%20a%20wordpress%20page%20template%3F'>\nHow do I embed the Custom Facebook Feed directly into a WordPress page template?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can embed your Facebook feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode\" title=\"WordPress.org do_shortcode reference\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">do_shortcode</a> function: <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[custom-facebook-feed]'); ?&gt;</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20facebook%20feed%20posts%20are%20not%20showing%20up%2C%20or%20all%20i%20can%20see%20is%20the%20facebook%20like%20box%20but%20no%20posts'>\nMy Facebook feed posts are not showing up, or all I can see is the Facebook Like box but no posts\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/facebook-feed-doesnt-show-can-see-like-box-posts-gives/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=errors\" title=\"My Facebook feed posts are not showing up, or all I can see is the Facebook Like box but no posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this FAQ</a> for potential solutions on how to resolve this issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='changing%20the%20font%20in%20your%20facebook%20feed%20and%20using%20google%20fonts'>\nChanging the font in your Facebook feed and using Google Fonts\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/changing-the-font-in-your-facebook-feed-using-google-fonts/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=fonts\" title=\"Changing the font in your Facebook feed and using Google Fonts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this FAQ</a> for directions on how to use Google fonts in your Facebook posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20my%20facebook%20posts%20horizontally%20or%20in%20multiple%20columns%3F'>\nCan I display my Facebook posts horizontally or in multiple columns?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/can-display-facebook-post-horizontally-multiple-columns/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=horizontal\" title=\"Can I display my Facebook posts horizontally or in multiple columns?\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this FAQ</a> for directions on how to display your Facebook posts in multiple columns.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20facebook%20feed%20appears%20to%20have%20stopped%20updating%20%2F%20working'>\nMy Facebook feed appears to have stopped updating / working\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your Facebook feed doesn&#8217;t appear to be showing the most recent Facebook posts then the most likely explanation is that the recent posts in your feed may be shared from a user&#8217;s personal profile. Facebook&#8217;s privacy policy doesn&#8217;t allow posts that you share from personal Facebook profiles to be shared outside of Facebook as the posts don&#8217;t technically belong to your Facebook page, they belong to the user who posted it to their personal Facebook profile. There&#8217;s an example of a post shared from a user&#8217;s personal Facebook profile <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sharing-photo-facebook-profile.jpg\" title=\"Example of Facebook post shared from personal profile\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Please note, this isn&#8217;t a limitation of our plugin, it&#8217;s a restriction which Meta (Facebook) places on it&#8217;s content in order to protect the privacy of their Facebook users.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential solutions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You could re-post the Facebook post to your page rather than sharing it to your Facebook page. If you re-post the content as your own post on your Facebook page then the content now originates from your Facebook page and will be displayed in the Facebook feed on your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you were to share a post from another Facebook page or public source, rather than sharing it from someone&#8217;s personal Facebook profile, then it would show up in your feed outside of Facebook, but by default any posts that originate from a personal Facebook profile are protected by Facebook&#8217;s privacy policy and is the private content of that Facebook profile owner.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20receiving%20an%20error%20message%20when%20trying%20to%20display%20my%20facebook%20posts'>\nI&#8217;m receiving an error message when trying to display my Facebook posts\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please refer to our <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/docs/errors/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=errors\" title=\"I'm receiving an error message when trying to display my Facebook posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Error Message Reference page</a> for information on how to resolve common error messages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='creating%20a%20masonry%20grid%20layout%20from%20your%20facebook%20posts'>\nCreating a Masonry grid layout from your Facebook posts\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"https://smashballoon.com/creating-a-masonry-grid-layout-from-your-facebook-posts/?utm_campaign=facebook-free-readme&amp;utm_source=faq&amp;utm_medium=masonry\" title=\"Creating a Masonry grid layout from your Facebook posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this FAQ</a> for directions on how to create a Masonry grid layout from your Facebook feed posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='avatar%20pictures%20aren%27t%20showing%20up%20in%20my%20feed'>\nAvatar pictures aren&#8217;t showing up in my feed\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most common reason for this is that an add-on or extension you have installed in your web browser is blocking the pictures being loaded from Facebook.
