If you have access to the php.ini file, you can manually increase the limit; if you do not (your WordPress installation is hosted on a shared server, for instance), you might have to break your exported XML file into several smaller pieces and run the import script one at a time.</p>\n<p>For those with shared hosting, the best alternative may be to consult hosting support to determine the safest approach for running the import. A host may be willing to temporarily lift the memory limit and/or run the process directly from their end.</p>\n<p>&#8212; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/importing-content/#before-importing\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Article: Importing Content</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
