        "description": "<p>For sites concerned with high traffic, speed for logged-in users, or dynamic pageloads, a high-speed and persistent object cache is a must. WP LCache improves upon Memcached and Redis object cache implementations by using APCu, PHP&#8217;s in-memory cache, in a way that&#8217;s compatible with multiple web nodes. Under the hood, WP LCache uses <a href=\"https://github.com/lcache/lcache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LCache</a>, a library that applies the tiered caching model of multi-core processors (with local L1 and central L2 caches) to web applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: WP LCache development is currently on hold, and not recommendated for production use, due to an <a href=\"https://github.com/lcache/wp-lcache/issues/138\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue with APCu cache fragmentation</a>. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Redis</a>, also maintained by Pantheon, is a great alternative.</p>\n<p>WP LCache is faster than other object cache implementations because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By using APCu, which is in-memory, WP LCache uses the fastest possible persistent object cache backend and avoids costly network connections on every request. When using a Memcached or Redis-based persistent object cache where Memcached or Redis is on a different machine, the millisecond cost of each cache hit can add up to seconds of network transactions on every request.</li>\n<li>By incorporating a common L2 cache, WP LCache synchronizes cache data between multiple web nodes. Cache updates or deletes on one node are then applied to all other nodes. Without this synchronization behavior, APCu can&#8217;t be used in server configurations with multiple web nodes because the cache pool is local to the machine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still not convinced? WP LCache includes features that no one else has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cache groups are handled natively, meaning you can delete an entire group of keys with <code>wp_cache_delete_group()</code>.</li>\n<li>WordPress&#8217; alloptions cache is sharded into distinct keys, mitigating cache pollution on high traffic sites. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31245\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read #31245</a> for all of the gory details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the installation instructions, then install WP LCache from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-lcache/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/lcache/wp-lcache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</p>\n<p>Go forth and make awesome! And, once you&#8217;ve built something great, <a href=\"https://github.com/lcache/wp-lcache/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">send us feature requests (or bug reports)</a>.</p>\n<h3>Contributing</h3>\n<p>The best way to contribute to the development of this plugin is by participating on the GitHub project:</p>\n<p>https://github.com/lcache/wp-lcache</p>\n<p>Pull requests and issues are welcome!</p>\n<p>You may notice there are two sets of tests running, on two different services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travis CI runs the <a href=\"https://phpunit.de/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHPUnit</a> test suite in a variety of environment configurations (e.g. APCu available vs. APCu unavailable).</li>\n<li>Circle CI runs the <a href=\"http://behat.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Behat</a> test suite against a Pantheon site, to ensure the plugin&#8217;s compatibility with the Pantheon platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of these test suites can be run locally, with a varying amount of setup.</p>\n<p>PHPUnit requires the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress PHPUnit test suite</a>, and access to a database with name <code>wordpress_test</code>. If you haven&#8217;t already configured the test suite locally, you can run <code>bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost</code>. You&#8217;ll also need to install and configure APCu in order to run the test suite against APCu.</p>\n<p>Behat requires a Pantheon site. Once you&#8217;ve created the site, you&#8217;ll need <a href=\"https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus#installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">install Terminus</a>, and set the <code>TERMINUS_TOKEN</code>, <code>TERMINUS_SITE</code>, and <code>TERMINUS_ENV</code> environment variables. Then, you can run <code>./bin/behat-prepare.sh</code> to prepare the site for the test suite.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p><strong>WP LCache requires PHP 5.6 or greater with the APCu extension enabled.</strong></p>\n<p>To install WP LCache, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin from WordPress.org using the WordPress dashboard.<br />\n1a. Those installing from Github will need to run <code>composer install --no-dev --no-scripts</code> after cloning to get the <a href=\"https://github.com/lcache/lcache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LCache library</a>.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin, to ensure LCache&#8217;s database tables are created. These are created on the plugin activation hook.</li>\n<li>Create a stub file at <code>wp-content/object-cache.php</code> to require <code>wp-content/plugins/wp-lcache/object-cache.php</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>wp-content/object-cache.php</code> file should contain:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n# Engage LCache object caching system.\n# We use a 'require_once()' here because in PHP 5.5+ changes to symlinks\n# are not detected by the opcode cache, making it frustrating to deploy.\n#\n# More info: http://codinghobo.com/opcache-and-symlink-based-deployments/\n#\n$lcache_path = dirname( realpath( __FILE__ ) ) . '/plugins/wp-lcache/object-cache.php';\nrequire_once( $lcache_path );\n</code></pre>\n<p>To install WP LCache in one line with WP-CLI:</p>\n<pre><code>wp plugin install wp-lcache --activate &amp;&amp; wp lcache enable\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you need to install APCu, the PECL installer is the easiest way to do so.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 7.0: <code>pecl install apcu</code></li>\n<li>PHP 5.6: <code>pecl install channel://pecl.php.net/apcu-4.0.11</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enabling APCu for CLI is a matter of adding <code>apc.enable_cli='on'</code> to your <code>etc/php5/cli/php.ini</code>.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t easily use PHP 5.6 or greater, you should switch to a more responsible hosting provider.</p>\n<h4>Admin Notices</h4>\n<p>If any of the requirements for LCache to function are not met, you will see an admin notice indicating the issue. Here&#8217;s how to resolve issues for each possible dependency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;LCache database table&#8221;: This indicates you have the <code>object-cache.php</code> symlink in place, but have not activated the plugin (which installs the LCache db table). Activate the plugin and verify the LCache tables are created.</li>\n<li>&#8220;PHP 5.6 or greater&#8221;: You need to update your PHP runtime, which will also make your site faster and more secure. Do it today, or contact your hosting provider if you don&#8217;t have access.</li>\n<li>&#8220;APCu extension installed/enabled&#8221;: You don&#8217;t have the required PHP extension to power LCache. See above instructions for installing APCU, or contact your hosting provider.</li>\n<li>&#8220;LCache library&#8221;: you&#8217;re probably installing direct from GitHub, not a download from the WordPress.org plugins directory. Awesome! You just need  to run <code>composer install --no-dev</code> inside the <code>wp-lcache</code> directory, and make sure the resulting <code>vendor</code> directory is deployed along with the rest of <code>wp-lcache</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Do you have benchmarks you can share?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve done some rudimentary testing with New Relic on Pantheon infrastructure. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/outlandishjosh/status/775756511611990016\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The results</a> were substantial enough for us to begin using LCache in production. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/outlandishjosh/status/781281995213115396\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Watch David Strauss&#8217; DrupalCon presentation</a> for a more thorough explanation.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to do some benchmarking yourself, we&#8217;d love to hear about your testing methodology and conclusions. Caching is more of an art than a science, and outcomes can vary. Because cost of network transactions is one of the problems solved by WP LCache, the performance gains will be more impressive if you&#8217;ve historically been using Redis or Memcached on a separate machine.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is APCu persistent like Redis is?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>APCu is persistent through the life of a PHP-FPM process. However, unlike Redis, APCu doesn&#8217;t save its state to disk at shutdown. When PHP-FPM is restarted, WP LCache will repopulate the L1 cache (APCu) from the L2 cache (database).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I seeing heavy database load from WP LCache?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you first enable WP LCache, you&#8217;ll have a good amount of database activity as it writes all cache entries to the database. Eventually, as long as your codebase is optimized, database activity will die down and most activity will be in APCu.</p>\n<p>However, if your codebase isn&#8217;t optimized, you&#8217;ll see continued database load. Some common issues include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frequent calls to <code>wp_cache_flush()</code>, which empties the entire cache and requires the L2 to be completely repopulated.</li>\n<li>Redundant or duplicative calls to <code>wp_cache_set()</code>, where code paths hardly ever use the cache values they set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both of these cases, any persistent object cache drop-in probably isn&#8217;t going to be useful until you solve your code problems.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
