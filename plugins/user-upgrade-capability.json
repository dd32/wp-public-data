        "description": "<p>&#8216;User Upgrade Capability&#8217; is a plugin to help with a multi-site network and helps with the administration of users and their roles. When you start using a multi-site WordPress installation you soon realise the power of having the ability to use a separate site for different functions (e.g. main site, separate blog, separate calendar …etc) each can then be handled separately and even with different themes.</p>\n<p>However, without &#8216;User Upgrade Capabilities&#8217; you would need to maintain the user access on each site, this is an overhead for administrators since for each site Admins will need to grant access and add/remove capabilties &amp; roles as required, which all takes time.  &#8216;User Upgrade Capability&#8217; helps with this admin task and allows you to create a new site and point back to a master reference site re-using its user listing and capabilties/roles to define access permissions for the new linked site.</p>\n<p>One example of where this approach is helpful is for the case where you want multiple calendars for different purposes on the same WordPress site.  Calendar plugins generally use a fixed database table name, this means that you can&#8217;t install two calendars on the same site.  With &#8216;User Upgrade Capability&#8217; you can create a new site for each calendar and point back to the reference site re-using its user base and capabilties.  The end user doesn&#8217;t even know that the calendars are on a different site.</p>\n<h4>Plugin site</h4>\n<p>read more on the <a href=\"http://justinandco.com/plugins/user-upgrade-capabilities/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin site</a></p>\n<h4>GitHub</h4>\n<p>https://github.com/justinticktock/user-upgrade-capability</p>\n<h4>WARNING</h4>\n<p>Activating this plugin on a site will replace the available user roles/capabilities with a copy from the reference site you will not be able to undo.</p>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>Serbo-Croatian, sr_RS ( props Borisa Djuraskovic <a href=\"http://webhostinghub.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">webhostinghub.com</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Extensions:</p>\n<p>If you select the options for extending functionality through other plugins the following are available for ease of installing..</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">User Role Editor</a> for Admins to control user access/capability.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-copier/\" rel=\"ugc\">Blog Copier</a> for ease of duplicating sites.</li>\n</ul>\n",
