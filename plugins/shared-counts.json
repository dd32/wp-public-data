        "description": "<p>Shared Counts is a WordPress social media share buttons plugin. Sharing buttons increase traffic and engagement by helping readers share your posts and pages to their friends on social media.</p>\n<p><strong>Included Buttons</strong><br />\n&#8211; Facebook Share Button<br />\n&#8211; Pinterest Pin Button<br />\n&#8211; Yummly Button<br />\n&#8211; Twitter Tweet Button (using the third-party Twitcount.com API)<br />\n&#8211; Email Sharing<br />\n&#8211; Share Count Total<br />\n&#8211; Print Button<br />\n&#8211; LinkedIn Share Button</p>\n<p>Facebook, Pinterest, Yummly, and Twitter buttons support social count display and tracking.</p>\n<h3>Basic Usage</h3>\n<p>In Settings &gt; Shared Counts you can select where the share buttons can appear automatically (Before Content, After Content, Before &amp; After Content). When editing a post, you can use the checkbox in the &#8220;Shared Counts&#8221; box in the right column to disable the automatic buttons on this specific post.</p>\n<p>You can use the <code>[shared_counts]</code> shortcode to manually display the buttons.</p>\n<h3>Styling and Display</h3>\n<p>We include many share button styling options, so you can pick the perfect look for you site. Additionally, you can automatically insert the share buttons before and/or after the post content. Want granular or manual control? No problem! You can also use the <code>[shared_counts]</code> shortcode to insert them inside your content as you see fit.</p>\n<h3>HTTP Recovery / Upgrading to HTTPS</h3>\n<p>We provide a one-click option to retrieve both HTTP and HTTPS share counts, ensuring you don&#8217;t lose your share counts when upgrading your website to HTTPS.</p>\n<h3>GDPR</h3>\n<p>Unlike other social sharing tools, this plugin does not use cookies, tracking scripts, or store any user data.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Shared Counts was created with site performance in mind, even at large scale. It is used on several large websites that get tens of millions of page views each month. Our unique and creative caching methods have a minimal affect on site overhead. Leveraging the SharedCount.com API, we can retrieve (almost) all share counts in a single request.</p>\n<h3>Developers</h3>\n<p>Additionally, Shared Counts was built to be developer friendly! We provide very liberal usage of hooks and filters. Everything is customizable and the possibilities are near limitless. Unlike other plugins all data (counts) are stored and cached in post_meta which makes it easy to access for extending (e.g. fetch top 10 most shared posts on your site). We have extensive documentation on <a href=\"https://sharedcountsplugin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website</a> and we&#8217;re also on <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredatch/Shared-Counts/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h3>Add On Plugins</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/billerickson/Shared-Counts-Pinterest-Image\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shared Counts &#8211; Pinterest Image</a> &#8211; Upload a separate image for Pinterest sharing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/billerickson/Shared-Counts-Cache-Status\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shared Counts &#8211; Cache Status</a> &#8211; Build and check the status of the Shared Counts cache</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>For details on this please see the <a href=\"https://sharedcountsplugin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shared Counts website</a> and our <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredatch/Shared-Counts/wiki/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub wiki</a>.</p>\n<h3>Bugs</h3>\n<p>If you find an bug or problem, please let us know by <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredatch/Shared-Counts/issues?state=open\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">creating an issue</a>.</p>\n<h3>Contributions</h3>\n<p>Contributions are welcome!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open an <a href=\"https://github.com/jaredatch/Shared-Counts/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue</a> on GitHub.</li>\n<li>Fork Shared Counts on GitHub.</li>\n<li>Create a new branch off of <code>develop</code>; branch name should be <code>issue/###</code> to reference the issue.</li>\n<li>When committing, reference your issue and provide notes/feedback.</li>\n<li>Send us a Pull Request with your bug fixes and/or new features.</li>\n</ol>\n",
