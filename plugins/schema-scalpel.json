Many sites don&#8217;t use schema, or use it incorrectly, thereby missing out on a powerful SEO and branding tool.</p>\n<p>Schema Scalpel solves this problem by giving you complete control over your website’s structured data. It allows you to tell search engines exactly what you want them to know about who you are and what you do.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create completely customized schema on any page… or <em>every</em> page!</li>\n<li>Copy and paste from a collection of built-in schema templates recommended by Google</li>\n<li>Works with the SEO plugins Yoast and All-in-One</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20schema%3F'>\nWhat is schema?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Schema, also known as structured data, is a form of microdata. I know that clarifies nothing, but stay with me here. Schema allows a website to give search engines precise information about the nature and content of the website.</p>\n<p>Organizations, businesses, and individuals all have different types of information necessary for describing who and what they are and what they do. Schema is how that information is conveyed to search engines so that the websites associated with those entities show up in the most relevant search results.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='json-ld%20vs.%20microdata%3A%20what%27s%20the%20difference%3F'>\nJSON-LD vs. Microdata: What&#8217;s the Difference?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Both of these forms of structured data will provide to search engines and their respective bots the information they need to understand your website.</p>\n<p>The primary difference is that microdata is written into and dispersed throughout the HTML of your page. This makes maintenance thereof very impractical. JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD), on the other hand, is contained wholly within a single set of <code>script</code> tags making it very easy to create, update, and improve.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, <strong><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/intro-structured-data#format-placement\" title=\"Introduction to Structured Data\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google recommends that you use JSON-LD!</a></strong> Give the search engines what they ask for in the format that they prefer, and they&#8217;ll rank your site higher.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
