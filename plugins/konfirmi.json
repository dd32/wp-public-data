KONFIRMI also goes beyond fraud prevention and CAPTCHA-like functionalty.  In addition, KONFIRMI avoids many problems often present in other customer verification systems.</p>\n<p>Our easy-to-use app allows you to select from a variety of ways to automatically verify your customer&#8217;s information, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Photo ID</li>\n<li>Mailing Address</li>\n<li>Phone number</li>\n<li>Email Address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>before any services are provided, before any access is granted, and before any products are sold or delivered.</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p><strong>USE KONFIRMI TO AVOID VIOLATING THE LAW</strong></p>\n<p>Our app provides an easy and affordable way to comply with various laws affecting e-commerce and other online businesses:</p>\n<p><strong>True Age Verification:</strong>  KONFIRMI lets you automatically verify your customer&#8217;s age!  Online sellers of age restricted products — like certain kinds of video games, liquor and alcoholic beverages, tobacco and vaping products, marijuana sales, pornography, and gambling services — must check the buyer’s government-issued photo ID, or in some cases at least verify the buyer’s information against consumer databases, to ensure that the buyer is old enough. In most cases, you also need a clear audit trail to prove the verifications were being done properly.  KONFIRMI handles all of this automatically!</p>\n<p><strong>No Facial Recognition.</strong>  Studies have shown that facial recognition is unreliable with non-Caucasians &#8212; just search the internet, and you will find several reputable studies and articles on this issue.  In addition, facial recognition is disfavored and highly problematic in many places, including in the European Economic Area (EEA) and in several states in the United States.  In some cases, you even need a written release from your customer to use facial recognition or other biometrics, and written disclosure of the specific purpose and duration of time for which the facial recognition or biometric information is being collected, stored, and used.  KONFIRMI lets you avoid all of this!</p>\n<p><strong>“Behind the Scenes” Verification.</strong>  KONFIRMI gets the consents you need to verify your customers!  In many countries, including in the United States, it is often illegal to identify individuals without their knowledge and consent, especially using biometrics of any kind.  This is easy with KONFIRMI!</p>\n<p><strong>GDPR Compliance:</strong>  KONFIRMI allows you to easily comply with the GDPR!  Under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EU residents have the right to request information you have about them, and have you delete or correct this information.  However, you first have to verify that the request is actually from your customer.  KONFIRMI handles this for you!</p>\n<p><strong>CCPA Compliance:</strong>  KONFIRMI also lets you easily comply with the CCPA!  Under the new California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), businesses have to provide California customers with a copy of their personal information held by the business, and delete or correct their information upon request.  However, you first have to verify that the request is from the customer.  KONFIRMI handles this for you automatically!</p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p>KONFIRMI allows you to easily get Single- or Multi-Factor Authentication for your customers.</p>\n<p>You can easily pick and choose from many simple or sophisticated verification methods.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can easily swap out one verification method for another, stack or layer various verifications methods together, and &#8216;mix and match&#8217; different verification methods for use in various parts of your website.</p>\n<p>For example, our most popular combination of verification methods is &#8220;SMS/Text Code&#8221; authentication, combined with &#8220;Knowledge Based&#8221; or &#8220;Information Check&#8221; authentication.</p>\n<p>This combination allows you to automatically verify your customer&#8217;s phone number or email address with third-party data sources, and then have your customer enter a code sent that same phone number or email address.</p>\n<p>This combination is very hard to spoof, but also is very fast and easy for your customers!</p>\n<p>KONFIRMI works with WooCommerce, as well as various popular contact form plugins.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konfirmi.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Konfirmi Website</a></p>\n<p>+++++++++++++++++</p>\n<p><strong>NEW FEATURES:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Works Internationally:</strong></p>\n<p>Your customers can easily change the language they see.
