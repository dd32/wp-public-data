Watermark PDF for WooCommerce allows WooCommerce site administrators to apply custom watermarks to PDFs upon sale.</p>\n<p>Watermark PDF is a plugin that adds a watermark to every page of your sold PDF file(s). The watermark is customizable with font face, font color, font size, placement, and text. Not only that, but since the watermark is added when the download button is clicked (either on the customer&#8217;s order confirmation page or email), the watermark can include customer-specific data such as the customer&#8217;s first name, last name, and email. Your watermark is highly customizable and manipulatable, practically magic!</p>\n<p>Upon WooCommerce purchase download link, this plugin uses the open source TCPDI and TCPDF libraries to customize your PDF.

You will find more detailed error messaging if you <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/\" rel=\"ugc\">turn on WordPress debugging</a>. Screenshots and clear descriptions of the steps it takes to reproduce your problem are also very helpful. Please also make your support request TITLE descriptive. If the answer to your question can be found on this page, you might be waiting a while to hear from me, as I must prioritize support requests. Thanks for understanding.</p>\n<p>If you get the message &#8220;Sorry, we were unable to prepare this file for download,&#8221; please check your WP debug logs for more details.</p>\n<p><strong>Do not use the WordPress.org support forum for help with the Premium (paid) version</strong> of WaterMark PDF &#8211; that is against WordPress.org rules.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20change%20watermark%20settings%3F'>\nWhere do I change watermark settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the WaterMark PDF settings page by clicking on the &#8220;settings&#8221; link under the Watermark PDF for WooCommerce plugin title on your WordPress plugins panel, or by navigating to the WooCommerce-&gt;Settings-&gt;Watermark tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20watermark%20isn%E2%80%99t%20english'>\nMy watermark isn’t English\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Select the “Deja Vu,” “Furat,” or “M Sung” font in the plugin settings panel if your language uses accent characters and find out if one supports characters in your language.</p>\n<p>A primary reason watermarks do not show up is when the watermark contains special characters but a font which doesn’t support those characters is in use. If none of the included fonts are subsetted for your language characters, you will need to programmatically add fonts yourself or look into purchasing the Premium version of this plugin, which supports font uploads.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20test%20my%20watermark%3F'>\nHow do I test my watermark?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe set your PDF to $0 (free) and &#8220;Privately Published&#8221;. Or maybe create a coupon in your Woocommerce shop to allow 100% free purchases. Don&#8217;t share this coupon code with anyone! Test your watermark by purchasing PDFs from your shop using the coupon. It&#8217;s a bit more tedious. If you want an easier go of it (on-the-fly testing), purchase the Premium version of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20the%20watermark%20go%20off%20the%20page%2C%20create%20blank%20pages%3F'>\nWhy does the watermark go off the page, create blank pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your watermark text string is too big or long for the page, and goes off it! Try decreasing font size or using the Y fine tuners to move the watermark back onto the page. Try lowering your &#8220;y-axis&#8221; value. This number corresponds to how many <em>millimeters</em> you want the watermark moved down the page. For example, if your PDF page is 11 inches tall, your Y-axis setting should be a deal less than 279.4mm in order for a watermark to show. The built-in adjustments on the settings page ultimately allow for watermarking on all document sizes. You may need to edit your watermark if it is too verbose.</p>\n<p>You can use a negative integer value for your Y-tuner and measure up from the bottom of the page. This is especially helpful if your PDF has variable sized pages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20the%20watermarked%20files%20go%3F'>\nWhere do the watermarked files go?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They are generated with a unique name and stored in the same folder as your original WordPress/Woo product media upload (usually wp-content/uploads/year/month/file). The unique name includes the order number and a time stamp. If your end user complains of not being able to access their custom PDF for some reason (most often after their max number of downloads is exceeded), you can find it in that folder, right alongside your original.</p>\n<p>If you are using Woo FORCED downloads, the plugin attempts to delete the watermarked files after being delivered. This isn&#8217;t 100% reliable since it works on PHP shutdown. If you don&#8217;t like attempted deletion, you can change it with the &#8216;wwpdf_do_cleanup&#8217; filter hook (set it to FALSE).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20watermark%20pdf%20for%20woocommerce%20watermark%20images%3F'>\nWill Watermark PDF for WooCommerce watermark images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Watermark PDF for WooCommerce is intended to watermark PDF (.pdf) files. If you are specifically looking to watermark image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, .etc), you may want to look into a plugin such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-watermark/\" title=\"Image Watermark Plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">Image Watermark</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20for%20epub%2Fmobi%20files'>\nDoes this work for ePub/Mobi files\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, sorry. This plugin is just for PDF files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20plugin%20seems%20to%20break%20my%20pdf'>\nThe plugin seems to break my PDF\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin bridges WooCommerce and the open-source PDF reading TCPDI and PDF writing TCPDF library. WaterMark PDF functions by parsing/reading your PDF into memory the best it can, then adding a watermark to the PDF syntax and outputting a revised file. Between the reading and output, certain features may be lost and other features (interactive PDF elements like internal links and fillable forms) will be lost. This is a limitation of the open-source third-party library used AND the wild-west nature of PDF syntax. It is not the fault of WaterWoo, which simply connects those libraries to WooCommerce. If you are serious about watermarking and/or encrypting complex PDF files, <a href=\"https://www.little-package.com/shop/pdf-stamper-for-woocommerce/\" title=\"PDF Stamper for WooCommerce plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">consider purchasing WooStamper</a>. Ultimately, Watermark PDF for WooCommerce is best for simple, smaller-sized and well-formed PDFs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20fallback%20in%20case%20watermarking%20fails%3F'>\nIs there a fallback in case watermarking fails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can serve the file untouched if watermarking fails, and avoid any error messages, by using the following filter code in your (child) theme functions.php file:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'wwpdf_serve_unwatermarked_file', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you do not know how to edit your functions.php file, you can use the Code Snippets plugin to easily add this code to your WP site frontend.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
