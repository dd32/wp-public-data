        "installation": "<h4>Automatic Installation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your plugin browser inside your wordpress installation and search <code>Gallerio</code> by keyword. Then click install and it will be installed shortly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from <code>Plugins</code> menu after installation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the latest version and extract the folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>The plugin will appear as inactive in your <code>Plugins</code> menu</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins</code> menu in WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>1. Can I include mulliple gallery shortcode in a single page or post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. You can include multiple gallery shortcodes in a single page or post flawlessly. Even if pagination is enabled you will be able to use pagination links simultaneously for those galleries.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2. In case of bulk upload only 20 files are getting uploaded once. How can I increase this limit?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this can be done from your server end. Your apache php configuration variable <code>max_file_uploads</code> might have been set to only 20. You can change this in your php configuration to increase this limit. If you    can&#8217;t contact your server administrator to do so.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>3. Can I modify the gallery canvas size or the thumbnail size that will be shown in my page or post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. All of the thumbnail and gallery related settings can be found in <code>Settings</code> section of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>4. The colorbox jQuery library is having conflict with my existing theme jQuery library. I want to implement my own lightbox plugin. Can I do so?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. You can disable colorbox in Settings and integrate your own lightbox plugin to avoid the conflict. In that case you may have to modify some plugin codes to match the gallery structure with your lightbox plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>5. Can I link some external URL to one of my gallery pictures?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. You can link some external URL to one of your gallery pictures. In that case just you have to turn off colorbox and set a link to that image.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>6. I have changed my thumbnail and picture dimensions after uploading photos. Will I have to upload them again to have the change?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No you don&#8217;t have to upload your pictures again. All you have to do is regenerate the thumbnails from your settings menu. Just go to settings and click on regenerate thumbnails. Wait for a while and all your thumbnails will be regenerated according to the new dimensions you have set. This can take several minutes also depending on the quantity of pictures you have in your galleries.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
