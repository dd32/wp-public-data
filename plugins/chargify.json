        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Create a WordPress page where people will sign up for access to your site. This is where a user will be taken to register and begin the signup process.<br />\na. Place the shortcode [chargify] in the body of your page somewhere to create the sign up form.<br />\n If you are using the accounting code functionality on your products and want to limit by them you&#8217;d change the shortcode to something like [chargify accountingcodes=20,22]<br />\nb. You can fill the rest of the page in with whatever else you want, any content that makes sense for you.<br />\nc. Note the URL of this page (full URL)</li>\n<li>Create a WordPress page where your users will return to after a successful signup.<br />\na. This will be after they complete a successful transaction<br />\nb. This will be useful for tracking analytics. You can use Google Analytics to make this the Goal page, and track signups and conversions as goals.<br />\nc. You should also consider using this page to give information to your users once they&#8217;ve finished paying for their memberships, such as welcome to our site, here&#8217;s a link to our FAQ. Here are some pages you may want to check out.<br />\nd. The user&#8217;s login information will come to them in an email. It is helpful to tell them to check their email to get that information and allow them to login.<br />\ne. This email is the typical New User email, and you can modify it via other plugins.</li>\n<li>Got to the Chargify settings section of the WordPress admin area.<br />\na. Add your API Key (you get this from Chargify.com when logged in)<br />\nb. Your Test API Key is probably the same.<br />\nc. Your Domain is the subdomain you get when creating a new site inside of the Chargify system<br />\nd. Your Test Domain is probably the same as above.<br />\ne. Mode, leave it Test until you&#8217;re ready to make it live.<br />\nf. Sign-up Type should be left at Default unless you know what you&#8217;re doing.<br />\ng. Signup Link &#8211; Place the URL to the page you created in step 1.</li>\n<li>Go to Chargify.com and login. </li>\n<li>Create your products at Chargify.com You&#8217;ll create a product family and products below that. (these will be the different access and product levels). Feel free to just have one product &#8211; standard access.</li>\n<li>While creating your Product, add the following line to your return parameters: subscription_id={subscription_id}&amp;customer_reference={customer_reference}<br />\na. This is CRITICAL. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!!! It is the information that is passed after a successful transaction that tells WordPress to create the new account.</li>\n<li>Now that you have a product identified, your WordPress account will use that information and allow you to set pages or posts to private. Go create a test post and look for the Chargify settings within that post edit page, and check that it&#8217;s for members only (or whatever you named your product).</li>\n<li>Now, when you try and access that product, you&#8217;ll be told you have to be logged in to view, and it should give you a link to sign up for an account.</li>\n<li>Logout of WordPress and try it. Go through every step and make sure it&#8217;s working before your turn off the Test function.</li>\n<li>If that works, you&#8217;ll need to continue setting up your Chargify account, inputting whatever information you need for your merchant account, payment gateway, or PayPal account. See chargify&#8217;s support for more information on that.</li>\n</ol>\n",
