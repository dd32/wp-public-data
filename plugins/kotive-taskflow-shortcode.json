You know your business best. Now you can create your own workflows or business processes to fit your business like a glove.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is this useful?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shortcodes are clean! You can already copy and paste JavaScript or iframe code to embed a Kotive workflow or form onto a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the &#8220;HTML&#8221; tab of the writing area. If a user is in the &#8220;Visual&#8221; (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Shortcodes will work either way.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
