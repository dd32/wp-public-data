        "description": "<p>Eazy Project Management is a WordPress plugin that creates a custom post type for projects with a custom taxonomy for clients. The plugin also creates a custom user role for clients. When a user is added with the role client, it adds the users display name to the taxonomy clients. You can then create a custom post type of project and use the taxonomy term client to keep the content of the project protected from users who aren\\&#8217;t admin or logged in with the display name matching the taxonomy term.</p>\n",

Select the clients you want to display the project for by checking the corresponding taxonomy term that matches the users name.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I customize the layout?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses the default single.php and taxonomy.php or archive.php to display a single project and a client archive. Add single-ezproject.php to your theme for a single project. Add taxonomy-ezproject_clients.php to your theme for the client archive that shows all projects for a client.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this plugin work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin creates a custom post type called Projects with a taxonomy or Clients. You can add a client as a user, so that they are able to login to the website. When you create the users, they are added to the Clients taxonomy for the projects post type. You create a project just like a post, and select the clients you want to show the project to like you would a tag on a post. A PHP if/else statement checks for the user to be either admin or logged in with a user display name that matches the taxonomy terms selected to display the current project.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to change conditional statement, flush permalinks on activation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update rjs_eazy_client_content functions if/else statement to include else block for all content that is not an ezproject post type. This should provide more control for the content filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version of plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n"
