        "faq": "\n<h4>What is a robots.txt file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Robots.txt is a text file webmasters create to instruct web robots (typically search engine robots) how to crawl pages on their website. The robots.txt file is part of the the robots exclusion protocol (REP), a group of web standards that regulate how robots crawl the web, access and index content, and serve that content up to users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is an ads.txt file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is an IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) approved text file that aims to prevent unauthorized inventory sales. Ads.txt is a simple, flexible, and secure method for publishers and distributors to declare who is authorized to sell their inventory, improving transparency for programmatic buyers.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does robots.txt and ads.txt helps for SEO?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The purpose of these files is to better describe the content on your website to web bots. These files help web crawlers to index the content and serve that content to users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why my website shows 404 (Not Found) page when robots.txt or ads.txt requested?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve enabled the particular file in Adenergizer settings of WordPress admin area. Also, URL rewriting should be allowed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
