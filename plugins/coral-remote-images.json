        "faq": "\n<h4>The plugin didn&#8217;t recognize the live URL</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yea, it might not. When we at Big Sea build websites locally, we tend to import the live database, and modify the URL for our local installs via PHP constants. If you do not do that, and modify the database, you can tell Coral Remote Images what the live URL is by setting:</p>\n<pre><code>define('BSD_CORAL_LIVE_URL', 'http://yourlivesiteURL.com');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add this in your wp-config.php or theme&#8217;s functions.php &#8230; this is the location of your WordPress install, not your site&#8217;s root (if it varies)</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Will only be overridden by the BSD_CORAL_LIVE_URL PHP constant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fix] Discovered that we weren&#8217;t compensating for SSL redirection. URLs to change to weren&#8217;t properly being determined.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>[Fix] Noticed during wp-cli activate that WP_SITEURL isn&#8217;t set during the time that it&#8217;s being utilized. Changed the location that it gets used, and swapped out some conditionals accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
