You can test any page that shows reviews, or the page that is displaying the total star rating reviews.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20for%20my%20reviews%20to%20show%20up%20in%20google%3F'>\nHow long does it take for my reviews to show up in google?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is the million dollar question. Google puts no timeline on how long it will take for your reviews and ratings to show in in SERPs. We have found that utilizing the structured data and highlighter tool provide in webmaster sites have shown up in results in 2-3 weeks, we have also seen it take months. Providing you use webmaster tools and the testing tool correctly that would be the best way to assure eventually your rating will show up in SERPs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20css%20to%20style%3F'>\nCan I use CSS to style?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can use your own style sheet and override css settings</p>\n</p>\n\n",
