        "faq": "<h4>When I unpublish and then publish my post again, is an email being sent a second time?</h4>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the look and feel of the email?</h4>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s a very simple HTML email being sent using WordPress&#8217; email function. You can simply add your logo.</p>\n<h4>Does it work for custom post types?</h4>\n<p>No. But you can add a simple line to the plugin to make it work. If your custom post type is called &#8220;product&#8221;, for example, you&#8217;d simply add:     add_action( &#8216;publish_product&#8217;, &#8216;mail_blog_post&#8217;, 10, 2);</p>\n<h4>Can i customize the email for each receiver?</h4>\n<p>No, you can&#8217;t have a &#8220;Hello Person XYZ&#8221; as greeting if that is what you are looking for.</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using Google&#8217;s SMTP instead of WordPress&#8217; email function and no mail is being sent.</h4>\n<p>Google&#8217;s SMTP allows only for 99 emails per day to be sent. So if you added more addresses, it simply won&#8217;t work. You could create a list or an alias and send your blognewsletter to that address instead.</p>\n",
