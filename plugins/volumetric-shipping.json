Shipping charges can increase due to the volumetric weight, which is directly related to the amount of space that it occupies.</p>\n<p>If your package has a large size-to-weight ratio, you may need to consider your package’s dimensional weight when calculating your shipping rates. Volumetric weight (Dimensional weight) reflects package density, which is the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight.</p>\n<p>If you’re shipping an item that takes up a lot of space but isn’t very heavy, a shipping company might charge you for the item’s dimensional weight instead of its actual weight.
