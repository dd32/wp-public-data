HFP only allows your file to be viewed on your website.</p>\n<p>Hotlink protection is provided via <code>.htaccess</code> rules in the <code>wp-content/uploads</code> directory.</p>\n<h3>Basic Usage</h3>\n<p>Once the HFP plugin is activated, you will have two new features in the media library:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Within the Screen Options tab (list view only), check box for the &#8220;Hotlink Prevention&#8221; column.</li>\n<li>To protect a file, edit the file and scroll down to the checkbox labelled &#8220;Hotlink Protection&#8221;.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any asset that is checked will have &#8220;Yes&#8221; displayed in the &#8220;Hotlink Prevention&#8221; column; otherwise, this column will be blank.</p>\n<h4>Note about &#8220;Open in new tab&#8221; option</h4>\n<p>When you use the &#8220;Open in new tab&#8221; option for links, WordPress adds <code>rel=\"noreferrer\"</code>, which effectively makes the link act like direct access, and the link will be blocked for files protected using HFP.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20hfp%20work%3F'>\nHow does HFP work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HFP creates an Apache <code>.htaccess</code> file in the <code>wp-content/uploads</code> directory. It sets a HTTP_REFERER check and RewriteRule for each file that has hotlink protection applied. Toggling hotlink protection on/off dynamically adds/removes RewriteRule statements.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20it%20be%20used%20with%20any%20type%20of%20media%20file%3F'>\nCan it be used with any type of media file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it works with any file that you upload to the media library.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20my%20files%20absolutely%20safe%20using%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nAre my files absolutely safe using this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: This plugin makes it harder for people to hotlink to your files, but if they are highly technical, they will be able to do things like fake the HTTP referrer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20with%20with%20web%20servers%20other%20than%20apache%3F'>\nDoes it with with web servers other than Apache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The server must process rewrite rules in <code>.htaccess</code>. So HFP will work on Apache and LightSpeed servers, but not NGINX.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
