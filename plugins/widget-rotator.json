Then this is for you.</p>\n<p>Widget Rotator Pro is a WordPress plugin which is used to rotate multiple widgets in same spot in your sidebars. If you need to show multiple widgets in your site in a random order, then this is a plugin for you. The plugin is a light weight and fully functional one. It allows multiple rotators in each sidebar, and each supports multiple widgets.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After you have installed and activated this plugin, go to Appearance -&gt; Widgets -&gt; And drag Widget Rotator Pro in any of your sidebar. </li>\n<li>Give it a title and choose display order. Click save and then refresh the page (otherwise it won&#8217;t load in other widgets)</li>\n<li>Now drag and drop any widget in the same sidebar. At the bottom of each widget you will find an option called &#8220;Rotate this widget in&#8221;. Choose any rotator from same side bar. </li>\n<li>Now enter a random priority number. Higher number means more priority. Do remember that the sum of priority in each widget assigned to a rotator should be 100. </li>\n<li>If you have 3 widgets then enter 30,30,40 or 25,25,50 or anything else but total should be 100. </li>\n<li>You can add multiple rotators in each sidebar and choose anyone for your widgets. Just remember to keep the total of priority to 100.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Important Note : I am not the developer of this plugin. I got it developed by a freelancer for my personal use. However id you find any problems let me know and I will get it fixed.</p>\n",
