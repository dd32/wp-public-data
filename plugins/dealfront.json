It collects behavioral data of the companies visiting your website, including the pages viewed, where they came from, and how long they spent on your site. IP addresses are collected to determine the company and its geographic location. By default Leadfeeder only shows company visits, not individuals. Leadfeeder only tracks individuals when you opt in and when the individuals identify themselves on your website (via form submissions or email integrations). Leadfeeder also enriches company visit data with publicly available business contact data. For more information, see <a href=\"https://www.dealfront.com/gdpr/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20leadfeeder%20data%20kept%20accurate%20and%20up-to-date%3F'>\nHow is Leadfeeder data kept accurate and up-to-date?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Leadfeeder automatically removes bots, ISPs, and other low-quality traffic sources, so you only get a list of high-quality identified companies. Unlike other tools, you also have the option to remove unwanted companies yourself. This makes Leadfeeder data quality superior to others. Our unique machine learning algorithm creates a fresh and accurate version of the IP-to-company database every day. It uses our proprietary data and combines it with millions of external signals and public IP registration databases. Every month around 20% of the database changes, so updating it on a daily basis is important.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
