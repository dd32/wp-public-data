The compression level used will be the default one.</p>\n<h4>And what about the thumbnails?</h4>\n<p>By default, all the thumbnails will be compressed. You can disable this feature from the settings page.</p>\n<h4>Can I choose a different compression level for each image?</h4>\n<p>Of course. You can choose a compression level different from the default one for each image in the Media page.</p>\n<h4>What is the preview? How it works?</h4>\n<p>The preview is a very important feature that allows you to see the changes before to make it permanent. By this way, you can test several compression levels and choose that one you prefer. To work, this feature uses a cache into the plugin&#8217;s directory that must be writable.</p>\n<h4>Can I automatically compress the already uploaded images?</h4>\n<p>Yes but in the premium version. With the free version you can make it manually.</p>\n<h4>Can I clear the cache?</h4>\n<p>Of course. You can clear it from the settings page.</p>\n<h4>Can I see additional information after the compression?</h4>\n<p>Yes you can. By enabling the option, you can see more information about the image on the Media page, such as the old size, the new size, the gain obtained by the compression and the compression level used in the compression process.</p>\n<h4>Is it a multilingual plugin?</h4>\n<p>Yes, of course. You can looking for supported languages in languages directory or create a new one.</p>\n"
