        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20other%20plugins%20that%20send%20email%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with other plugins that send email?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes of course. Vik Mail SMTP overrides the WordPress native email sending function through the PHPMailer Class. Therefore, any native plugin that sends email messages through the WordPress functions will be affected, theorically every plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20configure%20the%20smtp%20service%20of%20my%20own%20domain%3F'>\nCan I configure the SMTP service of my own domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We actually suggest to use your own SMTP service. For example, if you already have an email address like <em>example@yourwebsite.com</em> then you definitely have an SMTP service for the outgoing messages that you can use also for your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20this%20plugin%20different%20from%20the%20others%3F'>\nWhy is this plugin different from the others?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are probably many other plugins for WP that can do similar things to Vik Mail SMTP, but this plugin is compatible with the <strong>VikWP Framework</strong> used by all our other plugins. For those who like to hear technical stuff, the VikWP Framework allows to add system messages to the session queue (and much much more), like a success or failure notice that could be displayed right after sending an email message with a redirection to a different page. Other similar plugins that manipulate the SMTP and email sending functions could never support such functions. In short, this plugin can use the libraries of other VikWP plugins if they are installed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20support%20xoauth2%20for%20gmail%3F'>\nDoes it support XOAUTH2 for Gmail?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, sorry. We decided not to include the support for XOAUTH2 with Gmail due to its many limitations. First of all, the SMTP of Gmail can still be used via TLS by so called <em>less secure apps</em> like PHPMailer of WordPress, you just need to allow <em>less secure apps</em> to access the service from your Gmail account. PHPMailer is actually not a <em>less secure app</em>, but because the code is open source, Google will never consider it as <em>secure</em>. The protocol XOAUTH2 is only supported by certain versions of PHPMailer and WordPress, and it requires specific configuration settings at server level. Most hosting companies disable such functions for other security reasons, so the chances you have to be able to use XOAUTH2 on your domain are very low. If you need to use the SMTP service of Gmail, you should probably just grant the permissions for PHPMailer from your Gmail account.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
