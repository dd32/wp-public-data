        "faq": "\n<h4>What does the score mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It provides an interpretation for the strength of your subject line.<br />\nMizy applies two types of scoring:<br />\n*  <strong>Quantitative value</strong>: A higher score means your emails are more likely to be opened. Note: subject line is only one &#8211; but the most significant one- of the three factors (sender name, sending time, subject line) that determine the open rate of an email.<br />\n* <strong>Color of the badge</strong>: It provides a visual interpretation of the strength of your subject line. There are three colors: red, yellow, and green. Based on the results of 100k email campaigns, your subject line would perform &#8211; according to the color-  poorly, fairly or remarkably. We recommend you to always aim for green and never go below yellow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it truly Artificial intelligence?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, it is! If you want to get a sneak peek of what lies under the hood, check out <a href=\"https://help.automizy.com/faq/how-does-mizys-subject-line-tester-work\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a>. Also, our <a href=\"http://www.bsi.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AI research team</a> sends you their best wishes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I score other than email subject lines, e.g. headlines, taglines?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not right now. Mizy is still learning. However, naturally, there will be other use cases: it will score and optimize ads, headlines, and call to action buttons for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it compatible with Gutenberg?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently it is compatible only with the Classic Editor, however soon we plan to release Beta version for Gutenberg.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
