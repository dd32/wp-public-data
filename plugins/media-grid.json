Getting rid of the new school flexbox layout in favor of the old school (and more reliable) inline-block layout. Bigger images and more room for details in the detail modal.</p>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Adds some basic item information for the single item modal.</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed the missing grid button. Removed the bg blur for the modal, it was too resource intensive. Better scrolling and flexbox in the comparison modal. Icon added for the edit link.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>Starting development with a concept UI. Some things don&#8217;t actually work. Experimental tagging of media items is commented out. Delete doesnt actually delete. Search is limited to the items viewable on the page.</p>\n",
