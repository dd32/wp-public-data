        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen by going to <em>Plugins</em> -&gt; <em>Add New</em>, and searching for <em>Electroneum Instant Payments for Woocoomerce</em>. Alternatively, upload the <a href=\"https://github.com/benjaminoo/electroneum-instant-payments-woocommerce/releases\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin files</a> to the  <code>/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin by navigating to <em>Plugins</em> -&gt; <em>Installed Plugins</em> and clicking on <em>Activate</em> below the Electroneum Instant Payments for Woocommerce plugin name.</li>\n<li>Visit Electroneum&#8217;s user <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/user/vendor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">vendor page</a> (requires login) and follow the prompts to enter your details and create a vendor outlet.</li>\n<li>For the webhook address, enter <code>https://yoursite.com/wc-api/electroneum_ips_gateway/</code> replacing <em>yoursite.com</em> with your site&#8217;s main URL. This must be in place for payment status to be checked automatically in the backgroud. Note that you must have HTTPS to be enabled for this to work.</li>\n<li>On your WordPress dashboard, click on the <em>Electroneum IPS</em> menu item in the left navigation bar. This will take you to the plugin&#8217;s settings page in Woocommerce.</li>\n<li>Enter your API key, API secret, and vendor outlet ID in the fields provided and save your settings.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Where do I sign up as an Electroneum Vendor?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Navigate to the Electroneum <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/user/vendor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">user vendor page</a> and follow the prompts to enter your details and create a vendor outlet.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I get my API credentials?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After signing up as a vendor on Electroneum&#8217;s website, your API key and API secret will be displayed on the <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/user/vendor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">user vendor page</a>. Your vendor outlet ID will be displayed on the <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/user/vendor/brands\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">outlets page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is an API Webhook?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The API Webhook is a web address that you enter on your Electroneum vendor page, that points to a background page on your website. Electroneum sends payment information to this page every time a customer has made a payment. This enables automatic checking for payment confirmation in the background and streamlines the front-end user experience.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set my API Webhook?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Navigate to the Electroneum <a href=\"https://my.electroneum.com/user/vendor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">user vendor page</a> and insert the following webhook in the appropriate field:</p>\n<pre><code>https://yoursite.com/wc-api/electroneum_ips_gateway/\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#8230;replacing <em>yoursite.com</em> with your website&#8217;s main URL. Note that this URL must start with https://</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the use of the &#8220;I&#8217;ve Made the Payment Button&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although the payments page will update automatically when a payment is received, the button is left in place for users who don&#8217;t have Javascript implemented, and for instances where the web developer has failed to enter the webhook callback URL on Electroneum&#8217;s website, or made a typo. Basically, the button serves as a backup for possible technology failures.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When using Safari, the payment page does not update automatically with a successful payment. What&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The way in which the Safari browser treats SSL security certificates may cause front-end AJAX Javascript to fail and therefore the payment page won&#8217;t display a success message automatically, even though everything else works perfectly. A fix for this is to add the following line to your server&#8217;s .htaccess file:</p>\n<pre><code>BrowserMatch \"Safari\" nokeepalive\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using an Nginx server, you can edit your server configuration by adding <a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_disable\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this code</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that customers can still get around this by clicking the &#8220;I&#8217;ve Made the Payment&#8221; button after payment, which should show them a success message.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
