Same way for other templates &#8211;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>template file &#8216;product-one-column.php&#8217; will use the stylesheet &#8216;assets/css/product-one-column.css&#8217;  </li>\n<li>template file &#8216;product-three-columns.php&#8217; will use the stylesheet &#8216;assets/css/product-three-columns.css&#8217; </li>\n<li>template file &#8216;product-four-columns.php&#8217; will use the stylesheet &#8216;assets/css/product-four-columns.css&#8217; </li>\n</ul>\n<p>so one template file including its stylesheet update / modify will not affect others.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='so%20am%20i%20limited%20to%20display%20products%20only%20with%20one%20column%20or%20two%20columns%20or%20three%20columns%20or%20four%20columns%20view%3F'>\nSo am I limited to display products only with one column or two columns or three columns or four columns view?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, you are not limited! Templates are added as standard so you can update them, suppose you want to<br />\nshow more than four columns product view by updating template file &#8216;product-four-columns.php&#8217; then you can just<br />\nupdate / modify contents to show as 5 columns or 6 columns or whatever you prefer you can do but just don&#8217;t change<br />\nthe template file name &#8216;product-four-columns.php&#8217;  and its corresponding styesheet &#8216;assets/css/product-four-columns.css&#8217;.<br />\nSo you can display products as you want just keeping the template file names unchanged.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
