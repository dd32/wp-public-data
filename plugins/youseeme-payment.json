        "description": "<p>The YouPay IBAN account and payment plugin for SEPA and cryptocurrency can offer several advantages to merchants who integrate it into their e-commerce sites. Here are some of these potential benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>Customer base expansion</strong>: By accepting payments in SEPA and cryptocurrencies, merchants can attract customers who prefer to use digital currencies for online purchases. This can help expand the potential customer base and increase sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduced transaction fees</strong>: Cryptocurrency payments typically involve lower transaction fees than traditional credit card or bank transfer payments. Merchants can therefore save money on transaction fees and increase their profit margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Increased security</strong>: Cryptocurrency payments are encrypted and anonymous, reducing the risks of fraud and theft of personal information. Additionally, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, making it difficult for customers to dispute transactions after they have been completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Easier international transactions</strong>: Cryptocurrency payments are not subject to foreign exchange restrictions or conversion fees, making international transactions easier for both merchants and customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovative image</strong>: Integrating cryptocurrency payment solutions can give merchants an innovative and forward-thinking image, helping to improve their reputation and market positioning.</p>\n<p><strong>Commissions</strong>: Merchants have the option to set their commission rates between 1% and 5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Youseeme</strong> is a company registered with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) as a digital asset service provider (PSAN or DASP) under the registration number E2022-50 and as an Electronic Money Distributor (EMD) appointed by Treezor EME, registered with the ACPR (French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority) under number 63512.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>YouPay</strong> by Youseeme only supports <strong>EUR</strong> across all European Economic Area (E.E.A.) countries.</p>\n<h3>Benefits for users of the YouPay plugin</h3>\n<p><strong>YouPay</strong> facilitates B2B commerce.<br />\nHere are some features of the YouPay cryptocurrency payment plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Payment options</strong>: Users have the choice to pay with their regular bank card or with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Cryptocurrency payments are encrypted and anonymous, providing users with a higher level of security.</li>\n<li><strong>Fast Transactions</strong>: Cryptocurrency payments are generally faster than payments by bank card or wire transfer, allowing users to complete transactions more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Transaction Fees</strong>: Transaction fees for cryptocurrency payments are generally lower than those for bank card or wire transfer payments, allowing users to save money.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial Freedom</strong>: Users who prefer cryptocurrencies can conduct transactions freely without relying on traditional financial institutions.</li>\n<li><strong>Automatic Conversion</strong>: Cryptocurrency payments can be automatically converted into fiat currency, enabling users to make cryptocurrency payments without worrying about currency conversion.</li>\n<li><strong>Global Accessibility</strong>: Cryptocurrencies are available worldwide, allowing users to conduct transactions without worrying about currency restrictions or geographic barriers..</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Recommandations</h3>\n<p>You can also sign up on (<a href=\"https://user.youseeme.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Youseeme Crypto</a>) to obtain your free wallet for crypto collection and to obtain your crypto public address or alternatively, you can email us at (<a href=\"mailto:&#x73;&#117;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#x74;&#064;&#121;&#x6f;&#x75;&#115;&#x65;&#x65;&#109;&#101;&#x2e;&#102;&#114;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">customer support</a>).</p>\n<h3>Third party services</h3>\n<h4>Youseeme.io</h4>\n<p>We use https://api.youseeme.io/ API (especifically https://api.youseeme.io/v1/ecommerce/plugins/crypto/prices)<br />\nInputs:<br />\n    &#8211; Youseeme API key<br />\n    &#8211; serial-id made of hash generated from your API key and your website url<br />\nOutput:<br />\n    &#8211; json list of cryptocurrencies price conversion<br />\nFor more informations see (<a href=\"https://youseeme.io/protection-des-donnees-personnelles-rgpd/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a>) and (<a href=\"https://youseeme.io/conditions-generales-de-ventes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a>)</p>\n",
