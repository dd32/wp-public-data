It&#8217;s crucial for maintaining transparency and complying with advertising regulations. Disclaimify helps you easily integrate these disclosures into your content to build trust with your audience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20wording%20of%20the%20disclosure%20to%20match%20my%20brand%27s%20voice%3F'>\nCan I customize the wording of the disclosure to match my brand&#8217;s voice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>YES! Disclaimify offers seamless customization through the Gutenberg Editor. You can craft your own disclosure message, ensuring that it resonates with your brand&#8217;s style and tone. This customization helps you maintain consistency across your website while providing clear and transparent information to your readers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20work%20with%20my%20preferred%20wordpress%20theme%3F'>\nWill the plugin work with my preferred WordPress theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin is developed to work with any theme before or after the post efficiently.

This helps maintain a clear visual hierarchy and ensures that your disclosures are displayed to your readers in the desired sequence.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='getting%20started%20with%20a%20few%20simple%20steps'>\nGetting Started with a Few Simple Steps\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install and activate the Disclaimify plugin from the WordPress Plugin Repository.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the plugin settings to add and configure your disclosure preferences.</li>\n<li>Customize your disclosure content using the Gutenberg Editor to match your brand&#8217;s style.</li>\n<li>Choose your preferred disclosure display options based on your content strategy.</li>\n<li>Publish your disclosure, and let Disclaimify handle the rest.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%BB%20need%20help%3F'>\n👨‍💻 Need Help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Is there any feature that you want to get in this plugin?<br />\nNeeds assistance to use this plugin?<br />\nFeel free to <a href=\"https://hasthemes.com/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact us</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
