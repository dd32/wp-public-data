The theme check is designed to be a non-perfect way to test for compliance with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Theme Review</a> guidelines. Not all themes must adhere to these guidelines. The purpose of the checking tool is to ensure that themes uploaded to the central <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org theme repository</a> meet the latest standards of WordPress themes and will work on a wide variety of sites.</p>\n<p>Many sites use customized themes, and that&#8217;s perfectly okay. But themes that are intended for use on many different kinds of sites by the public need to have a certain minimum level of capabilities, in order to ensure proper functioning in many different environments. The Theme Review guidelines are created with that goal in mind.</p>\n<p>This theme checker is not perfect, and never will be. It is only a tool to help theme authors, or anybody else who wants to make their theme more capable. All themes submitted to WordPress.org are hand-reviewed by a team of experts. The automated theme checker is meant to be a useful tool only, not an absolute system of measurement.</p>\n<p>This plugin does not decide the guidelines used. Any issues with particular theme review guidelines should be discussed on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Make Themes site</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
