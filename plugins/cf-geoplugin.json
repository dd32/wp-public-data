        "description": "<p>Geo Controller is a transformative WordPress plugin, previously known as <strong>CF Geo Plugin</strong>, that personalizes and enhances your website based on users&#8217; geographic locations. By automatically determining visitors&#8217; locations, it can display custom greetings and tailored content, significantly increasing user engagement and interaction.</p>\n<p>The plugin also includes an advanced TOR network detection system, allowing website owners to manage visitors using the TOR network by blocking, hiding, or displaying specific content. Geo Controller integrates easily with geo tags, Google Maps, and various forms of content across posts, pages, widgets, and custom templates, requiring minimal coding knowledge.</p>\n<p>It is fully compatible with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, and WP Super Cache, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, Geo Controller enhances SEO through geo tags and redirects, offers spam protection, and optimizes WooCommerce stores with features like geolocation, payment method control, and local currency display.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, the plugin uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for optimal loading speed and leverages API use to reduce local data storage. Geo Controller also ensures legal compliance by filtering content based on regional laws, protecting your site from potential legal conflicts.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://wpgeocontroller.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Geo Controller Plugin</a>.</p>\n<h4>FREE AND PAID SERVICES</h4>\n<p>Geo Controller for WordPress is completely free!

However, for the free users, the API services are <a href=\"https://wpgeocontroller.com/documentation/quick-start/frequently-asked-questions/how-does-lookup-work\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">limited to 1000 lookups</a> per day.

It is a simple plugin to use, after installation and activation, you just need to insert the shortcode <strong><code>[cfgeo]</code></strong> in your post or page. This shortcode returns and displays the IP address of the visitor.</p>\n<p>You can also display different location-based information by using the return attribute in the shortcode. For example, to display the region of the visitor, you can use the shortcode <strong><code>[cfgeo return=\"region\"]</code></strong>. By changing the return attribute, you can display any information from the list provided by the plugin. Each user visiting the site will see information related to their area.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can also track custom IP addresses and return information from that IP by adding an optional attribute called ip. For example, <strong><code>[cfgeo ip=\"127.0.0.1\" return=\"area_code\"]</code></strong> will return the area code from that IP address.</p>\n<p>If the plugin is unable to locate the information, you can add a default value to the shortcode by using the default attribute. For example, <strong><code>[cfgeo return=\"country_code\" default=\"US\"]</code></strong> will return &#8220;US&#8221; if the plugin is unable to locate the country code.</p>\n<p>You can exclude or include content on your page based on the user&#8217;s location by using the <code>exclude</code> or <code>include</code> attribute. For example,</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo exclude=\"Toronto, Québec\"] This text is seen by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec [/cfgeo]\n</code></pre>\n<p>will hide the content &#8220;This text is seen by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec&#8221; from the visitors that are located in Toronto or Québec.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you want to display some content only to specific locations you can use the include attribute like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo include=\"New York, Miami, Germany\"] This text is seen only by people from New York, Miami and Germany [/cfgeo]\n</code></pre>\n<p>this shortcode will only display the text &#8220;This text is seen only by people from New York, Miami and Germany&#8221; to the visitors that are located in New York, Miami, and Germany.</p>\n<p>You can use the include and exclude attributes with country, region, or city codes. For example, <strong><code>[cfgeo include=\"US, GB, DE\"]</code></strong> displays content only to visitors from the US, Great Britain, and Germany, while <strong><code>[cfgeo exclude=\"CA, ON, QUE\"]</code></strong> hides content from visitors in California, Ontario, and Québec.</p>\n<p>By using these attributes you can control the content visibility based on user location and personalize the user experience.</p>\n<p>Please note that you need to use an accurate location name to include or exclude content and case-sensitive location name.</p>\n<p><strong>VAT CONTROL:</strong> If you need to show <em>value-added tax (VAT)</em> information on your website, there are 2 shortcodes that can help you with it.</p>\n<pre><code>[is_vat]You are under VAT[/is_vat]\n[is_not_vat]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both shortcodes have a default option that you can use as an alternative.</p>\n<pre><code>[is_vat default=\"You are NOT under VAT\"]You are under VAT[/is_vat]\n[is_not_vat default=\"You are under VAT\"]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generally, these two shortcodes show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>EU CONTROL:</strong> If you need to display some content related to <em>European Union (EU)</em> countries, you can do it in two easy ways:</p>\n<pre><code>[in_eu]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]\n[not_in_eu]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Like many of our shortcodes, there are default options that you can use as an alternative:</p>\n<pre><code>[in_eu default=\"You are NOT from the European Union\"]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]\n[not_in_eu default=\"You are from the European Union\"]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]\n</code></pre>\n<p>These two shortcodes also show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>GOOGLE MAP:</strong> If you want to place a simple Google Map in your post or page, you just need to place a shortcode [cfgeo_map] and your visitor will see their own location on Google Map by default.</p>\n<p>For example, you can display your own company street address inside Google Map like this: <code>[cfgeo_map longitude=\"-74.0059\" latitude=\"40.7128\" zoom=\"15\"]</code> and the pointer will show your street and place where you work.</p>\n<p>Google Map also allows you to use HTML inside the map and display an info bar:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_map longitude=\"-74.0059\" latitude=\"40.7128\" zoom=\"15\" title=\"My Company Name\"] \n   &lt;h3&gt;My Company Name&lt;h3&gt; \n   &lt;p&gt;No Name Street 35, New York, USA&lt;/p&gt; \n   &lt;p&gt;We have what you need&lt;/p&gt; \n[/cfgeo_map]\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this plugin, you can easily set up your Google Map.</p>\n<p><strong>GEO BANNER:</strong> With this plugin, you can create dynamic content (text, images, banners, videos) and target messages to specific regions, track IP addresses, and set up WordPress to work in the user&#8217;s timezone. This can increase conversions and support custom templates or plugins.</p>\n<p>Simply create a new banner, add your content, select rules (country, region, city), save it, and place the banner shortcode in your page content.</p>\n<p><strong>COUNTRY FLAG</strong> You can display country flags in text or like images.</p>\n<p>If you like to display the country flag in your text like an icon, you can do that simply like:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag] - and you will see a flag in your text.\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you like to display the country flag in your content like an image, you can do that also simply using img or image attributes like:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag img] - and you will see the image flag in your content.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also can give custom sizes of flags in %, px, in, pt, or em using size attribute like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag size=\"32px\"] - and you will see your flag in that size. You can use this size in image and normal text mode also.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also can display a custom flag using the country attribute by placing the country code simply like:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag country=\"ca\"] - and you will see a flag in your text or like an image.\n</code></pre>\n<p>We allow you also full control of these flags and you can place css, class, or id attributes to be able to use this in any kind of work like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag size=\"50\" css=\"padding:10px;\" class=\"your-custom-class custom-class custom\" id=\"top-flag\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Flags also support include &amp; exclude attributes where you can control your flag view:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag exclude=\"ca,us\"] - and you will hide the flag from the USA and Canada, for others it is visible\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag include=\"ca,us\"] - and you will show the flag only inside the USA and Canada, for others it is hidden\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Info &amp; Contact</h4>\n<p>Please visit our website <a href=\"https://wpgeocontroller.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.wpgeocontroller.com</a> and feel free to contact us.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20should%20i%20do%20if%20the%20plugin%20doesn%27t%20work%3F'>\nWhat should I do if the plugin doesn&#8217;t work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Geo Controller is designed to be compatible with most plugins, the WordPress ecosystem is vast and complex. With thousands of different plugins available and millions of unique WordPress installations, each with their potential combinations of themes, plugins, and settings, the landscape is incredibly diverse.</p>\n<p>What this means is that although efforts have been made to ensure Geo Controller works smoothly with other plugins, there might be instances where conflicts occur. A &#8220;conflict&#8221; in this context refers to two or more plugins interfering with each other&#8217;s functionality. This could cause one or both plugins to not work as intended, or even cause issues with the overall function of the website.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost impossible to test Geo Controller against every possible combination of plugins and WordPress configurations. Therefore, a 100% guarantee of compatibility cannot be given. It&#8217;s a rare occurrence, but sometimes, specific plugins might not work well with Geo Controller.</p>\n<p>If such a problem arises, it&#8217;s crucial to reach out to the support teams of Geo Controller or the other plugin involved. This collaborative approach often leads to a quick resolution of the issue. Both sets of developers understand their products intimately and will be able to assist in finding a solution.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, many compatibility issues stem from outdated software. Plugins, themes, and even WordPress itself are continually being updated. These updates often include fixes for known conflicts and compatibility issues. Therefore, keeping all aspects of a WordPress site up to date &#8211; including Geo Controller, other plugins, and the WordPress installation itself &#8211; is usually the most straightforward way to prevent or resolve these conflicts.</p>\n<p>In summary, while Geo Controller aims to be compatible with most plugins, the sheer variety of the WordPress environment means that occasional conflicts may arise. Open communication with support teams and keeping software up to date are the best strategies to ensure a smooth experience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20geo%20controller%20free%3F%20is%20there%20some%20license%20or%20restrictions%3F'>\nIs Geo Controller free?

    "description": "<p>Geo Controller is a transformative WordPress plugin, previously known as <strong>CF Geo Plugin</strong>, that personalizes and enhances your website based on users&#8217; geographic locations. By automatically determining visitors&#8217; locations, it can display custom greetings and tailored content, significantly increasing user engagement and interaction.</p>\n<p>The plugin also includes an advanced TOR network detection system, allowing website owners to manage visitors using the TOR network by blocking, hiding, or displaying specific content. Geo Controller integrates easily with geo tags, Google Maps, and various forms of content across posts, pages, widgets, and custom templates, requiring minimal coding knowledge.</p>\n<p>It is fully compatible with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, and WP Super Cache, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, Geo Controller enhances SEO through geo tags and redirects, offers spam protection, and optimizes WooCommerce stores with features like geolocation, payment method control, and local currency display.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, the plugin uses a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for optimal loading speed and leverages API use to reduce local data storage. Geo Controller also ensures legal compliance by filtering content based on regional laws, protecting your site from potential legal conflicts.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://wpgeocontroller.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Geo Controller Plugin</a>.</p>\n<h4>FREE AND PAID SERVICES</h4>\n<p>Geo Controller for WordPress is completely free!

It is a simple plugin to use, after installation and activation, you just need to insert the shortcode <strong><code>[cfgeo]</code></strong> in your post or page. This shortcode returns and displays the IP address of the visitor.</p>\n<p>You can also display different location-based information by using the return attribute in the shortcode. For example, to display the region of the visitor, you can use the shortcode <strong><code>[cfgeo return=\"region\"]</code></strong>. By changing the return attribute, you can display any information from the list provided by the plugin. Each user visiting the site will see information related to their area.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can also track custom IP addresses and return information from that IP by adding an optional attribute called ip. For example, <strong><code>[cfgeo ip=\"127.0.0.1\" return=\"area_code\"]</code></strong> will return the area code from that IP address.</p>\n<p>If the plugin is unable to locate the information, you can add a default value to the shortcode by using the default attribute. For example, <strong><code>[cfgeo return=\"country_code\" default=\"US\"]</code></strong> will return &#8220;US&#8221; if the plugin is unable to locate the country code.</p>\n<p>You can exclude or include content on your page based on the user&#8217;s location by using the <code>exclude</code> or <code>include</code> attribute. For example,</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo exclude=\"Toronto, Québec\"] This text is seen by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec [/cfgeo]\n</code></pre>\n<p>will hide the content &#8220;This text is seen by everyone except people from Toronto and Québec&#8221; from the visitors that are located in Toronto or Québec.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you want to display some content only to specific locations you can use the include attribute like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo include=\"New York, Miami, Germany\"] This text is seen only by people from New York, Miami and Germany [/cfgeo]\n</code></pre>\n<p>this shortcode will only display the text &#8220;This text is seen only by people from New York, Miami and Germany&#8221; to the visitors that are located in New York, Miami, and Germany.</p>\n<p>You can use the include and exclude attributes with country, region, or city codes. For example, <strong><code>[cfgeo include=\"US, GB, DE\"]</code></strong> displays content only to visitors from the US, Great Britain, and Germany, while <strong><code>[cfgeo exclude=\"CA, ON, QUE\"]</code></strong> hides content from visitors in California, Ontario, and Québec.</p>\n<p>By using these attributes you can control the content visibility based on user location and personalize the user experience.</p>\n<p>Please note that you need to use an accurate location name to include or exclude content and case-sensitive location name.</p>\n<p><strong>VAT CONTROL:</strong> If you need to show <em>value-added tax (VAT)</em> information on your website, there are 2 shortcodes that can help you with it.</p>\n<pre><code>[is_vat]You are under VAT[/is_vat]\n[is_not_vat]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both shortcodes have a default option that you can use as an alternative.</p>\n<pre><code>[is_vat default=\"You are NOT under VAT\"]You are under VAT[/is_vat]\n[is_not_vat default=\"You are under VAT\"]You are NOT under VAT[/is_not_vat]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generally, these two shortcodes show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>EU CONTROL:</strong> If you need to display some content related to <em>European Union (EU)</em> countries, you can do it in two easy ways:</p>\n<pre><code>[in_eu]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]\n[not_in_eu]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Like many of our shortcodes, there are default options that you can use as an alternative:</p>\n<pre><code>[in_eu default=\"You are NOT from the European Union\"]You are from the European Union[/in_eu]\n[not_in_eu default=\"You are from the European Union\"]You are NOT from the European Union[/not_in_eu]\n</code></pre>\n<p>These two shortcodes also show or hide everything inside it, depending on your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>GOOGLE MAP:</strong> If you want to place a simple Google Map in your post or page, you just need to place a shortcode [cfgeo_map] and your visitor will see their own location on Google Map by default.</p>\n<p>For example, you can display your own company street address inside Google Map like this: <code>[cfgeo_map longitude=\"-74.0059\" latitude=\"40.7128\" zoom=\"15\"]</code> and the pointer will show your street and place where you work.</p>\n<p>Google Map also allows you to use HTML inside the map and display an info bar:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_map longitude=\"-74.0059\" latitude=\"40.7128\" zoom=\"15\" title=\"My Company Name\"] \n   &lt;h3&gt;My Company Name&lt;h3&gt; \n   &lt;p&gt;No Name Street 35, New York, USA&lt;/p&gt; \n   &lt;p&gt;We have what you need&lt;/p&gt; \n[/cfgeo_map]\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this plugin, you can easily set up your Google Map.</p>\n<p><strong>GEO BANNER:</strong> With this plugin, you can create dynamic content (text, images, banners, videos) and target messages to specific regions, track IP addresses, and set up WordPress to work in the user&#8217;s timezone. This can increase conversions and support custom templates or plugins.</p>\n<p>Simply create a new banner, add your content, select rules (country, region, city), save it, and place the banner shortcode in your page content.</p>\n<p><strong>COUNTRY FLAG</strong> You can display country flags in text or like images.</p>\n<p>If you like to display the country flag in your text like an icon, you can do that simply like:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag] - and you will see a flag in your text.\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you like to display the country flag in your content like an image, you can do that also simply using img or image attributes like:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag img] - and you will see the image flag in your content.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also can give custom sizes of flags in %, px, in, pt, or em using size attribute like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag size=\"32px\"] - and you will see your flag in that size. You can use this size in image and normal text mode also.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also can display a custom flag using the country attribute by placing the country code simply like:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag country=\"ca\"] - and you will see a flag in your text or like an image.\n</code></pre>\n<p>We allow you also full control of these flags and you can place css, class, or id attributes to be able to use this in any kind of work like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag size=\"50\" css=\"padding:10px;\" class=\"your-custom-class custom-class custom\" id=\"top-flag\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Flags also support include &amp; exclude attributes where you can control your flag view:</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag exclude=\"ca,us\"] - and you will hide the flag from the USA and Canada, for others it is visible\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>[cfgeo_flag include=\"ca,us\"] - and you will show the flag only inside the USA and Canada, for others it is hidden\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Info &amp; Contact</h4>\n<p>Please visit our website <a href=\"https://wpgeocontroller.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.wpgeocontroller.com</a> and feel free to contact us.
