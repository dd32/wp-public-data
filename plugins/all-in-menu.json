Then add your already created tabs into your menu choosing the alignment you want (left, center, right) and the it&#8217;s appearance (color and width). You are ready to go. Wherever you add the shortcode of the menu (shown in the menu list) you will see your menu.</p>\n<p>Test the result! Resize the browser to see how responsive it is.
