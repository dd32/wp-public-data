There are a number of gallery plug-ins for WordPress, but many<br />\nare either too complex, too rigid or too expensive for some developer&#8217;s needs. No Frills Gallery has been developed for simplicity, but also<br />\nfor customisation. Thanks to it&#8217;s use of shortcodes, which are generated after you have chosen your specific requirements, both the gallery<br />\nand slideshow can be placed anywhere on the site, either in a page or as part of a sidebar, header or any content area via either the standard<br />\nshortcode or PHP&#8217;s do_shortcode syntax.</p>\n<p>The styling has remained purposefully simple, allowing you the flexibility you need to build on your own style. All front-end stylings can be<br />\nview in the /css/no-frills.css file. While you can edit this directly, it is not advised as it may be replaced on future plug-in updates.<br />\nInstead simply copy the styles inside this css file and add them to your own theme&#8217;s style.css file. Then customise them to suit your needs.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder <code>/no-frills-gallery</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the No Fills Gallery admin menu options to customise your gallery</li>\n<li>Generate your customisable shortcodes and place hem in to any WordPress page</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I add images to my gallery</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the NF Gallery link from the admin area. Once you&#8217;ve entered your gallery name and description, click the &#8220;Add Images To Album&#8221; button. Using the standard Media Library, select all your required images. Once added you can re-arrange simply by dragging and dropping each item. Click the &#8220;X&#8221; in the top-right-hand corner of each image to remove it from the list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I remove an image from the gallery will it delete the image from my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The images will remain in your Media Library for use elsewhere on the site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I view my image gallery</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No Frills Gallery uses shortcodes to display images. First customise your gallery settings shortcode by clicking the &#8220;Album Display Shortcode Generator&#8221; link in the admin menu. Once ready, click &#8220;Generate Shortcode&#8221;. Your shortcode will be displayed directly below the button. Simply copy it and paste it directly in to any of your WordPress pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I create a Slideshow</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A shortcode is also used to display the slideshow. Click the &#8220;Slideshow Shortcode Generator&#8221; link in the admin menu, customise your requirements and click &#8220;Generate Shortode&#8221;. Then copy and paste your provided shortcode in to any page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have more than one gallery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Multiple galleries are supported with No Frills Gallery PRO (http://www.jamestibbles.co.uk/no-frills-gallery-pro). PRO allows unlimited galleries, along with a number of additional features to further customise your gallery for extra features.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
