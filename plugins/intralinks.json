But it&#8217;s already Q4, and in the meantime Q3 earnings have been posted and linked back to the Q2 post (maybe to update the status of some project).  Intralinks would show you, while readin the Q2 post, that the Q3 post had linked to it.</p>\n<h4>Some Technical Background</h4>\n<p>Multisite or not</p>\n<p>This was built with the idea of multisite in mind, but will work just fine in single site.  What really matters is a set of content that has relevant links within it.  Think of Intralinks as representing the graph (as in edges and nodes) of your content.</p>\n<p>= WordPress.com</p>\n<p>I originally wrote this to run on WordPress.com with an ElasticSearch index and data stored in Memcached.  I adapted it to use normal database queries and Mark Jaquith&#8217;s excellent WP TLC Transients plugin.</p>\n",
