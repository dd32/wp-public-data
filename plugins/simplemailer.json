You can find the SimpleMailer form widget on <strong>Appearance » Widgets</strong> page in your WordPress dashboard. Go ahead and add SimpleMailer widget into your right sidebar area. If you visit your website now, you will be able to see the contact form widget in the sidebar on your page. Note that your WordPress theme should support the widget areas.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to display SimpleMailer form on a specific page is to use Shortcode. For instance, the following Shortcode in the body of a post or page would add contact form to that post or page: <strong>[simplemailer]</strong></p>\n<p>And the third option can be used to display the form anywhere you want in your theme files. To do this, simply add the function <strong>getForm(); ?&gt;</strong>  to one of your theme PHP files.</p>\n<h4>Configuring SimpleMailer</h4>\n<p>As mentioned before, SimpleMailer supports SMTP by default, the checkbox <strong>Enable SMTP</strong> must be activated.</p>\n<p>Now, fill in the child input fields below this checkbox to complete the SMTP settings.</p>\n<p>A valid configuration for a Gmail account could look something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable SMTP: Checked</li>\n<li>SMTP Host name: smtp.gmail.com</li>\n<li>SMTP Port: 25</li>\n<li>Encryption: START_TLS</li>\n<li>SMTP username: fake.user@gmail.com</li>\n<li>SMTP password: your_password</li>\n<li>SMTP Debug: 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to use the PHP <strong>mail()</strong> function instead, just deactivate the <strong>Enable SMTP</strong> checkbox. The entries in the child input fields below are then irrelevant.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the settings page you will find the Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reCaptcha</a> configuration. To start using reCAPTCHA, you need to sign up for an API key pair for your site. You then insert these into the corresponding input fields. Please also note that the PHP cURL extension has to be installed on your server for reCAPTCHA to work.</p>\n<p>All other settings are self-explanatory.</p>\n<h4>Advanced settings for advanced users</h4>\n<p>Advanced configuration settings are managed within the <strong>config.php</strong> file. By default, however, there is no config.php file in your plugin installation directory, you have to create this file first, as follow. The directory <strong>/wp-content/plugins/simplemailer/</strong> contains a <strong>custom.config.php</strong> file. You will need to make a copy of the custom.config.php file and name it config.php, that one will take priority over default SimpleMailer settings.</p>\n",
