        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want to disable a link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say there is incorrect information in the file, or there is an updated version, now you can disable the link sent out, shared, published and send out a new one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are these files searchable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The asset sets are blocked from being searchable in WordPress. This means that global searches of the site will not bring up any of the uploaded assets. This does not block search engines from finding them if they are linked to from someplace else. But it does make finding files harder if you do not have a direct link to the file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I upload a bunch of files and share them all with one link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Assets Manager generates a page that contains all of the links in the asset set. This page can then be shared. Note: if you have disabled or expired files they will not be listed on this page, if a file is &#8220;secure&#8221; and the visitor is not logged in the file link will not appear as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I reorder the list of files on the public facing assets set page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, just drag and drop. No need to save. All reordering happens via AJAX automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work with nginx?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, in some installs you may need to add this to your conf file, I needed this to serve images correctly:<br />\n    location ~ ^/asset/(.*)$ {<br />\n        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;<br />\n    }</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about foo bar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Answer to foo bar dilemma.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
