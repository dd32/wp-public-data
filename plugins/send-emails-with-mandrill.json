        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20a%20mandrill%20api%20key%3F'>\nWhy do I need a Mandrill API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to use this plugin, you have to provide one of your Mandrill API keys. That&#8217;s currently the only way we can get access to your Mandrill account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20mailchimp%20account%3F'>\nDo I need a MailChimp account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. If you aren&#8217;t currently on a MailChimp Monthly Plan, you&#8217;ll first need to upgrade or switch to a Monthly Plan. Once you have upgraded you can follow the steps <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/help/add-or-remove-mandrill/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> to add Mandrill to your account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20all%20emails%20routed%20through%20mandrill%3F'>\nAre all emails routed through Mandrill?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We try to send every single email sent through your WordPress installation. We also try to process your headers and attachments.</p>\n<p>If the sending fails for any reason, the plugin will try to send it again using the WordPress wp_mail function.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20to%20send%20some%20of%20my%20emails%20using%20the%20native%20wp_mail%28%29%20function%3F'>\nWhat if I need to send some of my emails using the native wp_mail() function?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the mandrill_payload filter and add a new parameter called &#8216;force_native&#8217; to the $message variable, and set it to true:</p>\n<p>$message[&#8216;force_native&#8217;] = true;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20emails%20are%20broken%20and%20show%20weird%20css%20code'>\nMy emails are broken and show weird CSS code\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In version 1.09, we added a setting that allows you to tell the plugin if you want to replace your line feeds by <br />. Try playing with that switch.</p>\n<p>If it works for certain emails but doesn&#8217;t work for others, you might want to modify this setting using the <strong>mandrill_nl2br</strong> filter. For example, if you don&#8217;t want to use this filter for the &#8220;forgot password&#8221; emails, add something like this to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file:</p>\n<p>function my_function($nl2br, $message) {<br />\n    if ( in_array(&#8216;wp_retrieve_password&#8217;, $message[&#8216;tags&#8217;][&#8216;automatic&#8217;]) ) {<br />\n        $nl2br = false;<br />\n    }<br />\n    return $nl2br;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;mandrill_nl2br&#8217;, &#8216;my_function&#8217;);</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20way%20to%20check%20what%27s%20going%20on%3F'>\nIs there any way to check what&#8217;s going on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If we couldn&#8217;t send your email through Mandrill, we&#8217;ll try to leave the Mandrill response in your server&#8217;s log so that&#8217;s your first stop.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you set the WP_DEBUG constant (defined in your wp-config.php file) to true, you&#8217;ll see some messages added by the plugin in key parts of the process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20getting%20an%20invalid%20api%20key%20message%20and%20i%27m%20sure%20my%20api%20is%20valid%21'>\nI am getting an Invalid API Key message and I&#8217;m sure my API is valid!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please verify the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That your API key is active (this can be viewed on the SMTP &amp; API Credentials page in your Mandrill account);</li>\n<li>That your web server has either cURL installed or is able to use fsock*() functions (if you don&#8217;t know what this means, you may want to check with your hosting provider for more details);</li>\n<li>That the domain name you&#8217;re using above is listed in the Sending Domains for your Mandrill account.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
