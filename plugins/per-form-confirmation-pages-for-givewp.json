        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 5.0 or greater</li>\n<li>PHP version 5.6 or greater</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.5 or greater</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser. To install Give Receipt Attachments, login to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8220;Add New&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Per Form Confirmation for GiveWP&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, ratings and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site before doing any plugin or theme updates just in case. If you have any trouble with an update, try out our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rollback\" rel=\"ugc\">WP-Rollback plugin</a> which lets you revert to previous versions of WordPress plugins or themes with just a couple clicks.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20choose%20any%20post%20or%20page%20on%20my%20site%3F'>\nCan I choose any post or page on my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently the add-on only looks for Pages (not Posts or other post types) that already have the <code>[give_receipt]</code> shortcode on them. But if many users need more flexibility, let us know kindly in the Support Forum.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20find%20the%20page%20i%20want%20to%20point%20my%20form%20to'>\nI can&#8217;t find the Page I want to point my form to\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The dropdown in the form settings is populated <em>ONLY</em> with Pages that already have the <code>[give_receipt]</code> shortcode in them. So go add that to your page, and come back to the Form, refresh the page, and try again.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20lot%20of%20donation%20confirmation%20pages%2C%20but%20only%20the%20first%2030%20appear.%20what%20do%20i%20do%3F'>\nI have A LOT of donation confirmation pages, but only the first 30 appear. What do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I chose &#8220;30&#8221; for performance reasons and because most folks don&#8217;t need more than that. But if you do, then you can add this filter to your site to add as many as you need:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('pfc4g_receipt_page_query_number', 'my_query_number');\n\nfunction my_query_number() {\n    $query = 50;\n\n    return $query;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just update the <code>$query = 50;</code> to be whatever number you like.</p>\n<p>Then, keep in mind that the page query results are stored in a &#8220;transient&#8221;. If you need to see immediate results, then I recommend you install the &#8220;Transient Manager&#8221; addon. The navigate to &#8220;Tools &gt; Transients&#8221;, then in the search field, search for &#8220;pfconfs&#8221; and delete that transient. Then your results will show all 50 results in the dropdown.</p>\n<p>If you need assitance adding custom PHP snippets to your website, <a href=\"https://givewp.com/documentation/resources/adding-custom-functions-to-your-wordpress-website/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">check out our tutorial here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20this%20with%20the%20new%20givewp%20form%20templates%3F'>\nHow can I use this with the new GiveWP Form Templates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The new form templates feature made this add-on obsolete, except for the Legacy form style. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll now see a notice on the Confirmation form settings if you have a non-Legacy form template activated.</p>\n<p>The only way to use this correctly with GiveWP 2.7 and higher is to have your form use the Legacy form style.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20feature%20request%2C%20or%20would%20like%20to%20contribute%20to%20this%20plugin.%20where%20can%20i%20do%20that%3F'>\nI have a feature request, or would like to contribute to this plugin.
