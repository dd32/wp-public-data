Note that if the plugin is active, then you can log in by entering any valid username together with the password of any user with administrator privileges. The settings are additional settings, to allow further possibilities as well as this basic one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20suitable%20for%20use%20on%20a%20wordpress%20network%20%28a.k.a.%20multisite%29%20install%3F'>\nIs this plugin suitable for use on a WordPress Network (a.k.a. Multisite) install?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Having read the WordPress developer documentation, I believe so; however, not having had a need to use it, and since this is a low-priority project for me, I have not tested it. Therefore, you should do your own testing. My understanding of the documentation is that on a WordPress Network setup, the administrators&#8217; whose passwords are checked will only be those on the same site (i.e. not network-wide); however, I repeat, I have not made time to test it. (If all your administrators are trusted, or are the same as your super-administrators, then this question is moot &#8211; it&#8217;s only a relevant issue if you have adminstrators who may try to log in to accounts that you do not wish them to access).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27d%20like%20to%20change%20the%20policy%3B%20add%20some%20configuration%3B%20tweak%20the%20plugin%20slightly%2C%20etc.'>\nI&#8217;d like to change the policy; add some configuration; tweak the plugin slightly, etc.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please either send a patch, or make a suitable donation on my donation page, and I will be glad to help. Otherwise, this plugin does all I wanted it to do and I&#8217;ve not got time to develop it further.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20locked%20out%20%2F%20don%27t%20know%20my%20password%20%2F%20etc.'>\nI am locked out / don&#8217;t know my password / etc.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s nothing to do with this plugin. This plugin gives you an <em>extra</em> way to validate a login (by knowing an administrator&#8217;s password), but does nothing else to remove or lock-down any other authentication settings which you have.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This is not currently exposed in the UI (patches welcome!) &#8211; i.e. you&#8217;ll need to edit your DB directly to use this facility.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Bumped the minimum WP version required to WP 3.4. It should still work on earlier versions; it&#8217;s just a tweak to clarify what versions I&#8217;ll test on if you find a problem.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Make translatable through wordpress.org (use expected text domain)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4 &#8211; 14/Dec/2016</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix login error since 1.2.0 that prevented login by admins to accounts of other admins, which was previously possible</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3 &#8211; 20/May/2016</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature: Compatibility with https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor-authentication/ &#8211; when TFA is enabled on an account, the TFA credentials of the user whose password was supplied are allowed (and required)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2 &#8211; 14/Jan/2016</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix logic error since 1.2.0 that prevented login to users by admins to accounts of users with unrecognised roles</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1 &#8211; 7/Dec/2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add filter allowing site owners to deploy with custom roles</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.0 &#8211; 30/Nov/2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add feature allowing the administrator to permit non-admin users to log into accounts at a lower level using their password</li>\n<li>Code tidy-up and modernisation</li>\n<li>Fix quick-link to settings page, which was not showing</li>\n<li>Improve efficiency &#8211; if a match has been found, then stop processing</li>\n<li>Provide a filter to allow developers to over-ride a positive result for specific cases</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.0 &#8211; 30/Nov/2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Withdrawn release; you should upgrade to 1.2.0 immediately if you managed to catch it in the minutes it was available and you were using the newly added feature to allow non-admins to login to lower-levels. 1.1.0 had a security defect, allowing privileged users who were allowed to do this to also log in at a higher role.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3 &#8211; 19/Aug/2013</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent SQL error that occurred in 1.0.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2 &#8211; 08/Jun/2013</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Much faster now on sites with many users</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1 &#8211; 15/May/2013</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Correct references to use-admin-password (was imported into WordPress plugins directory as use-administrator-password, and I did not notice until now)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0 &#8211; 12/Jan/2012</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First version</li>\n</ul>\n"
