        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>wp-stats-view-counter</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <em>Plugins</em> menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; View Counter to select post types to track.</li>\n<li>Use shortcode <code>[view-count]</code> or <code>get_post_meta( $post-&gt;ID, 'views', true );</code> to display views.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Which post meta key is used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default <code>views</code> is the key where the view counts are saved, but you can filter this with the filter <code>view_counter_meta_key</code>. So for example, if you wanted to change the meta key from <code>views</code> to <code>my-key</code>, you would use this in your functions.php file:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'view_counter_meta_key', 'my_view_counter_meta_key', 10, 1 );\n\nfunction my_view_counter_meta_key( $key ) {\n\n    return 'my-key';\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The plugin will check to make sure the new view count is greater than the old one before replacing, so there is some fallback to prevent it from overwriting previously saved views from other plugins also using the <code>views</code> post meta key.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I display the views?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either using <code>get_post_meta( $post-&gt;ID, 'views', true );</code> or the shortcode <code>[view-count]</code>.</p>\n<p>The shortcode can also accept before and after parameters, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>[view-count before=\"Views: \"]\n[view-count after=\" views\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>And keep in mind that shortcodes can be activated using <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">do_shortcode()</a> if you have having troubled getting it to work:</p>\n<pre><code>echo do_shortcode( '[view-count]' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How often does it update the views?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every 3 hours an entry is accessed, the plugin will check the WordPress.com Stats view count and update locally. The delay is to ensure we don&#8217;t overload the WordPress.com Stats API.</p>\n<p>This will be unnoticeable to the average visitor because it&#8217;s unlikely they are sitting on your site waiting for the views to update, like you might be.</p>\n<p>Unless you have an extremely active site, there isn&#8217;t really much reason for the check to be more frequent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the update time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you really want to, you can! Use the following filter:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'view_counter_transient_expiration', 'my_view_counter_transient_expiration', 10, 1 );\n\nfunction my_view_counter_transient_expiration( $hours ) {\n\n    return 2; // time in hours\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
