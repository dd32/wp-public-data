        "description": "<p>Provides a simple method to add one or more sliders to your website. Makes use of the outstanding jQuery Cycle plugin from http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ and provides some options to take advantage of the features of jQuery Cycle.

Create posts of that type and add a featured image to each post and Multi Slider will automatically display the images wherever you place the slider. Slides can be either images (set as featured images) or text (anything in the post content box).</p>\n<p>The sliders can be placed anywhere you wish via the mslider_show_slide() function, the [mslider] shortcode, or theme widgets.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What is a slider?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sliders define your slide collection. Say you want a rotating slide in your homepage header and another in your sidebar. These would be two different sliders, each with their own slides.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I only see Multi-Slider in the dashboard?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Under the Multi-Slider menu, make sure you add new sliders. Once you have created a slider, you will see it in the dashboard as a custom content type.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add a new slide?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add a slider in the Multi-Slider menu, then in the dashboard you should see the slider as a custom-content type. For instance, if you create the slider &#8220;Property Slideshow&#8221;, this will show up as a menu in your dashboard sidebar. Under the menu for the desired slider, select Add New Slide and go from there.</p>\n<p>Add a featured image if you want the slider to transition through pictures. If you want the picture to point to a link, add the link in the custom link area. If you want this to be text, put any markup desired in the post content area. To specify the order of your slides, use the Slide Position box on the right.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the slider code in my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The function is mslider_show_slide($mslider_slug, $mslider_return_output) $mslider_slug should be whatever slug you defined for that slider, and $mslider_return_output is an optional boolean: should the slider return the display code, our output it? By default, the slider outputs the code. Pass true to have it return the display code instead.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
