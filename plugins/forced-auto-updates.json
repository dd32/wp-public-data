There is no settings page.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Can’t I get the same effect with a single line of code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, here it is: <code>add_filter( 'automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout', '__return_false', 1 );</code></p>\n<p>That’s all this plugin does. Hosting it here just provides another way of applying that line of code, but if you prefer another method, feel free to use that and disregard this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I need more granular control to my auto updates?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several plugins you can use instead. For example, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/update-control/\" rel=\"ugc\">Update Control</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-updater/\" rel=\"ugc\">Advanced Automatic Updates</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/\" rel=\"ugc\">Easy Updates Manager</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin will always be option-free and only facilitate automatic background updates of minor WordPress releases.</p>\n<p>And keep in mind, despite the word “minor,” they can include critical security vulnerability fixes in WordPress core.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I tell if my auto updates will work, before a minor release is pushed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use a plugin by the WordPress team called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-tester/\" rel=\"ugc\">Background Update Tester</a>.</p>\n<p>It will warn you if there’s any reason an automatic background update would not apply.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If my WordPress site always applies automatic background updates, do I need this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. You only need it if you’re using version control system like Git or Subversion.</p>\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-tester/\" rel=\"ugc\">Background Update Tester</a> plugin to confirm though.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
