Similarly for any binary string of length at most 23.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Why is there a length limit of 23?</h4>\n<p>As you may know, there are 16,777,216 binary strings of length 24. It takes time to compute the complexity of all of these, and upload the results to the database. In short, we had to stop somewhere and in the current version that somewhere is length 23.</p>\n<h4>Why would I install this plugin?</h4>\n<p>It is not very useful yet, but I will probably add additional functionality such as shortcodes for drawing a diagram of a witnessing automaton for the complexity. The plugin is useful for blogging about nondeterministic automatic complexity.</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin work?</h4>\n<p>First the complexity is computed in Python and saved to SQL files. These files are then uploaded to a database. The complexity of a string like 0110 is then available as JSON data from an <a href=\"http://math.hawaii.edu/~bjoern/complexity-api/?string=0110\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API link</a>. The plugin itself just uses a simple PHP script to retrieve that data.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Very basic initial version providing only the [complexity string=&#8221;0110&#8243;] shortcode.</li>\n</ul>\n"
