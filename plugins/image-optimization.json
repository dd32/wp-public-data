Image Optimizer supports many popular formats, including  JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, and GIF.</p>\n<h4>REDUCED FILE SIZES FOR BOOSTED PERFORMANCE</h4>\n<p>Image Optimizer ensures faster loading times, enhanced user experience, and overall boosted website performance, by reducing the size of your website’s images resulting in improved Core Web Vitals and search engine rankings. With the Image Optimizer’s exceptional capabilities and unique algorithms, you can fine tune images and reduce their file sizes while retaining quality with lossless or lossy compression.</p>\n<p>This plugin requires a connection to an active Elementor account in order to identify the user and provide the user with the purchased service. This connection is triggered manually by the user via the plugin&#8217;s settings panel.<br />\nThis plugin uses a 3rd party service operated by Elementor, which accepts a standard image in JPG, PNG, GIF or WEBP format and returns a web optimized image based on the selected settings. This flow is triggered by the user or automatically (based on the selected plugin settings) on compatible image upload or by manually initiating optimize process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-product-page/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image Optimizer</a> | <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-free-trial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Try It Now</a> | <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-term-and-conditions/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a></p>\n<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Image formats supported</strong> include JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF and GIF.</li>\n<li><strong>Works in the background</strong>: The only plugin in the category that optimizes your images in the background, without you having to stay on the page during optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>Resize large images</strong>: The user can select the maximum pixel width in which images will be created if they exceed the dimension selected.

Easily configure the plugin to scale or compress your images on-demand, or automatically have them triggered as they are being uploaded. Or, if you have a large number of images already uploaded, the bulk optimization feature allows you to resize and/or compress your entire library of existing images in just a few clicks.</p>\n<h4>2 COMPRESSION LEVELs</h4>\n<p>With Image Optimizer’s advanced algorithms, you can compress images and reduce their file size at the level that makes the most sense for you. We offer 2 types of compression where images will be processed, giving you the perfect balance of compression and quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossless Compression</strong>: Lossless compression reduces image file sizes without sacrificing or diminishing the quality of your images. This type of compression reduces file sizes by removing unused or unnecessary data so that no image details are lost along the way.  Hence, you are able to reduce the file size and still maintain the quality of your image.</p>\n<p><strong>Lossy Compression</strong>: Lossy compression performs maximum compression resulting in lightweight images and smaller file sizes. It reduces image size by removing image data that is generally invisible to the human eye and minimizes any compromise in image quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Convert to WebP and AVIF</strong>: Convert images to the slimmer WebP or AVIF formats for even better optimization with a 25-30% savings over JPEG and PNG. Most browsers support WebP, however if they don’t, you can have fallback versions of the image available in the same format as the original image.</p>\n<p>By tailoring compression to the level you need, your visitors will enjoy faster load times, improved responsiveness, and a seamless browsing experience. Our approach also enables your website to rank higher in search results. Since a search engine&#8217;s ranking is heavily influenced by speed, user experience, and Core Web Vitals, Image Optimizer by Elementor is an invaluable tool for any website, especially one that’s abundant with images.</p>\n<h4>RESOURCES AND SUPPORT</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To learn more about Image Optimizer, go to the Elementor <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-help-center/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Help Center</a>.</li>\n<li>If you have any more questions or need support, simply <a href=\"https://go.elementor.com/wp-repo-description-tab-io-contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20image%20optimizer%20for%20any%20of%20my%20wordpress%20websites%3F'>\nCan I use Image Optimizer for any of my WordPress websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. Image Optimizer by Elementor is a stand-alone WordPress plugin that can be used to optimize images for any or all of your WordPress websites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20to%20optimize%20images%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nWhy do I need to optimize images on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Image optimization can significantly improve your website&#8217;s loading time, which is crucial for user experience and SEO. It reduces the size of your images without compromising their quality, leading to faster page load times and better performance scores.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20consider%20image%20optimizer%20by%20elementor%3F'>\nWhy should I consider Image Optimizer by Elementor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is a modern approach that is designed to do all the “heavy lifting” of converting and compressing images on a dedicated server, so your own server won’t suffer from any downtime or the need to keep the tab open. It offers on-the-fly optimization, WebP and AVIF conversion, and other features tailored to WordPress users&#8217; needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20original%20version%20of%20my%20images%20be%20lost%20after%20compression%3F'>\nWill the original version of my images be lost after compression?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, The Image Optimizer plugin will save both the original and the compressed versions of your images. You can always restore the original image if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20consider%20converting%20my%20images%20to%20webp%20or%20avif%3F'>\nWhy should I consider converting my images to WebP or AVIF?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WebP and AVIF are modern image formats  that provide superior lossless and lossy compression. They can  significantly reduce the file size of images,  leading to faster website load times. Most web browsers today support these format, but if they don’t &#8211; the original backup will be used.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20choose%20which%20images%20to%20compress%3F'>\nCan I choose which images to compress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! You can either compress images in bulk, compress specific image files individually, or automatically compress upon image upload.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20exif%20metadata%20of%20images%20removed%3F'>\nIs the EXIF metadata of images removed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>EXIF data can be removed if you choose so in the settings page. Best practice for better image optimization would be to remove EXIF metadata.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20re-optimize%20images%3F'>\nIs it possible to re-optimize images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By changing the requested level of optimization in the settings page, you can re-optimize all images at once. In addition, at any point in time, you can reoptimize any of your images individually; whether after restoring the original, making changes to the optimization settings, or for any other reason.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20support%3F'>\nDo you offer support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the Elementor team offers full support for image optimization questions.
