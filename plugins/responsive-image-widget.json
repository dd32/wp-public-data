Intended to make adding images (whose proportions are important) to sidebar areas easier for non-technical users who would have trouble using the text widget to insert images into the sidebar.</p>\n<p>One of its key features is the fact that it allows proportional adjustment on the fly, so the user can easily change the proportion of the image inside of WordPress, instead of needing to resize the image in an editor (a problem for many users who do not have a lot of experience resizing/cropping images.)  Basically, it creates a frame for an image rather than adding an image directly, and the frame size can be set before the image is added, much like in Adobe inDesign, where frames can be laid out and then have pictures inserted into them.</p>\n<p>It takes a title, image URL, ratio and target link URL. It outputs a rationally proportional div with the image set as a background. Using the CSS background-size and background-position properties, the image always fills the whole space and remains centered.</p>\n<p>Note: the image <em>always</em> fills the width of its container.  If the widget/widget area where the image is placed is large, the image will appear large.</p>\n",

The image is gigantic and/or pixelated!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The image <em>always</em> fills 100% of the containing widget it is in.
