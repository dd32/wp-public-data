        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use this plug-in to run a competition?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple. Set up a Contact Form 7 form. Then set up a new page/post with details of the competition, and be sure to include your Contact Form 7 form on this page/post. Finally, use this plug-in to set up the competition entry collection, by assigning the Contact Form 7 form to a new competition.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are competition entries collected?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using Contact Form 7 forms. This plug-in let&#8217;s you assign any number of Contact Form 7 forms to competitions, and turn them into competition entry collection forms. Simply set up a form as usual, create a Competition page which also contains the form, and start collecting entries.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What data can I collect on a competition form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The beauty of this plug-in is that you can choose any Contact Form 7 fields for your entry form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I see my entries?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plug-in has an &#8216;entries&#8217; screen, filterable per competition. You can view all entries by date, delete entries, and export entries to CSV.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can an entry be made multiple times?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plug-in does not allow multiple entries from the same email address, so you can be sure of a fair competition. However if you are not collecting an email address on your entry form, then an entry can be made multiple times.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I select a winner?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plug-in features a &#8220;Pick me a winner&#8221; button, which will choose a winner at random from entries to your competition. You can also specify entry dates that the winner must be selected between, and add criteria based on the data collected (useful if you are asking a question, and need a correct answer to win).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need Contact Form 7 to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plug-in uses Contact Form 7 (a great Wordress plug-in for creating web forms) to collect entries. Please install Contact Form 7 to use this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin support file uploads?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this plugin does not capture uploaded files</p>\n</p>\n\n",
