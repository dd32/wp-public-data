It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It comes preconfigured.</strong><br />\nWith The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you&#8217;re not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Setup guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It helps you optimize your metadata.</strong><br />\nWe made the only SEO plugin that follows Google&#8217;s webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It creates a beautiful overview.</strong><br />\nOn your post overview pages, you&#8217;ll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse cursor. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It includes exceptional support.</strong><br />\nWe don&#8217;t outsource our support. We&#8217;re here for you. Feel free to drop by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/\" rel=\"ugc\">our support forums</a> at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It leaves no room for errors.</strong><br />\nWe focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don&#8217;t. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won&#8217;t steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It remains genuine and pure.</strong><br />\nWe built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn&#8217;t be a billboard for our branding. We won&#8217;t ever change this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It improves search presence.</strong><br />\nThe SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search via structured data. It also automatically generates titles and descriptions according to Google&#8217;s guidelines and quickly helps search engines find the website&#8217;s latest changes via the built-in optimized sitemap.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It makes social sharing easy.</strong><br />\nThe SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they&#8217;re shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and WhatsApp.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It feels more than accessible.</strong><br />\nWe handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It protects you from mistakes.</strong><br />\nThe SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It follows best-practices and beyond.</strong><br />\nThe biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress&#8217;s API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It has developers at heart.</strong><br />\nWe encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin.

This means that we don&#8217;t even put the name &#8220;The SEO Framework&#8221; anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you&#8217;ve used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Incognito extension</a>.</p>\n<h3>Behind the screens</h3>\n<p>The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software is fast, nimble, responsive, and should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.</li>\n<li>It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.</li>\n<li>It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don&#8217;t send a 404 response.</li>\n<li>It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.</li>\n<li>It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t use them; only, they won&#8217;t show them in their search results.</li>\n<li>It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<p><strong>The SEO Framework supports:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internationalization through WordPress.org.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20the%20seo%20framework%20free%3F'>\nIs The SEO Framework free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads, tracking, bloat, or nags!<br />\nThis plugin is slim yet all-inclusive. It&#8217;s 100% freeware, not crippleware.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20premium%20version%3F'>\nIs there a premium version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.</p>\n<p>However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Extension Manager plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20no%20analytics%2C%20tracking%2C%20or%20404%20monitoring%3F'>\nWhy is there no analytics, tracking, or 404 monitoring?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SEO experts that use advanced tools such as Ahrefs, SEMrush, Screaming Frog, and Google Analytics prefer using The SEO Framework because it doesn&#8217;t try to do their job haphazardly.</p>\n<p>To correctly analyze your website, it must be done from the outside. If we load these features on your site, bad robots will cause thousands of false positives that fill your database with useless information that doesn&#8217;t apply to search engines. We refrain from this because it won&#8217;t ever help you anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20feature%20request%2C%20a%20question%2C%20or%20found%20a%20bug.'>\nI have a feature request, a question, or found a bug.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please visit <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription\" rel=\"ugc\">the support forums</a> and kindly tell us about it.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll try to get back to you within a week.

Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational. Gray is undefined or unprocessable.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20sitemap%20doesn%27t%20contain%20categories%2C%20images%2C%20etc.'>\nThe sitemap doesn&#8217;t contain categories, images, etc.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.</p>\n<p>If a visitor can&#8217;t find a page, then why would a search engine? Don&#8217;t rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website&#8217;s usability.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Extension Manager</a>. It brings extensions, like <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Articles</a>, that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20sitemap%20contains%20unwanted%20links.'>\nThe sitemap contains unwanted links.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the <code>noindex</code> option for it. This option will also remove the page from search engine result pages.</p>\n<p>If the link shouldn&#8217;t be in the sitemap because it&#8217;s meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.<br />\nYou should tell the author to check out the &#8220;<code>public</code> and <code>rewrite</code> post type arguments.&#8221; The plugin or theme author should know what that means.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the &#8220;General SEO Settings&#8221; under &#8220;Exclusions.&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20focus%20keywords%20included%3F'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t focus keywords included?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google warns</a> about the keyword stuffing approach implemented by some other SEO plugins. It forces users to write unnatural content, and it can have adverse effects on your site&#8217;s ranking.</p>\n<p>Modern search engines use AI to understand the context of your articles. This means that as long as you write relevant content, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about keywords.</p>\n<p>However, we implemented the same API Google uses to help you find appropriate synonyms and inflections for your keywords. This functionality is part of our premium suite of extensions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20the%20application%2Fld%2Bjson%20scripts%20do%3F'>\nWhat do the application/ld+json scripts do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers that tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.</p>\n<p>They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you&#8217;re connected to, and what page structure you&#8217;re using. This is also referred to as <strong>structured data</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20display%20breadcrumbs%3F'>\nHow do I display breadcrumbs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SEO Framework outputs hidden breadcrumbs for search engines to find via its Schema.org settings.</p>\n<p>You can also output these breadcrumbs visually in your theme by <a href=\"https://kb.theseoframework.com/?p=212\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">using a shortcode</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

We also added seconds to timestamps, resolved issues pertaining to the number 0, and remotely <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=4234\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fixed another compatibility issue in Polylang</a>.</p>\n<h3>5.0.4</h3>\n<p>This tiny update <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=4215\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">addresses an issue</a> that affected detection of the assigned blog page.</p>\n<h3>5.0.3</h3>\n<p>This minor update fixes compatibility with Polylang Pro.

We also improved the calculation of primary terms with child terms and how breadcrumbs handle post type archives. And again, we <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=4174\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">improved the performance</a>.</p>\n<h3>5.0.1</h3>\n<p>This minor update fixes issues our community found after the release of TSF v5.0.0. We also <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=4158\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">improved the performance</a>.</p>\n<h3>5.0.0 &#8211; Apex</h3>\n<p><em>We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts. &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3Dpos%3D17%3Asection%3D4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aristotle</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Release highlights</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There&#8217;s a brand-new relational Schema.org structured data generator.</li>\n<li>We added a new shortcode (and function) for breadcrumbs to put in your templates.</li>\n<li>You can now select a preferred Twitter Card type for every post, term, and custom post type.</li>\n<li>Do you fancy the SEO Bar but find it distracting?

Many features and tweaks weren&#8217;t possible because those would&#8217;ve created bugs or made maintenance impossible. In v5.0, we overhauled everything while keeping in mind the future. In doing so, we managed to ascend to a new apex, and we can now see the next summit ahead.</p>\n<p>Its code is unrecognizable, yet somehow very familiar. TSF v5.0 &#8220;Apex&#8221; is just the beginning of what comes next, and it won&#8217;t be downhill from here.</p>\n<p><strong>New breadcrumb shortcode</strong></p>\n<p>You can now use shortcode <code>&#091;tsf_breadcrumb&#093;</code>. This shortcode is meant to be implemented in your theme and will output the current breadcrumb. It will listen to your meta title settings. You can learn more about its syntax in our <a href=\"https://tsf.fyi/kb/a/212\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base about the Breadcrumb shortcode</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Important for developers</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We refactored the entire codebase in this update &#8212; over 1.20 million characters were written, and over 0.87 million were removed.</li>\n<li>The code counts <strong>1229 registered changes</strong>; we added over 70 new classes, 220 new methods, 20 new filters, and a shortcode.</li>\n<li>For the main object, <code>tsf()</code>, we deleted 19 classes, deprecated 388 methods and 1 property, and deleted 110 methods and 10 properties.</li>\n<li><code>uid</code> is now an accepted custom query parameter for almost all meta-generator methods. If your custom filters for TSF act odd on profile pages, <a href=\"https://tsf.fyi/support/tsf/new-topic\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reach out to us in the forums</a> and show us your code. <strong>We&#8217;ll fix it for you.</strong></li>\n<li>So, if you ever used the <code>the_seo_framework()</code> or <code>tsf()</code> function, you almost certainly will get a deprecation notice. If you need assistance resolving this, please <a href=\"https://tsf.fyi/support/tsf/new-topic\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open a new support topic</a> and <strong>show us your code</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New meta tag generator</strong></p>\n<p>TSF now generates all meta tags via a registry. You can alter the population of the registry via filters <code>the_seo_framework_meta_generator_pools</code> and <code>the_seo_framework_meta_generators</code>, and you can modify the final registry via filter <code>the_seo_framework_meta_render_data</code>. For that, you can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sybrew/272b746296114cd93c3320e9544a1618\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">find an example at Github</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>New Schema.org graph generator</strong></p>\n<p>We added a new Schema.org structured data generator to TSF. This generator supports every page, post, archive, and custom post type. We built it to be referential and expansive by generating an ID-based graph. For example, if you refer to a Person once, their entity will be put right there, but if you refer to it again, it will use an ID-based reference. This keeps the output code neat and will not waste time generating an entity twice. You can filter it via <code>the_seo_framework_schema_graph_data</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Environment upgrade notes</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress 5.5 through 5.8 are no longer supported. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"ugc\">Over 75% of all WordPress sites</a> are using WordPress v5.9 or later.</li>\n<li>Newer versions of WordPress are faster, more reliable, and easier to work with &#8212; for both you and us.</li>\n<li>Supporting past versions takes time away that&#8217;s better used implementing new features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PHP 7.2 and 7.3 are no longer supported. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"ugc\">Almost 80% of all WordPress sites</a> are using PHP v7.4 or later.</li>\n<li>Newer versions of PHP are faster and more secure.

It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It comes preconfigured.</strong><br />\nWith The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you&#8217;re not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our <a href=\"https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Setup guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It helps you optimize your metadata.</strong><br />\nWe made the only SEO plugin that follows Google&#8217;s webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It creates a beautiful overview.</strong><br />\nOn your post overview pages, you&#8217;ll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse cursor. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It includes exceptional support.</strong><br />\nWe don&#8217;t outsource our support. We&#8217;re here for you. Feel free to drop by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/\" rel=\"ugc\">our support forums</a> at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It leaves no room for errors.</strong><br />\nWe focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don&#8217;t. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won&#8217;t steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It remains genuine and pure.</strong><br />\nWe built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn&#8217;t be a billboard for our branding. We won&#8217;t ever change this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It improves search presence.</strong><br />\nThe SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search via structured data. It also automatically generates titles and descriptions according to Google&#8217;s guidelines and quickly helps search engines find the website&#8217;s latest changes via the built-in optimized sitemap.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It makes social sharing easy.</strong><br />\nThe SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they&#8217;re shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and WhatsApp.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It feels more than accessible.</strong><br />\nWe handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It protects you from mistakes.</strong><br />\nThe SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It follows best-practices and beyond.</strong><br />\nThe biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress&#8217;s API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It has developers at heart.</strong><br />\nWe encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin.

Here are a few things it does behind the screens.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.</li>\n<li>It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.</li>\n<li>It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don&#8217;t send a 404 response.</li>\n<li>It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.</li>\n<li>It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t use them; only, they won&#8217;t show them in their search results.</li>\n<li>It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<p><strong>The SEO Framework supports:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internationalization through WordPress.org.
