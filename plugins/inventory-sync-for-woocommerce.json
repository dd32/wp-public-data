The inventory sync is going to work great between localhost websites or from the localhost to a remote site. Do not forget though that in order to create an application password on the localhost you need to set <code>WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE</code> to <code>local</code> in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20support%20two-directional%20inventory%20sync%3F'>\nDoes it support two-directional inventory sync?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
