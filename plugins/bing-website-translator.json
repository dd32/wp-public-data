Or if you want to exclude just a piece of text, you should wrap it within a HTML element with the <em>notranslate</em> style class, for instance:</p>\n<p>&lt;span class=&quot;notranslate&quot;&gt;Company name&lt;/span&gt;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20lot%20of%20plugins%2C%20will%20this%20plugin%20slow%20down%20my%20website%3F'>\nI have a lot of plugins, will this plugin slow down my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has a lot of options for you to customize it in the best possible way. All these options are saved in only one database record (yes, only one!). So you can rest assured it won&#8217;t slow down your website. Sometimes your website slows down when you use more and more plugins, because most likely they haven&#8217;t been built carefully. If you have some understanding of code, you can search for the <em>add_option</em> function within your plugins files to check on this matter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kind%20of%20support%20do%20you%20provide%3F'>\nWhat kind of support do you provide?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Responding to questions or problems regarding the plugin and its features.</li>\n<li>Fixing bugs and reported issues.</li>\n<li>Providing updates to ensure compatibility with new WordPress versions.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
