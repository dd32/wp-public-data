        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install jpegoptim and optipng on your server.</li>\n<li>Make sure that shell_exec() is active on your php.ini (it usually is).</li>\n<li>Upload the Slimage plugin to your WordPress plugins directory and activate it.</li>\n<li>Go to Settings / Media and check the &#8220;Enable Slimage&#8221; under &#8220;Compress images with Slimage&#8221;. If jpegoptim and optipng are installed on a custom path on your server, set that path under &#8220;Server path for jpegoptim &amp; optipng&#8221;.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20bulk%20regenerate%20already%20uploaded%20images%3F'>\nCan I bulk regenerate already uploaded images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. After you set your desired compression level on the plugin settings and save your changes, you can use the <code>wp media regenerate</code> command of the amazing <a href=\"https://wp-cli.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP-CLI</a> to regenerate the thumbnails. If you don&#8217;t feel comfortable with the command line and prefer to do it with a plugin, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/force-regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"ugc\">Force Regenerate Thumbnails</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-thumbnail-rebuild/\" rel=\"ugc\">AJAX Thumbnail Rebuild</a> have been tested and confirmed to play nice with Slimage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20different%20compression%20level%20for%20a%20specific%20image%3F'>\nCan I set different compression level for a specific image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. On each image edit page there is an option called &#8220;Override quality&#8221; which allows you to set your specific settings for that particular image. After changing your image settings, you still need to regenerate its thumbnails in order to run the compression.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20if%20i%20don%27t%20have%20jpegoptim%20or%20optipng%20installed%20on%20my%20server%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin if I don&#8217;t have jpegoptim or optipng installed on my server?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If neither jpegoptim nor optipng exist on your server, then the plugin won&#8217;t work. It won&#8217;t break your site, but it will not do anything (except from showing a related warning message on it&#8217;s settings page). If only one of the tools exists, then it will use it to process the specific type of images only (JPEGs for jpegoptim and PNGs for optipng).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20if%20%3Ccode%3Eshell_exec%28%29%3C%2Fcode%3E%20isn%27t%20enabled%20on%20my%20php.ini%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin if <code>shell_exec()</code> isn&#8217;t enabled on my php.ini?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin relies on the PHP <code>shell_exec()</code> function which is by default enabled by most hosting companies. If, in your case, it is disabled, you will not be able to use it. Again, this will not break your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20extra%20arguments%20can%20i%20set%3F'>\nWhat extra arguments can I set?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default extra arguments should be fine for most cases. If you really want to play around with it, though, there are various additional options for both <a href=\"http://www.kokkonen.net/tjko/src/man/jpegoptim.txt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jpegoptim</a> and <a href=\"http://optipng.sourceforge.net/optipng-0.7.7.man.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">optipng</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20pass%20the%20google%20pagespeed%20test%20with%20that%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I pass the Google Pagespeed test with that plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. But you might need to make some compromise on the quality of your photos. For JPEGs, setting the quality level to 50 or 60 is enough to pass the test on most cases. Depending on the complexity of the image, though, on some cases the quality loss might be visible to the naked eye so you might need to experiment with the level of quality.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
