The Decode Reply Tool is designed with Decode in mind, but the concept could work with most other blog-style themes. Results may vary, of course because I can&#8217;t test it against all other themes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to know how to code or edit my theme files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all! Decode is as simple as can be; you never need to look at a bit of code. Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/decode\" rel=\"ugc\">Decode theme</a>, was designed specifically with this plugin in mind, so if you use that theme, you are certainly spared from messing around in code and theme files.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
