        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20change%20the%20settings%3F'>\nWhere can I change the settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t come with any settings screen on purpose. Settings screen may be included in the future, depending on the feedback from the users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20test%2C%20if%20this%20plugin%20works%3F'>\nHow do I test, if this plugin works?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually, you can check if a post is served from the cache or not by looking at the headers info. So, create a new blog post or update an existing post and look for its headers info. For example, if your site is behind Varnish, you may see the &#8216;Age&#8217; information that is greater than zero. Uncached posts (for example, a search query such as example.com/s=test) will have &#8216;Age&#8217; as zero.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20custom%20post%20types%3F'>\nDoes this work with custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. But, there is a workaround that requires some coding skills (such as how to extend a plugin). Please see this support thread for an explanation&#8230; https://wordpress.org/support/topic/custom-post-types-313/ . Thanks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20this%20plugin%20slow%20down%20publishing%20and%20updating%20posts%3F'>\nWhy does this plugin slow down publishing and updating posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin needs to fetch the new / updated post thrice in real time over the internet, just after publishing or updating. This is expected to slow down the whole process!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
