So that you can make a separate registration &amp; login page for the B2B users, and once someone completes registration, you can assign them to desired user roles automatically or manually.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Wholesale Bulk Order Form</h3>\n<p>The Bulk Bulk Order Form feature allows you to create a wholesale area exclusively for B2B users. So, wholesale customers can order products in bulk or create &amp; save purchase lists to order them later. The bulk order form can be enabled on the customer&#8217;s &#8220;My Account Page,&#8221; or you can also create a separate bulk order page via shortcode.</p>\n<h3>Private Store and WooCommerce Product Visibility Control</h3>\n<p>WholesaleX also allows you to hide your Wholesale store from guests and B2C users like an ideal WooCommerce Private store plugin.

Guess what? WholesaleX has a built-in conversation system that can be added to the customer&#8217;s &#8220;My Account Page.&#8221; So they can send general queries to start communicating with the site&#8217;s admin.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Request a Quote</h3>\n<p>WooCommerce Request a Quote is an exciting feature of the built-in conversation system of WholesaleX.

Customers can add funds to their wallets and then use them while purchasing products from your store. And as a store admin can also manually add funds to any registered customer&#8217;s wallet.</p>\n<h3>Subaccounts</h3>\n<p>This feature allows the registered B2B customer to create subaccounts. So the subaccounts holder can place orders on behalf of the main account holder. The main account holder provides desired permission to subaccount holders to control what they can do and what they cannot.</p>\n<h3>Email</h3>\n<p>WholesaleX comes with ready email templates for various purposes.
