        "faq": "<p>How is CUABR different than WP Import/Export? WordPress&#8217; Import tool requires a properly working site in order to import its media files mentioned in the XML file (exported file). It is not always possible to restore<br />\na broken site using its exported XML file which was exported and saved when the site<br />\nwas in good shape.</p>\n<p>Is this plugin a migration tool? Can I move blogs/sites across servers? This plugin can migrate blogs from one multisite WP to another, provided that both<br />\nWordPress are the same version and CUABR is installed on both of them.<br />\nBut; still; care must be taken while attemptying this.</p>\n<p>Will this plugin work on a WordPress server installed on a MS-Windows host? No! This plugin works only on Linux/UNIX servers.</p>\n<p>Can I use this plugin to backup/restore a single site WordPress blog/site? No! The plugin works ONLY on multi-site WordPress installations.</p>\n<p>What does it take to set up a multi-site WordPress server? Actually not much! Why don&#8217;t you have a look at https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network<br />\nto see how easy it is to set up a multi-site WordPress Network.<br />\n(You&#8217;ll need root shell access to the server).</p>\n<p>Will you develop a multi-lingual version? No!</p>\n",
