        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20any%20theme%3F'>\nWill this Plugin work with any theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin is theme independent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20are%20the%20visits%20updated%3F'>\nHow often are the visits updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The data is almost live; visits are captured in real-time and our server is updated about every 3 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20not%20see%20any%20visits%20on%20the%20map%20directly%20after%20installation%3F'>\nWhy do I not see any visits on the map directly after installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an intentional set-up period of a few hours before any data is captured. This is necessary to ensure that your setup is complete before we start capturing data, so please be patient, it will be worth it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20increase%20the%20frequency%20of%20the%20visit%20updates%3F'>\nCan I increase the frequency of the visit updates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No updates are managed on the server side.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20any%20personal%20information%20captured%3F'>\nIs any personal information captured?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, while the visit IP is captured, this is not linked to an individual.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20additional%20features%20are%20offered%20from%20the%20leads5050.com%20site%3F'>\nWhat additional features are offered from the Leads5050.com site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Leads5050.com platform is used to process visit data and generate reports.

Our server uses your domain name / api licence combination to communicate with your site in order to capture and return visit data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20api%20licence%20capture%20any%20personal%20data%3F'>\nDoes the API licence capture any Personal data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there is no personal information sent when the API is registered. No personal information is captured by any of the plugin processes. An email and username is needed for registration on Leads5050.com. This is required for your login if you want view detailed reports on Leads5050.com.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20login%20information%20needed%20to%20access%20leads5050.com%3F'>\nWhy is login information needed to access Leads5050.com?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Leads5050.com is the custodian of your data and provides reports generated from this data.

Leads5050 cannot pull any information from your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20be%20installed%20on%20other%20content%20management%20systems%3F'>\nCan this plugin be installed on other content management systems?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but the installation is different. Information is provided on Leads5050.com, or you can contact us for more information on this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20referrers%3F'>\nWhat are referrers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When someone visits your site from a different site by clicking a link on the remote site, this remote site is the referrer. This could be a search engine, social media, a link on another site or a browser. Referrers are also known as back-links.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20referrer%20information%20help%20me%3F'>\nHow does this referrer information help me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Information about visitors to your site can help with Sales and Marketing by identifying the types of visits you receive, where these came from, which pages are visited etc. All of these are invaluable market insights.

This will refresh your page and the map will display. This usually only happens the first time that you load the plugin. Also, allow time for the first data points to be captured and processed for the reasons described above.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20gdpr-compliant'>\nIs the plugin GDPR-compliant\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes this plugin does not capture any personal information and cannot be linked to an individual. Any location information is anonymous and cannot be linked to an individual. Also, site owners have a legitimate interest in identifying the origin of visits to their site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
