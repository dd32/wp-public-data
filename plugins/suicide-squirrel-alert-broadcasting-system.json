This is a pretty simple Widget, but it requires that your server has simpleXML. simpleXML is turned on by default for (almost) any server running PHP5. Do you get a message about simpleXML? Why didn&#8217;t you say so!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is that all it does? Put up an ugly picture?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>NO! Not only does it put up an ugly picture, it sets the alt and title attribures of the picture as well! Optioinally, it links back to the Command Center Advisory page so your viewers will know what to do.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
