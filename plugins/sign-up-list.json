There are other plugins that offer far more complex features for sign-up lists. However, if people start using this plugin and need multiple concurrent lists, I will add support for that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20re-use%20the%20list%20once%20the%20sign-up%20has%20been%20completed%3F'>\nHow can I re-use the list once the sign-up has been completed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can reset the list from the admin interface to start from scratch. You may want to export the current list entries first before you do that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20send%20out%20emails%20automatically'>\nDoes the plugin send out emails automatically\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not yet. You will have to follow-up manually on people that signed-up. You can export the entries to a spreadsheet to make this easier. I will add emails features if there is demand for it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20duplicate%20email%20addresses%20allowed%3F'>\nAre duplicate email addresses allowed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is an option in the admin interface, so you can choose to allow or disallow duplicates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20translations%20available%3F'>\nAre there translations available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am Dutch, so I have created a Dutch translation.
