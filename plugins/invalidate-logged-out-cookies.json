        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this plugin invalidate my cookies if I logged in before the plugin was activated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin will only invalidate cookies that were created after activating the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work with non-standard auth cookies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely, no. This plugin is only meant to be used with the standard auth cookies that WordPress uses.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Known conflicts with other plugins</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin overrides the core <code>wp_validate_auth_cookie</code> function. This means that you can&#8217;t enable this plugin and another that also overrides the same function.</p>\n<p>This is a non-comprehensive list of other plugins that also override this function (and should not be used at the same time as this plugin):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/safer-cookies/\" title=\"Safer Cookies\" rel=\"ugc\">Safer Cookies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-ssl-secure-admin/\" title=\"Admin SSL\" rel=\"ugc\">Admin SSL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-26-and-bbpress-09-integration/\" title=\"WordPress 2.6+ and bbPress 0.9 cookie integration\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress 2.6+ and bbPress 0.9 cookie integration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/no-login/\" title=\"No Login\" rel=\"ugc\">No Login</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disclose-secret/\" title=\"Disclose-Secret\" rel=\"ugc\">Disclose-Secret</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/photoq-photoblog-plugin/\" title=\"PhotoQ Photoblog Plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">PhotoQ Photoblog Plugin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s also possible that if another plugin is overriding a related function (e.g. <code>wp_generate_auth_cookie</code>) that this plugin will not work correctly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I know if this plugin is properly overriding the &#8216;wp_validate_auth_cookie&#8217; function?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once activated, if this plugin is NOT overriding the function, then a message will be shown to admin users towards the top of every admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I can&#8217;t log in after activating this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply rename or delete the plugin so WordPress can&#8217;t find it. This step requires that you have access to the filesystem where WordPress is installed (via FTP, SFTP, etc).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a small chance that this might happen. It most likely happens because of an incompatibility with another plugin that also overrides one of the core <code>auth_cookie</code> functions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
