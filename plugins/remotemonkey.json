Always get an overview of your sites&#8217; most important information. Easily apply updates, manage backups or just check if the site is online &#8211; everything in one place.</li>\n<li>One-Click-Updates: BackupMonkey provides you an easy-to-use list of available core and extension updates &#8211; all in one place. And the best part: You can apply those updates directly from the BackupMonkey panel with just a single click.</li>\n<li>Security Audits: Our site audit checks a site for malware and potential hacks. This way you will receive fast feedback if a page is a security risk and can react immediately if necessary.</li>\n<li>Backup-Management: Save valuable time and automate your backup process with our weekly planner. Decide for yourself how often backups are created and on which days they should be tested. Freely configurable for your personal needs.</li>\n<li>Automated Backup Tests: BackupMonkey does not only create backups, using the award-wining AkeebaBackup extension, but also tests backups to make sure a working site can be restored – because an untested backup is not a backup at all.</li>\n<li>Maintenance-Reports: Make your services transparent to your customers with our automatically generated monthly reports. Customize your reports using your own company-logo and colours and present your work to the customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use our <a href=\"https://console.backupmonkey.io/#/register\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free trial</a> and the our tool yourself for 30 days free of charge.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />\n(at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
