This only works when the image is uploaded to the post. Images that are selected from the media library (previously uploaded elsewhere) when being featured are not &#8220;attached&#8221; to the post, and will not link back to the post in this widget.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='gallery%20display%20issues'>\nGallery Display Issues\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin relies on core and theme gallery markup and styling. If your theme does not display the gallery well, ask your theme author to implement support for the core gallery widget. You can also customize the display by adding additional CSS in the customizer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='hiding%20captions'>\nHiding Captions\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To hide captions, paste this CSS into the &#8220;Additional CSS&#8221; editor in the customizer:</p>\n<pre><code>.widget_featured_image_gallery_widget .gallery-caption {\n\n    display: none;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
