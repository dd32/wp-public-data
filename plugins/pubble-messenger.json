        "installation": "<p>There are two steps to installing the Pubble Messenger Live Chat plugin on WordPress:</p>\n<p>a. Install the Plugin on your site from the Plugin Section on WordPress (access from your Admin section). To do this, in your WP admin panel, navigate to: Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Search plugins &gt; Pubble live chat &gt; Install..</p>\n<p>Once installed, you will see a message:</p>\n<p>“You need to configure Pubble Messenger to add live chat on your website. Please configure your Pubble Messenger Live Chat.</p>\n<p>b. Create (or/Sign In to) your Admin account and App ID on Pubble.</p>\n<p>If you are NEW to Pubble, use <a href='https://www.pubble.io/deploy' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Let’s Deploy</a>. This option let’s you create your Pubble Team, Admin account and get your App ID. The last step outputs the APP ID. In the code snippet, copy the app ID (number): data-app-id=“00000”</p>\n<p>If you already have a Pubble account, use: <a href='https://www.pubble.io/signin' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sign in on Pubble</a>. Once signed in, you need to access the Pubble Admin section. Click the “Admin” icon bottom left of the Dashboard or include “/admin” in the url (https://yourteam.pubble.io/admin). Then click Apps &gt; Messenger. In the Deploy Code section, copy the app ID (number): data-app-id=“00000”</p>\n<p>So now that you have your APP ID, you can configure Pubble Messenger Live Chat on your website. To do this, in the wp-admin section, you should have a message on top “You need to configure Pubble Messenger to add live chat on your website. Please configure your Pubble Messenger Live Chat.”. Click the link and enter the App ID in the input box.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: Where do I respond the chats from my Website?<br />\nA: Chats will appear in your Pubble Dashboard. The Pubble Dashboard is available on Web (https://yourteam.pubble.io), Mac, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Q: Is Pubble free?<br />\nA: We offer a free account that includes 100 conversations per month with access to all of Pubble&#8217;s core features. You get full access to Pubble in all its glory. See: http://www.pubble.io/pricing</p>\n<p>Q: Is there a limit to the number of members that I can have in my Pubble team?<br />\nA: No. Your team can be as large as you need and there’s never an additional charge for adding more team members. There is no “per agent” fees.</p>\n<p>Q: What are Conversations?<br />\nA: Conversations are between your team and your customers. Conversations can start with an inbound question or a message that you push to your customers. Internal messages (Group chat / direct messages) do not count towards your conversations total.</p>\n<p>Q: Does Pubble integrate with SMS?<br />\nA: Yes we have SMS integration.  If a user supplies a phone number we can send them a notification of an agent&#8217;s reply directly to their phone.  SMS open rates are practically 100% making it an extremely attractive communication tool.</p>\n<p>Q: What is the Pubblebot?<br />\nA: He’s our cool little mascot. Or maybe it’s a she! Pubblebot’s job is to make you awesome. The more you teach the Pubblebot, the more he will help you. The Pubblebot takes care of automating the repetitive parts of the customer support process like answering FAQs and capturing customer’s contact details.</p>\n",
