Then you must access the panel and validate the bank account where the money for your fees will be deposited. To do this, once inside the platform, you must go to the left side menu, in the configuration section, and click on new authorisation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20for%20my%20account%20to%20be%20debited%3F'>\nHow long does it take for my account to be debited?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From the time your client pays you and it reaches your bank, it takes between 24-48 hours maximum, unless the payment is executed on the weekend, in which case, the payment will be processed on Monday and it would take at most 72 hours. In addition, the payment goes from the customer’s account to yours, we do not hold anything.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20then%20have%20a%20detailed%20report%20of%20the%20shipment%20made%3F'>\nDo I then have a detailed report of the shipment made?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, each month, under payments, you can see the payments sent, their status and you can print a receipt for each one. In addition, you can download the receipts-payments in an excel file in case you want to take them to your accounting program.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
