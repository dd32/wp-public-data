It was then released on the off-chance others might find it useful. Turns out, it had staying power. At the time of this release, there are about 195 more people using it than I expected.</p>\n<p>That brings us to version <code>1.0.0</code>. <em>All</em> functions from version <code>0.1.0</code> have been deprecated. The deprecated functions will still perform as they did in <code>0.1.0</code>, but they will throw a deprecation warning when using <code>WP_DEBUG</code>.</p>\n<p>If you were using the plugin as-is, with no custom functionality built on top, then you don&#8217;t need to do anything further. If you were using any of the functions/filters/hooks from version <code>0.1.0</code> for custom functionality, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/thebrandonallen/bp-block-users/wiki/Upgrading-to-1.0.0\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrading to 1.0.0</a> wiki page.</p>\n<p>Despite these major changes, the plugin should work the same or better than before!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bumped minimum required WordPress version to 4.3.0.</li>\n<li>Bumped minimum required BuddyPress version to 2.4.0.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhancements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>BP Block Users is now loaded as a BuddyPress component.</li>\n<li>The <code>Block User</code> terminology has been changed to <code>Block Member</code> on the front-end to be more consistent with BuddyPress terminology. Props joost-abrahams [<a href=\"https://github.com/thebrandonallen/bp-block-users/pull/4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GH#4</a>].</li>\n<li>Added a blocked users list table to <code>Users &gt; All Users</code> admin screen.</li>\n<li>Added WP-CLI commands. Enter <code>wp bp-block-users --help</code> in your terminal for usage details.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The next major version will require PHP 5.3+.</li>\n<li>Deprecated functions, filters, and actions will be removed in a future release. The target right now is version <code>1.3.0</code>. Upgrade any code you&#8217;ve written against version <code>0.1.0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Release date: 2015-09-22</li>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
