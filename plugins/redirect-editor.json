Here is our solution to that problem</p>\n<h3>1.7.4</h3>\n<p>new security feature</p>\n<h3>1.7.3</h3>\n<p>The security features working far better<br />\nRedirect editor should be improved, which should help those who have asked for improvements for site redirects to external domains.</p>\n<h3>1.7.2</h3>\n<p>made admin side redirects less strict due to application purposes.<br />\ncorrected bugs</p>\n<h3>1.7.1</h3>\n<p>deletes readme.html and deletes license.txt.<br />\nattempts to block install.php and wp-config.php. We do not hide wp-content/uploads/ as some people have legitimate reasons to going there.<br />\nExpect more updates soon, including a popular request for the redirect editor feature.</p>\n<h3>1.7</h3>\n<p>Hides license.txt, hides install.php readme.html, hides wp-config.php, hides wp-content/uploads/. All important areas of WordPress that need to be hidden.</p>\n<h3>1.6.2</h3>\n<p>Very  important update! We accidentally removed the form functionality in version 1.6.1 by accident. We deeply apologize. 1.6.2 has patched that.</p>\n<h3>1.6.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>removed access to windows live writer, really simply discovery among others for logged out users. </li>\n<li>Anyone logged in as contributor or higher can use windows live writer, RSD, etc. This does not impact anyone who uses third party writing tools as long as they login.</li>\n<li>Updated code to block wp-config from attackers,  thanks to some friends who work for Sucuri. Cheers! </li>\n<li>more features coming in 1.7 for security. Coming soon! </li>\n<li>More updated code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.6</h3>\n<p>deny attackers access to wp-config</p>\n<h3>1.5.1.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing an error in the redirect process that caused issues for a few sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.5.1</h3>\n<p>Update wasn&#8217;t part of our planned release schedule, but due to a report by @awestbha we fixed an issue affecting sites with logged in users that didn&#8217;t allow redirects if you were already logged in.</p>\n<h3>1.5.0</h3>\n<p>latest WP version along with some changes to the app. Since this is adopted code, we did change wp_redirect to wp_safe_redirect.<br />\n This is the last 1.4.x update you should expect before 1.5 is released.</p>\n<h3>1.4.3</h3>\n<p>Improved code and updated description of plugin. Expect more updates from https://planetzuda.com .</p>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<p>*Update immediately &#8212; security update.<br />\n*Plugin under new ownership by Planet Zuda, so the safety of redirect editor now is really good.<br />\n* This was removed for 10 months due to abandoned by prior owner.
