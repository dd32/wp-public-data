After a customer pays, their email address and name will be sent to the listmonk mailing list of your choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using listmonk as an open-source newsletter and mailing tool makes you less dependent on services like Mailchimp, costs less, and has no limits on the amount of emails you can send per month.</p>\n<h3>How to use this plugin</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Install this plugin through the WordPress plugin directory.</li>\n<li>Ensure you have access to a configured listmonk server. You can connect listmonk to email services like Amazon SES, which costs as little as $0.10 per thousand emails.</li>\n<li>Access the plugin&#8217;s settings page from your WordPress admin dashboard under Settings to enable and disable components and enter listmonk credentials.</li>\n<li>Determine the listmonk list ID you want to subscribe people to. See listmonk documentation for more details.</li>\n<li>Utilize WPForms, Contact Form 7, or a custom field on the WooCommerce checkout page to send subscriber data to listmonk.</li>\n<li>When using a custom field on the WooCommerce checkout page, you can input a text customers will see during checkout.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress website (latest version recommended);</li>\n<li>Accessible listmonk server over HTTPS (tested up to listmonk v3.0.0);</li>\n<li>WPForms or Contact Form 7 for form-based subscriptions;</li>\n<li>WooCommerce for checkout-based subscriptions; (classic checkout supported, block-based checkout experimentally supported).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>\n<p>For compliance purposes, this plugin records the IP address each subscriber and sends it to your listmonk server. Subscribers through WooCommerce checkout do not require double opt-in, unlike form-based subscriptions. API credentials are stored securely on your server with encryption for the password. Please note that this plugin does not have any form of rate-limiting, so it is your own responsibilty to use a CATCHPA when using i.e. WPForms, to limit the amount of fake subscriptions that could be sent to your listmonk server.</p>\n<h3>Suggestions, Bugs, and Contributions</h3>\n<p>For bugs or suggestions, please create an issue on GitHub. Contributions, especially from those knowledgeable in PHP and the listmonk API, are welcome.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>GNU General Public License v3.0. No commercial closed-source usage allowed.</p>\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n<p>Huge thanks to Kailash Nadh for creating listmonk!</p>\n<h3>Dependency on external services</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses two external services: (1) a listmonk server of your choice, for which you are solely responsible and (2) a link to <a href=\"buymeacoffee.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Buy me a Coffee</a> to voluntarily support the development of this plugin. See their privacy policy <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>. This plugin can be used without donating.

You can either host one yourself, or use easy and freely available services lika Pikapods or Railway.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20have%20a%20listmonk%20server%2C%20do%20you%20have%20any%20recommendations%20on%20how%20to%20set%20up%20listmonk%20easily%3F'>\nI don&#8217;t have a listmonk server, do you have any recommendations on how to set up listmonk easily?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Consider hosting listmonk on a user-friendly hosting service like <a href=\"https://www.pikapods.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pikapods</a>. Check out the <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/MaximilianKohler/e5158fcfe6de80a9069926a67afcae11\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub guide</a> by MaximillianKohler for more advanced tips on how to set up listmonk.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20enter%20my%20listmonk%20credentials%3F'>\nWhere do I enter my listmonk credentials?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the plugin&#8217;s settings, called &#8220;Integration for listmonk&#8221; under the Settings tab in WordPress. There you need to enable the components you want to use (form based and/or checkout based subscription) and fill in your credentials.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20my%20listmonk%20list%20id%3F'>\nWhere do I find my listmonk list ID?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on a mailing list you created in listmonk. On the upper corner it should display the ID.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20users%20have%20to%20do%20double%20opt-in%20after%20subscribing%20to%20a%20mailing%20list%3F'>\nDo users have to do double opt-in after subscribing to a mailing list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only if you use the form-based component of this plugin. For all users that subscribe to a mailing list via the WooCommerce checkout page, their email address is already assumed confirmed, because it is unlikely someone will pay for a product with another persons email address just to spam them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20security%3F'>\nWhat about security?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin encrypts your listmonk password before storing it in the WordPress database. Always make sure to choose long and unique passwords; this is your own responsibility.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20problem%20with%20listmonk%2C%20can%20you%20help%20me%20out%3F'>\nI have a problem with listmonk, can you help me out?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please submit an issue to the listmonk Github repository (I am not the maintainer of listmonk).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20form%20do%20i%20have%20to%20select%20when%20i%20use%20wpforms%3F'>\nWhat form do I have to select when I use WPForms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin only works with the default &#8220;newsletter&#8221; form, which has a first/last name field and an email field.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20the%20wpforms%20form%20id%3F'>\nWhere can I find the WPForms Form ID?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the shortcode of the form you created. It should be formatted like &#8220;wpforms id=100&#8221;, where 100 is the Form ID that you need to enter in the listmonk integration settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20form%20do%20i%20have%20to%20select%20when%20i%20use%20contact%20form%207%3F'>\nWhat form do I have to select when I use Contact Form 7?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the forms contains the fields &#8216;your-email&#8217; and &#8216;your-name&#8217; in order for this plugin to work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20the%20page%20id%20for%20the%20contact%20form%207%20integration%3F'>\nHow do I find the page ID for the Contact Form 7 integration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This refers to the page ID of the page you entered the Contact Form 7 shortcode on. If you edit that page in your WordPress admin panel, the url will contain for example &#8220;page=57&#8221;. That number you will need to enter in the listmonk integration settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20problem%20with%20this%20plugin%2C%20can%20you%20help%20me%3F'>\nI have a problem with this plugin, can you help me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I created this plugin in my free time. I may have time to help you, but no guarantees!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
