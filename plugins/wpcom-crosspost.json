        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;WP.com Cross-Post&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Configuration</h4>\n<p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; WP.com X-Post</strong> and fill in the Client ID and Secret. If you don&#8217;t have them, click on the button &#8220;Create WordPress.com App&#8221; to create an app on WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Save the changes. The button &#8220;Connect to WordPress.com&#8221; will appear. Click on it to connect your self-hosted site to WordPress.com and choose the blog you want to sync with.</p>\n<p>One hour after the first activation there will be the first sync.</p>\n",
