Removing or renaming that file will simply delete your filters without affecting Dashboad Cleaner settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20hiding%20an%20element%20and%20making%20it%20invisible%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between hiding an element and making it invisible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hiding will remove the element and the space it occupies; making it invisible will mask the element but will keep the space it occupies. Hiding the element is the preferrered method but in a few cases, it can wrongly alter the whole page layout.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='shall%20the%20filter%20be%20based%20on%20the%20exact%20attribute%20value%2C%20or%20can%20it%20be%20shortened%20%28i.e.%2C%20partial%20match%29%3F'>\nShall the filter be based on the exact attribute value, or can it be shortened (i.e., partial match)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Partial match is accepted but whatever value you enter, it must start and end on a word boundary (as opposed to a substring). For more details about this, see the contextual <em>Help</em> tab in Dashboard Cleaner Settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20field%20values%20case%20sensitive%3F'>\nAre field values case sensitive?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The attribute value is case-sensitive, the HTML element and attribute names aren&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill it slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Dashboard Cleaner runs only in the back-end section (admin dashboard) not the front-end, hence it won&#8217;t affect your visitors.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
