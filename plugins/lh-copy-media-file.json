To toggle the view from grid to list click the mode button in (usually in the top left hand corner). Then under each item you will see a Copy file link next to view.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Copy Media File, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However many plugins and themes are not well coded or don&#8217;t follow standards (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-copy-media-file/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-copy-media-file/</a>. I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
