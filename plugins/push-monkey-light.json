All the Push Monkey features are free and you don&#8217;t need to pay until you reach a certain readership. At the moment, once you pass 100 subscribers, we would recommend upgrading to a payed tier. If not, you can still use Push Monkey, just no new subscribers will be registered.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I purchase a paid plan?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only if the number of subscribers grows drastically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve installed the plugin, but something doesn&#8217;t seem to work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pop us an email, write us a message on <a href=\"getpushmonkey.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">getpushmonkey.com</a> or on live chat.
