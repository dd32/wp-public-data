This plugin (Add Role Site Manager) is meant to help you create a new role &#8216;Site Manager&#8217; (role ID: &#8216;site_manager&#8217;) out-of-the-box which you can assign to your client as the top management of the website, so to resolve the above concerns.</p>\n<p>The capabilities of the role &#8216;Site Manager&#8217; will be more than &#8216;Editor&#8217; and less than &#8216;Administrator&#8217; to cover your needs.
