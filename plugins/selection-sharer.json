Thanks a lot, Alex for the helpful tips there!<br />\nWhile we&#8217;re smashing bugs, smashed another one as well. Hope you like it!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we&#8217;re working heavily on a different plugin, which features this as part of a more sophisticated suite to help you generate leads from your website called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/inbound-rocket/\" rel=\"ugc\">Inbound Rocket</a>, be sure to check it out!</p>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Been popping out updates like there is no tomorrow ðŸ™‚ This one features LinkedIn support, so you can easily have your visitors share your content towards LinkedIn!</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>Now That&#8217;s What I Call an Update!</p>\n<p>Just when you thought you knew the Selection Sharer WordPress plugin, here comes a release that changes everything. Actually, the good stuff is the same now but there&#8217;s more of it. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Facebook support (This uses the Facebook share functionality. Facebook share functionality requires a Facebook App ID, be sure to include fb:app_id meta tag information otherwise the Facebook share button will not show)</li>\n<li>Better performance! Not that I&#8217;m saying that it wasn&#8217;t performing before. But it is definitely working faster now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks a lot for the support, I got some more amazing things coming in 2015.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release</li>\n</ul>\n"
