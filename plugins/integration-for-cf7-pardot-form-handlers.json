Double-check you made no mistakes (case sensitive). Another common issue: please do not mark any fields as required in the form handler (besides the email address). If a field is marked as required and missing from the form or query, the submission will be ignored by Pardot. So better to miss 1 value instead of the whole submission.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20send%20a%20different%20value%20to%20pardot%20then%20the%20one%20shown%20in%20the%20form%2C%20how%20do%20i%20do%20this%3F'>\nI want to send a different value to Pardot then the one shown in the form, how do I do this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ContactForm7 supports <a href=\"https://contactform7.com/selectable-recipient-with-pipes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pipes</a> to define a different value to be used in emails as on the front-end. This plugin extends on that feature and can use the raw value after the pipe character as the value for Pardot. Just add the attribute <code>use-raw-values</code> to your form tag. Please use with care: this will reveal the raw values to the public. These pipe values can be used for drop down menus, radio buttons and checkboxes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20implementation%20is%20still%20not%20working%2C%20what%20can%20be%20the%20cause%3F'>\nThe implementation is still not working, what can be the cause?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure to match the HTTP/HTTPS protocol of the form handler with your website. If your website uses a secure connection over HTTPS your form handler should use that too in order to work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20some%20submissions%20not%20coming%20through%3F'>\nWhy are some submissions not coming through?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can be caused by an adblocker or tracking blocker used by the visitor of your website. To minify the chances of this to happen, please use a custom <a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.pardot_admin_first_party_cookie_add_tracker_domain.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tracker domain</a> for your Pardot links.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20this%20pardot%20you%20are%20talking%20about%3F'>\nWhat is this Pardot you are talking about?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pardot is the B2B marketing automation of <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Salesforce</a>, also known as Account Engagement. Pardot allows you to follow-up on prospects and as it is part of the Salesforce suite, it can easily transform your prospects into leads.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
