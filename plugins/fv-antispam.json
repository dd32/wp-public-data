        "description": "<p>FV Antispam is a powerful and simple antispam plugin. FV Antispam moves any spambot (machine written) comments directly to the trash and allows Akismet to just deal with human spam.<br />\nWhat makes FV Antispam better than any other solution is the very low CPU load. FV Antispam will not burden your hosting or slow down your server. Other effective antispam plugins may get your hosting cancelled. Really. It happened to us, that&#8217;s why we wrote FV Antispam.</p>\n<h4>The Problem</h4>\n<p>Our studies on our own sites have shown that for every 50 human spam comments a popular weblog will have up to 10,000 machine generated spam. With FV Antispam, Akismet finally becomes a usefull tool again allowing you to browse your spam folder and pull out any Akismet false positives. If you use just Akismet, bots fill your whole spam folder with thousands of comments. It&#8217;s nearly an impossible task to browse through hundreds or thousands of comments to find one or two false positives.</p>\n<h4>Why choose FV AntiSpam?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Dead simple. Just install, turn on and go. FV Antispam doesn&#8217;t need configuration. No redundant and dangerous options or cryptic choices.</li>\n<li>Effective.</li>\n<li>Reliable.</li>\n<li>Zero false positives.</li>\n<li>Virtually no CPU server load.</li>\n<li>Works with the most powerful WordPress form processor &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/filled-in/\" rel=\"ugc\">Filled In</a>. Utilizes Akismet for it as well if installed. Allows you to enter custom questions for extra protection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How does FV AntiSpam work so well?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No detectable signature for spam bots</li>\n<li>Blacklisted comments are put into trash</li>\n<li>The spam is moved directly to trash</li>\n<li>Spam pings and trackbacks are moved directly into trash if detected by Akismet</li>\n<li>Works hand in hand with Akismet, not trying to replace the collective system but supplement it.</li>\n<li>Stops only the machine spam</li>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t stop human spam which Akismet will move to spam folder.</li>\n<li>Keeps the spam folder almost empty so you can quickly go through the spam folder to rescue any Akismet false positives. This is impossible without FV Antispam as the spam folder of any popular site would have thousands of bot posted spam every week or even every day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/fv-antispam\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Support and more information</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>You can use the built in installer and upgrader, or you can install the plugin<br />\nmanually.</p>\n<p><strong>Test</strong> comment submission as non-logged in user after the plugin is installed! Read the <a href=\"http://foliovision.com/seo-tools/wordpress/plugins/fv-antispam/installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FV Antispam Testing guide</a>!</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20do%20you%20put%20the%20detected%20spam%20messages%20into%20trash%3F'>\nWhy do you put the detected spam messages into trash?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This way your spam folder is not overwhelmed with all the obvious spam messages. So you can look at this folder to check the spam messages detected by Akismet for example. And with new WordPress versions, you can also check the trash folder, to make sure that our plugin works correctly and only deletes what&#8217;s really a spam.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20you%20putting%20blacklisted%20comments%20into%20trash%3F'>\nWhy are you putting blacklisted comments into trash?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Same reason as above question, if a comments is already blacklisted, you don&#8217;t want to think about it in spam folder.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20problem%20with%20my%20filled%20in%20forms%20and%20i%20suspect%20it%27s%20caused%20by%20your%20plugin'>\nI have a problem with my Filled in forms and I suspect it&#8217;s caused by your plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you are logged in you should see a notice above each protected Filled in form. You will also see a warning in wp-admin Dashboard if there is any conflict with your Filled in forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20comment%20preview%20plugins%20do%20you%20recommend%20to%20use%20with%20fv%20antispam%3F'>\nWhich Comment Preview plugins do you recommend to use with FV Antispam?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/live-comment-preview/\" rel=\"ugc\">Live Comment Preview</a> works, but you have to change the textarea ID in the live-comment-preview.php file on line 124. You can find out that the ID is by looking into the source code of the page with comment form on it. It will be an unique string of seemingly random numbers and letters like &#8220;a7391152e&#8221;, so use that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dimox.net/jquery-comment-preview-wordpress-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery Comment Preview</a> is not so lightweight as the Live Comment Preview, but you can set the ID in options, so you don&#8217;t have to edit files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20seeing%20two%20comment%20textareas%20with%20this%20plugin%21'>\nI&#8217;m seeing two comment textareas with this plugin!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check your template HTML and CSS for that element. Ideally it should use standard WP <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/comment_form\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">comment_form</a> function and the same kind of CSS as the default template (TwentyTen). It needs to have id=&#8221;comment&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='all%20the%20comments%20go%20into%20trash%21'>\nAll the comments go into trash!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Same as above &#8211; make sure you use standard WP functions for display of comment forms. When you check out HTML source of your article page with comments bellow it, you should see two textareas &#8211; one with ID comment and the other with ID consisting of random numbers and letters. The first one should be set to invisible by this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
