This no-code solution provides you with the easiest way to get started with personalising your site.</p>\n<p>You can start using the following rules to show or hide blocks immediately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a user is viewing the site using a desktop or a mobile device</li>\n<li>If the user is accessing the site for the first time, or a returning user</li>\n<li>If the user is logged in, or logged out</li>\n<li>If the user is based in the UK or the USA</li>\n<li>If a user has spent 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute viewing a page</li>\n<li>If the time is the morning, afternoon or evening</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Custom Rule Options</h3>\n<p>The preset rules are just to get you going. The real power of PersonalizeWP is in the ability to create your own custom rules, which provide complete flexibility to choose your own scenarios of when you show or hide content.</p>\n<p>In addition to creating rules based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User Device</li>\n<li>New vs Returning User</li>\n<li>User is logged in/out</li>\n<li>User Location</li>\n<li>Time on Current Page</li>\n<li>Visit Period</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can create new rules that meet your needs based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last Visit</li>\n<li>Date</li>\n<li>Day of Week</li>\n<li>Visit Time</li>\n<li>User Role</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all of these rule types comes the ability to choose from a set of comparators such as Is Equal To, Does Not Equal, Before and After.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade to Standard for Extended Rules</h3>\n<p>We have also built a set of extended rules and rules that integrate with other plugins to provide more complex functionality for those who need it.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Standard package</a>, you get the ability to show or hide content using conditions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Referrer</strong> &#8211; where the user has come from</li>\n<li><strong>Cookie</strong> &#8211; if a cookie exists in their browser</li>\n<li><strong>Query String</strong> &#8211; text in the URL</li>\n<li><strong>Gravity Forms</strong> &#8211;

and will keep them up-to-date as their behaviour on your site changes.</p>\n<h4>Lead-Scoring</h4>\n<p>Assigning a score to an action that a user takes can help you to better understand how engaged they are with your site and content, helping you to gauge lead quality.</p>\n<p>You can set specific thresholds to identify promising opportunities and also assign negative points to keep scores in check.</p>\n<p>And you assign them to a segment using a score, meaning that you can keep all your highly interested leads in a single bucket.</p>\n<h4>Using Pro Features in the Block Editor</h4>\n<p>The Pro version of the plugin also brings all of these additional features into the Block Editor.</p>\n<p>This means that not only can you choose to Show/Hide content based on personalisation rules, but you can also filter that by Segment and Lead Score, and because these are driven by Visitor Profiles, your options are endless.</p>\n<h3>See how it works</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more about the PersonalizeWP, then you can <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visit our website</a>, which provides information, knowledge base articles, tutorials, tips and tricks and access to support documentation.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about the Pro version, please visit the <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing</a> page, or <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/book-a-demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Book a Demo</a> with one of the team to see how it can help you to personalise your content.</p>\n<h3>Integrations</h3>\n<p>PersonalizeWP is designed to work with any block and works with a number of plugins and block themes out of the box.</p>\n<h4>Integrations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Gravity Forms</li>\n<li>Ninja Forms</li>\n<li>WS Form</li>\n<li>WooCommerce</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetpack</li>\n<li>Genesis Blocks</li>\n<li>Kadence Blocks</li>\n<li>GenerateBlocks</li>\n<li>Atomic Blocks</li>\n<li>CoBlocks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support and feedback</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re keen to hear any feedback you might have regarding the plugin &#8211;

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20personalizewp%3F'>\nWhat is PersonalizeWP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PersonalizeWP is a WordPress plugin designed to add personalization features to WordPress. It follows similar principles to Enterprise platforms such as Episerver, Optimizely and Sitecore and works in conjunction with the Block editor to provide a simple and clear pathway to this functionality for content authors and admins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20use%20it%20for%3F'>\nWhat can I use it for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use PersonalizeWP to personalize content to your users, based on actions that they have taken, or criteria such as which countries they are accessing your site from. We have included basic rules into the plugin to provide a starting point and you can add your own rules, based on a set of conditions, and then apply those to any blocks you wish.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20personalizewp%3F'>\nHow do I use PersonalizeWP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have the plugin installed and activated, a PersonalizeWP option will appear in the Block Settings sidebar in the editor when you are editing a block. Within this, you will be given the choice to choose a rule and determine an action if that rule is met. For instance, you may wish to add a content block with a message that is only shown to the user if they come from a particular country, or if they have purchased a product from your store. Feel free to play around and let us know if you think.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20limitations%3F'>\nAre there any limitations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The actions that you can take when a rule is met, are currently limited to Show or Hide a block. We will be adding new actions in a future release. The plugin does not work with the Classic Block &#8211; which is due to be deprecated. You can use the Convert to Blocks feature to transform the Classic Block into independent blocks, which can then take advantage of PersonalizeWP.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20always%20be%20free%20to%20use%3F'>\nWill the plugin always be free to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will always have a free version of the plugin, but in the future, it is likely that we will add a Pro version which will offer additional features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='need%20help%3F'>\nNeed help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check our <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/knowledge-base/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base</a> or contact us through our <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/resources/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support site</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

and will keep them up-to-date as their behaviour on your site changes.</p>\n<h4>Lead-Scoring</h4>\n<p>Assigning a score to an action that a user takes can help you to better understand how engaged they are with your site and content, helping you to gauge lead quality.</p>\n<p>You can set specific thresholds to identify promising opportunities and also assign negative points to keep scores in check.</p>\n<p>And you assign them to a segment using a score, meaning that you can keep all your highly interested leads in a single bucket.</p>\n<h4>Using Pro Features in the Block Editor</h4>\n<p>The Pro version of the plugin also brings all of these additional features into the Block Editor.</p>\n<p>This means that not only can you choose to Show/Hide content based on personalisation rules, but you can also filter that by Segment and Lead Score, and because these are driven by Visitor Profiles, your options are endless.</p>\n<h3>See how it works</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more about the PersonalizeWP, then you can <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visit our website</a>, which provides information, knowledge base articles, tutorials, tips and tricks and access to support documentation.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more about the Pro version, please visit the <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing</a> page, or <a href=\"https://personalizewp.com/book-a-demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Book a Demo</a> with one of the team to see how it can help you to personalise your content.</p>\n<h3>Integrations</h3>\n<p>PersonalizeWP is designed to work with any block and works with a number of plugins and block themes out of the box.</p>\n<h4>Integrations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Gravity Forms</li>\n<li>Ninja Forms</li>\n<li>WS Form</li>\n<li>WooCommerce</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetpack</li>\n<li>Genesis Blocks</li>\n<li>Kadence Blocks</li>\n<li>GenerateBlocks</li>\n<li>Atomic Blocks</li>\n<li>CoBlocks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support and feedback</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re keen to hear any feedback you might have regarding the plugin &#8211;
