This is similar to the free shipping options available in marketplaces like Etsy where the shipping costs are factored into the price of the item. This also works well for lightweight items, where the shipping cost is less significant.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows a user to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure a &#8220;Free Shipping&#8221; badge for display in WooCommerce product category and detail pages</li>\n<li>Optionally hide other &#8220;paid&#8221; shipping methods in cart or checkout pages whenever free shipping is available</li>\n<li>Adjust text shown for a flat-rate based &#8220;Free Shipping&#8221; method in cart or checkout pages</li>\n</ul>\n",
