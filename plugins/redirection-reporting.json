        "description": "<p>Allows for more details reporting for the &#8220;Redirection&#8221; plugin by John Godley.<br />\nThis plugin will not do anything for you without using the Redirection plugin<br />\nto handle your 301 redirections.  This plugin was built to fix a gap in the<br />\nreporting which the Redirection plugin has.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>redirection-reporting.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/redirection-reporting</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Configure the global settings through the settings page.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20this%20plugin%20do%3F'>\nWhat does this plugin do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin simply reports on the redirection logs with day by day reporting.  It will also archive off data from the redirection_log table to redirection_log_archive (if enabled) to help keep the table that the redirection plugin writes to small.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20date%20format%20should%20i%20be%20using%3F'>\nWhat date format should I be using?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should be able to use any date format.  The PHP is going to reformat it to the<br />\nway that MySQL wants to see it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20the%20reports%3F'>\nWhere do I find the reports?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;Redirection Reporting&#8221; link can be found under the tools menu, probably<br />\nright near the &#8220;Redirection&#8221; link.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20archive%20feature%20for%3F'>\nWhat is the archive feature for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When there are large amounts of data in the Redirection plugin&#8217;s log table the pages<br />\nwhich show the lists of available regex URLs can be slow to load as these come from<br />\nthe log table.  In order to make this load faster, on sites which have a very heavy<br />\nworkload the data from the log table can be archived.  This will not reduce the amount<br />\nof data which is reported on as reports are run against the archive table and the<br />\nnormal table at the same time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='after%20upgrading%20to%20v3.0%20the%20reports%20don%27t%20work.'>\nAfter upgrading to v3.0 the reports don&#8217;t work.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On some systems the additional database objects which are needed are not being created.<br />\nIn order to fix this, deactivate the plugin and reactivate it, or simply go to the settings<br />\npage and click the &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; button.  We&#8217;re working on making that a smoother upgrade.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
