Save the changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Title</strong> &#8211; Enter a caption for what users will see during checkout.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong> &#8211; Provide a message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page, explaining VPay and the available payment methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Test Mode</strong> &#8211; Check this box to enable test mode. This allows you to test payments using SANDBOX details before going live. Uncheck it when your store is ready to accept real payments.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction_Charge</strong> &#8211; Specify the amount to be charged to the paying customer in addition to the order amount. This amount must be greater than 0 and shares the currency with the order amount.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction_Charge_Type</strong> &#8211; Either flat or percentage. This indicates how the payment total should be computed using the order amount and txn_charge above. E.g. order amount = 1000, txn_charge = 5, txn_charge_type = “percentage” then total = 1000 + (1000 * 5%) = 1000 + 50 = 1050.</li>\n<li><strong>API &amp; Secret Keys</strong> &#8211; Enter your VPay API key &amp; Secret key, which can be obtained from your VPay Dashboard. If Test Mode is enabled, use your SANDBOX API &amp; Secret keys.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Save Changes:</strong> Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> to update the settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p>We <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you copy the generated Webhook URL on the Woocommerce Settings page and paste it into the Webhook input field on your VPay dashboard under <strong>Settings &gt; Webhooks</strong> tab. This way, whenever a transaction is complete on your store, we&#8217;ll send a notification to the Webhook URL, which will update the order and mark it as paid. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your VPay dashboard under <strong>Settings &gt; Webhooks</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>If you do not find VPay on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ve checked the <strong>&#8220;Enable/Disable&#8221;</strong> checkbox</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve entered your <strong>API Keys</strong> in the appropriate field</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve clicked on <strong>Save Changes</strong> during setup</li>\n</ul>\n",
