The comment check box was added in WordPress version 4.9.6, then removed in version 4.9.8. However, the latest version disables comment cookies by default, breaking the ability for unlogged in users to detect when their comments have been submitted.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a privacy policy on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! GDPR is a European law. The plugin author, for instance, is located in Nevada, USA and GDPR doesn&#8217;t apply here.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
