        "installation": "<p><strong>Installation Overview</strong></p>\n<p>Before installing this plugin you should have the following information handy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your username and password to FreightQuote&#8217;s online shipping system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you need assistance obtaining any of the above information, contact your local FreightQuote office<br />\nor visit <a href=\"http://freightquote.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FreightQuote</a></p>\n<p>A more extensive and graphically illustrated set of instructions can be found on the <em>Documentation</em> tab at<br />\n<a href=\"https://eniture.com/woocommerce-freightquote-ltl-freight-quotes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">eniture.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Install and activate the plugin</strong><br />\nIn your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins =&gt; Add New. Search for &#8220;eniture ltl freight quotes&#8221;, and click Install Now.<br />\nAfter the installation process completes, click the Activate Plugin link to activate the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Get a license from Eniture Technology</strong><br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://eniture.com/woocommerce-freightquote-ltl-freight-quotes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Eniture Technology</a> and pick a<br />\nsubscription package. When you complete the registration process you will receive an email containing your license key and<br />\nyour login to eniture.com. Save your login information in a safe place. You will need it to access your customer dashboard<br />\nwhere you can manage your licenses and subscriptions. A credit card is not required for the free trial. If you opt for the free<br />\ntrial you will need to login to your <a href=\"http://eniture.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Eniture Technology</a> dashboard before the trial period expires to purchase<br />\na subscription to the license. Without a paid subscription, the plugin will stop working once the trial period expires.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Establish the connection</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings =&gt; FreightQuote. Use the <em>Connection</em> link to create a connection to your FreightQuote account.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Identify the carriers</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings =&gt; FreightQuote. Use the <em>Carriers</em> link to identify which carriers you want to include in the<br />\ndataset used as input to arrive at the result that is displayed in your cart. Including all carriers is highly recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Select the plugin settings</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings =&gt; FreightQuote. Use the <em>Quote Settings</em> link to enter the required information and choose<br />\nthe optional settings.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Define warehouses and drop ship locations</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings =&gt; FreightQuote. Use the <em>Warehouses</em> link to enter your warehouses and drop ship locations.  You should define at least one warehouse, even if all of your products ship from drop ship locations. Products are quoted as shipping from the warehouse closest to the shopper unless they are assigned to a specific drop ship location. If you fail to define a warehouse and a product isn’t assigned to a drop ship location, the plugin will not return a quote for the product. Defining at least one warehouse ensures the plugin will always return a quote.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Enable the plugin</strong><br />\nGo to WooCommerce =&gt; Settings =&gt; Shipping. Click on the Shipping Zones link. Add a US domestic shipping zone if one doesn’t already exist. Click the “+” sign to add a shipping method to the US domestic shipping zone and choose SEFL from the list.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Configure your products</strong><br />\nAssign each of your products and product variations a weight, Shipping Class and freight classification. Products shipping LTL freight should have the Shipping Class set to “LTL Freight”. The Freight Classification should be chosen based upon how the product would be classified in the NMFC Freight Classification Directory. If you are unfamiliar with freight classes, contact the carrier and ask for assistance with properly identifying the freight classes for your  products.</p>\n",

At the conclusion of the registration process an email will be sent to you that will include the<br />\nlicense key. You can also login to eniture.com using the username and password you created during the registration process<br />\nand retrieve the license key from the My Licenses tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20my%20plugin%20license%20from%20the%20trail%20version%20to%20one%20of%20the%20paid%20subscriptions%3F'>\nHow do I change my plugin license from the trail version to one of the paid subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to eniture.com and navigate to the My Licenses tab.
