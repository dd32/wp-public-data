This is a known issue but this is really not my fault. The problem is, the other plugin grabs all requests with an oauth_token parameter (which is necessary for all OAuth Plugins) and redirects to itself. I filed a Bug at the developer. One workaround could be: Deactivate the GA Plugin, authorize with Readability and activate it again. Everything else should be fine. Hopefully.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
