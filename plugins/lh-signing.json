        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20could%20you%20use%20this%20for%3F'>\nWhat could you use this for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You could use this plugin to create petitions with verified lists of users who have signed the petition. Or alternatively event sign ups or any sort of lists where the user needs to be verified</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20verification%20work%3F'>\nHow does the verification work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visitors who are not logged in enter their email address and are sent an email with a verification link, which they click to verify their agreement. Users who are logged in can automatically add their signature by simply submitting the form.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20post%20types%20does%20this%20work%20on%3F'>\nWhat post types does this work on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default both posts and pages can be signed. To add a custom post type or indeed remove a post type use the filter: lh_signing_posttypes_filter and add or remove post types to the array</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20be%20spammed%3F'>\nCan this be spammed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin uses JavaScript nonces to protect against spam. This means JavaScript must be activated by visitors, 99% of visitors do. This prevents automated spam.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customise%20the%20email%20templates%20that%20is%20used%20for%20the%20confirmation%20emails%3F'>\nCan I customise the email templates that is used for the confirmation emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes if you wish to customise the format of the html emails that are sent by this plugin, more the lh_signing-template.php file to your theme or child theme folder. From there you can edit its content. Styles in the head are automatically moved into the body when the email is sent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20emails%20to%20confirmed%20users%3F'>\nCan I send emails to confirmed users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes if you enable the Email Confirmed Users option you can populate a message that will be sent to users that are logged in or have confirmed their email address.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20registration%20page%20id%20mean%3F'>\nWhat does the registration page id mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As this plugin creates anew user (with a role of unconfirmed) and when they submit the form with a valid email. When this user confirms their &#8220;signature&#8221;, this role is changed to the default role for the site (usually subscriber), as such this plugin can/could be used for registering new users. If the registration page id corresponds to a page which contain the [lh_signing_form] short code, then this page will become the  default registration page for the site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20password%20reset%20page%20id%20mean%3F'>\nWhat does the password reset page id mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin can also be used for password resets. More documentation on this will added soon.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20plugin%20is%20slow%20to%20register%20the%20signature%2C%20why%20is%20that%3F'>\nThis plugin is slow to register the signature, why is that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The initial signing involves sending a confirmation email, if this is delivered via an external provider (eg via SMTP), this may take a few seconds. To work around this the plugin supports queuing the email, you can se whether you want email queuing or not in the configuration.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
