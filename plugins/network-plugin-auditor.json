There is no change on the normal site dashboards so there is nothing to see on a single-site installation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>All my blogs are showing blank columns except for the first!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please update to version 1.2 for improved support for custom database prefixes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin as an Must-Use plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!  Just copy the network-plugin-auditor.php file to your mu-plugins folder.  Be aware that you will not receive automatic notices of updates if you choose to install the plugin this way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, head over to https://github.com/ksemel/network-plugin-auditor, fork the repo and send in a pull request!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I found a bug</h4>\n<p>\n<p>And I want to know about it!
