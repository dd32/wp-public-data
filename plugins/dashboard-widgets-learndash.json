        "faq": "\n<dt id='who%20can%20see%20the%20widgets%3F%20%28user%2Frole%20permissions%29'>\nWho can see the widgets? (user/role permissions)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We decided to show the widgets to users with the &#8220;edit_dashboard&#8221; capability. By default, this only includes the &#8220;Administrator&#8221; role.</p>\n<p>Any other role, by default, does not have access to edit courses, lessons, topics or quizzes, thus rendering most of the quick links useless. If you want another user role to see the widgets, we suggest using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">User Role Editor plugin</a> to add the &#8220;edit_dashboard&#8221; capability to that user role.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the links in the Overview &amp; Links widget only work if the user has access to the corresponding page. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>edit_courses</strong> &#8211; Can access list pages for Courses, Lessons, Topics, Certificates, Questions &amp; Quizzes</li>\n<li><strong>edit_assignments</strong> &#8211; Can access the list page for Assignments</li>\n<li><strong>edit_essays</strong> &#8211; Can access the list page for Essays</li>\n<li><strong>edit_groups</strong> &#8211; Can access the list page for Groups</li>\n<li><strong>list_users</strong> &#8211; Can access the &#8220;Users &gt; All Users&#8221; page</li>\n<li><strong>group_leader</strong> &#8211; Can access the &#8220;Group Administration&#8221; page</li>\n<li><strong>manage_options</strong> &#8211; Can access most settings pages</li>\n<li><strong>manage_categories</strong> &#8211; Can access &amp; manage all Category &amp; Tag pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the Courses widget:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The &#8220;Edit&#8221; link will appear if the user has BOTH the <strong>edit_courses</strong> &amp; <strong>edit_published_courses</strong> capabilities</li>\n<li>The lesson/topic/quiz links &amp; counts just need the <strong>edit_courses</strong> capability</li>\n<li>The &#8220;Students&#8221; link will appear if the user has the <strong>list_users</strong> capability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the Recently Modified widget:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>edit_courses</strong> capability is required to use this widget</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20courses%20are%20displayed%20in%20the%20learndash%20courses%20widget%3F'>\nHow many courses are displayed in the LearnDash Courses widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have chosen to display up to 10 courses.

If two courses share the same Menu Order, they are then sorted by their course title.

What&#8217;s going on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the <strong>Overview widget,</strong> the numbers reflect <strong>published</strong> content.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>Courses widget:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>For courses, we display all courses except those in the trash, and revisions</li>\n<li>For lessons, topics &amp; quizzes, we only count the <strong>published</strong> content that is associated with the course. Drafts, revisions &amp; trashed content do not affect counts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you still think your numbers are off, it might be a bug. Please let us know in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/dashboard-widgets-learndash\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> so we can try to fix it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
