        "description": "<p>Forms are an essential component of any website. WordPress Contact Forms is the culmination of years of experience building and developing business websites of all types. Our plugin focuses on simplicity and power, it captures, stores and helps to classify contacts and leads according to their lead status. It&#8217;s ideal for single-language and multilingual sites, simple blogs, or complex WordPress-powered Content Management Systems. If your website handles a considerable amount of contacts and you need to make diverse forms our plugin is an excellent choice.</p>\n<h4>Select, Configure, and Embed Forms</h4>\n<p>Choose the fields you require, customize on-screen messages and email responses, preview, test, and effortlessly embed forms into your posts, pages, or custom content types using shortcodes or the built-in TinyMCE button.</p>\n<h4>Create Forms for Any Purpose</h4>\n<p>Create as many forms as you need. Design landing pages, contact pages, invitations, job application forms with curriculum upload, customer request forms, spare part requests, and more. Utilize the &#8220;Clone&#8221; feature to avoid &#8220;reinventing the wheel&#8221; when creating new forms.</p>\n<h4>Ready-to-Use Features</h4>\n<p>WordPress Contact Forms has commonly used fields like First Name, Last Name, Address, Province, Country, Telephone, Email, Captcha, and default success messages and email notifications. Simply create a drag-and-drop form, save it, go to a post or page, and click the orange &#8220;C&#8221; icon in the WYSIWYG editor to insert a contact form into the post or page content.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Use for Beginners</h4>\n<p>These features make it effortless for first-time users, but the plugin&#8217;s fast learning curve will soon entice you to explore its advanced features.</p>\n<h4>Craft Superior Forms</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t leave anything to chance; fine-tune the entire form submission process.</p>\n<h4>Create Reusable Fields</h4>\n<p>Build custom fields to reuse multiple times, starting with 20 available field types, including Text Field, Text Area, Email, Autoreply Email, Checkbox, Checkbox Group, Radio Buttons, Select, Multiple Select, Hidden Value, File Upload, Captcha, Custom HTML, Password, and more.</p>\n<h4>Customize Forms to Perfection</h4>\n<p>Apply visual styles to your forms using options in the &#8220;Appearance&#8221; tab. Select colors, margins, button styles, and more.</p>\n<h4>Custom Messages for Success</h4>\n<p>Each form can have its own unique online success message. So, when a form is completed, you can provide access to a file download link, coupon information, or simply a message to confirm that the form was submitted correctly.</p>\n<h4>Email Notifications for Administrators and Visitors</h4>\n<p>Send email notifications to administrators, including tracking information like visitor IP, referrer, date and time of form submission, and other user properties (for a full list, see the Beginners&#8217; Guide). Send an email notification to the visitor as further confirmation that the form was filled in correctly. All email notifications can be tested in the Preview/Test Tab before publishing.</p>\n<h4>Data Collection and Excel Export</h4>\n<p>All submitted data is securely stored in your WordPress database. Contacts received can be easily categorized into lead status categories and spam and tests can be easily discarded. Add notes on each contact received to keep track.</p>\n<p>All contact data received can be filtered, searched, and exported to Excel at any time. You can export all the data or just the data you need. The Advanced Excel Export option allows you to export to a file with ready-to-use filtering options.</p>\n<p>WordPress Contact Forms also includes a tracking graph in its Dashboard that displays the performance of all or each of your website forms over time.</p>\n<h4>Developer-Friendly API</h4>\n<p>WordPress Contact Forms includes an API to assist developers in customizing and adding their own features. WordPress Filters are used to customize forms during generation, to check and validate submitted form values, to execute custom code using sent data, and to add custom tokens for messages. Read the documentation on our site for more information.<br />\nPowerful PHP Form Builder Class<br />\nWordPress Contact Forms utilizes a PHP form builder class to generate the forms, ensuring robust and efficient form creation and management.</p>\n",
