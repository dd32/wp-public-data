This missing feature is<br />\nthe ability to email the subject or co-author of the blog post when the post<br />\nwhich they assisted with is published.

There are two options for doing this.  The first option is to use the &#8220;Email CoAuthor On Post&#8221; widget on<br />\nthe new post editor and simply put a comma between each email address.  The second option is to add one &#8220;EmailTo&#8221;<br />\ncustom fields each one with a different email address.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20default%20subject%20and%20body%20of%20the%20message%3F'>\nHow do I change the default subject and body of the message?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default subject and message are configured via the settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20subject%20and%20body%20for%20one%20blog%20post%3F'>\nHow do I change the subject and body for one blog post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fill out the &#8220;Email CoAuthor On Post&#8221; widget within the New Post editor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20personalize%20emails%20on%20a%20single%20blog%20post%20to%20multiple%20email%20addresses%3F'>\nCan I personalize emails on a single blog post to multiple email addresses?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  Only the first EmailToName value which the script finds will be used, and it will be used for<br />\nall the emails which are sent out for that blog post.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20from%20email%20address%3F'>\nCan I customize the from email address?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time.

The plugin doesn&#8217;t scrub or process the email in any way.  It simply passes the HTML<br />\nthat you supply and adds in the HTML headers to the email so that the email client that the user<br />\nis using processes the HTML tags.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20emails%20aren%27t%20showing%20up%20in%20html%2C%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nThe emails aren&#8217;t showing up in HTML, what should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First check the Settings page to make sure that the Send as HTML checkbox is checked.
