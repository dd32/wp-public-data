This easy to use, beautiful and powerful plugin will help you gather new subscribers and grow your business faster than ever! Within just a few simple steps you can create and customize the subscription form to match your need.

But that is not all! Elastic Email Subscribe Form is also a widget you can further personalize to your needs. It’s compatible with almost every other plugin and you can also integrate it with reCaptcha v2 for additional security. Simply drag and drop the widget to the appropriate area to enable it on your page.
