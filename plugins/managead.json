        "faq": "\n<h4>\nDoes it change on every page when I change the ad code\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. For example, you added an ad named &#8220;Ad1&#8221; in the settings section. Then you used it on 10 different posts or pages. If you change the &#8220;Ad1&#8221; code in the settings section, it will change on that 10 pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I add adsense code\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add any ad code you want. The plugin brings this code to your page in HTML without any intervention.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI don&#8217;t see a block named ManageAd\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It seems like your AdBlocker is conflicting with the plugin. Please add your domain to whitelist or close AdBlocker.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI saw error on Gutenberg\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you saw error like &#8220;Your site doesn’t include support for the &#8220;managead/block&#8221; block. You can leave this block intact or remove it entirely.&#8221; on Edit page. It seems like your AdBlocker is conflicting with the plugin.<br />\nPlease add your domain to whitelist or close AdBlocker.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
