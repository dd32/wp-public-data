When someone makes a purchase, you&#8217;ll get an e-mail telling you exactly how your new customer found your site.</p>\n<p>Plus, you&#8217;ll get over 30 online reports detailing the performance of all your traffic sources &#8211; how many unique people and visits they&#8217;ve sent you, how many people from that source have made a purchase, your visitor-to-customer conversion rate, and more. You can slice and dice all your web traffic by all these dimensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Landing page</li>\n<li>Search engine</li>\n<li>Search phrase</li>\n<li>Referring URL or domain name</li>\n<li>Country, state and city</li>\n<li>Day of week and time of day</li>\n<li>Ad campaign name</li>\n<li>Advertising medium (banner, PPC, e-mail, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Measure Your Advertising Results</strong></p>\n<p>If you advertise online, start keeping tabs on all your ads from right within your WordPress dashboard.
