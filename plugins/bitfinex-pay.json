        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20bitfinex%20pay%20work%3F'>\nHow does Bitfinex Pay work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your customers click the Bitfinex Pay button on your product page when checking out.</li>\n<li>Upon clicking, they will be directed to the Bitfinex payment gateway page. (This page contains your customers’ order details.)</li>\n<li>The countdown shows the remaining amount of time to complete the payment.</li>\n<li>Your customers will be redirected back to your website upon successful payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Customers making payments do not have to be Bitfinex users. If your customer is a Bitfinex user, they can log in via the Pay with Bitfinex button, and it will be considered an internal transfer within Bitfinex; the transaction will not be broadcast on the blockchain and will therefore also be faster than on-chain transactions.</p>\n<p>If your customer does not complete the payment before the countdown period, the invoice will be marked as Expired, and the customer will need to create a new payment request. You can also customise the time for the payment countdown when you configure the authenticated API endpoints.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20bitfinex%20pay%20works%20on%20your%20website'>\nHow Bitfinex Pay works on your website\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers click the Bitfinex Pay button on your checkout page.</li>\n<li>Upon clicking, they will be directed to the Bitfinex payment gateway page.</li>\n<li>The page contains your customers’ invoices and order details.</li>\n<li>The countdown shows the remaining amount of time to complete the payment.</li>\n<li>Your customers will be redirected back to your website upon successful payment.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20set%20up'>\nHow to set up\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign in or sign up for a Bitfinex account.</li>\n<li>Complete the verification process at least to the Intermediate level.</li>\n<li>Apply for Merchant verification.</li>\n<li>Set up a new sub-account and verify it.</li>\n<li>Create your API Key, learn how to do this here.</li>\n<li>Create an order with authenticated API endpoints, learn how to do it here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about Bitfinex Pay, visit Bitfinex Knowledge Base.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20the%20different%20invoice%20statuses%20mean%3F'>\nWhat do the different invoice statuses mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An invoice will have different statuses, starting from when the invoice is created until the time the funds are received in your account:<br />\n&#8211; Created: An invoice has been created;<br />\n&#8211; Pending: A deposit is pending confirmation to your account (for information on cryptocurrency deposit times, please view Where is my cryptocurrency deposit or withdrawal?);<br />\n&#8211; Completed: A deposit has been completed, and the payment amount and invoice amount was exactly matched;<br />\n&#8211; Expired: An invoice payment time has expired, meaning that the funds were not deposited in the required countdown period provided.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20my%20order%20status%20is%20set%20to%20completed%2Fprocessing%20after%20payment%20completed%3F'>\nWhy my order status is set to completed/processing after payment completed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a standard behaviour from WooCommerce.<br />\nMost of the time payment completed should mark an order as &#8216;processing&#8217; so that admin can process/post the items. If the cart contains only downloadable items then the order is &#8216;completed&#8217; since the admin needs to take no action.<br />\nAdditional information can be found in https://woocommerce.wp-a2z.org/oik_api/wc_orderpayment_complete/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20invoice%20limitation%20amounts%3F'>\nWhat are the invoice limitation amounts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The minimum invoice amount is $0.1 equivalent.</p>\n<p>If your customer is a Bitfinex user who authenticates their Bitfinex account via the Pay with Bitfinex button, they can pay the minimum invoice amount equivalent, which will be deducted from their Bitfinex wallet balance.</p>\n<p>However, if your customer is a Bitfinex user who makes the payment through the transaction address provided in the encrypted QR code or from the address box, they will be subject to the minimum withdrawal amount of $5 USD equivalent. For more information, please see Minimum Withdrawals.</p>\n<p>Note: The maximum invoice amount is $ 1,000 (equivalent).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
