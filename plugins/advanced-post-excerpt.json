Before the native &#8220;Excerpt&#8221; meta box is overridden, Advanced Post Excerpt passes an array of post types to the <code>ape_post_types</code> filter.</p>\n<p>If, for instance, you only want the native &#8220;post&#8221; post type to use Advanced Post Excerpt, you can add the following to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Restrict Advanced Post Excerpt to the \"post\" post type.\n *\n * @param array $post_types Post types affected by Advanced Post Excerpt.\n * @return array A restricted version of $post_types containing only \"post\".\n */\nfunction mytheme_restrict_ape_post_types( $post_types ) {\n    return array( 'post' );\n}\nadd_filter( 'ape_post_types', 'mytheme_restrict_ape_post_types' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20with%20the%20wordpress%20block%20editor%20%28a.k.a.%20%22gutenberg%22%29%3F'>\nWill this work with the WordPress block editor (a.k.a. &#8220;Gutenberg&#8221;)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! As of version 1.0.0, Advanced Post Excerpt will continue to display the TinyMCE editor in a meta box at the bottom of the block editor. To avoid conflicts, the default &#8220;Post Excerpt&#8221; panel in the block editor&#8217;s sidebar will automatically be removed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
