I was not willing to outright hack WordPress; so, I created a plugin that has worked solidly for me since WordPress version 3.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the minimum version that is useable with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m told that WordPress 2.7 changed several settings, including the way things are sent via mail. So I can&#8217;t guarentee support before version 2.7.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This pluging doesn&#8217;t work with x, y, z. Will you add support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Chances are if it&#8217;s not working with another plugin then I have not encountered the issue and am not likly to fix it. So no, I&#8217;m sorry but I will not be adding support for x, y, z.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
