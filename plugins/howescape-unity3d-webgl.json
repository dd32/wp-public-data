        "description": "<p>The Unity3d WebGL support creates a directory of files.<br />\nThis is not convent to load  on your WordPress web site.<br />\nThis plugin takes the contents of the &#8220;Build&#8221; directory (&#8220;Release&#8221; in earlier versions) from your game and places it<br />\ninside the plugin. When compiling the game you need to select an output directory. This directory name becomes the name of the game.<br />\nIn the initial version of the plugin for version 5.3.1 the plugin required &#8220;Builds_WebGL&#8221; to be the game name.<br />\nThe short code created by the plugin takes parameters which allow selection of the game.<br />\nThis plugin can then be referenced from with a short code.<br />\nThe parameters in the short code are the game name and the width and height.</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_web_gl_game src=&#8221;Roll-A-Ball&#8221; height=&#8221;500&#8243; width=&#8221;600&#8243; u3dver=&#8221;2020.3&#8243; buildtype=&#8221;Production&#8221; ]</p>\n<p>To extend the support for Unity3d to version 5.5.1 an additional parameter has been added.<br />\nThis parameter allows the specification of a version. The version support is 5.5.1 or the original version supported by the plugin. (ie. original version 5.3.1)<br />\nThe Unity3d version 5.5.1. creates a directory  &#8220;Development&#8221;. This is what I have uploaded in the included example. (ie. Roll-A-Ball-5_5_1-Release)<br />\nThe short code  is now looks like the following example.</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_web_gl_game src=&#8221;Roll-A-Ball&#8221; height=&#8221;500&#8243; width=&#8221;600&#8243; u3dver=&#8221;5.5.1&#8243; buildtype=&#8221;Production&#8221;]</p>\n<p>In reviewing the latest verion of Unity3d I noticed that the file organization for the WebGL has been updated again.<br />\nWith this update there are now 7 supported version 5.3.1, 5.5.1, 5.6.0, 2017.4.0f1, 2018.4, 2019.4, 2020.3 and 2021.3.9f1.<br />\nWhen using the newest version you would have a short code like the following.</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_web_gl_game src=&#8221;Roll-a-ball&#8221; height=&#8221;500&#8243; width=&#8221;600&#8243; u3dver=&#8221;2019.4&#8243; buildtype=&#8221;Production&#8221;]</p>\n<p>With the latest update to WordPress 5.7 the format of the files has changed agaion. The WebGL build options include the choice of a &#8220;Development Build&#8221;.<br />\nWhile this options is not recommended for a published game, being able to use in the plugin would helpful. An additional parameter has been added to specify the build type.</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_web_gl_game src=&#8221;Roll-a-ball&#8221; height=&#8221;900&#8243; width=&#8221;900&#8243; u3dver=&#8221;2020.3&#8243; buildtype=&#8221;Development&#8221;]</p>\n<p>This feature has four supported values &#8220;Development&#8221;, &#8220;Production&#8221;, &#8220;Production.GZip&#8221;, or &#8220;Production.Brotli&#8221;.<br />\nThe parameter is not necessary, if you are using a production build using GZip compression. The player settings Compression Format has 3 possible values.<br />\n* Development &#8211; No compression<br />\n* Production &#8211; Same as Production.GZip<br />\n* Production.GZip &#8211; Same as Production<br />\n* Production.Brotli &#8211; Compressed with a different algorithm<br />\nThese values allow you to take advantage of all the possible combinitation.</p>\n<p>I have noticed that some users have had difficulty in getting the short code to work as desired. There are a couple of error<br />\nmessages which are displayed. The parameter &#8220;errorreport&#8221; has 2 supported values &#8220;Normal&#8221; and &#8220;Verbose&#8221;. The default value is &#8220;Normal&#8221;.<br />\nIf you have the parameter set to &#8220;Verbose&#8221; and an error message is displayed additional information may be displayed.</p>\n<p>All other features should work as before. There are other features being considered please let me know if you desire anything functionality.</p>\n<p>With the addition of the settings page it is now possible to place<br />\nthe release directory in a zip file. (ie. &lt;gamename&gt;-Release.zip) The default version of Unity selected if no version<br />\nis 5.3.1 unless provided.<br />\nOnce the file is uploaded the setting page for the plugin will allow extraction<br />\nof the files into a location which the short code can locate. When naming games from version 5.5.1 and beyond you will need<br />\nto include the version number. (ie. &lt;gamename&gt;-5_5_1-Release.zip) With this version place the<br />\nfiles from the Development directory in the zip file. For the latest verion it is the same. (ie. &lt;gamename&gt;-5_6_0-Release.zip)<br />\nWith the addition of the last 2 version the the version number is now shorter.</p>\n<p>In the process of doing the latest update I wanted to switch between the different games to verify that everything was working.<br />\nTo make this task simpler I added a short code which displays a list of the available games and allows the selection of a game.<br />\nThe major reason for the addition was game development. Since I thought it might be useful I have added it to the plugin.</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_web_gl_gamepage]</p>\n<p>If you use this short code with just the plugin you will have three games. Four versions of the  Roll-A-Ball sample game and the space-shooter sample game.<br />\nThere are 2 ways games can be added, one is making them part of the plugin. The second is as a zip file which gets uploaded to the media directory.<br />\nOnce uploaded the uploaded game zip file can be expanded into the plugin from the settings page. There is also a delete option on the settings page.<br />\nIt can remove any game from the plugin. The page now displays the short code with the parameters you selected. The goal of this display is to assist people in getting a short<br />\ncode which they can put on there page and display the game.</p>\n<p>As the results of a question which was asked, &#8220;How can I get information from the browser into the Unity Game?&#8221; I have added a short code which adds javascript variables to the page.<br />\nThe short code is:</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_current_user]</p>\n<p>This adds the following to the HTML page:</p>\n<p>ie. var HS_CURRENT_USER_ID=5;var HS_CURRENT_USER_NAME=&#8221;gameplayer&#8221;;</p>\n<p>It is then possible to add code to the Unity Game to extract this information and make it part of the unity game. The 2020 version of roll a ball game displays the user which is logged into the wordpress site.</p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section</h3>\n<h3>A brief Markdown Example</h3>\n<p>[hs_unity3d_web_gl_game src=&#8221;Roll-A-Ball&#8221; height=&#8221;500&#8243; width=&#8221;600&#8243; u3dver=&#8221;2020.3&#8243; buildtype=&#8221;Production&#8221; errorreport=&#8221;Normal&#8221;]</p>\n",

The default value is &#8220;Normal&#8221;.<br />\nIf you have the parameter set to &#8220;Verbose&#8221; and an error message is displayed additional information may be displayed.</p>\n<p>All other features should work as before. There are other features being considered please let me know if you desire anything functionality.</p>\n<p>With the addition of the settings page it is now possible to place<br />\nthe release directory in a zip file. (ie. &lt;gamename&gt;-Release.zip) The default version of Unity selected if no version<br />\nis 5.3.1 unless provided.<br />\nOnce the file is uploaded the setting page for the plugin will allow extraction<br />\nof the files into a location which the short code can locate. When naming games from version 5.5.1 and beyond you will need<br />\nto include the version number. (ie. &lt;gamename&gt;-5_5_1-Release.zip) With this version place the<br />\nfiles from the Development directory in the zip file. For the latest verion it is the same. (ie. &lt;gamename&gt;-5_6_0-Release.zip)<br />\nWith the addition of the last 2 version the the version number is now shorter.</p>\n<p>In the process of doing the latest update I wanted to switch between the different games to verify that everything was working.<br />\nTo make this task simpler I added a short code which displays a list of the available games and allows the selection of a game.<br />\nThe major reason for the addition was game development. Since I thought it might be useful I have added it to the plugin.</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_web_gl_gamepage]</p>\n<p>If you use this short code with just the plugin you will have three games. Four versions of the  Roll-A-Ball sample game and the space-shooter sample game.<br />\nThere are 2 ways games can be added, one is making them part of the plugin. The second is as a zip file which gets uploaded to the media directory.<br />\nOnce uploaded the uploaded game zip file can be expanded into the plugin from the settings page. There is also a delete option on the settings page.<br />\nIt can remove any game from the plugin. The page now displays the short code with the parameters you selected. The goal of this display is to assist people in getting a short<br />\ncode which they can put on there page and display the game.</p>\n<p>As the results of a question which was asked, &#8220;How can I get information from the browser into the Unity Game?&#8221; I have added a short code which adds javascript variables to the page.<br />\nThe short code is:</p>\n<p>ie. [hs_unity3d_current_user]</p>\n<p>This adds the following to the HTML page:</p>\n<p>ie. var HS_CURRENT_USER_ID=5;var HS_CURRENT_USER_NAME=&#8221;gameplayer&#8221;;</p>\n<p>It is then possible to add code to the Unity Game to extract this information and make it part of the unity game. The 2020 version of roll a ball game displays the user which is logged into the wordpress site.</p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section</h3>\n<h3>A brief Markdown Example</h3>\n<p>[hs_unity3d_web_gl_game src=&#8221;Roll-A-Ball&#8221; height=&#8221;500&#8243; width=&#8221;600&#8243; u3dver=&#8221;2020.3&#8243; buildtype=&#8221;Production&#8221; errorreport=&#8221;Normal&#8221;]</p>\n",
