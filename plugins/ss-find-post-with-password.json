On submitting the form, if a post / page exists with that password then the user will be redirected to that page and automatically logged in. If no post / page is found then an error will be displayed.</p>\n<p>What if I use the same password for two pages?<br />\nThe plugin will redirect to the first page with the specified password. It is your responsibility to maintain unique passwords throughout your website.</p>\n",
