Properly configured, NCU will eliminate these two obstacles to discussion &#8211; preserving reply-links for all comments, and allowing for virtually unlimited depth. Through the addition of a set of CSS classes, NCU also provides the potential for unique, more readable or convenient custom formatting of nested conversations.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPfB6B6XrAU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>After full activation of NCU in a standard WordPress installation, the built-in default limit of 10 for maximum depth, set in &#8220;Discussion,&#8221; will be automatically changed to 10,000 &#8211; effectively unbounded.
