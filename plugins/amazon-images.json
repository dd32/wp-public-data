        "faq": "\n<h4>What do I need to get this working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need an account with Amazon for their <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Product Advertising API</a>. When you register and login you will have a<br />\npublic and secret key. You&#8217;ll need to enter these on the Amazon Images plugin options page<br />\nto be able to get image information.</p>\n<p>You will also need an affiliate tag, although if you&#8217;re looking at this plugin you likely<br />\nalready have one of these.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not just save the files?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The user agreement for the Amazon API allows you to store images for up to 24 hours. So rather<br />\nthan storing the images on your server this plugin links directly to the image at Amazon.</p>\n<p>During the import the images are temporarily downloaded so that WordPress can work with the<br />\nactual file to get size information. But the images are deleted immediately afterwards so they&#8217;re<br />\nnot on your server for more than a few seconds.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So, they&#8217;re hotlinked?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>The links are retrieved using the Advertising API, so presumably you are using the images to<br />\nlink to content on Amazon and maybe including your affiliate tag with the link.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about non-US affiliates?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently the plugin pulls images from the US Amazon site. It should work outside the US, but<br />\nliving in the US I have no good way to test that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting a SOAP not available error</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your host probably doesn&#8217;t have the SOAP library for PHP installed on your server. Ask<br />\nthem about it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m still confused!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit [http://www.nutt.net/tag/amazon-images/](my site) or use the WordPress forum link to the<br />\nright if you need help.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
