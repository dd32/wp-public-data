        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20wikipedia%20preview%20free%3F'>\nIs Wikipedia Preview free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Wikipedia Preview is free. It has been made available to you by Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that powers Wikipedia with a mission of free knowledge equity.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wikipedia%20preview%20work%20on%20any%20word%3F'>\nDoes Wikipedia Preview work on any word?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wikipedia Preview works with any word or phrase that has an article on Wikipedia, in any of the available languages. However, Wikipedia articles are typically language specific, meaning that different articles will be available in different languages. Not every article is available in every language, but you control the language of each preview on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20flow%20for%20implementing%20the%20wikipedia%20preview%20links%20in%20a%20post%3F'>\nWhat is the flow for implementing the Wikipedia Preview links in a post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When writing articles, decide which words show a Wikipedia popup on a particular post. The process of enabling the Wikipedia popup on a specific word is identical to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/paragraph-block/#insert-hyperlinks\" rel=\"ugc\">adding a hyperlink</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='after%20the%20implementation%20of%20wikipedia%20preview%20will%20there%20be%20any%20impact%20on%20the%20size%20of%20the%20page%3F%20will%20it%20get%20laggy%3F'>\nAfter the implementation of Wikipedia Preview will there be any impact on the size of the page? Will it get laggy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The words that will have a Wikipedia Preview popup on your site need to be annotated. Those annotations add to the page size but not more than the regular hyperlinks you already use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20one%20customise%20the%20preview%20style%3F'>\nHow does one customise the preview style?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the admin site, go to “Appearance / customize”, then select the “Additional CSS” option from the left side menu. In the text box, the following CSS should reset the existing term style so you can adjust it to your liking.</p>\n<pre><code>.wmf-wp-with-preview {\n    border: 0;\n    background-color: unset;\n    padding: unset;\n}\n.wmf-wp-with-preview::after {\n    content: '';\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20select%20the%20language%20of%20my%20preview%20links%3F'>\nHow can I select the language of my preview links?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You control the language of each preview link on your website when using the Wikipedia Preview search bar. This allows you to select different languages for each of your site’s previews, if you choose, particularly if your audience speaks multiple languages. Since not every Wikipedia article is available in every language, this has the benefit of creating previews for content that is not available in your site’s primary language. For example, if your website is in Swahili, you will likely add previews of Wikipedia articles in Swahili. However, you may find a word or phrase that does not have a Wikipedia article in Swahili, but perhaps has an English article instead. You can add the English preview in that case by using the Wikipedia Preview search bar. Note: Since Wikipedia is an ever-growing and expanding project, you may come back later and find that the missing article is now available in your preferred language.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20wikipedia%20preview%20plugin%20affect%20my%20website%27s%20seo%3F'>\nDoes the Wikipedia Preview plugin affect my website&#8217;s SEO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Wikipedia Preview plugin has zero impact on your website&#8217;s SEO. It operates on the client side, does not duplicate content, and is implemented with SEO best practices. Your search engine rankings remain unaffected.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20compatible%20with%20all%20the%20browsers%3F'>\nIs it compatible with all the browsers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Wikipedia Preview is compatible with the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge (Current and previous version), Safari 5.1+, iOS 6.1+ and Android 4.1+</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20we%20share%20our%20experience%20with%20wikipedia%20preview%20with%20you%3F'>\nHow can we share our experience with Wikipedia Preview with you?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please leave reviews on our Wikipedia Preview plugin page</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20else%20can%20i%20work%20with%20the%20wikimedia%20foundation%3F'>\nHow else can I work with the Wikimedia Foundation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you would like to explore a collaboration opportunity beyond Wikipedia Preview, please contact partnerships@wikimedia.org</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20which%20part%20of%20a%20wikipedia%20article%20appears%20in%20the%20preview%3F'>\nCan I customize which part of a Wikipedia article appears in the preview?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, site owners have the option to choose a specific section of an article as a preview, rather than being limited to the lead section. This allows for more targeted and relevant previews.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20wikipedia%20preview%20support%20dark%20mode%3F'>\nDoes Wikipedia Preview support dark mode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Wikipedia Preview supports dark mode for improved readability.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
