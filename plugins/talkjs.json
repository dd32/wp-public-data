Add buyer seller chat to your marketplace, on-demand app, or peer-to-peer chat to your social platform.

TalkJS offers unlimited testing and a 14 day free trial when you go live.</p>\n<h3>For developers</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to integrate the TalkJS messaging platform to your WordPress site, this is the easiest way to do it.<br />\nYou can use three methods of implementation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shortcodes</li>\n<li>Widgets</li>\n<li>Template tags</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>You can use shortcodes on a post-by-post basis. The following three shortcodes allows you to easily use any TalkJS UI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[talkjs_chat]</code></li>\n<li><code>[talkjs_inbox]</code></li>\n<li><code>[talkjs_popup]</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can pass along the default conversation user for the chat and the popup. You do this by adding a user ID to the shortcode: [talkjs_chat user=&#8221;2&#8243;]</p>\n<p>If you wish to get the author of the post as your conversation user you can use the following: [talkjs_chat userType=&#8221;author&#8221;]. You shouldn&#8217;t fill in the user ID in this case since it overwrites the <code>userType</code>.</p>\n<p>With all three you can pass along a custom welcome message like this: [talkjs_chat welcomeMessage=&#8221;Hi there!&#8221;]</p>\n<p>For Inbox and Chatbox, you can also customize the width and height of the shortcodes by passing <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties like this: [talkjs_chat height=&#8221;500px&#8221; width=&#8221;250px&#8221;]</p>\n<p>There are some predefined styles to make integration easier, if you want full control over the style of the TalkJS UI container, you can pass <code>style</code> property to overwrite the default styles. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties are ignored when <code>style</code> is used.</p>\n<p>The popup also has an option to keep it open between pages by using the shortcode with the keepOpen property e.g. [talkjs_popup keepOpen=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n<h3>Widgets</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s currently only one widget available: The TalkJS Chatbox widget. In it you can set a title, a welcome message and the conversation user (the current post author if blank)</p>\n<h3>Template tags</h3>\n<p>You can use template tags if you want to display the chatbox, inbox or popup on certain templates. You use them in your code like so:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php talkjs_chat();?&gt;\n&lt;?php talkjs_popup();?&gt;\n&lt;?php talkjs_inbox();?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can pass along the same attributes as in the shortcode-version. You add them in an array, like this:<br />\n     &#8220;Hi there, let\\&#8217;s chat!&#8221;,<br />\n        &#8216;userType&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;author&#8217;<br />\n    ]);<br />\n    ?&gt;</p>\n<h3>Welcome Message customization</h3>\n<p>You can add custom variables to your welcome message. These variables are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>{{first_name}} -&gt; logged in users&#8217; first name.</li>\n<li>{{last_name}} -&gt; logged in users&#8217; last name.</li>\n<li>{{name}} -&gt; logged in users&#8217; full name.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Available filters</h3>\n<p>We currently have one filter available for developers. Feel free to contact us if you need any other filters.</p>\n<h3>talkjs_hidden_post_types_for_chat_popup</h3>\n<p>Hide your custom post-type as a viable chat option.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nadd_filter( 'talkjs_hidden_post_types_for_chat_popup', function( $postTypes ){\n\n    $postTypes[] = 'my-custom-post-type';\n    return $postTypes;\n\n});\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",
