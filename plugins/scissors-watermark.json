To make a manual installation, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the contents of the Scissors zip-archive you downloaded.</li>\n<li>Upload the extracted <code>scissors</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin in WordPress&#8217; media settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Automatic resizing of the full-size image at upload-time can be configured in WordPress&#8217; media settings. You can specify a maximum width and a maximum height in pixels for this to take effect (a width/height of 0 disables image resizing in that particular dimension).</p>\n<p>Watermarking can also be configured and enabled in WordPress&#8217; media settings: Supply an image that you want to be embedded into newly uploaded images, specify its alignment, size, and margin, and you&#8217;re all set!</p>\n",
