        "description": "<p>Shouty (shoutbox) is a WordPress plugin for you to receive messages from your users. It creates a custom post type called &#8220;shout&#8221; which will allow you to administer shouts from the Dashboard as you do for the default post types. You can add Shouty in a post, page or a widget using its shortcode. The shortcode has certain options for you to customize the look and function of the Shouty. Shouty also creates a custom category option which can be used to create multiple shoutboxes on your website. To do that, you should first create a category, then set it in the shortcode. Shouty shares messages using AJAX and protects your blog using Honeypot spam protection technique. Users must log in to share shouts. It doesn&#8217;t accept any HTML but http and https links are converted to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags when the shout is shared. You don&#8217;t have to worry about unclickable links.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use Shouty</strong></p>\n<p>Insert the shortcode below into any post/page or widget.</p>\n<pre><code>[shouty category=\"home-page\" look=\"widget\" user=\"hide\" form=\"hide\" messages_number=\"5\" messages_title=\"hide\" messages_users_avatar_size=\"60\" show_more_button=\"hide\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Options you can set for the shortcode</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>category (category-slug; default: empty; Limits shout viewing and posting to a previously created shout category)</li>\n<li>look (post | widget; default: post; Switches looks &#8211; widget look is more compact)</li>\n<li>user (show | hide; default: show; Displays user information at the top of the form)</li>\n<li>user_avatar_size (in px; default: 64; Changes size of the user avatar in user information)</li>\n<li>form (show | hide; default: show; Displays Shouty form and the share button)</li>\n<li>messages_title (show | hide; default: show; Displays a title at the tops of the shouts)</li>\n<li>messages (show | hide; default: show; Displays shouts)</li>\n<li>messages_links (show | hide; default: show; Displays URLs in the shout)</li>\n<li>messages_number (a number; default: 10; The number of shouts to be viewed in one time)</li>\n<li>messages_users_avatar_size (in px; default: 32; Changes size of the user avatar on the left of the each shout)</li>\n<li>share_links (show | hide; default: show; Displays Facebook share and Twitter tweet links)</li>\n<li>show_more_button (show | hide; default: show; Displays show more button at the end of the shouts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin is written in English and has been translated into Turkish by <a href=\"http:/www.gungorbudak.com/\" title=\"Güngör Budak\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">myself</a><br />\n.

You&#8217;re welcomed if you want to translate it into your language. Use translations.pot, rename it as shouty-LANGCODE.po (e.g. shouty-tr_TR) and open it in Poedit. Translate and save. There should be a MO file created by Poedit. Send PO and MO files to me, then I will add them in the next release.</p>\n",

Now shouts can be categorized and in this way you can have multiple shoutboxes on your website. Just don&#8217;t forget to create a category first and include in the shortcode Sharing shouts and pagination have been improved. Sharing shouts from widgets is now possible. Every functionality is avaliable for post/page look as well as widget look. You can also now use all attributes of shortcode dynamically. You can also now hide show more button.</p>\n<h4>0.0.4</h4>\n<p>German translations have been added</p>\n<h4>0.0.3</h4>\n<p>WP 4.0 compatibility has been checked and Serbian translations have been added</p>\n<h4>0.0.2</h4>\n<p>Bug fixed: you could send an empty shout</p>\n<h4>0.0.1</h4>\n<p>First release</p>\n"
