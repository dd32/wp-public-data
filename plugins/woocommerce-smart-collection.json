The plugin looks up your product title, content, excerpt and tags, matches the key words with already available product categories and automatically assigns the product to those relevant product categories.</p>\n<p>This plugin will be really helpful if your website has a huge number of products and product categories. The plugin minimizes the effort of manually assigning each and every product to relevant product categories.</p>\n<p>For example, if you create a product with a title &#8220;IPhone 5S Reviews&#8221; and you have product categories like &#8220;IPhone&#8221;, &#8220;Reviews&#8221; available, then the product gets automatically assigned to these product categories.</p>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<p>The plugin is fully compatible with the recent versions of WordPress and Woocommerce.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with older WordPress versions, down to 3.0.</li>\n<li>Compatible with Woocommerce 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x and 2.4.x</li>\n<li>Multilingual Support is included with the plugin and is fully compatible with WPML.</li>\n<li>Support added for common importers like WordPress Importer and WP All Import.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Configurable</h4>\n<p>Woocommerce Smart Collection is completely customizable. Among others, you may enable/disable smart collection(s), append with existing categories, choose whether to generate smart category associations from product titles and tags.</p>\n<p>From version 1.0.1 onwards, the settings can be overriden for individual products.</p>\n<p>From version 1.0.6 onwards, collections can also be made using product content or excerpt.</p>\n<h4>Upcoming Features</h4>\n<p>In the upcoming version we will be adding support for custom product taxonomies.
