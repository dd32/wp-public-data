You can register for a free trial at hopewiser.com (or hopewiser.com.au if you are based in Australia)<br />\n• Click Load Settings, then choose the Server closest to your location and also your MAFs to be used on the address validation</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q. How are we supported?<br />\nA. Full, free support is included with the purchase of every bundle.  If you have any issues please feel free to contact us at Support@hopewiser.com</p>\n<p>Q. Which countries data can I use?<br />\nA. We support UK (Royal  Mail PAF), and Ireland (Eircode), Australia (Australia Post&#8217;s Postal Address File &amp; GNAF), New Zealand (NZ Post&#8217;s GeoPAF). We also have an International Address Lookup dataset to cover the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Q. Do I need an account to use the service?<br />\nA. Whilst the plugin is free the address lookup service does require a Hopewiser Adddress Lookup account.  You can sign up for an account at https://www.hopewiser.com/myaccount/#path=myaccount:register and view our click bundle pricing.</p>\n<p>Q. Can I get a test account?<br />\nA.

With autocomplete the address fills in as you type, allowing you to choose a full address from just a few keystrokes. Address Lookup allows you to input a partial address or postcode and select the address from a drop down list within the postcode or area.</p>\n",
