Less (but more relevant) links is better. Putting the archives and cloud on a separate page or post is better, as it allows bots to crawl &#8211; and interested readers to see all your content in a nice format.<br />\nDon&#8217;t add it repeatedly and redundantly though. Make sure it&#8217;s useful for your visitors, then it&#8217;s typically also welcome by google.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20widget%20support%3F'>\nIs there widget support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at the moment.
