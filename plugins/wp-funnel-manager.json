You will find the familiar editing screen to create your first funnel.</p>\n<p>Funnels are fully integrated with the new block templates feature of WordPress 5.8.

You can also add multiple funnels that share the same block template, or create new funnel types with their own block templates.</p>\n<p>To add more steps to a funnel, find the funnel within its funnel type listing and click on Edit Steps. Then, click on Add New to add a new step to this funnel. Again, use the familiar editing screen to add content to this step.

Suggested actions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch back to your previous theme that supports the template editor</li>\n<li>Contact your theme author and request the theme to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/16/introducing-the-template-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support the template editor</a></li>\n<li>You can also <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/template-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">activate this plugin</a>, which forces your theme to support the template editor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once your active theme supports the template editor, all your funnels will be automatically restored.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20the%20plugin%20automatically%20deactivate%20itself%3F'>\nWhy did the plugin automatically deactivate itself?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a rare issue that the majority of users will never encounter.</p>\n<p>WP Funnel Manager requires a core function, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_current_user/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp_get_current_user</a>, to be re-defined in a certain way. Only one plugin at a time is allowed to re-define any given core function, <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see this article for more explanation.</a> Therefore, if it is detected that another plugin is already re-defining this core function in its own way, WP Funnel Manager is unable to operate.</p>\n<p>By deactivating your other plugins one by one, and attemping to re-activate WP Funnel Manager, you can determine which one of your other plugins was causing the conflict with WP Funnel Manager. Once you have found it, you will be able to activate WP Funnel Manager and any other plugin not involved in the conflict.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20suggest%20a%20new%20feature%20or%20submit%20a%20bug%20report%3F'>\nHow do I suggest a new feature or submit a bug report?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Through the WordPress support forum, or on the <a href=\"https://github.com/carlomanf/wp-funnel-manager/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub page here.</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
