The content that is available includes audio from most NPR programs dating back to 1995 as well as text, images and other web-only content from NPR and NPR member stations. This archive consists of over 250,000 stories that are grouped into more than 5,000 different aggregations.</p>\n<p>This plugin also allows you to push your content to the NPR CDS, so that it can be republished by NPR or other NPR member stations.</p>\n<p>Access to the NPR CDS requires a bearer token, provided by NPR. If you are an NPR member station or are working with an NPR member station and do not know your key, please <a href=\"https://studio.npr.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ask NPR station relations for help</a>.</p>\n<p>Usage of this plugin is governed by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">NPR&#8217;s Terms of Use</a>, and more specifically their <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use#APIContent\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API Usage terms</a>.</p>\n<p>The WordPress plugin was originally developed as an Open Source plugin by NPR and is now supported by developers with NPR member stations working within the Open Public Media group.

WP_Cron doesn&#8217;t run as a specific user, therefore it doesn&#8217;t technically have publishing rights. <code>npr_cds_push()</code><br />\nnow checks if the post was retrieved from the CDS first before checking publishing rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>V1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing warnings and a few fatal errors in <code>NPR_CDS_WP.php</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>V1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing improperly escaped HTML in post editor meta boxes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>V1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing a bunch of warnings in <code>classes/NPR_CDS_WP.php</code></li>\n<li>Changing the behavior the <code>Get Multi</code> setting <code>Run the queries on saving changes</code> so that it runs once and then turns off. That way, it doesn&#8217;t run every time you save changes on the page.</li>\n<li>Fixed issue where updates to bulk actions dropdowns were being duplicated</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>V1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhaul to enable pulling from NPR&#8217;s Content Distribution Service, which is the next generation of the Story API.</li>\n<li>Previous version notes can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenPublicMedia/nprapi-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">NPR Story API plugin repository</a></li>\n</ul>\n"
