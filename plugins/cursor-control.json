IE requires you to use .cur image files for cursor icons. These files cannot be uploaded via the built-in WordPress media uploader.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will Internet Explorer users see instead of my custom cursor image?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They will see the default cursor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use an animated gif as my cursor image?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time, no browsers support animated cursors.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the image size restrictions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maximum cursor dimensions are 128 x 128 pixels. Smaller images (32 x 32, 64 x 64) are recommended.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What image file types can be used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can upload png, jpg, and gif files.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
