The payload of the message is either the order id or the product_id.</p>\n<p>The data transmitted is kept to the bear minimum to limit the data exposure over MQTT.  Further information may be retrieved by the end point using the standard WooCommerce API by querying the order or product by id.</p>\n<p>The stats topics are published to each time any other message is sent.

Further stats topics are in the to-do list.</p>\n<p>MQTT may be used to feed many different devices and services.  For example the feed could be consumed by NodeRed, Home Assistant or, of course, an Arduino.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload plugin <code>wc-mqtt-alerts</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin using the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in your WordPress admin panel.</li>\n<li>You can adjust the necessary settings using your WordPress admin panel in &#8220;MQTTWoo&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Create a page or a post, customize button settings and insert generated shortcode into the text.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhy use MQTT instead of the API\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Calls to the API put a load on the server and to make a &#8220;real-time&#8221; update the API would have to be called at least every 5 minuntes and that would put a substantial load on the server.<br />\nThe idea behind this plugin is to use MQTT to push an event notification so that the API need only be called when a change is detected.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy shiftr.io\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s free and it works well.  In essence the plugin posts to a URL using basic authentication and so could be used with any other MQTT broker with an HTTP interface that follows the same pattern.  Or your own server.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is the topic prefix\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the topic prefix is empty, but it may be set to allow the topics to fit in with an existing MQTT infrastructure.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
