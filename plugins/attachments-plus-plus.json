        "faq": "\n<h4>What is the minimum recommended WordPress version for Attachments++?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although Attachments++ can run on lower versions, 3.6 or higher is <em>strongly<br />\nrecommended</em>. Lower versions will not be able to embed audio or video files,<br />\nthough all documents will be supported.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What filetypes are supported by Attachments++?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is a long, ever-growing list. As of writing this, a total of <strong>51</strong> <br />\nfiletypes are supported with WordPress version 3.6 or higher, and <strong>40</strong><br />\nfiletypes for lesser versions. These filetypes include all common documents<br />\nfrom Microsoft Office (doc/docx, ppt/pptx, etc.), as well as many more obscure<br />\nfiletypes like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and AutoCad files. If you can think<br />\nof a file then it is probably supported or will be in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Attachments++ integrate with any other plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It does indeed. It is already designed to integrate with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-document-embedder/\" rel=\"ugc\">Google Doc<br />\nEmbedder</a>, if installed, and plans are in place to support more plugins in<br />\nthe future. If you know of a plugin that would make sense to integrate, please<br />\nfeel free to suggest it on the<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/attachments-plus-plus/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s not working! Help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Firstly, are you sure it&#8217;s not working? Some filetypes are not supported yet,<br />\nand for those the attachment page should not change at all. To test functionality,<br />\ntry uploading a PDF or DOC file (only because those are generally the easiest to<br />\ncome by). Once uploaded, go to the attachment page for that doc (found though<br />\nat <em>Admin Dashboard -&gt; Media Library -&gt; View</em> (for the PDF or DOC you just<br />\nuploaded). If that page looks the same as it did, then something probably is<br />\nwrong and you should post on the support forum. Also, it goes without saying,<br />\nif you get a bunch of big ugly error messages after installing Attachments++, that<br />\nshould also be posted on the support forum.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
