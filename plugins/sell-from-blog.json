If the code is correct, Sell from Blog creates a message, attaches your package to it and sends it to the buyer&#8217;s email address.</p>\n<p>The package you want to sell is placed on your own server, in a secured directory which is not accessible from outside.</p>\n<p>There is also a dashboard widget which shows you how many codes you have left and gives detailed info on last 25 transactions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can ask buyers to let you send additional information to their email address (can be turned on of off in the admin section).</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>With which premium sms services does the plugin currently work with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It works with every service which provides you with a set of codes and lets you check user input against them by yourself.</p>\n<p>I tested it with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://www.mobilepay.pl/ (pack)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How many files can I sell at the same time through this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, the plugin supports selling only one file at any given time. Therefore, it&#8217;s only good for people who have one ebook or program to sell on one blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does my package file have to be of a certain type?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it can be of any type (pdf, exe, zip, doc, etc.). But it is a good idea to compress it, because there are limits to the size of email messages (often a message must be less than 10MiB).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add my own codes to give away to my readers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can add your own custom (promotional) codes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you add support for remote validation of codes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I will add support for remote validation in future versions. You can help by sending me links to technical data of your service provider.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which languages are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>Polish (pl_PL)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This plugin is gettext-ready. You can easily translate it into your language.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
