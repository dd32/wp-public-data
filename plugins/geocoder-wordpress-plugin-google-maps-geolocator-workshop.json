The left form allows you to enter address information, or a longitude/latitude pair, and the right form shows the result of a geocode lookup or a reverse geocode.<br />\nIt is possible to display an interactive map, and also to examine the raw JSON data sent back from the geocode/reverse geocode lookup.<br />\nThis is an extension of a utility that was written in order to help data entry personnel enter accurate address information.<br />\nIt has administration options (&#8220;Geolocator Options&#8221;, in &#8220;Settings&#8221;).<br />\nThe plugin outputs highly optimized code that is XHTML 1.0 Strict compliant, as well as WAI AAA.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>To use this utility, you simply enter address information into the fields in the left-hand form. You can enter all the information in one line, if you wish.<br />\nThe string that is displayed above the entry is what is actually sent to Google Maps to be geocoded. Once you have filled in the address, click on &#8220;Address Lookup&#8221;. This will send a geocode request to Google Maps.<br />\nThe response is parsed, and shown in the right-hand (gray) box. A set of arrow links will appear between the two forms. These allow you to easily transfer results into the entry form.<br />\nIf you enter a longitude and latitude value into the bottom two boxes in the entry form, you can do a reverse geocode. This asks Google Maps to figure out an address, based on the values in these boxes.<br />\nIn many cases, Google Maps will return more than one response, and you can cycle through these responses.<br />\nEach response shows an &#8220;accuracy&#8221; number in a scale, above the response. The more accurate (confident) the result, the closer the scale marker will be to the right.<br />\nIn the interactive map, there are two markers shown. The yellow one reflects the long/lat pair in the left window, and can be moved around. Clicking in the map will move/create the marker, and fill in the long/lat fields.<br />\nThe gray marker reflects the position of the current response, and cannot be moved.<br />\nThe raw data window shows the entire response from Google Maps, presented in a hierarchical fashion. If there are more than one placemark, each mark will have a link that will bring that mark into focus in the gray form.</p>\n",
