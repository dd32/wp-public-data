        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It was originally created to work with magazine/news themes.  These types of themes typically required a lot of work when inputting images to make them look good.  This plugin was developed to make that process much easier for the end user.  But, at the same time, it needed to be flexible enough to handle anything.</p>\n<p>However, over the years, it has grown to be one of the most robust image scripts for WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it grab images?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Looks for an image by custom field (one of your choosing).</li>\n<li>If no image is added by custom field, check for a featured image.</li>\n<li>If no image is found, it grabs an image attached to your post.</li>\n<li>If no image is attached, it can extract an image from your post content (off by default).</li>\n<li>If no image is found at this point, it will fall back to a default image (not set by default).</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add it to my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several methods, but in general, you would use this call within The Loop.</p>\n<pre><code>`\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    `</p>\n<p>To see all methods and options, refer to the <code>readme.md</code> file included with the plugin download or <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/breadcrumb-trail/blob/master/readme.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">view the readme online</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
