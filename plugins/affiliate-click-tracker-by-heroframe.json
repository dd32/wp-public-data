We are here to help you earn more. Our product helps perfect your affiliate marketing strategy by providing a simple, yet deep dive to your click&#8217;s data. With Heroframe, you’ll know which links and programs get clicks and which ones don’t. This information will give an advantage to your affiliate promotions and increase earnings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20tracker%20slow%20down%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill the tracker slow down my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not! The tracker loads a footer JavaScript file asynchronously, so it won&#8217;t impact loading times.<br />\nAlso, your clicks data and reports are safely stored on Heroframe&#8217;s external servers. This means that your website&#8217;s database won&#8217;t be bloated with clicks data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20support%3F'>\nHow do I get support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact us using the <a href='https://heroframe.ai/contact' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support form</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20started%3F'>\nHow do I get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After installing the plugin, go to the plugin&#8217;s settings page.<br />\nSign up for a free <a href='https://app.heroframe.ai/dashboard/register' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Heroframe account</a> which takes one minute and paste your account keys in the plugin settings.<br />\nPress the &#8220;Activate Plugin&#8221; button and you&#8217;re done!

This will redirect you to your <a href='https://app.heroframe.ai/dashboard/register' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Heroframe account</a>, where you can see the detailed reports of your tracked pages and posts. You can also enable email notifications to get a weekly status of your site&#8217;s click count.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20pages%20or%20posts%20should%20i%20track%3F'>\nWhich pages or posts should I track?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should track your most popular pages or posts.
