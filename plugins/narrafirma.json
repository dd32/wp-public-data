        "description": "<p>NarraFirma is companion software to the textbook <a href=\"http://www.workingwithstories.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry</a>.</p>\n<p>Participatory narrative inquiry is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex patterns for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the recounting and interpretation of lived experience.</p>\n<h4>What is NarraFirma?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a checklist. NarraFirma provides practical guidance as you work, with questions for you to answer, recommendations based on the conditions you describe, activities that help you make decisions, and just-in-time advice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a journal. NarraFirma helps you keep careful records about what happened in your project, and it gives you places to reflect on what happened. This reminds you to keep learning as you work, and it helps you to document your project for future reference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a kiosk. NarraFirma helps you collect stories, on-line and/or off-line, based on question forms you design (with sample questions you can copy). Because story collection is integrated, there is no need to export or import data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a workstation. NarraFirma helps you explore and interpret patterns in your data (stories and answers to questions about stories), creating annotated visualizations you can use to make sense of the stories you collected.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why choose NarraFirma?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s portable. You can install NarraFirma anywhere, as a WordPress plugin or a Node.js web application. Web hosting is inexpensive, popular, and well supported. You can also install NarraFirma on your local computer and use it off-line. (Whichever installation method you choose, we strongly suggest that you set up SSL security on your web site before collecting or entering confidential or important information. Many hosting providers can help you with this task.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a team player. With NarraFirma your team can work on projects together in real time without having to hand files back and forth. You can plan your project, collect stories, discover patterns, and reflect on what you&#8217;ve learned &#8211; together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s an open book. NarraFirma is open source software. So if you have a question about how something works, you can just look at the source code to find out. If you need the software to do something it can&#8217;t do, you can add new functionality yourself or ask someone else to add it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It works in the real world. One NarraFirma installation supports multiple projects, forms, data sets, and reports. Why? Because real-life story projects are rarely simple or predictable. So go ahead and make a mess. NarraFirma is ready for it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Donations</h3>\n<p>We have spent a lot of time developing NarraFirma. We appreciate donations, and will use them to keep working on it. You can donate at <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=DGVVDT2D49QA8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PayPal</a>.</p>\n<h3>Need some help?</h3>\n<p>I offer training in the use of NarraFirma and consulting for PNI projects. If you are interested, check out my web site at <a href=\"cfkurtz.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cfkurtz.com</a>, or send me a note at cfkurtz at cfkurtz dot com.</p>\n",

page is now called the &#8220;Review graphs&#8221; page (and the introduction has been tweaked)<br />\nChanged: The main-page display of story collections is (hopefully) more intuitive (clicking on the number of stories now leads to the &#8220;Review incoming stories&#8221; page, and clicking on the number of answers now leads to the &#8220;Review graphs&#8221; page)<br />\nChanged: On the &#8220;Explore patterns&#8221; page, the export buttons have been moved to the top of the page (before they got in the way of writing observations)<br />\nChanged: The threshold for drawing extra-tall contingency charts has been reduced from 11+ to 8+ rows (for better clarity)<br />\nChanged: Improved formatting of printed session agendas (collection, sensemaking) and project presentation outline<br />\nChanged: Slightly improved wording of some of the page descriptions on section pages</p>\n<p>Fixed: A bug where the &#8220;anything else?&#8221;

(now &#8220;Review graphs&#8221;) page where making a selection in one subgraph did not remove a previous selection in another subgraph<br />\nFixed: A bug on the &#8220;Annotate stories&#8221; page where adding the first answer to a choice question also added an empty-string answer<br />\nFixed: A bug where clicking on the number of stories in a collection on the main/dashboard page did not bring up that collection on the &#8220;Review graphs&#8221; page<br />\nFixed: A bug where certain carriage-return characters within stories would cause the CSV export to misalign spreadsheet cells<br />\nFixed: A bug where, in CSV story import, there was no backup default for a missing multi-choice single-column delimiter (it now defaults to a comma)</p>\n<h4>1.6.5</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug where code to update legacy data with missing remarkable flags was setting extra flags as well (only affected projects created before v1.4.0)<br />\nFixed: Added explanation of circle colors in clustering during catalysis</p>\n<h4>1.6.4</h4>\n<p>Added: Catalysis option to hide patterns that don&#8217;t include at least one question asked about stories<br />\nChanged: Clarified a few things on the Project admin / Import &amp;

page to not work<br />\nFixed: Bug where radio-button or boolean answer showed only on last story entered on form (though data was correctly stored)</p>\n<h4>1.5.24</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug where stories appeared out of order in survey form.</p>\n<h4>1.5.23</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug I thought I had fixed long ago, in the &#8220;chooser&#8221; boxes where you add questions to a story form. Showing the question texts broke the associations. Removed them.</p>\n<h4>1.5.22</h4>\n<p>Fixed: I forgot to save one file (package.json) with the new version number in the previous release. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n<h4>1.5.21</h4>\n<p>Added: Import option for multi-choice delimited questions with write-in answers in the same column.<br />\nAdded: On &#8220;Write questions about stories/participants&#8221; pages, when import options are showing, button to directly access import guide.<br />\nAdded: On &#8220;Start story collection&#8221; page, button to directly access help on what can be changed in a story form linked to a non-empty story collection.<br />\nChanged: Improved import guide and help on updating story forms.</p>\n<h4>1.5.20</h4>\n<p>Added: Spot-check graphs page now has buttons to show selected stories (or random sample) in pop-up window for copying and pasting elsewhere.<br />\nAdded: Spot-check graphs page can now show answers to questions about stories (in a simple format) for copying and pasting elsewhere.<br />\nAdded: Additional warnings to alert the user of read-only mode, in case they edit fields without realizing they are not logged in to an account with editing privileges.</p>\n<h4>1.5.19</h4>\n<p>Added: Icons that show the actitivies on each page (manage, plan, enter, review, journal, export).

(NF needs you to do this so it can run its validation checks.)<br />\nAdded: Global error pop-up that shows the same message as is posted to the development console (for those who don&#8217;t know about or can&#8217;t find the development console).<br />\nChanged: Improved error reporting when questions that should have but are missing answer lists are imported from CSV.<br />\nChanged: Improved error message in survey itself when a question that requires an answer list has no answer list.<br />\nChanged: NF&#8217;s HTML cleanup process has always interpreted a single angle bracket (&lt;) as the start of an HTML tag (and showed an error if there is no closing bracket).

Was choking on wrong data type during story export.</p>\n<h4>1.5.14</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug in printing story cards where story-form question-answers were not appearing.</p>\n<h4>1.5.13</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug where choose-questions-for-story-form widget was not matching up questions correctly if question short names had extra (leading or trailing) blank spaces. (Now any extra blank spaces are trimmed off.)<br />\nFixed: Bug where extra (empty) lines in choice-question available-answers lists were creating malformed survey HTML, causing the error &#8220;Something went wrong loading the survey questionnaire from the server.&#8221; (Blank lines are now being trimmed out correctly.)</p>\n<h4>1.5.12</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug where the texts of edited stories did not appear correctly in the &#8220;Show story texts for copying&#8221; popup window on the &#8220;Explore Patterns&#8221; page.<br />\nFixed: Bug where annotations might not match existing stories correctly during import and bulk changes.</p>\n<h4>1.5.11</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Improved error handling for empty (no-name) questions. Was choking on them during export.</p>\n<h4>1.5.10</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug where write-in answers were missing from the display of submitted stories and answers (which survey-takers can use to save a local copy of what they said).</p>\n<h4>1.5.9</h4>\n<p>Added: Brief introductory text (with link to WWS book) to home page<br />\nAdded: Section links to home page (on right, below story collections table, for better accessibility)<br />\nChanged: Moved page descriptions from popup tooltips to texts below page links; shown by default but can be turned off in project admin options<br />\nChanged: Improved page descriptions to explain what each page is for and why you would want to use it<br />\nChanged: Section pages (Planning, Collection, etc) now start with graphical icons that echo the home-page diagram (better continuity)<br />\nChanged: Hid upper-right page navigation buttons (previous, next) in situations in which they had been disabled (gray)<br />\nChanged: Made all links have a highlighted box when hovered over (for better accessibility)<br />\nChanged: Consolidated all color designations in main CSS file into CSS vars (to make it easier to tweak colors)<br />\nChanged: Tweaked some colors to make interface a bit calmer<br />\nChanged: Removed hard-coded copy of CSS definitions for SVG-PNG conversion (now read directly from DOM); should reduce errors while changing CSS<br />\nChanged: Default font from &#8220;Arial, Helvetica&#8221; to &#8220;Helvetica, Arial&#8221; (looks better?)<br />\nFixed: &#8220;Explore patterns&#8221;

label to home-page diagram, so beginners have a hint at what to click on first<br />\nChanged: Revamped help system to (a) clarify interactions between pages and (b) add previous-next links between help pages<br />\nChanged: In story cards, added bold tags so word processors will show selected answers even if style information is lost<br />\nChanged: While looking at stories in &#8220;Review incoming stories&#8221; can now see raw JSON story data<br />\nFixed: Bug where survey could refuse to save story because it seemed to have no name (though it did)<br />\nFixed: Bug where question name with leading or trailing space did not match choice made in story form (now extra spaces are trimmed out)<br />\nFixed: Bug where &#8220;Active on web?&#8221; column on &#8220;Start story collection&#8221; page showed &#8220;checked&#8221; for all story collections (instead of yes or no)<br />\nFixed: Bug where instructions on &#8220;Create project story elements&#8221; page were out of synch with changed clustering-diagram interface</p>\n<h4>1.5.5</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Critical bug in WordPress PHP code that could cause new NarraFirma installations to show a blank screen instead of the setup page</p>\n<h4>1.5.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Small bug in display lumping code that could cause a lumped count to be off when somebody chose and then un-chose an answer</p>\n<h4>1.5.3</h4>\n<p>Added: Option to set custom graph height as well as width</p>\n<h4>1.5.2</h4>\n<p>Changed: Improved usability of clustering interface (used in planning and catalysis)<br />\nFixed: Improved error message when JSON was expected but HTML was received (the HTML could be an error message; now it is shown)<br />\nFixed: Small (probably invisible) bug where id for write-in fields was not given story id prefix</p>\n<h4>1.5.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed: Bug where catalysis report graphs did not print (list comparison was set backwards, sorry)</p>\n<h4>1.5.0</h4>\n<p>Added (survey): Multi-lingual surveys (partipant can choose language; choice is saved for graphing)<br />\nAdded (survey): Option to embed introductory video (streaming or mp4)<br />\nAdded (survey): Story collection date question (generated or imported)<br />\nAdded (survey): For all question types, option to allow write-in answer (for &#8220;other&#8221;

    "description": "<p>NarraFirma is companion software to the textbook <a href=\"http://www.workingwithstories.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Working with Stories in Your Community Or Organization: Participatory Narrative Inquiry</a>.</p>\n<p>Participatory narrative inquiry is an approach in which groups of people participate in gathering and working with raw stories of personal experience in order to make sense of complex patterns for better decision making. PNI focuses on the profound consideration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through the recounting and interpretation of lived experience.</p>\n<h4>What is NarraFirma?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a checklist. NarraFirma provides practical guidance as you work, with questions for you to answer, recommendations based on the conditions you describe, activities that help you make decisions, and just-in-time advice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a journal. NarraFirma helps you keep careful records about what happened in your project, and it gives you places to reflect on what happened. This reminds you to keep learning as you work, and it helps you to document your project for future reference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a kiosk. NarraFirma helps you collect stories, on-line and/or off-line, based on question forms you design (with sample questions you can copy). Because story collection is integrated, there is no need to export or import data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a workstation. NarraFirma helps you explore and interpret patterns in your data (stories and answers to questions about stories), creating annotated visualizations you can use to make sense of the stories you collected.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Why choose NarraFirma?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s portable. You can install NarraFirma anywhere, as a WordPress plugin or a Node.js web application. Web hosting is inexpensive, popular, and well supported. You can also install NarraFirma on your local computer and use it off-line. (Whichever installation method you choose, we strongly suggest that you set up SSL security on your web site before collecting or entering confidential or important information. Many hosting providers can help you with this task.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s a team player. With NarraFirma your team can work on projects together in real time without having to hand files back and forth. You can plan your project, collect stories, discover patterns, and reflect on what you&#8217;ve learned &#8211; together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#8217;s an open book. NarraFirma is open source software. So if you have a question about how something works, you can just look at the source code to find out. If you need the software to do something it can&#8217;t do, you can add new functionality yourself or ask someone else to add it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It works in the real world. One NarraFirma installation supports multiple projects, forms, data sets, and reports. Why? Because real-life story projects are rarely simple or predictable. So go ahead and make a mess. NarraFirma is ready for it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Donations</h3>\n<p>We have spent a lot of time developing NarraFirma. We appreciate donations, and will use them to keep working on it. You can donate at <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=DGVVDT2D49QA8\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PayPal</a>.</p>\n<h3>Need some help?</h3>\n<p>I offer training in the use of NarraFirma and consulting for PNI projects. If you are interested, check out my web site at <a href=\"cfkurtz.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cfkurtz.com</a>, or send me a note at cfkurtz at cfkurtz dot com.</p>\n",
