        "faq": "<h4>Will there be a more advanced version of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>Maybe, depends on the time I have available. I already have a full-time job.</p>\n<h4>What about performance?</h4>\n<p>The code is not optimised for performance. To illustrate, when generating the report, the plugin first selects all the users in in your WordPress intallation. For each user, it makes a separate query for each meta-key you have choosen for the report to find the value. This could potentially generate lots of queries towards the database.</p>\n<p>Example: you have 1200 users in your database, and want to produce a report using 7 report fields:</p>\n<p>1 query to find all users: 1 query 7 queries for each user: 1200 x 7 = 8400 queries In total: 8401 queries</p>\n<p>I have tested it with about 200 users and genereated reports with 10+ fields. It still takes less than 5 seconds on my test equipment. The usermeta queries are all small and hits the default indexes.</p>\n",
