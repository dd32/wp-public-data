        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20adopt%20%3F'>\nWhy should I use AdOpt ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AdOpt is the best option for websites that use cookies and have chosen Consent as the Legal Basis to support the collection of personal data.<br />\nOur system, planned within the concepts of Privacy by Design, transparently informs your website users what data is collected and manages all updated consents as required by GDPR, LGPD and CCPA, etc. This ensures that you stay safe and creates a trusting relationship with your users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20my%20website%20need%20a%20cookie%20notice%20%3F'>\nDoes my website need a cookie notice ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you collect personal data, use cookies for marketing and analytics through pixels on your website, and have chosen Consent as the Legal Basis for your company, the cookie notice will help you a lot!</p>\n<p>For, the regulations like GDPR, LGPD or CCPA, and many others, requires users to be notified about what data you collect, including third-party cookies.<br />\nTheir processing will only be valid after consent has been freely and explicitly obtained from the data subject. In addition, it is the responsibility of the company to prove &#8220;in writing&#8221; that consent has been given. All of these are tasks performed by a cookie management platform, AdOpt!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20not%20using%20those%20banners%20with%3A%20by%20continuing%20to%20browse%2C%20you%20agree%20to%20the%20use%20of%20cookies...%20%3F'>\nWhy not using those banners with: By continuing to browse, you agree to the use of cookies&#8230; ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because the law requires that consent must be &#8220;free and stated,&#8221; not &#8220;implied,&#8221; or &#8220;subjective.&#8221;<br />\nIn addition, a good cookie notice should also allow the visitor to easily and freely choose their options, without any bias of consent. Be careful with notices that use scroll as consent!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20be%20fully%20complied%20for%20lgpd%2C%20gdpr%20and%20ccpa%20using%20adopt%20%3F'>\nWill I be fully complied for LGPD, GDPR and CCPA using AdOpt ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, a Consent Management Platform like AdOpt does not cover all sides of the regulation. AdOpt operates on the first hypothesis of personal data processing which is consent (art, 7, I &#8211; LGPD, e.g.).<br />\nEach company has its own processes, so you must also observe the flow of data within your company in relation to the other obligations of the law, and even other legal basis that may supplement the consent.<br />\nThis is one of the responsibilities of the Data Protection Officer of your company, discuss this point with him/her!,<br />\nHowever, since consent is very popular in the market for companies with a digital presence, it would already be an excellent start on the road to compliance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20developer%20to%20configure%20adopt%20%3F'>\nDo I need a developer to configure AdOpt ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, it&#8230;depends!</p>\n<p>A regular installation flow would be, to paste a code (tag) into your website&#8217;s header. But, for WP users, our plugin makes this for you.<br />\nSo, you only need to insert the AdOpt BannerID Key, and it is already installed. Besides, rest assured that we have a support team that will help you if you need it, and as soon as you create an account, you will receive a complete tutorial!<br />\nfeel free to chat with us, or send any doubt to hey@goadopt.io.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
