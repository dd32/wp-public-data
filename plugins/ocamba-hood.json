        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20the%20ocamba%20hood%20plugin%20use%203rd%20party%20services%3F'>\nDoes the Ocamba Hood plugin use 3rd party services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Ocamba Hood relies on Ocamba services located at https://cdn.ocmtag.com and https://cdn.ocmhood.com. We are using https://cdn.ocmtag.com to determine if the inputted Code Key is valid, and we are using https://cdn.ocmhood.com to import the main scripts for Service Worker handlings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20ocamba%20hood%20plugin%20create%20files%20outside%20its%20plugin%20directory%3F'>\nDoes the Ocamba Hood plugin create files outside its plugin directory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. When you input the Ocamba Hood Code Key for the first time, the Ocamba Hood Plugin creates a sw.js file inside the public_html directory. File sw.js is used to install and register service workers. The importScripts() javascript function is inside the file. importScripts() is importing all logic from our servers. When the plugin is deleted, sw.js is deleted also.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
