See the following link for detail information :<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.riskified.com/documentation/stripe-gateway.html\" title=\"Guide to API Integration with Stripe as Gateway\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Guide to API Integration with Stripe as Gateway</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Riskified account yet you will have to contact their customer support. You will not be able to test Fraudify without a Riskified account.</p>\n<p>Note that Fraudify takes care of step number 2 of the guide above. You only have to do steps 1 and 3.</p>\n<p>2.a WordPress upload &#8211; For most users, this is probably the simplest installation method. To install the Fraudify plugin using this method, please follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login to your WordPress admin panel</li>\n<li>Navigate to Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload Plugin</li>\n<li>Click on Choose File and select fraudify.zip</li>\n<li>Click on Install Now</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.b FTP upload &#8211; If you would like to install the Fraudify plugin via FTP, please follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extract the fraudify.zip file you previously located. You should now see a folder named fraudify</li>\n<li>Using an FTP client, login to the server where your WordPress website is hosted</li>\n<li>Using an FTP client, navigate to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory under your WordPress website&#8217;s root directory</li>\n<li>Using an FTP client, upload the previously extracted fraudify folder to the plugins directory on your remote server</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Once the installation is complete, Fraudify plugin will be ready for use. Now all you need to do is navigate to Plugins &gt; Installed plugins and activate Fraudify plugin. After you have done this, you should see Fraudify appear in the left navigation bar of your WordPress admin panel under  Settings &gt; Fraudify.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The last step is to enter your &#8220;Shop Domain&#8221; and &#8220;Auth Token&#8221; under Settings &gt; Fraudify. Both of these items can be found in your Riskified admin panel. Your &#8220;Order notification endpoint&#8221; can be found in the top of this page. This piece information will be entered in your Riskified admin panel. See screenshots.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NOTE: The following steps are needed if you are using WooCommerce before 2.6 and using &#8220;WooCommerce Stripe Payment Gateway&#8221;. Please add the following line to the specified file:</p>\n<p>File: wp-content\\plugins\\woocommerce-gateway-stripe\\includes\\legacy\\class-wc-gateway-stripe.php</p>\n<p>Line: 349</p>\n<p>Line current looks like this: &#8220;return $post_data;&#8221;</p>\n<p>It should looks like this:</p>\n<p>&#8220;return apply_filters( &#8216;wc_stripe_generate_payment_request&#8217;, $post_data, $order, $source );&#8221;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To be able to test you have to pass an order on your website. Once that is done go to WooCommerce &gt; Orders. You will see that the Riskified shield is gray, which means &#8220;Pending&#8221;. Now go to Riskified sandbox and submit a result to this newly created transaction. Go back to your Orders list and refresh the page. You should see the Riskified shield change colors.</li>\n</ol>\n",
