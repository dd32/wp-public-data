If you want attachments displayed on most or all posts the checkbox should stay checked.</p>\n<p>Either way, you can override the option.  Adding a custom field named rAttach-on with a value of anything other than empty or a zero will display attachments regardless of the option setting.  Likewise, rAttach-off with any non-blank, non-zero value will force the page to not display attached files.</p>\n",
