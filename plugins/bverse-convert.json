That&#8217;s something pretty exhausting, actually, is something painful. Why not just write the references and have the certainty that when you submit your post all those references will be automatically converted into links to your desired service and Bible Version?<br />\nThis is basically the best practice and should save you a lot of work and time.

(Sorry for taking way to long about this request and thanks for the patience @Guido. I can only hope is not too late for this to be useful.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 6.0.1 compatible.</li>\n<li>Fixed a couple WordPress 6.0.1 compatibility issues.</li>\n<li>Shortcodes are currently disabled until we can update the code for newer WordPress versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 5.3.2 compatible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor changes. Removed older versions (tags). We will now be working from v1.3.x. We also updated the plugin Readme so it reflects is compatible with WordPress 3.8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>trunk</code> as stable tag. This was something missing or wrongly used in previous versions and, in someway, it made the plugin localization a little bit confusing since now bVerse uses WordPress language packs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Important plugin instructions were updated and now are cleaner. Less clutter.</li>\n<li>Plugin description on the <code>readme</code> file was updated according to latest updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>languages</code> directory. bVerse Convert now will solely rely on WordPress.org Language Packs which are provided by the community.</li>\n<li>Bible Language files for BibleGateway service were combined.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed available translatable strings and language files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a jQuery bug which wasn&#8217;t enqueueing the library correctly. Details on <a href=\"http://www.crossedcode.com/bverse-convert/docs/releases/13/131#fixed-a-jquery-bug-which-wasnt-enqueueing-the-library-correctly\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">1.3.1</a></li>\n<li>Added Bibles.org Service shortcode.

Details on <a href=\"http://www.crossedcode.com/bverse-convert/docs/releases/13/131#added-bibles-org-service-shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">1.3.1</a><br />\n<strong>Usage</strong>: <code>[bversebibles title=\"Genesis 1:3\"]v.3[/bversebibles]</code></li>\n<li>Fixed the Option for showing Credits while Bibles.org was selected. Previously they weren&#8217;t showing.</li>\n<li>Fixed some CSS issues for the Credits Option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now you can select <strong>Bilbles.org</strong> as your main Scriptures Reference service. Just like <strong>BibleGateway.com</strong> and <strong>Biblia.com</strong>, it will allow you to open references in a New Window and display a Popover with references inside.
