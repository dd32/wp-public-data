The WeBWorK Open Problem Library provides access to more than 50,000 assessment/homework problems created and freely shared by the members of the WeBWorK community for others to curate, remix, and use with their students.</p>\n<p>WeBWorK provides an option for students to email their professor if they have a question about a WeBWorK problem. However, this one-on-one communication model leaves students isolated from their peers and can result in the instructor answering the same question dozens of times. WeBWorK Q&amp;A helps students learn from one another by sharing their questions in a community space. Instead of working on assignments alone or interacting only with their instructor, students using WeBWorK Q&amp;A can become part of a community of learners, working together on the same material and offering mutual support. Questions can be answered by faculty, other students, tutors, and so on, enabling faster response times.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask questions anonymously</li>\n<li>Use LaTeX in questions and responses</li>\n<li>Include images in questions and responses</li>\n<li>Browse and filter questions</li>\n<li>Like helpful answers</li>\n<li>Subscribe to or unsubscribe from email notifications about a question</li>\n<li>Accessible, responsive recommended theme</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/webwork-qa-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation site</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>WeBWorK Q&amp;A was created by a team based at <a href=\"http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">City Tech</a> (New York City College of Technology, City University of New York) as part of <a href=\"https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/openinggateways/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Opening Gateways</a>, a City Tech initiative funded by the U.S. Department of Education’s Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions program* to support student success in mathematics courses that serve as gateways to STEM disciplines.</p>\n<p>WeBWorK Q&amp;A was developed in partnership with <a href=\"https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The OpenLab at City Tech</a>, an open platform for teaching, learning, and collaboration; anyone can create an OpenLab using the free and open source software <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/commons-in-a-box/\" rel=\"ugc\">Commons In A Box OpenLab</a>.</p>\n<p><em>*Disclaimer: materials developed do not necessarily represent the policy of the Department of Education, and you should not assume endorsement by the Federal Government.</em></p>\n",
