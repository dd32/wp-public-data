Future versions will protect the themes page (themes.php).</p>\n<h4>I can still update my theme from the Themes page, even with protection.  What gives?</h4>\n<p>That&#8217;s a known issue. Future versions will protect theme updates from the Themes screen.</p>\n<h4>Does this protect plugin or theme deletion?</h4>\n<p>Not at this time, but that&#8217;s planned for a future version.</p>\n<h4>Does this protect core?</h4>\n<p>Not at this time, but that&#8217;s planned for a future version.</p>\n",
