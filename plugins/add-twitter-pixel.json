And there&#8217;s particularly good news for smaller businesses: Twitter reports that <a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/basics/grow-and-engage-your-follower-base\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">60% of users</a> purchase from an SMB.</p>\n<p>Beyond direct conversion, Twitter is a popular resource for customers along the purchasing funnel. Nearly half (49%) of female Twitter users say Twitter content has influenced their purchase decisions &#8212;- while only 7% have made a purchase through Twitter. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-trends/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">17% of men</a> reported in a BigCommerce survey that they&#8217;d purchased something directly from a Tweet in their timeline.</p>\n<p>The data speaks for itself: Twitter is prime real estate for brands wanting to increase conversion, revenue and social proof (e.g., customer reviews via social media). The advertising platform represents a wide variety of interests and demographics, and is particularly relevant for college-educated audiences under 50. Some <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/social-media-update-2014/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">36% of Twitter users</a> visit the site daily, with 22% saying they go on Twitter several times a day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-guide-to-twitter-advertising/#why-you-should-consider-advertising-on-twitter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Source</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
