Smart Layouts were designed to allow the user to<br />\ngroup resizeable windows within a single container that can be easily shared or embedded within<br />\nother online media, while retaining the content determined by the user and presenting live data.<br />\nThis feature is based on the existing Trade Ideas concept of the user’s ability to create their<br />\nown channel layouts and share them using the cloud features. But now they can be displayed outside<br />\nof the Trade Ideas client or web application. Trade Ideas Vision allows the user to embed  a layout<br />\nvia an iframe within the user&#8217;s content.  The shortcode to embed your layout window within your content is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>[tivision code=\"cloudcode\" height=\"height\" width=\"width\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to use this plugin, you will also need to have an active Trade Ideas account<br />\nin order  to create the Smart Layouts to be displayed as well to generate the cloudcode to paste into the shortcode above.</p>\n<p>Please refer to Installation for further details.</p>\n",

This popup shows the windows currently being displayed in the application.</li>\n<li>On the &#8216;Current Windows&#8217; popup, click the &#8216;Close All&#8217; button, after which all current windows being displayed will close.</li>\n<li>Now go to the toolbar and select  New &gt; then the window type that you wish to be included within your Smart Layout.</li>\n<li>You may configure your selected window by right-clicking in the body of the window and selecting &#8216;Configure&#8217; which will then display the Config Window.</li>\n<li>After having configured your selected window with the desired strategies and/or filters, exit the Config Window by clicking OK.</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 4 &#8211; 6 above for all additional windows that you wish to be included in your Smart Layout.</li>\n<li>Once you have the windows that you want to display in your Smart Layout configured correctly, position them on screen in roughly the layout that you want them to appear.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Retrieve Your Cloud Code From Your Saved Layout</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Now from the toolbar, click &#8216;Smart Layout&#8217;.

This<br />\nvalue is 32 characters long.  If you accidentally enter a value which is not 32 characters long (or enter no code at all) , a default<br />\nwindow will be displayed.  If you enter a code which is 32 characters long, yet doesn&#8217;t correspond to any existing layout<br />\nan error message will be displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the data shown in the layout windows in real time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the data is delayed by 15-20 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve included charts in my layout but they do not appear.  Why can&#8217;t I see them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Charts only appear when there&#8217;s live data.  Trade Ideas Vision only uses delayed data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t my Single Stock Window symbol link with other windows that may be present in my layout?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This feature does not work in Trade Ideas Vision.  Layouts are displayed within an iframe. Due to cross-site security restrictions,<br />\nclicking on the iframe will not be captured by the content of the iframe(your layout).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
