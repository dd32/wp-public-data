That is the provisions that the WP Super Cache plugin author has setup.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is WP Readable Compatible With W3 Total Cache?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are compatible with v.9.2.4 which is right now the latest version. The only thing we ask our users to do is go to your W3 Total Cache Settings, click on Performance, then User Agent Groups, and then enable the group name &#8220;high&#8221;. The desktop version is cached by the plugin while the mobile version does not get cached at all as it&#8217;s apart of the user agents on &#8220;high&#8221; list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is WP Readable Compatible With Other Cache Plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We haven&#8217;t done much testing outside of the major cache plugins.
