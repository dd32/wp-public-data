Countless trainings do not help because WordPress lacks an intuitive handling. First of all it is important to know what purpose the new WordPress website should serve. Furthermore it is important to know how well your customer already knows WordPress. Depending on the level of knowledge, you will definitely help him to learn how to use his new WordPress website much faster with Quickdashboard. With Quickdashboard you can let your customer get started with WordPress already in the development phase with his own account! He can then immediately familiarize himself with the functions for which the website is being built.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20quickdashboard%20also%20work%20for%20mobile%3F'>\nDoes Quickdashboard also work for mobile?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Quickdashboard is mobile ready.
