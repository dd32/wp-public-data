        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20makes%20nudgify%20unique%3F'>\nWhat makes Nudgify unique?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike other Social Proof plugins or WordPress/WooCommerce Sales Notifications, Nudgify was designed to add <strong>real-world context</strong> to your website.</p>\n<p>Nudges create a more human user experience, increasing your sales and sign-ups AND improving your user experience. Not only is it much more than a simple Social Proof app for WordPress, it is also a customer-friendly alternative.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elegant and non-intrusive messages</li>\n<li>Solutions for every industry and any budget</li>\n<li>Built for humans – easy to use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of the range of messages you can display, and the focus on context rather than sales, Nudgify is a popular alternative to Provesource, FOMO, Beeketing, Fera.ai, Trustpulse and Useproof.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20free%20trial%20include%3F'>\nWhat does the Free Trial include?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Free Trial gives you all the features available with a Plus plan. You get the full range of Social Proof notifications, FOMO notifications, Urgency and Friction Nudges, plus advanced integrations and styles.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20the%20free%20trial%20ends%3F'>\nWhat happens when the Free Trial ends?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the trial ends your account will simply become inactive – there is NO automatic subscription after your free trial and NO need to unsubscribe manually. To reactivate your account after the trial period, you simply need to pick a paid plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20average%20roi%20for%20nudgify%3F'>\nWhat is the average ROI for Nudgify?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no average ROI, because it depends on your website and your goals. However, the impact that Social Proof notifications have on an eCommerce website speaks for itself and the importance of real-world context to the overall customer experience has been highlighted by marketing consultancies such as McKinsey and PWC.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20built%20nudgify%3F'>\nWho Built Nudgify?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike the majority of Social Proof or Sales Notification apps, Nudgify was designed by a combination of web marketers and software developers. That means the content AND the functionality are perfectly tailored to modern marketing teams.</p>\n<p>The combination of unique features, user-friendliness and persuasive marketing content makes Nudgify a popular alternative to apps like NotificationX, Bizzy, Evidence and ProofFactor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20websites%20can%20i%20use%20nudgify%20on%3F'>\nHow many websites can I use Nudgify on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our pricing is per website. That means that you can add as many websites to your Nudgify account as you like, and multiply your plan price by the number of websites you have, e.g. if you use our Lite plan on 2 websites, it will cost 2x $0.99  = $1.98/month.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
