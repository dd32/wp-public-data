        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/sales-health-monitor-for-woocommerce</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the Sales Health Monitor for WooCommerce menu item in the WordPress admin area to configure the plugin settings</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20monitor%20orders%3F'>\nHow does the plugin monitor orders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin allows you to set expectations for your order volume. You specify how many orders (X) you expect within a certain number of hours (Y). For example, you might expect at least 10 orders every 12 hours.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20does%20the%20plugin%20check%20for%20new%20orders%3F'>\nHow often does the plugin check for new orders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An external service, located at https://sales-health-monitor.itgoldman.com, monitors your website and checks for new orders every hour. If the number of new orders within your specified time frame falls below your set threshold, an email notification is sent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20my%20privacy%20secured%3F'>\nIs my privacy secured?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Only the minimum necessary data is transmitted: your site&#8217;s URL and the aggregated number of orders. No sensitive customer or order details are shared.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20email%20address%20for%20notifications%3F'>\nCan I change the email address for notifications?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can set any email address for notifications in the plugin settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20monitoring%20done%20on%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nIs the monitoring done on my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the actual monitoring is performed by an external server. Your WordPress site provides the necessary information to this server, which then performs the hourly checks and sends notifications if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20enable%20or%20disable%20the%20service%3F'>\nHow do I enable or disable the service?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can deactivate the plugin anytime, or you can pause monitoring by unchecking the &#8220;Enable Monitoring&#8221; checkbox.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
