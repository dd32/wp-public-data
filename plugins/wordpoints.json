You can get your license key for an<br />\nextension from the <a href=\"https://wordpoints.org/my-account/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">My Account</a> page.</li>\n<li>New <code>[wordpoints_rank_list]</code> shortcode to display a list of the ranks that users<br />\ncan have on the site.</li>\n<li>Reaction settings can now include conditions on a post&#8217;s terms. This means that<br />\npoints can now be awarded for posts based on tags, categories, or custom<br />\ntaxonomies.</li>\n<li>When no Reactions have been created for a points type yet, WordPoints will offer to<br />\ncreate some demo reactions to help you get started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Modules&#8221; are now called &#8220;extensions&#8221;. The term &#8220;extension&#8221; is more familiar and<br />\nobvious in its meaning than &#8220;module&#8221;.</li>\n<li>When deleting a points type, you are now required to type the name of the points<br />\ntype in the confirmation dialog. This helps to ensure that points types aren&#8217;t<br />\ndeleted accidentally. In addition, the confirmation dialogs for when a Reaction or<br />\nRank is being deleted have been updated to so the reaction description or rank<br />\nname, respectively, so that it is clear which rank or reaction is being deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Top Users points table will always order results for users with same number of<br />\npoints consistently, rather than it being more-or-less random. If two users have<br />\nthe same number of points, the one with the lowest ID will come before the one with<br />\nthe higher ID number. Thanks to Gspin96 for the patch!</li>\n<li>Improved performance of the Ranks component. Creating ranks should be much quicker<br />\non sites with large numbers of users now.</li>\n<li>The Max setting of the Contains condition for Reactions now interprets an empty max<br />\nto mean no maximum, rather than a maximum of 0.</li>\n<li>Corrected the invalid HTML that was breaking the user profile admin screen.</li>\n<li>Fatal errors when viewing points logs after deactivating the BuddyPress plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.0 — 2017-03-14</h4>\n<p>Security</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hardening: Module files are now validated before deletion.

Available conditions are<br />\ncurrently Equals, Greater Than, and Less Than.</li>\n<li>The ability to set Conditions for a reaction or award points based on the parent of<br />\na page or other hierarchical post type.</li>\n<li>The ability to set Conditions for a reaction on the comment content, or attributes<br />\nof the parent comment if the comment is a reply.</li>\n<li>Support for events that involve multiple entities (like when a user is added to a<br />\ngroup, for example).</li>\n<li>Better support for right-to-left locales.</li>\n<li>More comments to aid in translation of the plugin.</li>\n<li>Meta box with shortcode examples to the Points Types screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS and JS files to be minified.</li>\n<li>Reactions UI to improve accessibility for unsighted users by allowing success and<br />\nerror messages to be spoken aloud by assistive technology.</li>\n<li>Network-active modules to also be displayed on the per-site Modules screens on<br />\nmultisite.</li>\n<li>Widgets to improve display in small sidebars. The settings now allow for some of<br />\nthe columns in the points logs tables to be hidden, horizontal scrolling to be<br />\nenabled, and the user names to be hidden so that just the avatars are displayed.<br />\nAlso makes it so that the user rank is not displayed next to the user name within<br />\nthe widgets.</li>\n<li>The Comment Leave event to only be fired for comments, not pingbacks or trackbacks.</li>\n<li>The name of the &#8220;Configure&#8221; screen to &#8220;Settings&#8221; instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Error messages being displayed when first adding a widget to the site via the<br />\nCustomizer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Older Versions</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to view the changelog for older versions, see the <a href=\"https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wordpoints/trunk/changelog.txt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">changelog.txt</a> file included with the plugin.</p>\n"
