Without the plugin you should be able to drag a new file to upload it even if the Media Library tab is open. This plugin just makes it easier for anyone who has not discovered that this is the case.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20admin%20page%3F'>\nWhere is the admin page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t have any options, so there isn&#8217;t one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%20doesn%27t%20work.%20whats%20up%20with%20that%3F'>\nIt doesn&#8217;t work. Whats up with that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin does work on the sites it has been tested on. If it is not working for you, please ask for help on the plugin&#8217;s support forum, but please don&#8217;t embarass yourself by leaving a poor review before asking for help.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20using%20the%20plugin%20and%20love%20it%2C%20how%20can%20i%20show%20my%20appreciation%3F'>\nI am using the plugin and love it, how can I show my appreciation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can donate via <a href=\"https://cubecolour.co.uk/wp/\" title=\"cubecolour donation page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my donation page</a>.
