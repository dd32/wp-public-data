It MUST have the same number of semicolons of first line.<br />\n5-All other lines must have: the column, it&#8217;s correspondence and if this will show a URI or not. Semicolon separated.</p>\n<p>3.I want a correspondence with a prefix that doesn&#8217;t exists. WHat should I do?<br />\nYou can upload other prefixes than the ones that already exists in the plugin. (Pink part)<br />\n1)Enter the prefix in the left input.<br />\n2)Enter the prefix&#8217;s URI in the right input.<br />\n3)Click Save.<br />\nAnd that&#8217;s all.</p>\n",
