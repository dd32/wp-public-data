This breaks the fragile creative state and moves the brain into the analytical, critical mode &#8212; which is the exact opposite of free-flowing creativity.</p>\n<p>The key to creativity flowing through your writing is to simply keep typing, stay in motion.</p>\n<p>Remember that editing happens AFTER writing, not during, and especially not before.  While writing, allow yourself to only and simply write, free in the safety of knowing that you will come into the editing phase soon, where you will perfect your work.</p>\n<p>To help keep you writing, Flow will remove everything from the screen. It will not allow you to delete or backspace, training you to keep going forward. It will only show you one letter at a time. Also try Ninja Mode, which will remove that one letter for a totally sleek and stealthy writing experience.</p>\n<p>Because Flow is a very unique writing experience, we recommend that you give yourself some time to play around with it and let your mind and body adjust to this new writing style.  Just keep writing and see what happens.  Notice how you feel, we think it&#8217;ll be totally great.</p>\n<p>Wishing you much fun and Flow,<br />\nTeam ilys &lt;3<br />\nOfficial Sponsor of National Novel Writing Month</p>\n",
