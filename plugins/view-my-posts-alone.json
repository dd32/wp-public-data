In the (view_my_posts_alone.php) . There will be a IF condition with this line if (strpos( $_SERVER[ &#8216;REQUEST_URI&#8217; ], &#8216;/wp-admin/edit.php&#8217; ) !== false). You have to add the OR Condition and add as much as CPT that you need.<br />\n(E.g) if (strpos( $_SERVER[ &#8216;REQUEST_URI&#8217; ], &#8216;/wp-admin/edit.php&#8217; ) !== false) || (strpos( $_SERVER[ &#8216;REQUEST_URI&#8217; ], &#8216;/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=[YOUR_CUSTOM_POST_TYPE_SLUG]&#8217; ) !== false).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin conflict with any other plugins that we have installed in our blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all, it’s a very simple and effective plugin and there are no issues with other plugins so far as we have tested it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
