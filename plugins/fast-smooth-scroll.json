        "description": "<p>This plugin takes a <strong>no-frills approach</strong> to smooth scrolling, providing a <strong>fast, performant, and accessible user experience</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Simply enable the plugin</strong>, and any anchor links (i.e. links that point to other content on the same page) will provide a smooth scrolling experience rather than abruptly jumping to the destination content.</p>\n<p>The plugin relies on the <strong>latest smooth scrolling techniques using CSS</strong>. A very <strong>fast and lightweight JavaScript polyfill (&lt;1KB)</strong> is included to equally support older browsers, including Internet Explorer. So you can rest assured this plugin covers your userbase.</p>\n<p><h4>Why does this plugin exist?</h4>\n</p>\n<p>Smooth scrolling is a basic feature to enhance user experience, so it shouldn&#8217;t come at a performance cost that at the same time harms user experience elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Several other smooth scrolling solutions unfortunately rely on outdated techniques such as jQuery, which can hurt your site&#8217;s performance, and is really not necessary to provide the feature. Even browsers as old as 10 years don&#8217;t need jQuery to achieve smooth scrolling. In fact, as of today you can achieve the behavior with only CSS, not even requiring any JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Another potential reason to use this plugin over other smooth scrolling solutions is accessibility: This plugin respects the user preferences around reduced motion, which can avoid discomfort for those with <a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/understanding-vestibular-disorders/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">vestibular motion disorders</a>.</p>\n<p>You may already use a smooth scrolling plugin, but it is worth double checking that it doesn&#8217;t use one of those outdated, inefficient, and inaccessible approaches that may slow down your site or affect user interactions negatively.</p>\n<h4>More technical details</h4>\n<p>This plugin simply enables smooth scrolling with the <code>scroll-behavior</code> CSS property. This property has been supported by all modern browsers for a few years now.</p>\n<p>To support older browsers as well, a lightweight JavaScript polyfill is included, which is only loaded for browsers that lack support for the CSS property and doesn&#8217;t require any dependencies. The polyfill uses latest JavaScript user experience best practices such as <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> to provide a smooth scrolling experience without potentially blocking other user interactions.</p>\n<p>For relevant browser support, see:<br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/css-scroll-behavior\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CSS Scroll-behavior</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_scroll-padding-top\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CSS property: scroll-padding-top</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/prefers-reduced-motion\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">prefers-reduced-motion media query</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">requestAnimationFrame</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/high-resolution-time\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">High Resolution Time API</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_nodelist\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">NodeList API</a><br />\n* <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_scrollto\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Window API: scrollTo</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>fast-smooth-scroll</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory or download it through the WordPress backend.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20configure%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhere can I configure the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t come with a settings screen or options of any kind. You install it, and it just works.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20scrolling%20slightly%20off%20vertically%3F'>\nWhy is the scrolling slightly off vertically?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the anchor scrolling doesn&#8217;t end up in exactly the right place, there is a good chance this is happening because your site uses a fixed header or another element that overlaps the main content.</p>\n<p>For such situations, the plugin supports setting a scroll offset. You can use the filter <code>fast_smooth_scroll_offset</code> to set such an offset in pixels (default is 0, i.e. no offset).</p>\n<p>For example, with the following code you would set a scroll offset of 120 pixels. This works for both the default CSS-only implementation as well as for the JavaScript polyfill.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nfunction myplugin_get_custom_scroll_offset() {\n    return 120;\n}\nadd_filter( 'fast_smooth_scroll_offset', 'myplugin_get_custom_scroll_offset' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20support%20reduced%20motion%20preferences%3F'>\nDoes the plugin support reduced motion preferences?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! For better accessibility, clients that are configured to reduce motion will not be affected by the smooth scroll behavior.</p>\n<p>The <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query is used to detect such a preference. Note that this only works with the CSS-only solution, as the older browsers that would require the JavaScript polyfill do not support this preference.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20care%20about%20smooth%20scrolling%20for%20older%20browsers.%20how%20can%20i%20disable%20the%20javascript%20polyfill%3F'>\nI don&#8217;t care about smooth scrolling for older browsers. How can I disable the JavaScript polyfill?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the JavaScript polyfill is only loaded when needed and is extremely lightweight, there&#8217;s probably not much value in disabling it. However, if you want to go for the purist solution of only relying on the CSS approach, you can certainly do so, using the built-in filter <code>fast_smooth_scroll_enqueue_scripts</code>, which defaults to <code>true</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, with the following code you would ensure the JavaScript polyfill and even the simple feature detection check are never loaded:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nadd_filter( 'fast_smooth_scroll_enqueue_scripts', '__return_false' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20test%20the%20javascript%20polyfill%3F'>\nHow can I test the JavaScript polyfill?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely, you are using a modern browser which therefore does not trigger the JavaScript polyfill to load.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a legacy browser handy, you can still test the behavior: You&#8217;ll need to be logged in as an administrator, and then you can add a query parameter <code>fast_smooth_scroll_debug_polyfill=1</code> to any URL. For example, in case of the home page:</p>\n<pre><code>https://my-site.com/?fast_smooth_scroll_debug_polyfill=1\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20should%20i%20submit%20my%20support%20request%3F'>\nWhere should I submit my support request?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For regular support requests, please use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/fast-smooth-scroll\" rel=\"ugc\">wordpress.org support forums</a>.
