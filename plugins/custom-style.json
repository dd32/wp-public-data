If you could just change the main color to match your liking, your companys style, .. whatever!</p>\n<p>It’s actually easy in WordPress, because you have direct access to your themes&#8217; style files. Just use <code>Appearance -&gt; Editor</code> inside the Dashboard and there you go. That’s great until the other day you update your theme because a new, improved and of course much better version has been released. Then all your custom changes are gone and you have to start from scratch again.</p>\n<p>A much better way is to save additional CSS rules in the blog’s database and include them inside a <code>&lt; style/&gt;</code> element. Of course there must also be a way to enter those rules via the Dahsboard. And this is exactly what this plugin is all about!</p>\n<p>This simple plugin will add a <code>&lt;style&gt;..&lt;/style&gt;</code> element to <code>&lt;head /&gt;</code>, thus allowing the administrator to customize the &#8220;look&#8221; of the theme used without actually changing one of the theme&#8217;s files. This allows you to simply update the theme without loosing your valueable changes.</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p>If you require any help, if something is not working, if you have an<br />\nidea for improvement, critics, please do not hesitate to contact me by sending an<br />\nemail to <code>wh [at] haefelinger [dot] it</code> or visit the plugin&#8217;s home<br />\npage at <a href=\"http://workbench.haefelinger.it/project/custom-style\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://workbench.haefelinger.it/project/custom-style</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Basic Installation</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>custom-style</code> into <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>The plugin is now installed and ready for usage (see Usage section).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Once installed and activated, sub menu item &#8216;Custom Style&#8217; is added to<br />\nmenu &#8216;Appearance&#8217; in your Dashboard. Select that menu item, add some<br />\nCSS rules into the text field and save it. Then reload your WordPress<br />\nBlog. If you then look at your blog&#8217;s HTML source code, you should see<br />\na <code>&lt;style&gt;..&lt;/style&gt;</code> element in the head element with your content.</p>\n<h4>Advanced Usage</h4>\n<p>Depending on your CSS rules, you may need to refer to files in your<br />\ntheme. A typical example is the usage of a background image as shown<br />\nbelow:</p>\n<pre><code>    #header {\n      background-image: url( &lt;my theme url&gt;/images/my-bg-image.jpg );\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using a hardwired URL here is possible but a rather ugly<br />\nsolution. Especially if you prefer to install themes having version<br />\nnumbers in their folder name.</p>\n<p>To support a location independant CSS addition, &#8216;custom-style&#8217;<br />\nsupports the syntax</p>\n<pre><code>     {bloginfo:word}\n</code></pre>\n<p>where &#8216;word&#8217; is an arbitrary word (or absent). Such a &#8216;custom<br />\nexpression&#8217; is evaluated as</p>\n<pre><code>        bloginfo('word')\n</code></pre>\n<p>See https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/bloginfo for further<br />\ninformation about &#8216;bloginfo&#8217;.</p>\n<p>This eventually allows you to solve the problem above like</p>\n<pre><code> #header {\n   background-image: url({bloginfo:template_url}/images/my-bg-image.jpg );\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>cause <code>bloginfo(\"template_url\")</code> evaluates to your blog&#8217;s theme URL.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>No &lt;style&gt;..&lt;/style&gt; in my &lt;head /&gt; element?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin depends on the usage of <code>&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;</code>. So your<br />\n    header.php file should look something like</p>\n<pre><code>       &lt;head&gt; .. &lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt; .. &lt;/head&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>There is a &lt;style&gt;.. in my &lt; element &#8211; no visible effect though!?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that your CSS styles are not overridden by <code>&lt;style /&gt;</code><br />\nelements later in your HTML code. It&#8217;s therefore advised to add <code>&lt;?php<br />\nwp_head(); ?&gt;</code> near <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>, preferable</p>\n<pre><code>       &lt;head&gt; .. &lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make also sure that your CSS rules are really picked up! It might very<br />\nwell be the case that your CSS rules are overriden by another CSS<br />\nrules which is more selective! Try to use the &#8220;!important&#8221; rule when<br />\nin doubt.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No functional changes &#8211; just wrestling with this readme file.
