You can visit the Textile docs if you want to know more about how to use their tools: https://docs.textile.io/tutorials/hub/web-app/</p>\n<p>So with Typescript we import the Textile libraries needed to create for example Buckets.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to know how to programm to use this tools. However a good understanding about Textile Tools would help. Please refer to official docs if needed: https://docs.textile.io/hub/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20file%20admin%2Fjs%2Fwptextileplugin_admin.js%3F'>\nWhat is the file admin/js/wptextileplugin_admin.js?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because Textile libraries were created using Typescript we need to generate a transpiled file. Nevertheless we include the original Typescript sources that we created so any user can modify this plugin as needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20typescript%20sources%3F'>\nWhere are the Typescript sources?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The typescript files that we developed are on the typescript folder.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
