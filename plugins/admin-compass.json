It doesn&#8217;t perform any destructive operations since it generates a dedicated search index. On the other hand we are securing the access to the search index.</p>\n<p>As of today we recommend testing it in staging environment and pay special attention to the search index that has following naming convention:</p>\n<pre><code>/wp-content/admin_compass_[random characters].db\n</code></pre>\n<p>We recommend securing it manually using .htaccess</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20open%20the%20search%20palette%3F'>\nHow do I open the search palette?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can open the search palette by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + F, or by clicking the &#8220;magnifying glass&#8221; icon in the WordPress admin top-bar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20keyboard%20shortcut%3F'>\nCan I change the keyboard shortcut?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, the keyboard shortcut is not customizable, but we&#8217;re planning to add this feature in a future update.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20woocommerce%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It will be compatible with upcoming PRO version. Once available it will be able to search for products and orders if WooCommerce is installed and activated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20secure%20is%20the%20search%20index%3F'>\nHow secure is the search index?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The search index is stored in a SQLite database with a randomized filename, located in a protected directory within your WordPress installation. The database file permissions are set to be restrictive,</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20on%20a%20multisite%20installation%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin on a multisite installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While the plugin should work on individual sites within a multisite installation, it has not been extensively tested in a multisite environment. Use with caution and test thoroughly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
