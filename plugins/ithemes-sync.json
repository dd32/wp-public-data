You can <a href=\"https://go.solidwp.com/central-30-day-trial\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">signup today</a>, test it out, and if you are unsatisfied reach out to our team to ask about our 30-day refund policy.

The SolidWP Help Desk offers private, ticketed support to protect your privacy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20solid%20central%20secure%3F'>\nIs Solid Central secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Solid Central uses industry-standard SSL technology to encrypt all communication between your Central dashboard and the client sites you connect to it.
