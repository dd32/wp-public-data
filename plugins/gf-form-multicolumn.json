Create a new row of separated columns by selecting the Row Start button in the Multiple Columns Field box on the right-hand side of the Gravity Forms form page.<br />\n5. Add the fields that you want in the column.<br />\n6. Create a Column Break to separate to the next column, or Row End to end the column division and the field row.<br />\n7. Repeat 4-6 as necessary.<br />\n8. Click the Update button to save the changes.</p>\n<p>CSS and JS included with the plugin can be toggled on and off in the Form Settings for the individual form.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Settings -&gt; Form Settings once a form has been selected, visit the section titled Multiple Columns.
