Consider this as a beta test. The plugin will be constantly improved and we&#8217;re sure one day, when we feel it is ready to be used on a universal scale, we&#8217;ll definitely do it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat kind of blocks are provided?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the initial, release we decided to go with three custom blocks including a Carousel(powered by bxSlider), a Call to Action Section and a Information Box. We prioritised quality over quantity, so instead of providing a multitude of blocks. There are three well refined (we hope) blocks.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
