In the settings for each form you can set a limit on the number of failed submissions from the same user in a given timeframe. Once the limit is reached, further attempts to submit the form by the same user will result in an error, even if the submitted data is otherwise valid.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20help%3F'>\nHow can I help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most important thing you can do is to download and use the plugin!
