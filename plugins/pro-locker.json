        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat does this plugin address?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The purpose of this plugin is to provide greater reach of your content through the means of share locking. Let’s say you have an interesting content to share (be it news, pictures, videos, among other types of content), and you wish to maximize reach by having a mechanism for virality. You just have to lock that content with our plugin and configure the sharing requirements (hit counter) per visitor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat’s a good number to set up as the hit number?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We recommend keeping it fairly low, perhaps 2 or 3 is a good choice. Making it big enough will make people try to cheat on it using proxies or VPNs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is a Prokey and if a Prokey has been abused, what can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A Prokey is a sharing link instance ID, which identifies a visitor from another and counts hits against to. If a Prokey has been abused, every Prokey has an IP address associated with it, so you can add it to the blacklist mechanism we have also shipped with this release. An IP address blacklisted can’t create new Prokeys nor count hits for other Prokeys.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
