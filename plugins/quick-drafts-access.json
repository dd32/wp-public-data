Filters are also provided to disable the plugin from ever showing the &#8220;All Drafts&#8221; or the &#8220;My Drafts&#8221; links.</p>\n<p>On admin listings of only draft posts, this plugin also adds a dropdown above the table that allows for the listing to be filtered by the selected draft author.

By default, the plugin does NOT display the drafts links if no drafts are present for that post type.
