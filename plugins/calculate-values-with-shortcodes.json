        "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted to calculate some values dynamically to display in your posts? Let&#8217;s say you have some shortcodes that retrieve values in real time from the database. Now you want to perform some calculations on those shortcodes and display the results in your posts or pages. This plugin allows you to use a simple [calculate] shortcode with the expression inside to display these values in real time!</p>\n<p>So an expression like [calculate]2+3*4[/calculate] will return the value &#8220;14&#8221;. Now just replace any numeric value with a shortcode that returns a number and you&#8217;re set.</p>\n<h3>Attributes</h3>\n<p>You can use the &#8220;dec&#8221; attribute to specify the number of decimal digits you want to round the result up to. The default is &#8220;0&#8221;. Meaning that by default, all results will be rounded to an integer.</p>\n<p>For international number formatting, you can use the &#8220;int&#8221; attribute to specify a locale. For example, int=&#8221;fr_FR&#8221; will format the numbers according to the french locale!</p>\n<p>See screenshots for illustrations.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use this to display values in a table that are constantly changing. Or refer to dynamic prices multiplied by some value. The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>You can see a real world example of this plugin at work <a href=\"https://www.wp-tweaks.com/how-to-calculate-values-in-wordpress-posts-and-pages/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here:</a></p>\n<p>The best part is, it doesn&#8217;t use dangerous functions like &#8220;eval&#8221; to work &#8211; which means all authors can use it safely. There&#8217;s no danger of it breaking your site.</p>\n",

        "changelog": "<h4>2.3</h4>\n<p>Changed &lt;? to &lt;?php in evalmath.class.php<br />\nRemoved the deprecated &#8220;money_format&#8221; function and replaced it with NumberFormatter instead</p>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<p>Strip out HTML from any inside shortcodes</p>\n<h4>2.1.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed a potential deprecation error: &#8220;Methods with the same name as their class will not be constructors in a future version of PHP&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thanks to Kristina for pointing it out!</p>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<p>Strip HTML from inside shortcodes</p>\n<p>Added a new optional &#8220;int&#8221; attribute which will format the output in a local currency. So for example, [calculate int=&#8221;fr_FR&#8221;]15.00[/calculate] will return 15,00</p>\n<p>Fixed a potential deprecation error: &#8220;Methods with the same name as their class will not be constructors in a future version of PHP&#8221;</p>\n"
