You know those addresses are fake so you can add them to the filter list. However, remember the more specific you go, the less chances you get to stop the order. ie. Fake order with &#8220;bbbb&#8221; as the company name. No real person would that information so create a filter of &#8220;bbb&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20an%20included%20list%20of%20filters%20with%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nIs there an included list of filters with the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time we do not include a preset list of filters for complete customization.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
