Simply click this and your heatmap will be calculated.  Please note that if you have a large number of clicks this process may take a few minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How long does it take to process each pages heatmap?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you click on display heatmap the processing time varies depending on how many clicks you have had on your site.  For a few hundred clicks the processing will take a few seconds.  or a few thousand clicks it could take a few minutes.  As with most heatmap tools you don&#8217;t want to run your heatmap for more then about a week to get good results.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change my websites HTML/Layout while I am tracking clicks?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since WP Super Heatmap actually uses the structure of your Website to track clicks it is highly <strong>not recommended</strong> to modify your HTML/Layout while tracking clicks.  If you would like to change the structure or layout of your site you should clear the database and start a new heatmap.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
