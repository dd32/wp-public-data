You will need to fill out most fields in order for the plugin to work correctly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MailChimp Key: This is a random string of letters and numbers that you need to enter in order to create a webhook in MailChimp. You can type anything you want here &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to make sense. Something like e6uyUjSzNt9XTU51M1r5 is perfect. If this field is not filled in, your MailChimp subscribers won&#8217;t receive a discount code. If you are not using MailChimp, leave this blank.</li>\n<li>ActiveCampaign Key: This is a random string of letters and numbers that you need to enter in order to create a webhook in ActiveCampaign. You can type anything you want here &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have to make sense. Something like e6uyUjSzNt9XTU51M1r5 is perfect. If this field is not filled in, your ActiveCampaign subscribers won&#8217;t receive a discount code. If you are not using ActiveCampaign, leave this blank.</li>\n<li>Discount Name: Enter a label to identify discount codes in EDD as having been generated by this plugin. For example, enter &#8220;Email subscriber discount&#8221;. Regardless of what you enter here the subscriber&#8217;s email address will be added to the end of the discount name.</li>\n<li>Discount Amount: Enter how much the discount should be for. Do not enter any symbols like $ or % just the number (i.e. 20)</li>\n<li>Discount Type: Enter the type of discount you are offering &#8211; either a percentage or a flat rate.</li>\n<li>Use once per customer: If the discount should expire after it has been used check this box.</li>\n<li>Max Uses: If you want to make the discount available to customers to use multiple times enter how many times here.</li>\n<li>Email Subject: This is the subject line used in the email sent to your subscribers. Something like &#8220;Thanks for subscribing to Acme Co. Newsletter&#8221; would work.</li>\n<li>From Email Address: Enter the address the discount code should be sent from. If you have a customer support or sales address, this would be a good email to enter. Try to make it an @yourdomain.com address, as some recipients may have trouble receiving from a Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. address.</li>\n<li>From Display Name: Enter your name or the company name that the email should come from.</li>\n<li>Customer Placeholder Name: Enter a generic greeting name if you are using the {firstname} placeholder tag provided. This will allow you to have a greeting to the customer if they do not enter a name in their signup.</li>\n<li>Message: Enter the message your customers should receive in the email. Be sure to include the {code} placeholder tag, otherwise they will not receive the discount code.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20up%20webhooks%20in%20mailchimp%3F'>\nHow do I set up webhooks in MailChimp?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the technical details on how to create a webhook through MailChimp by <a href=\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/integrations/api-integrations/how-to-set-up-webhooks\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">clicking here</a>.</p>\n<p>General steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click Lists tab</li>\n<li>Click your list name</li>\n<li>Click Settings &gt; Webhooks</li>\n<li>Click create new webhook button</li>\n<li>Paste your callback URL</li>\n<li>Under &#8220;What type of updates should we send&#8221; check only Subscribes (uncheck all other boxes)</li>\n<li>Under &#8220;Only send updates when a change is made&#8230;&#8221; keep all checked unless you only want to send a discount to a certain type of change.</li>\n<li>Save</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your webhook callback URL should be http://yourdomain.com/?trigger-special-discount=true&amp;discount-key=xxxxxxxxxxxx</p>\n<p>Replace yourdomain.com with your actual website domain, and replace xxxxxxxxxxxx with the MailChimp Key entered in the plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20up%20webhooks%20in%20activecampaign%3F'>\nHow do I set up webhooks in ActiveCampaign?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the technical details on how to create a webhook through ActiveCampaign by <a href=\"http://www.activecampaign.com/api/webhooks.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">clicking here</a>.</p>\n<p>General steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click Automations tab</li>\n<li>Click New Automation button</li>\n<li>Click Start From Scratch</li>\n<li>Click Subscribes</li>\n<li>Select your list or leave as any list</li>\n<li>Add Webhook as an action (paste your webhook URL)</li>\n<li>Add End this automation as an action</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your webhook callback URL should be http://yourdomain.com/?trigger-special-discount=true&amp;discount-key=xxxxxxxxxxxx</p>\n<p>Replace yourdomain.com with your actual website domain, and replace xxxxxxxxxxxx with the ActiveCampaign Key entered in the plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
