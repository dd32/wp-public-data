        "description": "<p>The &#8220;Generate Random Orders for WooCommerce&#8221; plugin allows store owners to generate random orders quickly, making it a valuable tool for testing and data population. You can set the number of orders to generate.</p>\n<p>Once you generate the orders, you can easily view them in the WooCommerce admin panel. This plugin can save you a significant amount of time when testing your store&#8217;s ordering and payment processes or when populating your database with random data.</p>\n<h3>How it works?</h3>\n<p>This plugin runs a script to generate random orders and related data in this site&#8217;s WooCommerce database. You can specify how many orders you want to generate.</p>\n<p>Order dates are set as follows:<br />\n* Order #1: midnight today<br />\n* Order #2: midnight yesterday<br />\n* Order #3: midnight one week ago<br />\n* Order #4: midnight 30 days ago<br />\n* Order #5+: random date and time between now and 365 days ago, with ~50% of orders between now and 30 days ago</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Order billing name and shipping name are each randomly selected from two possible names.</li>\n<li>&gt;Order billing phone and shipping phone are randomly generated 10-digit numbers.</li>\n<li>Order user ID is either 1 or 2. The JSON assumes that the nickname of user 1 is user1, and the nickname of user 2 is user2 (this doesn&#8217;t matter if the JSON is not being used.</li>\n<li>Order billing address and shipping address are the same, randomly selected from two possible addresses, one Canadian and one US.</li>\n<li>Order billing email is example<em>N</em>@example.com, where <em>N</em> is a random number from 1 to 3.</li>\n<li>Each order has (randomly) 1 to 5 product items. The WooCommerce store must have both variable and simple products. Products are selected at random with a ~33% bias toward variable products and ~67% bias toward simple products. Each item has a random quantity between 1 and 5 (whole number).</li>\n<li>~25% of orders are assigned local pickup. ~75% of orders are assigned flat rate shipping. The shipping in the WooCommerce store must be set up with flat rate having instance ID 1 and local pickup having instance ID 2. Shipping amount is a random whole number between 5 and 20.</li>\n<li>~33% of orders have coupon code 50OFF added. This coupon code must be configured in WooCommerce.</li>\n<li>Orders are randomly assigned statuses with the following approximate distribution: 14% pending, 29% processing, 57% completed. Some orders may have their status automatically changed to refunded due to the line item refund, if the refund results in the entire order being refunded.</li>\n<li>~50% of orders have a custom meta field wpz_custom_meta_1, and ~50% of orders have a custom meta field wpz_custom_meta_2. The value of either field is a random 3 digit number.</li>\n<li>The JSON assumes that two taxes are set up: tax ID 1 is GST, tax ID 2 is PST. This doesn&#8217;t matter if the JSON is not being used.</li>\n<li>~20% orders have line item refunds. Each refund has one product item, and the quantity refunded is 1; refund amounts correspond to quantity pro-rated line total and taxes. A corresponding amount of shipping is refunded (ignoring other items that may be on the order). Refunds are dated between 1 and 14 days from the order date, but not past the current time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Addons &amp; Integrations</h3>\n<p>Looking to automate your WooCommerce reports, share them on the frontend of your site, or create in-depth sales reports?
