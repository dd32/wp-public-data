From there, simply install the WordPress plugin and activate it. Then navigate to the converter page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This conversion tool assumes you are using the plugin for Zippy Courses and NOT the hosted version.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Choose Which Courses to Migrate</strong><br />\nYou can migrate all courses, or pick and choose which courses you&#8217;d like to convert into AccessAlly courses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Convert to Standalone or Stage Release Courses</strong><br />\nYou decide how you want your courses to be permissioned in AccessAlly: as a standalone course, where everything is immediately unlocked. Or as a stage released course, where each module can be unlocked over time or on a schedule. You can also convert to regular WordPress pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Edit Courses</strong><br />\nOnce the LMS migration is complete, you can navigate through AccessAlly&#8217;s Course Wizard to add course icons, create tags in your CRM, and test that everything is working. You&#8217;ll also need to re-create any quizzes, certificates, and assignments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Disable Plugins</strong><br />\nIf you&#8217;re happy with how everything looks in AccessAlly you can disable both the LMS migration plugin and Zippy Courses plugins. But before you do, make sure to follow the <a href=\"https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/migration-wizard-plugin-download/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">member migration steps</a> to make sure your members can access the new version of your courses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Differences Between Zippy Courses and AccessAlly Courses</h3>\n<p>Zippy Courses includes a multi-tier course format: Units and Lessons.</p>\n<p>With AccessAlly courses, the focus is not on the tiers (since you use regular WordPress pages, you get to decide how “deep” the course goes). Rather, the focus is on the access permission tags, and whether you want to release all course content at once, or “drip” it out slowly over time.</p>\n<p>This plugin was not developed by the Zippy Courses® team, and is maintained by the AccessAlly team. Any questions should be directed to AccessAlly.</p>\n<h4>Getting Started:</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/migration-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">1.

It&#8217;s possible there are other things you need to update or migrate, including payment systems or permissions.

It will not turn Zippy Courses quizzes or other LMS specific content into the equivalent AccessAlly ones. You&#8217;ll need to re-create your quizzes and set up private notes for assignments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20students%20automatically%20be%20converted%20into%20accessally%20students%3F'>\nWill my students automatically be converted into AccessAlly students?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this plugin only handles converting Zippy Courses course content including modules, lessons, and topics into AccessAlly course equivalents. In order to convert your WordPress users from Zippy Courses ones to AccessAlly ones, you&#8217;ll want to <a href=\"https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/migration-wizard-plugin-download/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">follow the member migration tutorial</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20need%20to%20send%20new%20passwords%20to%20members%3F'>\nWill I need to send new passwords to members?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s quite likely when switching <a href=\"https://accessally.com/features/membership-management/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress membership management plugin</a> that you&#8217;ll need to send students a new password to login to your site. Depending on what system you&#8217;re using in conjunction with Zippy Courses or Zippy Courses itself, you can set up a welcome email sequence in your email service. More details in the full <a href=\"https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/migration-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">migration guide</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20another%20membership%20plugin%20to%20work%20with%20accessally%3F'>\nDo I need another membership plugin to work with AccessAlly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. AccessAlly includes everything you need to run your courses, including the membership management and payment functionality on top of the LMS features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20revert%20from%20accessally%20courses%20back%20to%20zippy%20courses%20courses%3F'>\nIs it possible to revert from AccessAlly courses back to Zippy Courses courses?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you started with a Zippy Courses course and used this plugin you&#8217;ll be able to convert an AccessAlly course back into a Zippy Courses course. However, you can&#8217;t use this plugin to convert a new AccessAlly course into a Zippy Courses course.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
