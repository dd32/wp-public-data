Other 2004 editions may work but are not officially supported. We are hard at work to provide better support for more versions of the standard. If you have any suggestions on what standards to support please don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us via the support Forum.</p>\n<h4>Video/Audio</h4>\n<p>Currently many File Formats like mp3, wav, mp4 and webm are supported. With our free oEmbed extension you can also add and organize videos from Youtube, twitch and other Streaming services.</p>\n<h4>PDF</h4>\n<p>CLUEVO LMS allows you to use your PDF files as learning modules. Upload a PDF file and use it as a module in your learning tree. Your users place in the document is stored and you can see each student&#8217;s location in the document.</p>\n<h4>Learning Structure</h4>\n<p>The LMS consists of different courses that in turn contain chapters that contain modules. The first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is upload a SCORM module. To do this use the uploader on the Learning Management page in the modules tab. Once you have uploaded one (or more!) modules you can start creating your learning structure. Create some courses and add chapters and modules.</p>\n<h4>User Management</h4>\n<p>CLUEVO LMS gives you the ability to set permissions for each level of the learning tree. You can assign users to groups and set permissions for groups or just individual users. Each element of the learning tree can have one of three access levels:</p>\n<p>0: No access. Items won&#8217;t show up anyware for this user/group<br />\n1: Visible. Items will be visible for a user/group but cannot otherwise be accessed<br />\n2: Open. The user/group has full access to this element.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to have permissions expire at a certain date/time.</p>\n<p>Hint: As a user with administrative capabilities you have full access to all elements by default.</p>\n<h4>Reports</h4>\n<p>The reports page gives you an overview on the progress your users have made. You can also view the different SCORM parameters.<br />\nProgress records and SCORM parameters can also be exported to csv files.</p>\n<h4>Competence</h4>\n<p>The competence system allows you to define competence areas that consist of different competences. You can then set which modules teach which competences and how much of a competence a module covers.</p>\n<p>An example could be that you have a competence area named Backoffice that consists of the following competences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excel</li>\n<li>Word</li>\n<li>Outlook</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Competences are a great alternative way to organize your courses. They enable your users to directly browse modules that teach certain competences.</p>\n<h4>Settings</h4>\n<p>CLUEVO LMS provides an in-depth settings page to customize the LMS to your liking. You can customize the way your modules are displayed, protect your modules from external access, allow your students to rate your content and much more.</p>\n<h4>Extensions</h4>\n<p>We offer a suite of extension to add functionality to your LMS. Whether it&#8217;s support for more types of modules, certificates or reporting, we have it all.<br />\nOur Extension include:</p>\n<h3>Free Extensions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>oEmbed Modules: Allows you to use content like YouTube videos as modules</li>\n<li>Google Documents: Let&#8217;s you use your Google Docs as modules.
