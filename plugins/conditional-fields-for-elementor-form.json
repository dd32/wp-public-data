        "installation": "<h3>Quick Installation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>&#8220;wp-admin &gt;&gt; Plugins &gt;&gt; Add New&#8221;</strong> on your WordPress website, search for <strong>&#8220;Conditional Fields for Elementor Form&#8221;</strong>, and install and activate this plugin developed by <a href=\"https://coolplugins.net/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=homepage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cool Plugins</a>.</li>\n<li>Install <strong>&#8220;Elementor PRO&#8221;</strong> to access this plugin’s features, as the form widget is only available in the Elementor Pro version.</li>\n<li>Edit a page with Elementor and create a form. In the form fields, you’ll find a conditions tab where you can easily apply conditions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Add Conditions to Elementor Form Fields?</h3>\n<h4>Step 1:</h4>\n<p>First, install <strong>&#8220;Elementor Pro&#8221;</strong>, then install <strong>&#8220;<a href=\"https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=get-pro&amp;utm_content=installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Conditional Fields for Elementor Form</a>&#8220;</strong>. Since it is an addon for Elementor Pro, Elementor Pro must be installed first.</p>\n<h4>Step 2:</h4>\n<p>After installing both plugins, edit a page with Elementor where you intend to add a form. Create the form using the Elementor form widget and add the desired fields.</p>\n<h4>Step 3:</h4>\n<p>Select the field you wish to hide or show based on specific conditions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, in a contact form, you might want to show the <strong>&#8220;Order ID&#8221;</strong> field only if the user selects <strong>&#8220;Order Status&#8221;</strong> in a query-type select/option field, and hide it if <strong>&#8220;General Query&#8221;</strong> is selected.</li>\n<li>Enable conditions on a field via the <strong>&#8220;conditions tab.&#8221;</strong></li>\n<li>Choose a display mode, either <strong>hide or show</strong>. For example, if you select <strong>&#8220;Show&#8221;</strong>, the field remains hidden until the condition is met. Conversely, the <strong>&#8220;Hide&#8221;</strong> option keeps the field visible until the condition is met. The pro version of this addon adds two more modes: <strong>Enable/Disable</strong>, allowing you to enable or disable an input field based on conditions.</li>\n<li>Create a condition by entering the ID of the field against which you want to compare the value. For example, you might enable a condition on the <strong>&#8220;Order ID&#8221;</strong> field so it becomes visible if <strong>&#8220;query-type = order-status&#8221;</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can also apply multiple conditions to a field and link them using an <strong>AND operator</strong>, meaning the field will hide or show if all conditions are met. The pro version also supports an <strong>OR operator</strong>, allowing a field to hide/show if any condition is met.</li>\n<li>Conditions can be compared in several ways, such as <strong>is equal to (==), is not equal to (!=), greater than (&gt;), and less than (&lt;)</strong>. The pro version supports many other comparison conditions like <strong>empty, not empty, contains, does not contain, starts with, ends with</strong>, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Step 4:</h4>\n<p>Save or update the page and see the results and actions!</p>\n<p>— —————————————- —<br />\n<a href=\"https://coolplugins.net/product/conditional-fields-for-elementor-form/?utm_source=cfef_plugin&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=get-pro&amp;utm_content=installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Get the Pro version of Conditional Fields for Elementor Form</strong></a><br />\n— —————————————- —</p>\n",
