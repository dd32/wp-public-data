Or, you have done too many URL Smashes in one day. Check your Google API account for details. Sometimes it&#8217;s because you didn&#8217;t specify the full URL, including the &#8220;http(s)://&#8221; part &#8211; &#8216;relative&#8217; URLs are not smashed.</p>\n<p>If the URL Smash fails for some reasosn, the URL is not changed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20like%20how%20the%20plugin%20changes%20things%20or%20there%20is%20a%20problem%3F'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t like how the plugin changes things or there is a problem?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can just deactivate the plugin. Your settings will be saved if you want to reactivate later.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20database%3F'>\nDoes the plugin make changes to the database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin only adds one &#8216;row&#8217; to the Options database, using standard WordPress functions. The plugin will read the values as needed, minimizing calls to the database to limit any overhead against the database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20require%20anything%20extra%20on%20the%20client%20%28visitor%29%20browser%3F'>\nDoes the plugin require anything extra on the client (visitor) browser?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not that we are aware of. The things we do are done through standard WordPress calls. It works with the standard &#8216;jQuery&#8217; code that WordPress already includes and uses.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20we%20go%20for%20support%20if%20there%20is%20a%20problem%20or%20question%20-%20or%20a%20new%20feature%20we%20think%20will%20be%20nifty%3F'>\nWhere can we go for support if there is a problem or question &#8211; or a new feature we think will be nifty?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the plugin support page for questions. Or you can contact us directly via the Contact Us page at www.CellarWeb.com . We usually respond within 24 hours (and are usually faster than that).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20the%20plugin%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does the plugin cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s free! But there is a place to donate at www.CellarWeb.com, if you are so inclined. (And we will appreciate that inclination!)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20else%20do%20you%20do%3F'>\nWhat else do you do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have a plugin that stops comment spam in it&#8217;s tracks. Plus a contact template that does the same thing. Our process doesn&#8217;t rely on things that don&#8217;t work, like hidden fields, or hard to use Captcha things. You&#8217;ll find all the details at our FormSpammerTrap site: http://www.FormSpammerTrap.com .</p>\n<p>We do lots of WordPress sites: implementation, customization, and more. You can find more info at our business site at www.CellarWeb.com .</p>\n</p>\n\n",
