        "description": "<p>With <strong>FF Block Gist Embed</strong> you can embed files from GitHub Gists. It adds a block named &#8216;Gist Embed&#8217; to the WordPress editor interface. For every instance of this block, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select one or more files from the same Gist URL to be embedded in your post.</li>\n<li>Include the vendor stylesheet that handles the styling of Gist embeds (see the FAQ for more information).</li>\n<li>Choose whether or not to embed the Gist files as raw content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\n<p>We would like to bring some additional features soon. Some of the things we have planned, are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caching the content of files</li>\n<li>Manually change the order of the files from a Gist within a block</li>\n<li>Automatically get the list of files after a valid Gist URL is entered in the input field</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/ff-block-gist-embed</code> directory of your site or blog, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I embed multiple Gist files from the same block?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. However, this plugin lists all the files from the same Gist in the same order as on gist.github.com. If you need to list files in a different order than on gist.github.com, use multiple Gist Embed blocks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do Gist embeds get the correct styling automatically?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, <strong>Gist Embed</strong> is configured to load vendor stylesheets for Gist embeds (each Gist comes packed with CSS that handles the styling for the embed containers on the frontend).<br />\nYou can select whether or not to load vendor stylesheets for each Gist Embed block by (un)checking the &#8216;Include stylesheet&#8217; checkbox in the sidebar menu (see the screenshots).<br />\n<strong>Please note</strong>: this checkbox is checked by default for each Gist Embed block. Performance-wise, it is advised to uncheck this checkbox for all but one of the Gist Embed blocks on the same post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I embed raw files from Gists?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an option to embed the checked file(s) from the Gist Embed block as raw content in the sidebar (unchecked by default).<br />\nBy checking this checkbox, the content from each checked file is loaded as raw content instead of embedded in a Gist embed container. This could be useful for HTML prototypes, for example.<br />\nNote that if you check this checkbox, the vendor stylesheet is never loaded for this block.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin support block alignment options?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Provided your active theme supports the &#8216;wide&#8217; and &#8216;full&#8217; alignment options, you can configure each block to <em>align wide</em> or take up the full width. The CSS classes that are added, are <code>alignwide</code> and <code>alignfull</code>, respectively. Your theme should already apply the correct styling for these classes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve possible errors displayed if block is used but no Gist URL is entered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the first file of the Gist by default. If a Gist contains only one file, the checkbox for that file is disabled.</li>\n<li>Correctly list the files of a Gist when the GitHub username contains dashes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is our first release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
