If it&#8217;s a custom post type, it&#8217;s got custom information, and I want to put it in a custom template!</p>\n<p>So I threw together a plugin to handle this.  With this plugin installed and activated, it checks your template directory for posttype.php then t_posttype.php.  If neither exists, then the standard WP template rules take effect.</p>\n<p>For example, if your custom post type is &#8216;books&#8217;, it&#8217;s going to check your template directory for &#8216;books.php&#8217;.  If it finds it, it will use that as the template for your &#8216;books&#8217; posts.  If not, it will check for &#8216;t_books.php&#8217;, and use that as the template for your &#8216;books&#8217; posts.
