That is because i have used it to learn how to get plugins to work. My main goal next is to find a way of making a sort-of &#8216;framework&#8217; plugin, so that I can use a general top-leveol options page for all my plugins. I need to find out how to get a second plugin to notice whether a previous plugin had been installed and activated, so that the top-level menu already exists. If you know how to do this, please contact me: info@oldcastleweb.com.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This enables users to define their own greeting.</li>\n<li>The next stage will see a framework for all my plugins, allowing them all to use a custom top level options page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial plugin merely changes &#8220;howdy&#8221; to &#8220;welcome&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n"
