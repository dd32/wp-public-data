This will enable botnets to try and Bruteforce attack a website with the user’s credentials.</p>\n<h3>Brute Force Login Protection</h3>\n<p>A <strong>brute-force attack</strong> is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every<br />\npossible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination<br />\nthat works.<br />\nOur plugin will <strong>protect your site against Brute Force Attack</strong>, by restrict access to login page to<br />\nwhitelisted IP addresses.<br />\nOtherwise, your login page will request your wordpress user email.<br />\nIt is not necessary Limit Login Attempts. Read below about Rate Limiting.</p>\n<h3>Rate Limiting</h3>\n<p>Rate Limiting is a substitute to <strong>Limit Login Attempts</strong>.<br />\nBots and Hackers can make a lot of visits in a short time period.<br />\nWe can just limit a number of visits.</p>\n<h3>Simple Login Lockdown</h3>\n<p>Rate Limiting is a substitute to <strong>Simple Login Lockdown</strong>. Read above.</p>\n<h3>Rename wp-login.php</h3>\n<p>Rate Limiting is a substitute to <strong>Rename wp-login.php</strong>. Read above.</p>\n<h3>External service</h3>\n<p>If the settings of Anti Hacker is Block all traffic from Tor? = &#8220;Yes&#8221;, we can test visitors Ip<br />\nfrom the TOR PROJECT database. We download daily Tor Database and we didn&#8217;t send any information to them.<br />\nThis is a free service. TorProject is a not-for-profit organization.</p>\n<p>Tor Documentation:<br />\nhttps://www.torproject.org/</p>\n<h3>External service 2</h3>\n<p>Our plugin will check your status on Google regarding Google Safe Browsing.<br />\nGoogle Safe Browsing is a service provided by Google to help protect users from malicious websites on the internet.<br />\nTo simplify your inquiry, avoiding the need to create a Google account to obtain an API,<br />\nwe will perform this query for you.<br />\nWe will send your domain address and Google will inform us whether it considers your site safe or not.<br />\nObviously, if it does not consider it safe, it will not send visitors to your site.<br />\nInstead, it will inform those who intend to visit your site that it is dangerous.<br />\nHence the importance of always monitoring this.

This will enable botnets to try and Bruteforce attack a website with the user’s credentials.</p>\n<h3>Brute Force Login Protection</h3>\n<p>A <strong>brute-force attack</strong> is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every<br />\npossible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination<br />\nthat works.<br />\nOur plugin will <strong>protect your site against Brute Force Attack</strong>, by restrict access to login page to<br />\nwhitelisted IP addresses.<br />\nOtherwise, your login page will request your wordpress user email.<br />\nIt is not necessary Limit Login Attempts. Read below about Rate Limiting.</p>\n<h3>Rate Limiting</h3>\n<p>Rate Limiting is a substitute to <strong>Limit Login Attempts</strong>.<br />\nBots and Hackers can make a lot of visits in a short time period.<br />\nWe can just limit a number of visits.</p>\n<h3>Simple Login Lockdown</h3>\n<p>Rate Limiting is a substitute to <strong>Simple Login Lockdown</strong>. Read above.</p>\n<h3>Rename wp-login.php</h3>\n<p>Rate Limiting is a substitute to <strong>Rename wp-login.php</strong>. Read above.</p>\n<h3>External service</h3>\n<p>If the settings of Anti Hacker is Block all traffic from Tor? = &#8220;Yes&#8221;, we can test visitors Ip<br />\nfrom the TOR PROJECT database. We download daily Tor Database and we didn&#8217;t send any information to them.<br />\nThis is a free service. TorProject is a not-for-profit organization.</p>\n<p>Tor Documentation:<br />\nhttps://www.torproject.org/</p>\n<h3>External service 2</h3>\n<p>Our plugin will check your status on Google regarding Google Safe Browsing.<br />\nGoogle Safe Browsing is a service provided by Google to help protect users from malicious websites on the internet.<br />\nTo simplify your inquiry, avoiding the need to create a Google account to obtain an API,<br />\nwe will perform this query for you.<br />\nWe will send your domain address and Google will inform us whether it considers your site safe or not.<br />\nObviously, if it does not consider it safe, it will not send visitors to your site.<br />\nInstead, it will inform those who intend to visit your site that it is dangerous.<br />\nHence the importance of always monitoring this.
