Designed from scratch with &lt;3.</p>\n<p>Coupon URLs is a WooCommerce extension that allows you to apply a WooCommerce coupon by clicking a custom link on your site. You have full control over the URL. You can create any URL you want from your own domain, there are no limits or restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>https://example.com/?code=FALL50</li>\n<li>https://example.com/code/FALL50</li>\n<li>https://example.com/FALL50</li>\n<li>https://example.com/offers/?code=FALL50</li>\n<li>https://example.com/a/very/deep/path</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also add a WooCommerce product automatically before adding the coupon.</p>\n<h3>Add a product before adding the coupon</h3>\n<p>Coupon URLs allows you to add a product from your store automatically before applying the discount/coupon. You can even select the quantity!</p>\n<p>For example, you can create a custom link like: https://example.com/code/FREEORANGE that when clicked will add 1 Orange and then the coupon FREEORANGE will be applied adding a 100% discount (just as an example).</p>\n<h3>Redirect to the cart, the checkout page or any other page after applying the coupon</h3>\n<p>You can select <em>any</em> page on your site to redirect to after applying the coupon. Want to redirect to the cart? The checkout page? A specific product page? A custom page? We got you covered!</p>\n<p>Redirect to:<br />\n* Cart (WooCommerce)<br />\n* Checkout (WooCommerce)<br />\n* Shop (WooCommerce)<br />\n* Homepage<br />\n* Any page on your site<br />\n* A custom path on your site (eg: example.com/a/custom-path)<br />\n* An external URL</p>\n<h3>Smart apply</h3>\n<p>If the customer&#8217;s cart is empty (and you haven&#8217;t added the Add Product action), Coupon URLs will remember to add the coupon as soon as the customer adds a product to their cart. No manual action needed.</p>\n<h3>Beautiful builder</h3>\n<p>Coupon URLs has been designed as a builder so that you can add only the actions that you want to perform after the link has been clicked, visually.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 actions:\n<ul>\n<li>Add coupon.</li>\n<li>Add Product.</li>\n<li>Add an Extra Message After Applying to the Cart.</li>\n<li>Add Custom Message When Coupon hasn&#8217;t been added yet.</li>\n<li>Redirect</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coupon URLs is an original Neblabs design.
