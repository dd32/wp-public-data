When your site creates a new syndicated post, GeoMashup can use that data as location information for the post. In addition, Feed GeoMashup scans the incoming posts for maps that GeoMashup created in the original. When it finds such a map, it will replace it with a new  [geo_mashup_map] shortcode. The shortcode on your site will probably not have the same settings as on the original. Your map will probably look different, but it will adhere to whatever preferences you have set up in your own GeoMashup options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin pull in geodata from other sources?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It might. It was created to operate on the GeoRSS generated by the GeoMashup<br />\nplugin, but it should work on other similarly formatted feeds.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where are the options settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Look under &#8220;Syndication &gt; Posts &amp; Links&#8221; to find a Feed GeoMashup options box. Select an individual feed from the drop-down at the top of the same page to set feed-specific preferences.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I set Feed GeoMashup to filter out posts with no GeoRSS data, what will happen to posts that I have already syndicated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing. They will not be deleted, but neither will they be updated. If you set Feed GeoMashup to filter them, FeedWordPress will be affectively unaware of them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I filter an incoming feed to include mapped posts only from a limited</h4>\n<p>\n<p>area?</p>\n<p>Yes. On the &#8220;Syndication &gt; Posts &amp; Links&#8221; settings page you can define limits<br />\nto a range of longitudes and latitudes. Only posts mapped within the limits<br />\nwill be syndicated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are you offering support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

The<br />\nproblem was that the RSS feed included rendered HTML rather than the<br />\nshortcode, but the GeoMashup JavaScripts could not be run from the originating<br />\nsite. FeedGeoMashup now strips the rendered HTML and reasserts the bare shortcode. Any custom attributes set on the<br />\noriginal copy of the post will be lost. On the other hand, default settings on the<br />\nsyndicating site will apply, a fact that will insure consistency even when<br />\nposts come from different sournces.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can now opt to filter an incoming feed&#8217;s mapped posts by longitude and latitude. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding site-wide and feed-specific options to pull in all posts or only posts with GeoRSS data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
