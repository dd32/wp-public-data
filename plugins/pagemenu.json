If you are familiar with php you can of course edit the php function &#8230; not too difficult to read, I hope. Css options can of course also be adjusted to suit.</p>\n<p>Using</p>\n<p>Pagemenu selects page titles and page links from the database based upon the parent, you choose when you create the page.  Parent pages (ie: <em> pages not linked to other pages </em>) become the top menu item.</p>\n<p>When you want a page listed under a particular parent, just select the desired parent in the parent dropdown on the right side of the edit page menu in WordPress Admin. (<em>or &#8220;Main Page (no parent)&#8221; if you want the page to be a parent</em>)</p>\n<p>When you have more than 1 page, list the order  in which, you want them to appear <em>(just beneath the parent dropdown on the right side.)</em> </p>\n"
