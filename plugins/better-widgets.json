Hoping to find a better way to do this.</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>Lots of changes. This plugin now requires WordPress 3.8, as the widgets screen in core has had some significant updates. Adding a checkmark to show that you&#8217;ve saved a widget. New icons for default widgets (and some Jetpack widgets, too).</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>Starting development with a concept UI. Some things don&#8217;t actually work. Experimental tagging of media items is commented out. Delete doesnt actually delete. Search is limited to the items viewable on the page.</p>\n"
