On the front end, you can control exactly what you want the different things to be called. Means that you do not have to translate something at all, just state what you want it to be called. Works with all languages!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20it%20on%20any%20theme%3F'>\nCan I use it on any theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can use the plugin on any wp theme you want. However, different themes will overwrite the plugin&#8217;s css and then you have to reshape your table if you do not like the look. If you want the exact same look that we present, you should also download our theme.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
