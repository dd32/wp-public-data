        "faq": "\n<dt id='q.%20how%20to%20create%20an%20account%3F'>\nQ. How to create an account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. It&#8217;s easy. Go to our registration page <a href=\"http://chat.askly.me/register\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and create your account in a few clicks. This will be your main account and you will be the owner. You can invite additional team members to collaborate with.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20how%20accurate%20is%20the%20instant%20translation%20in%20askly%20chat%3F'>\nQ. How accurate is the instant translation in Askly Chat?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Our chat is integrated with leading neural machine translation technologies. We only use paid technologies. The translations are highly accurate and conversations with customers can easily be done with the multilingual support.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20my%20website%20is%20currently%20in%201%20language.%20why%20do%20i%20need%20a%20multilingual%20chat%3F'>\nQ. My website is currently in 1 language. Why do I need a multilingual chat?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Your online shop does not have to be multilingual, but your customers probably are. We see that 10-30% of conversations take place with clients whose mother language is not as your website&#8217;s language. We have automated detection of the client&#8217;s native language and can easily provide real-time translation in both directions. It&#8217;s a much more comfortable and pleasant experience for the customer. Imagine you can get service from the French e-shop in German language :).</p>\n<p>We see that on average, online shops serve customers in 5 languages through chat. In total, our solution detects and translates into 140 languages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20how%20can%20i%20get%20notified%20of%20incoming%20new%20chats%3F'>\nQ. How can I get notified of incoming new chats?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A.There are sound, visual and email notifications available to make sure that no chat or message goes unnoticed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20do%20you%20have%20any%20chat%20history%20limitations%3F'>\nQ. Do you have any chat history limitations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. No, there are currently no restrictions on storing chat archives. As the number of customers and conversations grows rapidly, we may offer a separate package to preserve our long history.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20is%20your%20chat%20using%20robots%20or%20chatbots%3F'>\nQ. Is your chat using robots or chatbots?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Currently, our solution is not consciously configurable for automated responses and is targeted at customer support teams who want to serve customers in real time.</p>\n<p>According to customer research, 80% of the people don&#8217;t like bots and robots. There are very few e-shops that have been able to work well. That&#8217;s why we focus on customer-centric service.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20can%20i%20also%20automatically%20translate%20the%20faq%20tab%3F'>\nQ. Can I also automatically translate the FAQ tab?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes you can. Add all your FAQ questions and answers in your chosen language. Decide by each question, if you want to automatically translate it. You can modify each translated question and answer in any language.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20what%20happens%20then%20after%20the%20free%20trial%3F'>\nQ. What happens then after the free trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Free trial is for 30 days. You can use all the features and serve your customers to evaluate if you like our chat solution and if it has made your customer experience better. If you decide to continue, please choose a suitable option from our packages <a href=\"https://www.askly.me/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>. Prices start from 19€ a month.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q.%20i%20did%20not%20find%20a%20suitable%20package%20from%20your%20list.%20do%20you%20offer%20personalised%20solutions%3F'>\nQ.
