But the nature of static sites implies that<br />\nany dynamic elements of your install that reply upon WordPress plugins<br />\nor internal functions to operate dynamically will no longer work.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='q%3A%20why%20do%20i%20need%20it%3F'>\nQ: Why do I need it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: You do not need it! Your visitors need it ðŸ˜‰ The most performant way to<br />\ndeliver a website is static html content. But this is not the best way for<br />\nall single posts of your blog because you are losing the benefit of dynamic<br />\nelements like captcha checks. So the optimal solution would be only make the<br />\nlanding pages / the start page static.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20does%20it%20work%20with%20a%20cdn%3F'>\nQ: Does it work with a CDN?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Yes. A CDN will cache the content of you blog posts. Usually the CDN ask<br />\nfor changes on your server before deliver the cached content. So real static<br />\ncontent can speed up this process to.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20why%20should%20i%20delete%20all%20static%20content%20before%20changing%20permalinks%3F'>\nQ: Why should I delete all static content before changing permalinks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This plugin use the permalink provided by your WP core installation to<br />\ncreate and check if a static version of the post/page is still stored on<br />\nyour webserver. So if do you change the definition of the permalink structure<br />\nthe plugin will not find prior stored content. We are thinking about a log<br />\nfor all static URLs. But this will need additional storage in the database<br />\nand we want try to have as small/performant footprint as possible. Perhaps we<br />\nwill change this with a future version. But it is not on our agenda at this<br />\ntime.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20i%20get%20security%20warnings%20of%20the%20browser%20if%20i%20request%20a%20static%20file'>\nQ: I get security warnings of the browser if I request a static file\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: If your server support http and https please make sure to create the<br />\nstatic files while WP has configured the WP address and website address<br />\nto the httpS:// version. BTW: Of course your server must support https<br />\nconnections to URI of your blog.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20can%20i%20make%20a%20static%20version%20of%20my%20whole%20wp%20blog%20to%20transfer%20it%20on%20an'>\nQ: Can I make a static version of my whole WP blog to transfer it on an\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>punblishing server? =<br />\nA: No. There are other plugins to do this job. But this plugin was developed<br />\nwith the aim to keep as most dynamic features of WordPress and plugins as<br />\npossible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='experimental%20features'>\nEXPERIMENTAL FEATURES\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Features marked as &#8220;experimental&#8221; in the admin menu are experimental!<br />\nThis means: We think it is a good extension to our plugin that we would<br />\nlike to include in a future version, but we are not sure yet about the<br />\nbest solution that works for all or most people. So please feel free to<br />\nuse and test it and report back to us about it. Experimental features<br />\nmight be removed in an update, if it does not work out. So please pay<br />\nclose attention to our changelog!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='known%20bugs'>\nKNOWN BUGS\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These are bugs or unexpected glitches that we know of, but that do not<br />\nhave an impact on the majority of users, are not security relevant and<br />\nwill perhaps be fixed in the future &#8211; if we have time to spend or you<br />\nprovide us with a lot of &#8220;K&#xF6;lsch&#8221; ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if do you set the Blog URI to http:// but have also https:// enabled the<br />\nplugin will fetch the content from the http:// location and all references<br />\nto elements like CSS and/or images within the HTML code are set by WP to the<br />\nunsecured protocol. It is up to you to set the configuration of you post to<br />\nthe secured protocol before creating static html code.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
