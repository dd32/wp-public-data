        "description": "<p>Quick Multilingual is a WordPress plugin designed to offer a streamlined, user-friendly solution for creating bilingual websites with the flexibility to expand into multilingual sites in the future. This Lite version is tailored for smaller websites with up to two languages and a maximum of four pages, making it perfect for businesses and individuals who need a straightforward setup. The plugin automatically adjusts the HTML lang attribute and adding hreflang tags for better SEO and user experience.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adjust HTML Lang Attribute:</strong> Dynamically set the <code>lang</code> attribute in the HTML tag based on the current language.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Hreflang Tags:</strong> Define custom hreflang codes for primary and secondary languages.</li>\n<li><strong>Language Folder Redirection:</strong> Redirect the parent language folder to the secondary language homepage.</li>\n<li><strong>Mapping:</strong> map up to 4 pages of the primary language to their translation in the secondary language.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Configuration:</strong> User-friendly settings page for managing language settings and redirections.</li>\n<li><strong>Settings Link:</strong> Convenient link to the plugin settings from the main Plugins page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add Pages:</strong> Create your website pages in the primary language as usual. For the secondary language, create a language “folder” page and add child pages underneath for each translated page.</li>\n<li><strong>General Settings:</strong> Navigate to the Settings page and configure the HTML language attributes (there is a link included to look those up) for your primary and secondary languages. Define the language “folder” page and specify the number of pages your website will have (up to four in the Lite version).</li>\n<li><strong>Map Translations:</strong> Use the Translation Mapping tab to link each secondary language page to its corresponding primary language page. Important: make sure to set the homepage as first mapped page.</li>\n<li><strong>Finalise with Navigation:</strong> Add the main navigation menu with the primary language pages and the secondary language “folder” under which you can add the translated (child) pages. The plugin handles all the necessary technical details, ensuring your multilingual site functions smoothly with the correct language tags and redirections.</li>\n</ol>\n",
