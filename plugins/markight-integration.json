To benefit from this feature, you can select a specific time period or customer segment to answer questions such as:</p>\n<p>Will my customers churn in the next x days?<br />\nWhich customer segment is likely to churn in the next x days?</p>\n<h3>Time between Purchases</h3>\n<p>Based on your customers’ purchase behavior in the past, this analysis examines the average customer repurchase rate for the second, third, and subsequent purchases to predict their future buying patterns. With the help of this, you can identify customers with the following characteristics:</p>\n<p>Customers on the verge of churning<br />\nCustomers on the verge of purchasing<br />\nCustomers with an extended time gap between their purchases<br />\nCustomers with a short time gap between their purchases</p>\n<h3>Product Performance</h3>\n<p>Having to manage an abundance of products, it’s common for category managers who work in retailers to spend the majority of their time on short term objectives such as setting meetings, conducting negotiations and attending day-to-day tasks.
