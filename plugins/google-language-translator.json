Requested long ago by a few users &#8211; thanks for your months of patience!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.06</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a XSS Cross Scripting Vulnerability in the plugin, as requested by WordPress.org. Unnecessary code (during testing) was being posted to the settings page, so the code was removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.05</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added 3 new options to the settings page: English, Spanish, and Portuguese flag image variations.</li>\n<li>Fixed an error with the Floating Widget: order of flags was not being honored in certain cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.04</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrected the text on the settings page to reflect 91 total flags, instead of 81 flags.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.03</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added 10 new languages and associated flags: Chichewa, Kazakh, Malagasy, Malayalam, Myanmar(Burmese), Sesotho, Sinhala, Sundanese, Tajik, and Uzbek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.02</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the Tamil flag to use the Indian flag, instead of Tamil Tigers flag.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated style.css to reflect the syntax error connecting to the Chinese flag.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress security updates added to the settings page [wp_nonce_field()].</li>\n<li>Removed 3 outside Javascript files &#8211; these files are now called upon directly from WordPress CMS.</li>\n<li>Unpacked flags.js p,a,c,k,e,r code.

Big improvement!</li>\n<li>Re-factored more code to increase efficiency.</li>\n<li>Added de-activation hook to reset all plugin settings when plugin is de-activated.

The Floating Widget is simply another way for allowing website visitors to translate languages.  The functionality is built-in with the existing flag preferences, and can be turned on or off at the administrator&#8217;s preference. The floating widget can also function in full with both the language box and/or flags showing OR hiding, so the administrator has full control of how it displays. The floating widget is placed at bottom right of the website in the free version, but can be placed in other locations by changing CSS styles associated with the box.</li>\n<li>Fixed the issue with Dashboard styles loading on the wrong pages. This was causing some annoying display issues on the WordPress Dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-factored/re-arranged more code in google languagetransltor.php by placing them into separate files.</li>\n<li>Fixed the issue of Custom CSS box not displaying it&#8217;s styles to the website. This was only missed in this last update, due to re-arrangement of the files. Sorry for any inconvenience.</li>\n<li>Removed style2.php file, which is unnecessary and was being used in testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-factored/re-arranged some of the code in googlelanguagetranslator.php by placing them into separate files.</li>\n<li>Fixed a minor coding issue in glt_widget.php &#8211; this was generating an error in WordPress when debugging.</li>\n<li>Moved all CSS code into a single file.  The result is nice, clean inline CSS code that is now called only once.</li>\n<li>Fixed some additional CSS display issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted additional minor invalid HTML issues on the settings page, and also in the front-end plugin display.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the url request to Google to allow both unsecured and secured page translations. Previously, some users experienced errors when trying to use the translator on &#8220;https://&#8221; (secured) pages.</li>\n<li>Adjusted some minor spacing issues in the settings page HTML (caused some annoying red HTML errors when using &#8220;View Source&#8221; in right-click menu).</li>\n<li>Removed old CSS styles that were added in the previous 3.0 update &#8211; the styles were added when Google servers were being updated, and were producing major translation dislay issues until their update was complete.  Now the styles I added are no longer needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Correct a small CSS error that affected the showing/hiding of the Google toolbar.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.9</h4>\n<p>***IMPORTANT: Google&#8217;s most recent server update is producing display issues for website translation tool. There are major display issues with the translation toolbar and also the translations editing interface. Version 2.9 temporarily hides the edit translation functionality until Google decides to fix this issue, although you can still edit translations directly through your Google account at translate.google.com. Please direct any support requests through WordPress.org and we will be happy to assist you.<br />\n* Fixed Google Translation toolbar display issue<br />\n* Fixed the Edit Translation interface by hiding it temporarily until Google fixes this<br />\n* Removed some unneeded styles from the style sheet.<br />\n* Fixed some CSS issues for the Google Branding display, which was affected by Google&#8217;s most recent update</p>\n<h4>2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an option to allow users to manage their own translations directly through their Google Translate account (free). When activated, users can hover over the text of their website, and edit the translations from the webpage directly.  Google will remember these translations, and then serve them to users once the edits are made. Users must install the Google Translate Customization meta tag provided through Google Translate here: translate.google.com/manager/website/settings. To obtain this meta tag, users need to configure the Google Translate tool directly from this website (although they will not use this because the plugin provides it), then the user can obtain the meta tag on the &#8220;Get Code&#8221; screen, which is displayed after configuring the Google Translate tool on this webpage.</li>\n<li>Added an option to allow users to turn on/off Google&#8217;s multilanguagePage option, that when activated, the original website content will be a forced translation, instead of original content (but only after a translation is made.)</li>\n<li>Added more flexible styles to the settings page, so that left and right panels display nicely to the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Google Analytics tracking capability to the plugin.</li>\n<li>Added a &#8220;CSS Styles&#8221; box in the settings panel.</li>\n<li>Changed the Catalonian flag to its correct flag image.</li>\n<li>Fixed coding issues that previously updated options incorrectly, which is why many users experienced display issues. All options are now initialized upon plugin activation, which should fix this issue permanently.</li>\n<li>Fixed a glitch in our usage of the translate API. Previously, when the user clicked the default language, it would toggle back and forth between the default language and &#8220;Afrikaans&#8221; language. Now, users will see the correct language displayed at all times, no matter how many times it is clicked.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added defaults to all options to ensure there are no more issues with the translator displaying upon installation. Again, sorry for any inconvenience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminated an internal WordPress error being generated from a coding mistake.</li>\n<li>Added a default option for the Translator alingment. Previously, this was causing the plugin to disapppear.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Found a couple of small display errors in the settings page after uploading version 2.3. Sorry for any inconvenience!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a &#8220;Preview&#8221; area on the settings page that allows you to see your settings in action.</li>\n<li>Added custom flag support for all languages (custom flags available ONLY when selecting the &#8220;ALL Languages&#8221; setting.</li>\n<li>Added an option that allows left/right alignment of the translation tool.</li>\n<li>Added the &#8220;Google Language Translator&#8221; widget.</li>\n<li>Updated googlelanguagetranslator.php to properly register setting in the admin settings panel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added language &#8220;Portuguese&#8221; and &#8220;German&#8221; to the Original Language drop-down option on the settings page.</li>\n<li>Changed flag image for the English language (changed United States flag to the United Kingdom flag).</li>\n<li>Added link in the settings panel that points to Google&#8217;s Attribution Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added language &#8220;Dutch&#8221; to the Original Language drop-down option on the settings page.</li>\n<li>Added a new CSS class that more accurately hides the &#8220;Powered by&#8221; text when hiding Google&#8217;s branding. In previous version, the &#8220;Powered by&#8221; text was actually disguised by setting it&#8217;s color to &#8220;transparent&#8221;, but now we have set it&#8217;s font-size to 0px instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Corrected some immediate errors in the 1.9 update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added 7 flag image choices that, when clicked by website visitors, will change the language displayed, both on the website, AND in the drop-down box (flag language choices are limited to those provided in this plugin).</li>\n<li>Added 6 additional languages to the translator, as provided in Google&#8217;s most recent updates ( new languages include Bosnian, Cebuano, Khmer, Marathi, Hmong, Javanese ).</li>\n<li>Corrected a minor technical issue where the Czech option (on the backend) was incorrectly displaying the Croatian language on the front end.</li>\n<li>Added jQuery functionality to the settings panel to improve the user experience.</li>\n<li>Added an option for users to display/hide the flag images.</li>\n<li>Added an option for users to display/hide the translate box when flags are displayed.</li>\n<li>Removed the settings.css file &#8211; I found a better way of displaying the options without CSS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modified google-language-translator.php to display the correct output to the browser when horizontal layout is selected.  Previously, it was not displaying at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modified google-language-translator.php so that jQuery and CSS styles were enqueued properly onto the settings page only. Previously, jQuery functionality and CSS styles were being added to all pages of the WordPresss Dashboard, which was causing functionality and display issues for some users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added &#8220;Specific Language&#8221; support to the plugin settings, which allows the user to choose specific languages that are displayed to website visitors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<p>Added &#8220;Original Language&#8221; support to the plugin settings, which allows the user to choose the original language of their website, which ultimately removes the original language as a choice in the language drop-down presented to website visitors.</p>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<p>Corrected display problems associated with CSS styles not being placed correctly in wp_head.</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML display problem in the sidebar area now fixed. Previously, inserting the [google-translator] plugin into a text widget caused it to display above the widget, instead of inside of it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcode support is now available for adding [google-translator] to text widgets. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The shortcode supplied on the settings page was updated to display &#8216;[google-translator]&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n"
