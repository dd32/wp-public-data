However, before these images are registered, the Theme Blvd framework applies a filter to an array of the sizes to be registered.</p>\n<p>This allows for all of the image sizes of the theme to be easily filtered from your child theme or from a plugin&#8230; and this would be an example of a plugin that utilizes that. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h4>Do I have to use this plugin to change image sizes?</h4>\n<p>Nope. In fact, if you understand the basics of PHP and the WordPress filters API, I would suggest that you do not use this plugin and instead, you manually make the changes from your child themeâ€™s <em>functions.php</em>. Realistically, running this plugin requires extra resources on your server that can be avoided by just manually make the change you want from your child theme.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to dive into a little development action, and accomplish the gist of what this plugin does, you&#8217;d simply do something like this from your child theme:</p>\n<pre><code>function my_image_sizes( $sizes ) {\n    $sizes['slider-large'] = array(\n        'width' =&gt; '960', // Your new width\n        'height' =&gt; '350' // Your new height\n    );\n    return $sizes;\n}\nadd_filter( 'themeblvd_image_sizes', 'my_image_sizes' );\n</code></pre>\n",
