You can open the \\&#8217;web developers\\&#8217; options to check the received media type next to the image.  It will still have the original file extension on the filename so you will need to clear any caching on your browser.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this affect WordPress caching</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, all of the work is done by your server so any caching / optimization plugin will not be affected.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it work with CDN&#8217;s and or static content providers</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will have to configure your CDN to serve the webp image type, if the webp images are saved directly to your CDN folder will depend on how it is being maintained in WordPress.  You may be able to just include the .htaccess snippet to make it work.  I will update this question as soon as I know more.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
