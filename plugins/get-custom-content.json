Type the name of your value in the post title field, and type some content. Then select the variable to which this value belongs in the &#8220;GET Custom Content Variables&#8221; box on the editor screen.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want this particular value to be the default value, and therefore be shown when the variable is not defined in the URL, click the check box in the &#8220;Make this the Default?&#8221; box on the editor screen. It will appear if the variable is not defined in the URL (such as www.example.com) or when the variable is defined but the value does not exist (such as www.example.com?variable=nonexistent)</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s up to you to make sure you don&#8217;t set up multiple values to be the default.

One is to use the GET Custom Content widget to drop it in the sidebar.

Example:</p>\n<p>-value-default<br />\nI want this shown instead of the default!<br />\n-value-default</p>\n<h3>How can I insert the URL&#8217;s query variable value into my site?</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you may want to use value in the user&#8217;s URL to display something on your page. For example, you might want the link example.com/my-page/?username=Gretel to display &#8220;Greetings, Gretel!&#8221; on the page. To do this, enter a description for the particular variable (in this case, username) back on the screen where you can add or edit GET Custom Content Variables. Include <em>VALUE</em> in the spot where you want the value to be filled in. For example, you could type:</p>\n<p>Greetings, <em>VALUE</em>.</p>\n",
