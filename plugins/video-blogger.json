        "faq": "\n<h4>What was the plugin developed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Development begun 1st August 2013 and the plugin was released 12th August 2013.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can Video Blogger help me make money?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it can but you must remember to make use of it regularly. The plugin is designed for WordPress bloggers who like to embed many videos. You can then create<br />\na video spot on your blogs which your visitors become familiar with. When a post does not have a video, rather than show nothing, we can show Google<br />\nAdSense. Your visitors will often focus on the AdSense ad expecting a video to be there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What URL should I submitted as a Source to display my video?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each video streaming website has URL for different purposes i.e. link, using in embed, playlists, episodes. As I type this<br />\nthe plugin is still very new and expects the embed URL for most sites. YouTube is a little easier, you can use the YouTube URL displayed in browser when visiting<br />\na YouTube video on YouTube.com. This area of functionality is priority and the hope is that most URL will work to help make things like confusing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is YouTube.com supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Blip.tv supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Vimeo.com supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Vevo.com supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Dailymotion.com supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Metacafe.com supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Break.com supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</p>\n\n",
