Next to it, there will be a button for undoing.<br />\nIMPORTANT!<br />\nYou can find the dropdown list and undo button of the Tiny AI Assistant in the SECOND row of the TinyMCE editor toolbar, which is initially in a closed state.<br />\nTherefore, you need to enable the appearance of the second row of the toolbar using the dedicated button to access the tools of the Tiny AI Assistant!</p>\n<p>All you need to do is provide the relevant information for the command in the text editor interface associated with the respective editor toolbar.<br />\nFor example, if you use the &#8220;Write poem&#8221; command, logically, the system expects a topic.<br />\nYou would enter the topic in the text editor area, such as &#8220;Smurfs,&#8221; select the &#8220;Write poem&#8221; option from the dropdown list, and after a short wait, the generated poem will appear instead of the &#8220;Smurfs&#8221; text.</p>\n<p>If the generated content is not satisfactory, you can click the undo button next to the dropdown list to revert back to the content before the generation.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT!<br />\nUnused content from tokens will not be refunded, meaning that any command you issue to the system and receive a response for will consume the corresponding tokens regardless. Additionally, it&#8217;s worth noting that both issuing a command and receiving the resulting content consume tokens. For example, if you translate a longer text with the system, translating one A4 page of text may consume tokens equivalent to two A4 pages of text due to the command issuance and the returned content.</p>\n<h3>External Service Calls</h3>\n<p>The plugin utilizes our own checker API service (https://construct.pdk.hu/tinyAIEx-checker/checker_api.php) to retrieve the OpenAI license key to be used when using the plugin.<br />\nThe checker API returns the OpenAI key based on the license key provided by the user in the plugin&#8217;s settings, as long as there is an available token quota associated with the subscription.</p>\n<p>Data Privacy Statement for the checker API:<br />\nNo personal data is transmitted when using the API; only the Tiny AI Assistant license key, the name of the corresponding subscription package, and the number of tokens used or available are transmitted.</p>\n",
