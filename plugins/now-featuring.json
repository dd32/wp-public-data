        "faq": "<p>How do I change the length of the excerpt shown?</p>\n<p>The Now Featureing widget uses WordPress built in functionality to get the content excerpt. This pluging enables the &#8216;Excerpt&#8217; meta box on the edit screen, below the main compose box, where you can enter your own excerpt. If you leave this blank, the first 55 characters are passed to the widget. This number can be modified by adding a filter on the &#8216;excerpt_length&#8217;, via php code in the functions.php file. Some themes allow you to change this value in the theme customizations.</p>\n",
