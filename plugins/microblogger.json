        "installation": "<p>[STEPS 2 TO 4 AND 9 ARE OPTIONAL &#8211; use only if you want the mobile UI!]</p>\n<p>1).   Extract the zip to a temporary location on your disk.</p>\n<p>2).   Enter the <code>mobile</code> directory. Then open <code>index.php</code> in a text editor.</p>\n<p>3).   Edit lines 3 to 5 to reflect the information of your wordpress holding database.</p>\n<p>4).   Copy index.php to a place on your fileserver. Bookmark this location on your mobile phone.</p>\n<p>5).   Copy the <code>microblog</code> directory to <code>[blog root directory]/wp-content/plugins</code>.</p>\n<p>6).   Activate the plugin from the word press &#8216;plugins&#8217; page.</p>\n<p>7).   Edit your theme, to include <code>&lt;?php do_action('showmicroblog'); ?&gt;</code> in the position of your choosing. Maybe the left sidebar? (This step ultimately depends on your theme, so you will have to explore your own situation here &#8211; good luck!)</p>\n<p>8).    Edit the options in the &#8216;Microblog&#8217; section of the admin area, maybe make and upload your own microblog/recent activity banners then reference them here?</p>\n<p>9).    Pay particular attention to the &#8216;Pin&#8217; setting if you want to use the mobile UI.</p>\n<p>10).   Microblog away!

This is a long term bug that appears sporadicly, I would be very grateful if you could drop a post on the comments part of the page on my blog with the exact error message. That way I&#8217;ll stand more chance of being able to actually fix this. EDIT: I <em>think</em> the problem is solved, but don&#8217;t quote me, confirmed later.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve found a bug with the plugin, how should I contact you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An email would be great thanks (samuel.ecwilliams@gmail.com), failing that the comments section of the microblog page of my blog would be great &#8211; thanks again!</p>\n</p>\n\n"
