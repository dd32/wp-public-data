First, it&#8217;s free (though it does require a web server).  Second, it is very rudimentary &#8211; you can code text into nodes/categories and retrieve the text coded into those categories.  That&#8217;s it.  Third, it runs on a web server, which means it is compatible with any platform that has a web browser.

WordPress Access Control Manager&#8221;.  While that plugin is a little complex for the purpose here, it does make it so posts are private by default, meaning only those individuals with an account on your installation can view the posts and retrieve text.</p>\n",
