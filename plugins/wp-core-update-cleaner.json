If you&#8217;re maintaining multiple WordPress sites like us, this can get tedious. So instead, we developed this plugin to take care of deleting these files for us.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20delete%20these%20files%3F'>\nWhy should I delete these files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to delete these files if you want to keep them for some reason. However, the readme file contains the version number of the WordPress version you&#8217;re running. This may be used by bots or evil people trying to hurt your site by taking advantage of security exploits in your version if you&#8217;ve not installed security patches. Also, there&#8217;s no reason to have wp-config-sample.php and the license files just laying around.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
