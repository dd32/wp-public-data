This new image is then used instead of the true original when generating image subsizes to reduce server load.</p>\n<p>Prior to 5.3, it was possible for the originally uploaded image to be displayed on the front-end, even when they were not “web ready”. Unnecessarily large images can be bad for performance and wastes bandwidth (which is unfortunate for those with slow Internet, or bandwidth caps by their service plans). This new full size image will now be displayed instead.</p>\n<p>There are some scenarios where disabling this threshold would be desired, though.
