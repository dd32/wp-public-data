        "installation": "<p>In the WordPress backend, search for the plugin &#8216;post-display-counter&#8217;. Once you found it, activate it and you are done. In the plugin options you can choose to hide the counter for all posts and for posts before a certain date. You can also hide the counter for individual posts.</p>\n<p>The plugin might not work out of the box for all themes, in that case you will have to modify the theme files. For instructions see below. Also feel free to send us an email, we are happy to help.</p>\n<p>Posts are only counted when the title is generated by the_title() function. You can count other instances by modifying the template files.</p>\n<p>add a class &#8220;countable&#8221;</p>\n<p>in the same element, add an attribute &#8220;data-served-id&#8221; with the post id as its value.</p>\n<p>For example, change this:</p>\n<h3>\n</h3>\n<p>into this:</p>\n<p>&lt;h3 class=&quot;countable&quot; data-served-id=&quot;&#8221;&gt;</p>\n</h3>\n<p>The reverse could also be needed. When you have a title that should be excluded from being counted, surround it with the functions count_remove() and function count_restore() like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php function count_remove();\n    the_title();\nfunction count_restore(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are 3 functions that you can use to display the counter on your page in any format you like. In this case you probably want to disable the default counter in the plugin options.</p>\n<p>Display default counter:\n    </p>\n<p>Display counters in your own format:</p>\n<p>        This post has been presented  times.<br />\n        This post has been opened  times. <br />\n        The open rate is  times.\n    </p>\n<p>(note that get_counters() can be used both to display the default counter as to determine if the counter is visible)</p>\n",
