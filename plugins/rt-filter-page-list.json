        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder <code>rt-filter-page-list</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Visit the new Settings / RT Filter Page List settings page to configure filtering</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='which%20type%20of%20filtering%20should%20i%20choose'>\nWhich type of filtering should I choose\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you plan on using the Pages widget that comes with WordPress, it&#8217;s probably best to filter just the output of that<br />\nwidget by selecting &#8216;Modify the behavior of the Pages widget&#8217;.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re building your own navigation based on wp_list_pages, select &#8216;Modify wp_list_pages globally&#8217;. This will filter<br />\nthe page list anywhere wp_list_pages is called. This could lead to unexpected behavior with menus and other widgets. If<br />\nthis happens on your site, you can either opt to use the Pages widget, select &#8216;None&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Selecting &#8216;None&#8217; disables the plugin&#8217;s automatic filters, but still allows you to call the<br />\nRT_Filter_Page_List::filter_html function directly to apply filtering in your code.</p>\n<pre><code>$html = wp_list_pages( $args );\n$html = RT_Filter_Page_List::filter_html( $html );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20use%20this%20instead%20of%20hiding%20pages%20through%20css%3F'>\nWhy would I use this instead of hiding pages through CSS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is meant for cases where the pages menu contains a large number of pages, or where the target browser is slow<br />\n(e.g. IE7/8). Or both. This plugin can reduce the pages listing returned by WordPress by up to 99%.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20make%20my%20site%20slower%3F'>\nWill this make my site slower?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the filtering is done server-side, your site&#8217;s pages might take slightly longer to generate. However, they will<br />\nprobably also be smaller (in terms of file size), and thus take less time to download. On sites where pages are cached,<br />\nthe effect should be negligable.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%27s%20not%20clear%20which%20page%20is%20currently%20selected'>\nIt&#8217;s not clear which page is currently selected\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not include CSS styles to highlight the currently selected page, its ancestors, or it children.<br />\nIdeally, your theme should take care of this.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
