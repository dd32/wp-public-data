When the site is ready to go live, I delete that comment. Now the site looks funny because there is a lonely &#8216;Recent Comments&#8217; title in the sidebar with nothing under it (see screenshot). I figured I could either a) remove the widget, wait until the site gets its first comment, and then add it again (the problem with this option is that I would probably forget to do that later on) or b) make a plugin so that the recent comments widget only appears if any comments exist.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to do anything beyond installing the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope that is all.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
