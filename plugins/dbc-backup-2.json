        "faq": "\n<h4>Why create a server based back-up</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It makes sense to me to keep the SQL database backup where you will most likely need it if something goes wrong. Many web hosts provide a large amount of free space for you to store files. So rather than having to pay someone else for storing your database backup you can use the free space you already have.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Aren&#8217;t server based back-ups insecure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not really, server based back-ups are only unsafe if your server is prone to fail or poorly protected from hacking.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to make my backup more secure</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s easy, the plugin creates a .htaccess file in the backup folder. You can open this file and add to this code. The backup folder is protected against browsing or direct file access.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will you add a link to download the file from the web?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, as this would mean any anonymous user with the link could download your backup file. This would make things very insecure for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t any compression format options appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because Gzip and Bzip2 are not installed on your server.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin didn&#8217;t make a backup when I setup a specific wp-cron job</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP-Cron is different to server cron as it requires WordPress to trigger the batch jobs. This means, for example if you have no visitors on your site at the time of backup then the backup will run the next time someone browses your site. The same problem also happens with things like scheduled posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Seriously?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, seriously. You can read up on wp-cron.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How long have you been using this? and have you ever restored a site from the backup?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>About 2 years I&#8217;ve been using this and yes, a few times I&#8217;ve used a backups to build a fresh website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work for multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it will create a backup of all blogs and sub-sites. In the future I hope to make it work for just selected blogs.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
