When you select Meteo Belgique forecasts, the widget will automatically default to French if you choose English or German as display language.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the way the weather info is displayed ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Belgo Meteo only modifies very slightly the way the weather info is displayed by the various providers. If you want to modify colours or background, for example, you will need to modify the css by modifying/adding the belgometeo.css file.<br />\nPlease be aware that this file does not contain all css used by the display. Many css rules are left untouched and are coming straight from the providers. You can overrule them by specifying your own css in the belgometeo.css file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
