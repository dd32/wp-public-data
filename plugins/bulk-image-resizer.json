        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20use%20bulk%20images%3F'>\nWhy use Bulk images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that most plugins that optimize images duplicate images in new folders creating a superstructure that complicates the entire site. This plugin optimizes the images you have uploaded to your site and overwrites them. The thumbs are also regenerated. If the image is converted to webp or if the name of the image is changed, the system tries to correct the images already published in the articles and pages. However, it is possible to restore at any time. If you have space problems you can always delete the original image that is used for the restore</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20resize%20images%20when%20uploaded%3F'>\nCan I resize images when uploaded?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, when you are in the setting activate &#8220;Resize when images are uploaded&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20formats%20does%20it%20support%3F'>\nWhat formats does it support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It supports jpg, webp and png formats in accordance with wordpress directives.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20decide%20not%20only%20the%20size%20but%20also%20the%20quality%20of%20the%20images%3F'>\nIs it possible to decide not only the size but also the quality of the images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can decide whether to compress high, medium or low quality images.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20go%20back%20once%20resized%3F'>\nCan I go back once resized?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes if you haven&#8217;t removed the original image.
