        "description": "<p>A field for Advanced Custom Fields that forces the user to crop their image to specific aspect ratio or pixel size after uploading. Using an aspect ratio is especially useful in responsive image use cases.</p>\n<p>After cropping, a new cropped image variant is created in the gallery and saved into the post. Thumbnails are also generated for the new image. User can re-crop the original image at any time from the post page.</p>\n<p>The cropped image variants are hidden by default in the media browser and on the media page but you can view them by selecting the &#8220;list view&#8221; on the media page.</p>\n<p>There are three modes of operation: aspect ratio, pixel size and free crop. You can select this option when creating the field in ACF field options.</p>\n<h4>Aspect ratio</h4>\n<p>Use this option if you want the image to be of specific aspect ratio like 16:9 but the pixel size is not important.</p>\n<p>After selecting an image, user can select an area from the image that matches this aspect ratio. When crop button is pressed, the area is cropped from the original image.</p>\n<p>If you need a smaller image size, you make use of WordPress&#8217;s thumbnail functionality to access a smaller version of the image.</p>\n<h4>Pixel size</h4>\n<p>Use this option if you need a specific pixel size image like 640&#215;480. User will not be able to select an image smaller than the defined pixel size.</p>\n<p>After selecting an image, user can select an area from the image they want, which can be larger than the pixel size but may not be smaller. The aspect ratio of the selection is locked according to the pixel size.</p>\n<p>When crop button is pressed, the area is cropped from the original image. After the crop is complete, the image will be automatically scaled down to the pixel size. This means the final image will always be the specified size.</p>\n<h4>Free crop</h4>\n<p>Crop can be done freely, there are no aspect ratio limitations.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.9 or later</li>\n<li>PHP 5.6 or later</li>\n<li>Advanced Custom Fields 5.8 or later (Pro or Free)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Polylang Pro</li>\n<li>Enable Media Replace</li>\n<li>\n<p>WP Offload Media, Media Cloud and other plugins that move media files to remote location</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ACF 5.8 or later (Pro or Free)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Thanks</h4>\n<p>Special thanks to Anders Thorborg for <a href=\"https://github.com/andersthorborg/ACF-Image-Crop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ACF Image Crop</a> which served as a inspiration for this plugin.

Elementor only supports built-in ACF fields. Please contact Elementor support and ask them to add support for 3rd party fields. For some workarounds for limited Elementor support, see this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-5518/\" rel=\"ugc\">post</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20with%20beaver%20builder%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin with Beaver Builder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not really. Beaver Builder only supports built-in ACF fields. Please contact Beaver Builder support and ask them to add support for 3rd party fields. However, there is a work around this limitation by using a plugin called &#8220;Toolbox For Beaver Builder&#8221;. Please <a href=\"https://beaverplugins.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see their website</a> for more details.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20an%20issue%20or%20i%20want%20to%20contribute%20code'>\nI have an issue or I want to contribute code\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please use the <a href=\"https://github.com/joppuyo/acf-image-aspect-ratio-crop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a> to raise <a href=\"https://github.com/joppuyo/acf-image-aspect-ratio-crop/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issues</a> about the plugin. You are also free to send a pull request on GitHub.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20this%20different%20from%20the%20other%20plugin%3F'>\nHow is this different from the other plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is similar to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-image-crop-add-on/\" rel=\"ugc\">Advanced Custom Fields: Image Crop Add-on</a>. I originally created a fork of that plugin to add functionality I need: specifying an aspect ratio instead of pixel size. Unfortunately the plugin doesn&#8217;t seem to be maintained anymore so my pull request was not merged.</p>\n<p>So I created <strong>ACF Image Aspect Ratio Crop</strong> from scratch as an alternative to <strong>ACF Image Crop</strong>.</p>\n<p>Possibility to use a pixel size instead of aspect ratio was added later on because I got so many requests for adding that feature.</p>\n<p>The other plugin is not actively maintained and does not work well with latest ACF versions. I try to maintain this plugin as best as I can when new versions of ACF and WordPress come out.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This release will retain all the core functionality of the plugin, but it will feature a much improved code structure. This will make it easier to extend and to add more features to the plugin. Until 7.0.0 is released, I will not be adding any more features in the 6.x.x branch of the plugin. Despite this, bug fixes are of course provided. I have a lot of ideas for new features and improvements once 7.0.0 is released, so stay tuned!</p>\n<h4>6.0.0 (2021-10-20)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Breaking change: Changed how minimum and maximum image pixel sizes work</li>\n<li>Minimum image size previously only affected the original uploaded file in aspect ratio mode. Now crop area must be larger than minimum dimensions.</li>\n<li>Maximum image size previously only affected the original uploaded file in aspect ratio mode. Now if cropped area is larger than maximum dimensions, final image will be scaled down to maximum dimensions.</li>\n<li>These changes do not apply to free crop mode, free crop minimum and maximum dimensions are disabled.</li>\n<li>Pixel size mode has always had minimum dimensions. Enforcing maximum dimensions are now disabled for pixel size mode since the image is always scaled down to pixel size.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.1.4 (2021-09-18)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Bump compatibility to WP 5.8</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.1.3 (2021-09-18)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Fix potential issue with translations, see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/get_plugin_data-called-too-early-breaks-translations-2/\" rel=\"ugc\">this thread</a> for more information</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.1.2 (2021-03-11)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Bump stable tag</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.1.1 (2021-03-11)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Bump compatiblity to WP 5.7</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.1.0 (2021-01-30)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Feature: Added REST API compatibility mode. This enables you to crop images in the WordPress administration interface with admin-ajax.php instead of the REST API. You can enable this by going to Plugins -&gt; ACF Image Aspect Ratio Crop -&gt; Settings. Please note that this is a temporary fix for sites that don&#8217;t have REST API enabled.

The aspect ratio of the selection is locked according to the pixel size.</p>\n<p>When crop button is pressed, the area is cropped from the original image. After the crop is complete, the image will be automatically scaled down to the pixel size. This means the final image will always be the specified size.</p>\n<h4>Free crop</h4>\n<p>Crop can be done freely, there are no aspect ratio limitations.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.9 or later</li>\n<li>PHP 5.6 or later</li>\n<li>Advanced Custom Fields 5.8 or later (Pro or Free)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Polylang Pro</li>\n<li>Enable Media Replace</li>\n<li>\n<p>WP Offload Media, Media Cloud and other plugins that move media files to remote location</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ACF 5.8 or later (Pro or Free)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Thanks</h4>\n<p>Special thanks to Anders Thorborg for <a href=\"https://github.com/andersthorborg/ACF-Image-Crop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ACF Image Crop</a> which served as a inspiration for this plugin.
