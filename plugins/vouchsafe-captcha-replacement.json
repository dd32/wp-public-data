        "faq": "\n<h4>How do you guarantee the availability of your service?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have taken every precaution to guarantee that VouchSafe is available and responsive. VouchSafe is hosted on multiple, geographically distinct instances of the Amazon cloud service to provide the best possible speed and availability.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does VouchSafe work with SSL?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does. Both console.vouchsafe.com, (your account managment console) and api.vouchsafe.com (the service itself) are available with 256 bit encryption.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t VouchSafe work with my contact form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike Drupal and Joomla, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a core contact component, (it really ought to), so there&#8217;s no way for us to inject our code into the particular plugin you may have installed on your website.  We&#8217;ll be actively canvassing contact plugin developers to include the option to activate VouchSafe for their plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about localization?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are currently working on integrating our localization with our cultural diversity localization engine, and we have not yet made our localization service publicly available. We&#8217;ll be announcing availability within the next few months.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does VouchSafe require Flash or Silverlight?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not. If you watch the videos on our website, you&#8217;ll see that VouchSafe is perfectly happy on the iPad, the iPhone, and a myriad of Android powered devices. VouchSafe is delivered as pure HTML5 or as an AJAX app where HTML5 is not available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I installed VouchSafe and I still got spam. What happened?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The VouchSafe plugin is designed to integrate with the core WordPress comments and registration systems. There are some vulnerabilites particular to trackbacks and certain combinations of other plugins in WordPress.  You may need to deactivate trackbacks or secure them with another plugin. If you are using a third-party plugin to manage trackbacks, you may want to ask the developer if they have an update to integrate it with VouchSafe or another validation mechanism.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
