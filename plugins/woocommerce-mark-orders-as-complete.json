To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type ‚ÄúWooCommerce Mark Orders as Complete‚Äù and click Search Plugins. You can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you‚Äôre sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it</li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation‚Äôs wp-content/plugins/ directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.</li>\n</ol>\n",

If you use these gateways and need them to work just open an issue on GitHub and I&#8217;ll look into it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
