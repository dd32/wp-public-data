        "description": "<p>Creating and keeping up with sports league stats on the internet can be a hassle. Fortunately, the Sports Bench plugin takes all of the hard work away from you. After a simple five-minute (or less) setup, you&#8217;re ready to start entering teams, players, games and even division and then watch the plugin do all of the other stuff for you. Sports Bench takes care of accumulating the stats you enter as well as the standings and schedules. The plugin has the ability to display the standings, a scoreboard of all game for the current season and statistical leaderboards. Show off game stats next to a recap of a game. Easily create pages for teams and players. And shortcodes allow you to show game, player or team information in any post. You have enough to worry about with managing your sports league; let us take care of the hard part.</p>\n<h4>Turn your website into a sports website</h4>\n<p>Sports Bench helps you turn your WordPress website into a sports website with just a few clicks of the mouse. Whether this website is for a sports league that you’re covering or a website for your local sports league, you can easily turn your website into the place to go for all of the information.</p>\n<h4>Stats and standings calculated for you</h4>\n<p>One of the great parts about Sports Bench is that it does all of the calculations for you. Simply add in players, teams and games, and Sports Bench will calculate the standings and stats for you. You don’t have to do anything else. It’s as simple as that.</p>\n<h4>Built to work with any theme</h4>\n<p>The Sports Bench plugin is built to work with any well-built WordPress theme. Whether it’s from the free WordPress theme directory, StudioPress, Themeforest or somewhere else, you can use the plugin with any theme. You might have to make small styling adjustments, but functionally it will work.</p>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Team pages</li>\n<li>Player pages</li>\n<li>Standings</li>\n<li>Stats</li>\n<li>Scoreboard</li>\n<li>Box Scores</li>\n<li>Divisions</li>\n<li>Widgets for standings, scoreboard and stats leaderboard</li>\n<li>Blocks and shortcodes for teams, players, box scores, standings, scoreboard, stats leaderboard and more</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Sports Currently Supported:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Baseball</li>\n<li>Basketball</li>\n<li>Football</li>\n<li>Hockey</li>\n<li>Rugby</li>\n<li>Soccer</li>\n<li>Volleyball</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>See what Sports Bench can do</h4>\n<p>Check out what you can do with Sports Bench by <a href=\"https://sportsbenchwp.com/demos/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">checking out one of the demos</a> for each sport. You&#8217;ll get a good idea of how Sports Bench can help you and what you can do with the plugin to make it work for your website.</p>\n<h4>Upgrade to the Sports Bench Premium Plugin</h4>\n<p>Want to get access to more blocks, as well as playoffs, stat search and other cool features? Consider <a href=\"https://sportsbenchwp.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">upgrading to the Sports Bench Premium plugin</a> where you&#8217;ll get those cool new features as well as premium support for the plugin.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>In the WordPress Dashboard, go to “Plugins” -&gt; “Add New” and search for “Sports Bench Lite” and click install and activate, OR download the zip file of the plugin and go to “Plugins” -&gt; “Add New” and click \\&#8221;Upload Plugin\\&#8221; and upload the zip file.</li>\n<li>Once the plugin has been activated, you can click on &#8220;Sports Bench&#8221; in the left hand menu in the dashboard to set up the settings. Please note that when you set the sport for your website, you should not change it as it will rewrite the game tables and wipe out that data.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20sports%20bench%20support%20multiple%20sports%20on%20the%20same%20site%3F'>\nDoes Sports Bench support multiple sports on the same site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sports Bench only supports one sport on a site at the same time. That’s just how the plugin is written. If you would like to show multiple sports, you could create a WordPress Multisite install, with a different sport on each subsite (similar to the demos).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20sports%20bench%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nIs the Sports Bench plugin compatible with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ideally it should be compatible with your theme. But that is also dependent on how your theme is created. If the theme is built up-to-WordPress standards (which includes any themes in the WordPress theme directory), then you shouldn’t have any issues. But the theme isn’t built right, you might run into issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20extend%20the%20plugin%20to%20match%20what%20i%20need.%20how%20do%20i%20do%20that%3F'>\nI want to extend the plugin to match what I need. How do I do that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sports Bench already does a lot of what you need for your website. But if you need to extend it even further, be sure to check out the Documentation for the classes, functions and filters you need to customize the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20sports%20does%20sports%20bench%20support%3F'>\nWhat sports does Sports Bench support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sports Bench currently supports baseball, basketball, football, hockey, rugby, soccer and volleyball. More sports might be added over time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
