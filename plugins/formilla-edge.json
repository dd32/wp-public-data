        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%20formilla%20edge%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow do I install Formilla Edge on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Formilla Edge works with any website platform. The fastest way to install is to use this plugin; simply activate the plugin and choose Formilla Edge from the WordPress admin menu.  You&#8217;ll see a link to <strong>Sign Up</strong> for a Formilla account and use the Plugin ID you receive to activate the plugin. You can alternatively copy and paste your unique Formilla code snippet to your webpage(s) instead. To get the code snippet, login to your Formilla.com account &gt; click <strong>Settings</strong> in the left menu &gt; then choose <strong>Installation</strong> from the sub-menu. On the following page, you&#8217;ll see simple instructions to copy/paste the code into each of your pages. Note: you only need to install this once to power your Formilla account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20formilla%20edge%20work%20with%20woocommerce%20websites%3F'>\nDoes Formilla Edge work with WooCommerce websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin easily installs with WooCommerce sites.  Install and activate the plugin from within your WordPress/WooCommerce admin panel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20an%20existing%20formilla%20live%20chat%20customer%3B%20do%20i%20need%20to%20install%20anything%20to%20begin%20using%20formilla%20edge%3F'>\nI&#8217;m an existing Formilla Live Chat customer; do I need to install anything to begin using Formilla Edge?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, we made it simple for existing live chat customers as Formilla Edge is now available to all Formilla customers! If you are currently using our live chat script or plugin, no need to add any additional plugin or code. Simply login to your Formilla account and navigate to <strong>Smart Messages</strong> in the left menu, then click the <strong>Create Smart Message</strong> button to configure your first in-app message, for example.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20an%20in-app%20or%20email%20message%20to%20announce%20a%20sale%2C%20market%20a%20new%20product%20or%20service%2C%20etc.%3F'>\nHow do I create an in-app or email message to announce a sale, market a new product or service, etc.?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To create a new in-app or email message, or to find your existing Smart Messages, mouse over &#8220;Automation&#8221; in the left menu of the Formilla dashboard, then select <strong>Smart Messages</strong> from the sub-menu that appears.  Here you can view the status of your existing messages and their performance, or simply create a new message by clicking the <strong>Create Smart Message</strong> button and choosing your desired type of message from the flydown menu.  Note: to send email messages, you&#8217;ll need to ensure your email address is verified with Formilla from the <strong>Settings</strong> &#8211;&gt; <strong>Users</strong> page, and also setup your business email with Formilla.  Once you create your first Email Smart Message, you&#8217;ll notice a link at the top to configure your <strong>Custom Email Domain</strong>; simply follow the instructions on the next page to configure your DNS records properly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20in-app%20message%20only%20displayed%20once%20when%20testing%2C%20although%20it%20will%20not%20appear%20again.%20what%20can%20i%20do%20to%20continue%20testing%3F'>\nMy in-app message only displayed once when testing, although it will not appear again. What can I do to continue testing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default setting for in-app messages is to display <strong>Once</strong> after 5 seconds. With this configuration, the message will not display again.  In this case, you can test with a different browser, or modify the settings from the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> to display the widget more frequently. For instance, we recommend setting the message to display Always and to set the &#8220;Display if user has already interacted with it?&#8221; option to Yes when testing.  This way, you&#8217;ll continuously see the message.  To find the settings mentioned, mouse over &#8220;Automation&#8221; from the left menu, then click <strong>Smart Messages</strong> from the submenu that appears. Next, click the edit/pencil icon next to your in-app message to enter the settings area, choose the 2nd tab called <strong>Message</strong>, and scroll down to the <strong>Edit Advanced Options</strong> accordion.  Be sure to click the header of the accordion to expand it and find the settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20formilla%20lead%20widgets%20app%3F'>\nWhat is the Formilla Lead Widgets app?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Formilla Lead Widgets app gives you the ability to collect email subscribers and boost your social following. You can enable it by simply logging in to your Formilla account, then mouse over <strong>Settings</strong> from the dashboard menu on the left and select <strong>My Apps</strong> from the sub-menu that appears.  Next, click <strong>Add App</strong> for Formilla Lead Widgets if it isn&#8217;t added yet. Now that you&#8217;ve enabled Formilla Lead Widgets, mouse over <strong>Settings</strong> in the left menu, and choose <strong>Widgets</strong> from the submenu that appears.  Next, click the <strong>Add Edge Widget</strong> button to configure your first Edge lead widget.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
