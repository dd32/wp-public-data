You can generate the table as often as you want, but waiting until you are done editing fields prevents creating extraneous fields in your database.  Supple Forms will not Delete table fields or custom tables.  We don&#8217;t want to risk you losing any data by stray clicks.

Simply place your field names in brackets and insert them in your snips.  For example:  &lt;div class=&#8217;neatbox&#8217;&gt;I live in [city]&lt;/div&gt;</li>\n<li>The name you give your HTML snip will be used in the shortcode that you insert into your posts/pages.  For example, a snip named address_box would be inserted with this shortcode: [supple snip=&#8217;address_box&#8217;]</li>\n<li>Finally, place shortcodes like [supple snip=&#8217;my_snip&#8217;] in your posts or pages.</li>\n<li>For the programmer in you, you have direct access to your custom table from within your template code.  Use the WordPress database object ($wpdb) to perform SQL commands and queries on your data.  Your table name (if using Custom Table) is shown in red on the Form Settings page. Supple Forms utilizes your defined WordPress table prefix ($wpdb-&gt;prefix) + the prefix &#8220;supple_&#8221;.  So a table that you named destinations would normally be in the database as:  wp_supple_destinations   (unless you changed your $wpdb-&gt;prefix to something other than the default (wp_))</li>\n</ol>\n",
