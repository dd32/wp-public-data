One of our primary focuses is ensuring that it integrates with almost any theme, anywhere, anytime, and we have utilized the power of Bootstrap to ensure that the Directory is 100% mobile ready and responsive. It won&#8217;t break all that hard work you&#8217;ve put into making sure your site works on any medium.</p>\n<h4>Here are just a few of the many features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to install, easy to configure</li>\n<li>Add the [directory] and [directory_submit] shortcode to any page (automatically installed for you, but feel free to change them)</li>\n<li>Default list sorting options for Categories,Featured and Listings in dashboard.</li>\n<li>Sort using shortcodes, i.e. [directory cat_order_by=&#8221;xxx&#8221; cat_order=&#8221;asc&#8221; fl_order_by=&#8221;xxx&#8221; fl_order=&#8221;asc&#8221; list_order_by=&#8221;xxx&#8221; list_order=&#8221;asc&#8221;]</li>\n<li>Ability to change Taxonomy and Post type slugs.</li>\n<li>Added new fields for listings.</li>\n<li>Customize the look and feel as much, or as little as you want</li>\n<li>Features can easily be enabled or disabled on the dashboard</li>\n<li>Users can easily maintain their listings through a front end control panel</li>\n<li>Fully customizable email notifications, for the admin and the user</li>\n<li>Strong focus on internationalization, we want this to work for everyone, everywhere</li>\n<li>Clean, fully responsive interface</li>\n<li>Social media integration, build traffic for your users</li>\n<li>Google Maps integration</li>\n<li>Lightweight but still powerful</li>\n<li>Supported Views: grid , compact</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More information at <a href=\"http://plugins.lddwebdesign.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugins.lddwebdesign.com</a></p>\n<h4>Extensions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://plugins.lddwebdesign.com/extensions/directory-reports-exports/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Directory Reports &amp; Exports.</a> The LDD Directory Lite Reports and Exports extension allows a user to create reports and to export listings in multiple formats e.g XML, CSV, HTML, PDF.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plugins.lddwebdesign.com/extensions/directory-import/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Directory Import.</a> The LDD Directory Lite Import extension allows a user to import listings directly to their directory via CSV files that can be edited by hand or in applications such as Microsoft Excel.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plugins.lddwebdesign.com/extensions/directory-listing-reviews/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Directory Reviews.</a> The LDD Directory Lite Reviews extension add a powerful user review system to your online directory with star ratings, comments and filterable/searchable review content.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plugins.lddwebdesign.com/extensions/directory-social-login/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Directory Social Login.</a> The LDD Directory Lite Social Login extension that allow with the ability to login with facebook, google+, linkedin logins.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plugins.lddwebdesign.com/extensions/directory-social-share/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Directory Social Share.</a> The LDD Directory Lite Social Share extension add the ability to share your directory listings on popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest and via E-mail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>This plugin is where it is thanks to the hard work and open source beliefs of a great many people.
