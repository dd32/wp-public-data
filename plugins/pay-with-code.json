        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload Plugin: Download the &#8220;Pay with Code&#8221; plugin and upload it to your WordPress site via the WordPress admin panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate Plugin: Navigate to the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; section in your WordPress admin area, find the &#8220;Pay with Code&#8221; plugin, and click &#8216;Activate&#8217;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Configure Settings: Go to the WooCommerce settings page, select &#8216;Payments&#8217; and configure the &#8220;Pay with Code&#8221; gateway settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generate Codes: Use the admin panel provided by the plugin to generate and manage purchase codes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use Codes: Inform your customers how they can purchase and use these codes during checkout.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>How do I generate codes?</p>\n<p>Admins can generate codes through the &#8216;Generate Codes&#8217; submenu in the plugin&#8217;s settings. Codes can have set expiration dates and are managed from the admin panel.</p>\n<p>What happens if a code is used or expired?</p>\n<p>The plugin provides feedback at checkout if a code has been used, is expired, or is deactivated, preventing the transaction until a valid code is entered.</p>\n<p>Is the plugin secure?</p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin uses WordPress robust verification to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.</p>\n<p>Is there a limit to the number of codes I can generate?</p>\n<p>There is no inherent limit imposed by the plugin on the number of codes you can generate. However, practical limits may depend on your server&#8217;s performance and database capabilities. Admins can generate codes as needed, based on the operational scope and capacity of their WooCommerce setup.</p>\n<p>Can I set an expiration date for generated codes?</p>\n<p>Yes, when generating codes via the admin panel, you can specify an expiration date for each code. This ensures that codes are only valid within a predetermined time frame, enhancing security and managing promotions or special offers effectively.</p>\n<p>What happens to the stock levels when a purchase code is used?</p>\n<p>Upon successful verification and use of a purchase code, the plugin automatically reduces the stock levels of the purchased items. This integration ensures that inventory levels are accurately maintained within the WooCommerce system, preventing overselling and managing supplies efficiently.</p>\n<p>Where can I get support?</p>\n<p>You can contact Dynasty via the provided link in the plugin&#8217;s description or through the support forum on the WordPress plugin repository page. Want direct contact, hit me up at holakhunle@gmail.com</p>\n",
