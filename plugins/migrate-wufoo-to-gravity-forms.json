Where do I find my Wufoo API key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is a 16 digit code, which applies for all your Wufoo forms. To obtain your key, log in to your Wufoo account, head to the Form Manager or Forms tab, and click the Code button beneath the name of any form. This will take you to the code manager. Next, click the API Information button to view your API key.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don’t want to import certain fields?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, you can do that if you don’t map the particular field with any of Gravity Form fields.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to use same fields in the gravity form as I was using in Wufoo Form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you don’t need to match every form field. Just make sure to map all the desired fields for importing data.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
