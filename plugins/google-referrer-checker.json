I want them to know about as many links pointing to my site as possible. Unfortunately, Google misses out on a good portion of the web. Well, what if you could find links that Google hasn&#8217;t necessarily found, and then make sure that Google does index them and count them?</p>\n<p>If you were go into your Google Analytics right now and export all of the pages that have sent visitors to your site since your website&#8217;s inception, what percentage of them do you think will have been indexed by Google? 90%, 95%, 99%? Sure, it will probably vary from site to site, especially given how many different sites out there have sent traffic to you, but there are likely to be a handful that Google never got around to crawling. Our goal with this first set-it and forget-it tactic is to find the pages that refer traffic to your site on-the-fly and make sure if they have a link, that Google knows about it.</p>\n<p>Ideally, our automated the script would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Record every referrer from other sites.</li>\n<li>Spider that site to see if it actually has a real, followed link.</li>\n<li>Check to see if Google had cached that referring page with the followed link.</li>\n<li>Coax Google to reindex that page if it had not yet found the link.</li>\n<li>Continue to check to see if Google had cached the referring page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is actually quite easy to accomplish programmatically. The first three steps are done every day by tools regularly used by SEOs. The only difficult part is finding a way to encourage Google to visit the referring pages it has not yet indexed. We can solve this by simply having a widget on the page that displays those referrers, essentially an &#8220;As Seen On&#8221; bulleted list of pages that had linked to your site, but had not yet been indexed.</p>\n<p>This plugin does just that.
