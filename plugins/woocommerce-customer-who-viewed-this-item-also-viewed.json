This ensures efficient performance and criteria of suggested products on your site because most of the customers consider only top visited or reviewed products.</p>\n<p>Compatibility of WordPress VIP.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Requirement</h3>\n<p>PHP version : 5.3 and latest<br />\nWordPress   : WordPress 3.0 and latest</p>\n<h3>Installation Process</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Install &#8220;Customer Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed Using Woocommerce&#8221; either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in your WordPress Admin and go to the admin panel Setting -&gt; WooCommerce -&gt; Customer Also Viewed Settings.</li>\n<li>Configure your plugin as needed.</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it.
