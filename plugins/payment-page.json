WordPress documentation contains <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation-1/\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20payment%20page%3F'>\nHow do I use Payment Page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve activated the Payment Page plugin, you can select a Payment Page template based on your business needs. Customize the template as you choose, and you&#8217;ll be accepting payments in minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20best%20wordpress%20payment%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat is the best WordPress payment plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are many plugins available to receive payments on your WordPress site. We built Payment Page to be as simple as possible to set up and accept payments as quickly as possible. It only takes 60 seconds to start accepting payments with Payment Page if you already have a Stripe account set up. For PayPal, only 2-3 minutes.</p>\n<p>We streamlined the entire process of creating flexible payment options for your customers with different currencies, payment frequencies, and intelligent filters that only display the relevant plans for customers to select.</p>\n<p>We prioritized having a wide variety of payment options because many other solutions only support one gateway and a limited number of options. Flexibility is key in a world where we have so many digital wallets, customers potentially around the world, and consumer preferences demand streamlined payment flows.</p>\n<p>Because of some of these core tools, we believe Payment Page stands apart from the crowd.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20payment%20gateways%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat Payment Gateways are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Stripe and PayPal are currently both supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20stripe%20payment%20methods%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat Stripe Payment Methods are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These are the Stripe payment methods currently supported: Credit &amp; Debit Cards, ACH via Plaid, SEPA Direct Debit, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Microsoft Pay, Alipay, WeChat Pay.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20paypal%20payment%20methods%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat PayPal Payment Methods are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These are the PayPal payment methods currently supported: PayPal Standard Checkout, Credit &amp; Debit Cards, Pay Later, Venmo, Bancontact, BLIK, eps,  giropay, iDEAL, Mercado Pago, MyBank, PRzelewy24, and SOFORT.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20recurring%20subscription%20payments%20supported%3F'>\nAre recurring subscription payments supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
