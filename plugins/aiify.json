        "description": "<p>Simplify your content creation process with <strong>Aiify</strong>, the AI-powered <strong>WordPress plugin</strong> that allows you to <strong>generate new content</strong> and <strong>enhance existing text</strong> leveraging AI technologies like <strong>ChatGPT 3 &amp; 4 and</strong> Llama models through <strong>Ollama AI</strong>, plus additional models via OpenRouter including <strong>Claude</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong>, and <strong>PaLM 2</strong>, <strong>Mistral</strong> and more. With <strong>ultra-customizable</strong> generation and <strong>seamless integration</strong> with the WordPress <strong>block editor</strong>, you can easily insert AI-generated content directly into your <strong>pages</strong> and <strong>articles</strong>, complete with structured <strong>headings</strong>, <strong>lists</strong>, <strong>bold keywords</strong>, and more. Aiify is perfect for <strong>bloggers</strong>, <strong>writers</strong>, and anyone looking to elevate their content game.</p>\n<p>Effortlessly create <strong>compelling</strong> and <strong>SEO-optimized content</strong> with Aiify. Our AI-powered plugin for <strong>WordPress</strong> simplifies the <strong>content generation</strong> and <strong>editing process</strong>, with the ability to <strong>highlight keywords</strong>, <strong>insert lists</strong>, and more. Aiify is compatible with the block editor and can be used directly from the <strong>WordPress customizer</strong> or the FSE (full site editor), streamlining your content creation process and enhancing the quality of your website&#8217;s copy.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Aiify&#8217;s versatility extends beyond block compatibility; it integrates with every TinyMCE content editor thanks to the <strong>TinyMCE plugin</strong> making it compatible with WooCommerce and most themes et plugins.</p>\n<h3>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h3>\n<p>This plugin primarily serves as a bridge to AI models like ChatGPT and a large set of models running through Ollama or OpenRouter.</p>\n<p>The main idea, particularly for content generation and editing, is to provide you with a tool (Content Editor Block or TinyMCE plugin). This tool allows you to submit a prompt to the AI, and then the AI&#8217;s response will be formatted and inserted into your post or TinyMCE editor.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the quality of the content will depend on the quality of the prompt and the model. That&#8217;s why Aiify provides you with a settings panel allowing you to fine-tune the default prompts to match your needs.</p>\n<p>So, while this plugin aims to <strong>facilitate content generation and editing</strong>, the user <strong>must acknowledge the inherent limitations of AI</strong> technology. The accuracy or appropriateness of the AI-generated content is not guaranteed and may vary based on the input provided and the selected <strong>ai model</strong>. Users are responsible for reviewing and verifying the content before use and agree to use this tool at their own risk. The developers of this plugin assume no liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from its use. Always ensure that the generated content adheres to applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>We are always open to feedback on how to make this tool better for you, so don&#8217;t hesitate to get in touch with us.</p>\n<h3>OPEN AI</h3>\n<p>Aiify utilizes the API from  <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI</a> . This plugin does not gather any information from your OpenAI account. The data transmitted to the OpenAI servers primarily consists of the AI prompt composed using our models as well as the context you specify. We may also use the API to retrieve the available models.</p>\n<p>It is important to check your usage on the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/account/usage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI website</a> for accurate information. Please also review their <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a> for further information.</p>\n<h3>Ollama (beta)</h3>\n<p>Aiify allows users to set up their preferred Ollama service, which can be self-hosted, to use multiple models from <a href=\"https://ollama.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ollama AI</a> . This plugin does not gather any information from your Ollama service. The data transmitted to your Ollama service primarily consists of the AI prompt composed using your input, as well as the context you specify. We also retrieve the available models, allowing you to choose the one you want to use.</p>\n<p>If you are using an external Ollama service and not hosting your own, please review their privacy policy and terms of use.</p>\n<h3>OpenRouter (beta)</h3>\n<p>Aiify allows users to set up their OpenRouter key to access multiple models from <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenRouter</a>. This plugin does not collect any information from your OpenRouter account. The data sent to OpenRouter consists primarily of the AI prompt and the context you specify. Additionally, we retrieve a list of available models for your convenience.</p>\n<p>Please review their <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/privacy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://openrouter.ai/terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a> for more detailed information.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h4>AI-Generated Blocks</h4>\n<p>Generate AI content Blocks using the &#8220;Aiify Block&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Model Support with Ollama and OpenRouter</h4>\n<p>With Aiify, you have the flexibility to choose from a variety of AI models, including Mistral, Mixtral, Phi, Llama2, Gemini, PaLM 2, and Claude.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20content%20copywriting%3F'>\nWhat is content copywriting?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Copywriting involves crafting persuasive written content with the goal of driving a specific action or response from the reader. It typically focuses on marketing or advertising purposes and requires an understanding of the target audience, as well as clear and engaging language.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20rewriting%2C%20editing%20and%20the%20difference%20between%20them%20%3F'>\nWhat is rewriting, editing and the difference between them ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Editing involves reviewing and making changes to an existing piece of writing in order to improve its clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness. This can involve correcting grammar and spelling errors, reorganizing sentences or paragraphs for better flow, and polishing the language to make it more engaging for the reader.</p>\n<p>Rewriting, on the other hand, involves revising the content of a piece of writing more extensively. This can include making substantial changes to the structure, tone, or focus of the piece in order to improve its overall quality and effectiveness.</p>\n<p>While editing may involve some rewriting, the two processes are not necessarily interchangeable. Editing may focus more on fine-tuning and polishing an already-existing piece of writing, while rewriting involves making more substantive changes to the content itself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20an%20openai%20api%20key%3F'>\nHow do I get an OpenAI API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can retrieve an OpenAI API key by <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/signup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">signing up</a> on the OpenAI website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20openai%20free%3F'>\nIs OpenAI free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>OpenAI offers a simple and flexible pricing model.
