You can activate it on a sitewide or network-wide basis.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work with bbPress 1.x?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Only bbPress 2.0 and newer are supported.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I specify the image to be used as a thumbnail?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It automatically grabs the first image associated with the topic. You just need to ensure the image you want appears first in the topic.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the appearance of the thumbnails?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can modify the appearance of the thumbnails using CSS. The &#8216;bbp-topic-thumbnail&#8217; selector is added to each thumbnail to enable you to add your own CSS styling.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
