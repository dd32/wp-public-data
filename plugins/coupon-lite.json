However, there were some themes that let you create a coupon site on WP in minutes.<br />\nBut, all of them lacks the essential features that a coupon website needs. They were neither user-friendly nor search engine friendly which makes it very hard to build a coupon website on WordPress. Moreover, they don&#8217;t look good, visually. That makes it hard to generate sales as the user feels it complicated to use a site that is built on such themes and plugins.<br />\n<strong>So, here we have developed a coupon plugin for WordPress which will help you to make most of your existing users. It will make it easy to generate sales and will also help you rank your site higher on search engines as we have developed plugin by keeping all the SEO standards in mind.</strong><br />\nThe Plugin is backed will all the feature that a coupon site needs, you can simply install the plugin and can turn your site into a full-fledged coupon website within minutes. Moreover, this WordPress coupon plugin supports all the WordPress themes so you can use any theme of your choice and it will turn it into a coupon theme which will help you build a good user base of online shoppers who loves to save while shopping online.<br />\n<a href=\"https://couponplugin.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check our pro version for more features.</a><br />\nFrom a normal visitor&#8217;s perspective, it is very important to have a site that is easy to navigate so the plugin introduces a very simple interface with a highly customisable look that allows you to turn your site into the way you want. The pro version gives you access to additional features which you will not see with any other coupon plugin or theme.<br />\nIt includes automatic affiliate URL Cloaking and adding a Nofollow tag to them, which will help you in ranking better in SERP. Along with that, it allows you to show coupons by category or store so you can show a bunch of coupons by single shortcode.</p>\n<p>WordPress Coupon Plugin Features</p>\n<h3>Show Coupons By Store Or Category</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a boring task to add coupons one by one so in this coupon plugin, we have introduced a special feature that will allow you to show all the coupons for specific store or category by inserting a single shortcode in the content. You can simply add a single shortcode into your content and it will start showing all the coupons you have for that store. You can also control the count of coupons if you want.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Affiliate Link Cloaking</h3>\n<p>Running a coupon site which doesn&#8217;t get traffic, is it makes sense? For getting good traffic it is necessary to have good rankings on Google. According to Google, having a lot of Dofollow outbound links are not good for SEO and it doesn&#8217;t have negative effects on SEO.<br />\nSo, to solve that problem so your site can rank higher in google we have added an automatic link cloaking system which will make your affiliate links look better and will help in SEO as well. Also, the plugin has added Nofollow tag to all the outbound links so you don&#8217;t lose any of link juice.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Click to Copy&#8221; For Coupon Codes</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to turn your visitors into your users. If you also want to make that happen then it is necessary to serve them best they need. You need to provide them compact and easy UI so they can return back to your site.<br />\nAnd if it is very hard to copy a coupon for a visitor then, I&#8217;m definitely sure that it will be a bad experience for the user and he will not dare to come back to your site. So, with intentions to make it easy to access your site for users we have added simple &#8220;Click to Copy&#8221; button which let users copy the coupon by a single click.</p>\n<h3>Easy Social Media Sharing For Coupons</h3>\n<p>Social media is one of the best ways to get traffic. In fact, it also has an impact on organic traffic as Google consider social signals as a ranking factor. So, in this plugin, we have added a direct option for social media sharing so users can easily share coupons on facebook and twitter.</p>\n<h3>Coupon Voting</h3>\n<p>In the coupon plugin, the user can easily vote on the coupon if they work for them or not. It will help you to take down all the coupons which don&#8217;t work for visitors.  It will help you to show working coupons only which will increase the trust of visitor and no wonder if they become your regular visitor.<br />\nFor most of the users even free version is enough but if you are willing to expand at a bigger level then I will recommend you to go with pro version. As that will make it easy to manage and will help you in SEO as well as that have some additional SEO Benefits.</p>\n<h3>Create A Coupon Demo</h3>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W04yxYxu_Ok?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>Show A Coupon Within A Post Demo</h3>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/npvpD-aw1kk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n",
