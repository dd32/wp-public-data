This is supported by most modern browsers and devices such as tablets and smart phones.

It is recommended that you use any alternative browser for modifying templates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Xtrad Viewer and the Wordfence Security Plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wordfence aggressively checks all insertions in the SQL database. The Xtrad Viewer uses the database to store blobs of data which increase in size as the 3D Scenes get more complex. The time that Wordfence takes to check these scenes is sufficient to exceed their timeout when the scenes are larger than a certain size.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
