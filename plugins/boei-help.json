And customers want to talk to businesses the same way they do with friends and family.</p>\n<p>70% of consumers prefer messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, and live chats over any other form of communication.</p>\n<p>Give them options with Boei.</p>\n<p>Bring all your contact channels to one location with the Boei Supermenu.<br />\nAnd engage with your clients using their preferred channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Don‚Äôt miss out on potential customers who prefer to talk to your businesses via:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Messaging apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal, WeChat, Slack, Skype, Discord‚Ä¶</li>\n<li>Social DMs like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn‚Ä¶</li>\n<li>Chat integrations like Tawk, Jivochat, Drift, Intercom, Crisp‚Ä¶</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let your visitors choose ‚Ä¶ and collect many more leads every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Click to chat: All the chat options in one button!</strong></p>\n<p>Once you use Boei your visitors are always just one click away from talking to you. Show what channels you‚Äôre available on, and let them choose their favorite apps or channel. Provide a WhatsApp button, Telegram button, FB messenger button, click-to-call button, email button, SMS button, Viber button, or many more, so you never lose a lead again.</p>\n<p>üìà <strong>More Conversions: Get 30% more leads and calls.</strong><br />\nIf you offer channels like<a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/whatsapp?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=pluginpage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> WhatsApp &amp; WhatsApp Business</a>, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram, you can convert up to 30% more visitors into leads.</p>\n<p>üëã <strong>Zero friction</strong>: <strong>Meet your customers where they are.</strong><br />\nLet your customers chat with you in a way that feels easy and natural to them. Give them options to choose their favorite apps. Include Social Media DMs like Twitter and Instagram DMs, Snapchat, and many other chat channels.</p>\n<p>üôéüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <strong>Relationship</strong>: <strong>Build trust and personal connections</strong><br />\nSurveys prove that people experience direct messaging as much more personal and feel better about brands after messaging with them. Using Boei will immediately help you build trust and create better connections.</p>\n<p>üí¨ <strong>Natural selling: Keep the conversation going and close the sale.</strong><br />\nKeep in contact with visitors after they leave your website and increase conversions by building a relationship. Just continue to chat with them. Direct messaging has the highest conversion rates you will ever experience.</p>\n<p><strong>üèÜ Support 2.0: Improve your support and service</strong><br />\nBoei will add a floating chat assistant to any page of your website. If you like, you can configure a different widget for any page of your site. Add text and video to showcase products or answer important questions. Or include maps to direct customers to your store.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Boei is better than live chat or WhatsApp alone.</strong></p>\n<p>People often prefer messaging apps like WhatsApp over regular customer support chat. Regular live chats will leave your clients tethered to the computer to wait for your answer. When you let your visitors contact you through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram, they are free to chat with you at any time, wherever they go. And you are too. By offering more options, your visitors are much more likely to contact you.</p>\n<p><strong>Boei WhatsApp integration for WordPress</strong></p>\n<p>WhatsApp is the most used messaging app worldwide. With Boei you can integrate WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business with WordPress in a matter of seconds. Just enter your WhatsApp number, and you‚Äôre ready to go. Clicking on the WhatsApp Button will take your visitor directly to the App, and they can type their message. You will then receive it on your own WhatsApp (or your WhatsApp Business account), and you can reply from wherever you are.</p>\n<p>In the premium version, you can prefill the WhatsApp Chat with a first message to save your users the time of typing. Or display a QR Code for the WhatsApp Chat, so it&#8217;s easy to move the conversation from Desktop to the mobile app.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrate Boei with Jivochat and Crisp</strong><br />\nServices like J√≠vochat and Crisp offer a shared inbox for many of your contact channels. Unfortunately, they miss several important ones. With Boei you can seamlessly integrate Jivochat and Crisp in your Supermenu and supplement it with those services they don‚Äôt natively support. Much better than cluttering your design with more buttons.</p>\n<h4><strong>Choose from 50+ Supported Chats &amp; Widgets</strong></h4>\n<p>The following channels are supported in Boei.<br />\nYou can select as many options as you want.</p>\n<p>üí¨ <strong>Messengers &amp; Social chat</strong></p>\n<p>Click to chat ‚Äì on all the leading messaging apps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/whatsapp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WhatsApp &amp; WhatsApp Business</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/blog/add-facebook-messenger-chat-to-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Messenger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/telegram\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Telegram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/twitter_messenger\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter DM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/instagram_dm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Instagram DM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/wechat\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WeChat</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/line\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Line</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/skype_chat\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Skype Chat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/sms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SMS / Text message</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/snapchat\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Snapchat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/signal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Viber</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/signal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Signal</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/discord\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Discord</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>ü§© <strong>Forms</strong><br />\nCapture leads, questions, or comments.

A must-have. No-Brainer. Thank you so much Ruben for your awesome tool.‚Äù<br />\n<strong>philippe.ruaudel</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>This is the best plugin I came across</strong> that helps you add multiple chat platforms via one small helper icon. This helps you connect with your customers on a platform of their choice.‚Äù<br />\n<strong>Bikram Singh</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>Boei is a must-have for every website.</strong> The chat tool is adaptable for most businesses, easy to set up and encourages responses immediately. And with excellent support from Ruben, you can&#8217;t go wrong with Boei!‚Äù<br />\n<strong>elgaw</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>Very happy to give 5 Stars for this plugin.</strong>  Over 70% of my business inquiries are coming from Smartphone users based on my Google Analytics. Boei allows those users to contact me on their preferred social Channel with one click‚Ä¶‚Äù<br />\n <strong>Fran Tully</strong></p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working very well! <strong>I started to make sales right after I installed this.</strong>‚Äù<br />\n <strong>Ibrahim</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>Boei is chatting with customers on steroids.</strong> It resolves a huge problem ‚Äì how to integrate all the channels people use to communicate in one place. In addition, there is an option for newsletter subscription integration. Even a contact form. Brilliant. The support is great and Ruben (the developer) is listening to his clients. Highly recommend.‚Äù<br />\n<strong>Bobby K</strong></p>\n<p>‚ÄúHow is this possible? I have been searching for a service like boei, without success for over a year. Boei just works. It works so well I was suspicious of it for nearly a whole week, sending endless texts and emails to myself in utter disbelief when it failed to keel over!</p>\n<p>Set up is straightforward, easy, and takes minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Seriously, I cannot recommend Boei enough.</strong>‚Äù<br />\n<strong>Sara Hall</strong></p>\n<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>\n<p>Boei will add a floating chat button to your website. Clicking on it will open a beautifully styled chat menu where you can choose to display buttons for Facebook Messenger chat, WhatsApp chat, Viber calls, Skype calls, and Telegram chat (+many more) as contact options for your website.</p>\n<p>Customers can select their preferred channel to contact you. Don‚Äôt miss any more leads because the customer didn‚Äôt want to mail you. Instead, visitors can quickly contact you via Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp &amp; WhatsApp Business, Telegram, social media DMs, or any other channel you offer.</p>\n<p>Boei can also integrate with several live chat solutions (Jivochat, Crisp, Tawk.to, and many more) and provide it as a channel to your customers.</p>\n<p>Boei comes with several built-in Forms: free contact form, newsletter signup form, feedback form, and callback form.</p>\n<p>On top, you can integrate videos, images, HTML code, and iframes to personalize your chat menu and give your visitors a warm welcome</p>\n<p><strong>WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp Logo are brand assets and trademark of Facebook, Inc. Boei.help is not in partnership, sponsored, or endorsed by Facebook, Inc.</strong></p>\n<h3>Our 10+ community favorites: WhatsApp and 9 other must-have channels</h3>\n<p>See our 10+ most popular channels worldwide.</p>\n<h3>Direct Email, Click-to-call, and Contact Form &#8211; the mandatory evergreens</h3>\n<p>Almost every single widget ever built with Boei features at least one, if not all of these evergreen channels. They are the backbone of your customer support and lead generation.</p>\n<h3>WhatsApp Chat &#8211; the single most important messaging channel</h3>\n<p>WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app worldwide, with Billions of users across all continents. If there is one messaging app that is almost mandatory to include, it‚Äôs WhatsApp. Especially in combination with mail, phone, and live chat, WhatsApp will perfectly supplement your existing contact options.</p>\n<h3>Tawk.to Chat &#8211; the 100% free live chat</h3>\n<p>Tawk is an anomaly in the live chat segment. Coming late to the party, they left every competitor behind with their 100% free product. Today, Tawk.to has a market share of over 20% and is the world&#8217;s leading live chat service.</p>\n<h3>Jivochat &#8211; the multichannel contact CRM</h3>\n<p>Jivochat is a contact CRM to bring your many contact channels into one location for centralized customer support or sales. With Boei you can seamlessly integrate Jivochat with many other services it does not natively support.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Messenger &#8211; a global giant</h3>\n<p>Facebook remains one of the world‚Äôs largest social networks. Its native Facebook Messenger has an active user base of roughly 1 billion people, accounting for 28% of all mobile phone messaging app users globally. So don‚Äôt sleep on Facebook Messenger as a valuable addition to your contact options.</p>\n<h3>Telegram &#8211; alternative direct messenger</h3>\n<p>Telegram comes in 4th place for most users globally. With a similar functionality to WhatsApp.</p>\n<h3>Crisp Chat &#8211; an all-in-one business messaging platform</h3>\n<p>Crisp Chat is another centralized inbox for various contact channels. With Boei you can seamlessly integrate Crisp Chat with other channels it doesn‚Äôt natively support.</p>\n<h3>Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram DMs &#8211; the mandatory social media channels</h3>\n<p>When younger people exchange contacts, it‚Äôs not emails anymore. It‚Äôs either Instagram, Snapchat, or Twitter handles. Meet your audience where they naturally connect by integrating Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat in your Boei widgets.</p>\n",

That is why all the heavy lifting is not done on Boei servers, and the WordPress Plugin just serves as a bridge. This way, only minimal queries and processes need to be done by WordPress itself and your website stays lightning-fast. A second benefit of this architecture is that Boei can easily be used across all platforms because all the configurations are done directly in your Boei account. This is better for you and us because it means we don‚Äôt have to reinvent the Boei admin area for every CMS on Earth.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20paid%20subscription%3F'>\nDo I need a paid subscription?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you can use Boei for free.

And customers want to talk to businesses the same way they do with friends and family.</p>\n<p>70% of consumers prefer messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, and live chats over any other form of communication.</p>\n<p>Give them options with Boei.</p>\n<p>Bring all your contact channels to one location with the Boei Supermenu.<br />\nAnd engage with your clients using their preferred channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Don‚Äôt miss out on potential customers who prefer to talk to your businesses via:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Messaging apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal, WeChat, Slack, Skype, Discord‚Ä¶</li>\n<li>Social DMs like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn‚Ä¶</li>\n<li>Chat integrations like Tawk, Jivochat, Drift, Intercom, Crisp‚Ä¶</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let your visitors choose ‚Ä¶ and collect many more leads every day.</p>\n<p><strong>Click to chat: All the chat options in one button!</strong></p>\n<p>Once you use Boei your visitors are always just one click away from talking to you. Show what channels you‚Äôre available on, and let them choose their favorite apps or channel. Provide a WhatsApp button, Telegram button, FB messenger button, click-to-call button, email button, SMS button, Viber button, or many more, so you never lose a lead again.</p>\n<p>üìà <strong>More Conversions: Get 30% more leads and calls.</strong><br />\nIf you offer channels like<a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/whatsapp?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=pluginpage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> WhatsApp &amp; WhatsApp Business</a>, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram, you can convert up to 30% more visitors into leads.</p>\n<p>üëã <strong>Zero friction</strong>: <strong>Meet your customers where they are.</strong><br />\nLet your customers chat with you in a way that feels easy and natural to them. Give them options to choose their favorite apps. Include Social Media DMs like Twitter and Instagram DMs, Snapchat, and many other chat channels.</p>\n<p>üôéüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <strong>Relationship</strong>: <strong>Build trust and personal connections</strong><br />\nSurveys prove that people experience direct messaging as much more personal and feel better about brands after messaging with them. Using Boei will immediately help you build trust and create better connections.</p>\n<p>üí¨ <strong>Natural selling: Keep the conversation going and close the sale.</strong><br />\nKeep in contact with visitors after they leave your website and increase conversions by building a relationship. Just continue to chat with them. Direct messaging has the highest conversion rates you will ever experience.</p>\n<p><strong>üèÜ Support 2.0: Improve your support and service</strong><br />\nBoei will add a floating chat assistant to any page of your website. If you like, you can configure a different widget for any page of your site. Add text and video to showcase products or answer important questions. Or include maps to direct customers to your store.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Boei is better than live chat or WhatsApp alone.</strong></p>\n<p>People often prefer messaging apps like WhatsApp over regular customer support chat. Regular live chats will leave your clients tethered to the computer to wait for your answer. When you let your visitors contact you through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram, they are free to chat with you at any time, wherever they go. And you are too. By offering more options, your visitors are much more likely to contact you.</p>\n<p><strong>Boei WhatsApp integration for WordPress</strong></p>\n<p>WhatsApp is the most used messaging app worldwide. With Boei you can integrate WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business with WordPress in a matter of seconds. Just enter your WhatsApp number, and you‚Äôre ready to go. Clicking on the WhatsApp Button will take your visitor directly to the App, and they can type their message. You will then receive it on your own WhatsApp (or your WhatsApp Business account), and you can reply from wherever you are.</p>\n<p>In the premium version, you can prefill the WhatsApp Chat with a first message to save your users the time of typing. Or display a QR Code for the WhatsApp Chat, so it&#8217;s easy to move the conversation from Desktop to the mobile app.</p>\n<p><strong>Integrate Boei with Jivochat and Crisp</strong><br />\nServices like J√≠vochat and Crisp offer a shared inbox for many of your contact channels. Unfortunately, they miss several important ones. With Boei you can seamlessly integrate Jivochat and Crisp in your Supermenu and supplement it with those services they don‚Äôt natively support. Much better than cluttering your design with more buttons.</p>\n<h4><strong>Choose from 50+ Supported Chats &amp; Widgets</strong></h4>\n<p>The following channels are supported in Boei.<br />\nYou can select as many options as you want.</p>\n<p>üí¨ <strong>Messengers &amp; Social chat</strong></p>\n<p>Click to chat ‚Äì on all the leading messaging apps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/whatsapp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WhatsApp &amp; WhatsApp Business</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/blog/add-facebook-messenger-chat-to-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Messenger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/telegram\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Telegram</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/twitter_messenger\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter DM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/instagram_dm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Instagram DM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/wechat\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WeChat</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/line\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Line</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/skype_chat\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Skype Chat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/sms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SMS / Text message</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/snapchat\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Snapchat</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/signal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Viber</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/signal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Signal</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boei.help/chat/wordpress/discord\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Discord</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>ü§© <strong>Forms</strong><br />\nCapture leads, questions, or comments.

A must-have. No-Brainer. Thank you so much Ruben for your awesome tool.‚Äù<br />\n<strong>philippe.ruaudel</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>This is the best plugin I came across</strong> that helps you add multiple chat platforms via one small helper icon. This helps you connect with your customers on a platform of their choice.‚Äù<br />\n<strong>Bikram Singh</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>Boei is a must-have for every website.</strong> The chat tool is adaptable for most businesses, easy to set up and encourages responses immediately. And with excellent support from Ruben, you can&#8217;t go wrong with Boei!‚Äù<br />\n<strong>elgaw</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>Very happy to give 5 Stars for this plugin.</strong>  Over 70% of my business inquiries are coming from Smartphone users based on my Google Analytics. Boei allows those users to contact me on their preferred social Channel with one click‚Ä¶‚Äù<br />\n <strong>Fran Tully</strong></p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs working very well! <strong>I started to make sales right after I installed this.</strong>‚Äù<br />\n <strong>Ibrahim</strong></p>\n<p>‚Äú<strong>Boei is chatting with customers on steroids.</strong> It resolves a huge problem ‚Äì how to integrate all the channels people use to communicate in one place. In addition, there is an option for newsletter subscription integration. Even a contact form. Brilliant. The support is great and Ruben (the developer) is listening to his clients. Highly recommend.‚Äù<br />\n<strong>Bobby K</strong></p>\n<p>‚ÄúHow is this possible? I have been searching for a service like boei, without success for over a year. Boei just works. It works so well I was suspicious of it for nearly a whole week, sending endless texts and emails to myself in utter disbelief when it failed to keel over!</p>\n<p>Set up is straightforward, easy, and takes minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Seriously, I cannot recommend Boei enough.</strong>‚Äù<br />\n<strong>Sara Hall</strong></p>\n<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>\n<p>Boei will add a floating chat button to your website. Clicking on it will open a beautifully styled chat menu where you can choose to display buttons for Facebook Messenger chat, WhatsApp chat, Viber calls, Skype calls, and Telegram chat (+many more) as contact options for your website.</p>\n<p>Customers can select their preferred channel to contact you. Don‚Äôt miss any more leads because the customer didn‚Äôt want to mail you. Instead, visitors can quickly contact you via Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp &amp; WhatsApp Business, Telegram, social media DMs, or any other channel you offer.</p>\n<p>Boei can also integrate with several live chat solutions (Jivochat, Crisp, Tawk.to, and many more) and provide it as a channel to your customers.</p>\n<p>Boei comes with several built-in Forms: free contact form, newsletter signup form, feedback form, and callback form.</p>\n<p>On top, you can integrate videos, images, HTML code, and iframes to personalize your chat menu and give your visitors a warm welcome</p>\n<p><strong>WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp Logo are brand assets and trademark of Facebook, Inc. Boei.help is not in partnership, sponsored, or endorsed by Facebook, Inc.</strong></p>\n<h3>Our 10+ community favorites: WhatsApp and 9 other must-have channels</h3>\n<p>See our 10+ most popular channels worldwide.</p>\n<h3>Direct Email, Click-to-call, and Contact Form &#8211; the mandatory evergreens</h3>\n<p>Almost every single widget ever built with Boei features at least one, if not all of these evergreen channels. They are the backbone of your customer support and lead generation.</p>\n<h3>WhatsApp Chat &#8211; the single most important messaging channel</h3>\n<p>WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app worldwide, with Billions of users across all continents. If there is one messaging app that is almost mandatory to include, it‚Äôs WhatsApp. Especially in combination with mail, phone, and live chat, WhatsApp will perfectly supplement your existing contact options.</p>\n<h3>Tawk.to Chat &#8211; the 100% free live chat</h3>\n<p>Tawk is an anomaly in the live chat segment. Coming late to the party, they left every competitor behind with their 100% free product. Today, Tawk.to has a market share of over 20% and is the world&#8217;s leading live chat service.</p>\n<h3>Jivochat &#8211; the multichannel contact CRM</h3>\n<p>Jivochat is a contact CRM to bring your many contact channels into one location for centralized customer support or sales. With Boei you can seamlessly integrate Jivochat with many other services it does not natively support.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Messenger &#8211; a global giant</h3>\n<p>Facebook remains one of the world‚Äôs largest social networks. Its native Facebook Messenger has an active user base of roughly 1 billion people, accounting for 28% of all mobile phone messaging app users globally. So don‚Äôt sleep on Facebook Messenger as a valuable addition to your contact options.</p>\n<h3>Telegram &#8211; alternative direct messenger</h3>\n<p>Telegram comes in 4th place for most users globally. With a similar functionality to WhatsApp.</p>\n<h3>Crisp Chat &#8211; an all-in-one business messaging platform</h3>\n<p>Crisp Chat is another centralized inbox for various contact channels. With Boei you can seamlessly integrate Crisp Chat with other channels it doesn‚Äôt natively support.</p>\n<h3>Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram DMs &#8211; the mandatory social media channels</h3>\n<p>When younger people exchange contacts, it‚Äôs not emails anymore. It‚Äôs either Instagram, Snapchat, or Twitter handles. Meet your audience where they naturally connect by integrating Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat in your Boei widgets.</p>\n",
