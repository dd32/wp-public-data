        "installation": "<p>There are several ways to install and activate Solid Performance for your website. Here are two of them:</p>\n<h4>Install Solid Performance via the “Add Plugins” screen</h4>\n<p>To install and activate Solid Performance via your WordPress admin area, navigate to “Plugins &gt; Add New Plugin”. On that screen, go to the search field on the far right top of the screen and type in “Solid Performance” and hit Enter. The “Solid Performance” plugin should be your first result.</p>\n<p>In the “Solid Performance” plugin card, click on the “Install Now” button. You’ll see the button change to “Installing”, then it will switch to say “Activate”, click “Activate”. At that point, Solid Performance is active on your website.</p>\n<p>Lastly, navigate to the Dashboard, then navigate to “Settings &gt; Solid Performance” and toggle the option to “Enable Page Cache”. Now your site is SOLID with Solid Performance.</p>\n<h4>Install Solid Performance via SFTP</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to wordpress.org/plugins/solid-performance and near the top right of the screen, click on “Download.” That will download the solid-performance.zip file. </li>\n<li>Unzip the file locally on your computer. That should give you a folder called “solid-performance” with all the plugin files. If there is a sub-folder in that folder also called “solid-performance” then we’ll use the sub-folder. </li>\n<li>Upload the whole “solid-performance” sub-folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Navigate to your WordPress admin area, and then to “Plugins”. You’ll see “Solid Performance” in your list of plugins, but it will not be activated. Click on the “Activate” link.</li>\n<li>The page will refresh automatically. Navigate to “Settings &gt; Solid Performance”. </li>\n<li>Toggle the “Enable Page Caching” option. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now your site is SOLID with Solid Performance!</p>\n",

But page caching (the kind Solid Performance leverages) helps specifically to improve your time to “Largest Contentful Paint”, which is one important Web Core Vital metric.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20solid%20performance%20improve%20the%20performance%20of%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow does Solid Performance improve the performance of my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When Solid Performance is activated on a site, a specific advanced cache drop-in file will be added to the wp-content directory.</p>\n<p>Using a drop-in will allow the plugin to handle serving cached responses to users before WordPress has had a chance to load fully since they load prior to MU and normal plugins.</p>\n<p>When page caching is enabled, the buffer generated by WordPress will be saved to a static HTML file within the wp-content/cache directory. On subsequent requests to the same post, Solid Performance will respond with the cached page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20solid%20performance%20compatible%20with%20popular%20plugins%20like%20woocommerce%20and%20givewp%3F'>\nIs Solid Performance compatible with popular plugins like WooCommerce and GiveWP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Solid Performance will detect active plugins that have known cache exclusions, like WooCommerce &amp; GiveWP (and more!), and implement them automatically.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
