Where is the Podigee box in the editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No worries, it&#8217;s still there – but in future version it might not be – because everything you need can now be found here: HTTP(S)://YOUR_WORDPRESS_URL/wp-admin/admin.php?page=podigee-wpqp-plugin. Here you create new drafts, here you manage your settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20a%20paid%20podigee%20plan%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need to have a paid Podigee plan to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We offer this plugin as a feature for the users of our <a href=\"https://www.podigee.com/en/plans/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">premium plans</a>. So please be fair and think about hosting your podcast at one of Germany&#8217;s leading podcast hosters. Otherwise, this plugin&#8217;s license allows you to build your own version for which, obviously, we don&#8217;t give any support.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20add%20any%20junk%20to%20my%20wordpress%20database%3F'>\nDoes this plugin add any junk to my WordPress database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No – but it stores your podcast subdomain and your auth token in the WordPress option table using the key &#8216;pfex_plugin_options&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20installed%20and%20activated%20the%20plugin%20but%20why%20don%27t%20i%20see%20it%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve installed and activated the plugin but why don&#8217;t I see it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check HTTP(S)://YOUR_WORDPRESS_URL/wp-admin/admin.php?page=podigee-wpqp-plugin – everything here is in one place. After setup, you&#8217;ll find here a list of all published episodes in your configured feed(s).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20see%20a%20list%20of%20episodes%20...%20but%20what%20do%20i%20do%20now%3F'>\nI see a list of episodes &#8230; but what do I do now?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When hovering over a episodes title, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;&gt;&gt; turn into post&#8221; (or some similar text) below the title. Click it. If everything works correctly, it will automagically save a new blog post (as draft) with all your episode&#8217;s information in it. On the confirmation page you&#8217;ll find a direkt link to preview and to edit the new episode – also the episode&#8217;s title in the list should be linked to the post draft as of now.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20only%20need%20the%20player%20shortcode%2C%20is%20this%20plugin%20any%20good%20for%20me%3F'>\nI only need the player shortcode, is this plugin any good for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Just hover over the episode you need the shortcode for an click the &#8220;&gt;&gt; copy&#8221; link below the shortcode listed to have it right in your clipboard. You can then paste it in any post or page you want.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20really%20create%20multiple%20posts%20at%20once%3F'>\nCan I really create multiple posts at once?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>YES! Just select the episodes you need from the list and select &#8220;New posts from episodes&#8221; from the dropdown. As soo as you hit &#8220;apply&#8221;, the bulk magic begins! If everything works out, you&#8217; get a list of newly created blog posts alogn with buttons for previewing and editing them. Tada!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20don%27t%20you%20set%20the%20episode%27s%20date%20as%20post%20date%3F'>\nWhy don&#8217;t you set the episode&#8217;s date as post date?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, actually we do – but as we save the episode as draft (instead of publishing it right away), WordPress overwrites the post date with the current date during publishing. You can click on &#8220;immediately&#8221; in the publish settings box and you will see, that the episode&#8217;s date is already saved here correctly. All you have to do to have this date also as post date: click on the selected day in the calendar (and then on &#8220;publish&#8221;). If you change the date after publishing the post, please keep in mind that this could (depending on your permalink structure) also change the URL of your post.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
