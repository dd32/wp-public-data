        "faq": "\n<h4>How can Enecto match the Google Analytics traffic with companies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use a manual process and some extensive internet searches to map the GA data with a company.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about ISPs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We remove traffic originating from ISPs, private ADSL/fiber lines etc.<br />\nOnly traffic coming from a traceable source (ie a leased corporate line with proper dns registration) can be traced.<br />\nNormally this is about 20-25% of the traffic to a B2B site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about privacy and individuals?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Enecto system relies on data from Google Analytics. In this data there are no individuals. Therefore Enecto can not trace any individuals.<br />\nWe are only using public sources and best guess to map the visits to companies, no hidden scripts or Enecto cookies.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What countries are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As for now, Enecto WL generates leads from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you add my country?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Enecto relies on high accuracy company databases that we purchase from reliable sources like Bisnode /Dun &amp; Bradstreet. We do not work with dubious ip databases since we do not want to pollute our reports with data from unknown origins.<br />\nRight now we are focusing to cover 21 European countries.</p>\n<p>Please contact us if you can direct us to a company database provider offering an api based service in your country.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Pricing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our price model is based on the most active companies on your website.<br />\nExample: 100 leads per month will show the 100 most active companies on your website the past 30 days. Please note that this is a top-list and the companies will be replaced either by more active visiting companies or after 30 days.<br />\nSee www.enecto.com</p>\n</p>\n\n",
