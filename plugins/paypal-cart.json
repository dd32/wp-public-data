Unlike other plugins, Paypal Cart is very simple to use and does one thing and one thing only.</p>\n<p>For each post that a blogger wants to append with the Paypal Cart, a simple metabox is provided that includes the item price, a shipping and handling charge (optional) and an inventory (number of items available).  When the inventory is &#8220;1&#8221; of more, the Paypal Cart box appears in the post along with a purchase link that takes a user into the Paypal commerce system.</p>\n<p>The Settings interface is where the blogger sets their Paypal email address, determines which of 16 different currencies they accept. They can also optionally modify the css associated with the box to make the  WP Cart for Paypal fit their style.</p>\n<p>When an item is sold, the blogger enters &#8220;Sold&#8221; or &#8220;Sold Out&#8221; in the inventory box and the item is displayed as Sold and the Purchase button is no longer visible.</p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section</h3>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Install WP Cart for Paypal as you do most plugins:</p>\n<p>Upload <code>WP_PayPal_cart.zip</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory and activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q.  How much does it cost to use WP Cart for Paypal?<br />\nA.  The only charges are those that you incur by using Paypal.  You can help support the plugin donating money.  There&#8217;s a link on the Settings page.</p>\n<p>Q.  Can I point WP Cart for Paypal at another commerce vendor?<br />\nA.  Not at this time.</p>\n<p>Q.  I have some ideas for features.  Who do I contact?<br />\nA.  Send an email to mike@Human80.com.</p>\n<p>Q.  I would like the function to appear on main index pages of my blog, not just the is_single() pages.<br />\nA.  In testing, we found that there are some templates that disable the CSS when it appears on index pages.  Until we find a solution for that, the WP Cart for Paypal box can only appear on is_single() pages.</p>\n<p>Q.  I want to feature more than one price per item.  How do I do that?<br />\nA.  Since Paypal Cart links purchases into the Paypal shopping cart function, site visitors can order more than one of an item by clicking the Purchase button multiple times.</p>\n",

Fill it in and it uses this instead.<br />\n* Eliminated &#8220;Download URL&#8221; option as there are complexities yet to be solved.</p>\n<p>= 1.2 September 19, 2014=<br />\n* Launch Version of the Plugin</p>\n"
