        "description": "<p>When using Dokan Multivendor Marketplace, it is a given that Vendors are one of the most important factors in your eCommerce business operation. They make your marketplace stand out by offering more options to customers. Thus, it is important to accommodate your vendors and provide ease in their operations.</p>\n<p>Keeping your marketplace needs and your vendor’s comfort in mind, we have developed a vendor dashboard UI that is not only visually appealing but also informative and easy to navigate. Neatly organized settings are grouped under descriptive titles so vendors can easily find the functions they are looking for.</p>\n<h4>PRODUCT CREATION AND SELLING</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Products:</p>\n<p><strong>Create Product:</strong> Vendors can easily <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/products/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create products</a> right from their dashboard. Whether it is simple products, variable products or digital products with subscription. A table view lists all the products of the vendor store under columns with “Published” or “Draft” status, stock status, price and more. Vendors are able to import and export product details with one click buttons, and a filter option to find specific products based on date, category, type and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit Product:</strong> To modify or edit a product, we have created a categorization that enables the vendor to jump between sections to make changes to only desired product functions, without having to search through all form fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Orders:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/orders/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Orders tab</a> on the vendor dashboard menu offers a listed view of current and past orders placed on the store page with details on order ID, bill amount, status, customer details, shipping status and more. Additional filter option allows for easy order search based on date range or customer name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Coupons:</p>\n<p>Vendors can host different kinds of sale campaigns to boost their store performance. In order to assist with that, if admin enables coupon creation for vendors, “<a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/coupons-2/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Coupons</a>” function is available to vendors to create custom coupons on their store products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Return Request:</p>\n<p>If vendors want to offer customized <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/modules/vendor-rma/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">return and warranty</a> facilities on their sold products, they can easily do so from their dashboards. Just head to the menu and make modifications accordingly, whether to delete, accept or change status with reasons.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when Return and Warranty Request module is active.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/settings/store-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Store SEO</a>:</p>\n<p>To rank vendor store products for search engine optimization, there are SEO tools within the dashboard on their product creation/edit box. Dokan has integrations with Yoast SEO (<a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/integrations/yoast-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see doc</a>) and Rank Math SEO (see <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/rank-math-seo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">module page</a> for details)</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> See how to do Product SEO with Yoast SEO <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-guide/how-to-do-seo-for-products/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>, and details on Rank Math SEO module.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Announcements:<br />\nIf the marketplace admin wants to communicate with all vendors listed on the marketplace, instead of one-on-one conversations, they can send an announcement. The vendors will be able to view all the admin published announcements in their <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/announcements/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Announcement</a> tab.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>ADMIN DEPENDENT MARKETPLACE CAPABILITIES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Withdrawal:</p>\n<p>Admin sets the withdrawal threshold for vendors. However, on the vendor dashboard a simple UI with withdrawal request button offers the vendor a one-click easy withdrawal process, taking away any extra hassle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Verification:</p>\n<p>Vendor verification documents and updates are available here for when they apply to sign up on a marketplace.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/seller-verification/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Seller Verification</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>STORE OPERATIONS &amp; FRONTEND DETAILS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Staff :</p>\n<p>Vendors have the option to add unlimited users to their store page and give them custom capabilities in order to manage their individual store. To set up the roles and provide each user with individual permissions, they can find the detailed forms and functions within this menu.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/vendor-staff-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vendor Staff Manager</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Store :</p>\n<p>To set up <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/settings/#:~:text=Your%C2%A0Store%20.-,Store%C2%A0Settings,-Store%20banner%20will\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">store details</a> such as store address, contact information, open close time &amp; message, and biography can all be set here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Payment :</p>\n<p>Vendors can set what type of payment options are available within their store, whether it is cash on delivery, credit cards, or eWallets (Google pay, Apple Pay, Paypal) are acceptable. They can define it on the <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/settings/#:~:text=the%20Biography%20option.-,Payment%C2%A0Settings,-The%20vendor%20can\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Payments</a> tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Reviews :</p>\n<p>All <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/reviews/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">store reviews</a> are collected for easy access to the vendor. They can choose to display, delete or report any review as spam. Unapprove option is also available if the vendor changes their mind on an approved review.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/#:~:text=rev-,Vendor%20Review,-Enable%20customers%20to\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vendor Review</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Social Profile :</p>\n<p>Social profiles have become a currency for validation in the current times. Having a social profile where customers can look through the vendor or business profile gives customers a sense of trust and a motivating factor on whether to complete a purchase. Thus, Dokan allows vendors to add multiple <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/settings/#:~:text=editing%20a%20product.-,Social%20Profiles,-Social%20profiles%20help\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">social profiles</a> on their store page and give customers the flexibility of choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Followers:</p>\n<p>Give your customers the opportunity to <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/modules/follow-store/#:~:text=Vendor%20View%20After%20Getting%20Follower\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">follow the vendor stores</a> that they find appealing. By following, customers can always be informed of changes, new products, discounts and more, while staying loyal to your marketplace.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when Follow Store module is active.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Support:</p>\n<p>Customers can contact vendors for product inquiry or information directly from their product page. Vendors are able to access all the support inquiries/tickets on their vendor dashboard under the “Support” tab and take actions accordingly.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/modules/how-to-install-and-use-store-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Store Support</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>GETTING PRODUCTS TO YOUR CUSTOMER DOORSTEPS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Delivery Time :</p>\n<p>Dokan Delivery Time allows customers to have a better shopping experience by having the flexibility of choosing a delivery time of their choice. It also assists vendors by making delivery time slots instead of constantly working on orders and their deliveries. This mutually beneficial module allows for the ease of both vendors and customers.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/#:~:text=Enterprise-,Delivery%20Time,-Make%20your%20marketplace\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Delivery Time</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/settings/#:~:text=Update%20Settings%20button.-,Shipping%20Settings,-This%20page%20contains\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shipping</a>:</p>\n<p>Every store with physical products MUST have a shipping system in their operation. After <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-guide/dokan-zone-wise-shipping/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce shipping</a> configuration, the marketplace admin needs to set up the permissions for vendors. Dokan offers this <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/settings/#:~:text=Update%20Settings%20button.-,Shipping%20Settings,-This%20page%20contains\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">setting</a> right where vendors need it the most. Vendors can also make changes to <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/settings/dokan-shipping-status/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shipping statuses</a> to keep customers informed on their order delivery status.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 ShipStation:</p>\n<p>Vendors can set up the ShipStation integration here with Authentication Key and Export Order status fields. More information is available <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/modules/shipstation-dokan-wedevs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/shipstation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ShipStation</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>VENDOR STORE ANALYTICS &amp; REPORT</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Reports :</p>\n<p>A detailed <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/vendor-dashboard/reports/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reporting overview</a> is available on the vendor dashboard that provides a holistic view of entire vendor store operations with insights on their performance. Key statistics of Store Overview, Sales by day, Top Selling products, Top Earning products, and Statement inclusive of their balance, transactions in debit and credit form are all readily available and updated in real-time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>🎯 Analytics :</p>\n<p>Vendors can view general analytics like the number of users, session duration, page views, and bounce rate, etc in an informative, graphical form.</p>\n<p>📌 <em>Note:</em> This function is dependent on and available to vendors when <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/vendor-analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vendor Analytics</a> module is active.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>More Info</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn More: <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/dokan/modules/vendor-dashboard/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Features of Dokan Vendor Dashboard</a></li>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"https://wedevs.com/docs/dokan/free-modules/dokan-vendor-dashboard/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Detailed Guide</a></li>\n<li>Compatibility:\n<ul>\n<li>Dokan: <em>v3.7.10</em> or Later.</li>\n<li>Dokan Pro: <em>v3.7.13</em> or Later.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>\n<p>Dokan Vendor Dashboard uses <a href=\"https://appsero.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Appsero</a> SDK to collect some telemetry data upon user&#8217;s confirmation.
