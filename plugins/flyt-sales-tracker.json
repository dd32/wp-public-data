        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>flyt</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.<br />\nIt will not require any configuration at now.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I configure this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you will to active this plugin from plugin manager than it will start working. You not need to do any additonal setting for this plugin. It will track all the sales information based on your domains requestes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How it Work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you will short your URL using url shortner and share to social media it will automatic track sales based on traffic get from shared shortner URL on social media websites which site your store is referenced.</p>\n<p>We have used Cookies becuase user can land on any page from any social media shared url and it will may be cantain with Ref. code like &#8220;CoolProduct&#8221;.<br />\nSo we are saved this code in cookie becuase we need to send this code when customer place order and our API call for sales track with this Ref. code.<br />\nSo we can easily generate sales report for this Ref. code based.</p>\n<p>Cookie will hold value tempary for landing page and Ref. code on customer browsers.</p>\n<p>Let me explain again here. Website owner have installed this for tracking sales. So now they will create short URL for any products with Reference code for promotions.<br />\nSo they can track howmuch sales get generate with this URL and specific Ref. code.<br />\nFor e.g. You have this product URL : https://momsfitness.staging.wpengine.com/shop/weight-loss-blueprint<br />\nand website owner will share it on any social media (facebook.com) website for promotions like : https://momsfitness.staging.wpengine.com/shop/weight-loss-blueprint/?ref=coolproduct<br />\nSo now customer get traffic from social media to website products page at the same time we are store Ref. code ( like here &#8220;coolproduct&#8221;) from URL get and save in cookie and landing from (facebook.com) website as well.<br />\nNow customer can visit navigate any of pages, when customer place there order at the same time we are sending information (landing site and Ref.code if available with website domain used) to our server after successfully placed order.<br />\nSome time order can cancle or return after placed. So we are tracking order status via API, so we can generated sales report only for completed orders.<br />\nSo now you can think about why we need to setup cookie, because we must need to store variable value for landing site and ref. code untill customer place order.<br />\nonce order placed than we are doing unset our cookie variables.<br />\nWe have working successfully our solution on magento and opencart now.</p>\n<p>3-Party APIs :<br />\nWe are using this call back APIs API URL ( https://dt-flyt-woocommerce-plugin.azurewebsites.net/apis/changeOrderStatus.php ) when order status get changed. When customer place order than most of order status have like processing or pending or else..<br />\nSo when order get completed than our system get notified via this email for this website order had completed XXX orders. So we can show report for only completed orders.</p>\n<p>Note:<br />\nWe are provide free service for just track sales revenue generated for any product page after promotions.<br />\nSo we are using your orders information for generate sales report easily track for any specific product URL.<br />\nWe are saving your orders infromation on our database for report generat.
