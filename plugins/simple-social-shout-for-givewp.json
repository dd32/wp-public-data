        "installation": "<p>AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION</p>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Simple Social Shout for GiveWP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type “Simple Social Shout for GiveWP” and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<p>MANUAL INSTALLATION</p>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here.</p>\n<p>UPDATING</p>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20sharing%20message%3F'>\nHow can I change the sharing message?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s two ways to do that:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Template file</strong><br />\nThe sharing buttons are output via template file, and the plugin FIRST checks whether you have that template in your theme. So you can override the whole template completely by creating your own template file in your theme.</p>\n<p>Simply copy the contents of the file in this plugin at <code>/wp-content/plugins/give-simple-social-shout/templates/basic-template.php</code> and copy it into a new file in your theme that would be at <code>wp-content/themes/your-theme/sss4givewp.php</code>.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that you can customize it however you like. The message is in line 6, it starts with <code>$message =</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT BE CAREFUL!!</strong></p>\n<p>Even small changes to the buttons can prevent them from sharing correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Filter</strong><br />\nIf you prefer to customize only the message and are familiar with PHP and how filters in WordPress work, you can do that with a PHP snippet like this:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('sss4givewp_message', 'my_custom_sss4givewp_message');\n\nfunction my_custom_sss4givewp_message() {\n    // Get the donation meta to output dynamic info\n    $meta = sss4givewp_template_args($args = array());\n\n    // Customize your message here\n    $message = sprintf(__('Custom FILTERED Message!! &amp;quot;%1$s&amp;quot; and donate to &amp;quot;%2$s&amp;quot;', 'sss4givewp'),$meta['org'], $meta['form_title']);\n\n    // Return the message for the filter\n    return $message;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20style%20the%20social%20share%20buttons%3F'>\nCan I style the social share buttons?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course you can use CSS, but if you want more complex customization of the appearance you can add a file into your theme&#8217;s root folder called <code>sss4givewp.php</code> and that will be the output of your social sharing instead. It&#8217;s best if you copy the template from the plugin to start from. The default template is found in the plugin in <code>/templates/basic-template.php</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20size%20of%20the%20icons%3F'>\nHow can I change the size of the icons?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way is with custom CSS. Put this in your Customizer &#8220;Additional CSS&#8221; section and you&#8217;ll get icons that are twice the current size:</p>\n<pre><code>#sss4givewp a {\n    width: 80px;\n    height: 80px;\n    padding: 18px;\n}#sss4givewp a svg {\n    width: 40px;\n    height: 40px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the <code>padding</code> of the <code>#sss4givewp a</code> rule might need minor tweaking to suit the existing styles in your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20add%20x%20social%20platform%3B%20will%20you%20add%20it%3F'>\nI want to add X social platform; will you add it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These three platforms each support a link-based sharing that does not require javascript or authentication &#8212; this is why they were chosen and why this add-on is called &#8220;simple&#8221;. But if you want to add additional platforms and know how to implement them correctly, see the above FAQ on how you can template the output yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20submit%20support%20questions%3F'>\nWhere can I submit Support Questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have purchased any of our Premium Add-ons, we can provide with your <a href=\"https://givewp.com/support?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Free_Addons&amp;utm_content=SSS4GiveWP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Priority Support here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are a free GiveWP user and have a general question about GiveWP, <a href=\"https://go.givewp.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">submit a ticket here</a>.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, if your question is specific to &#8220;Simple Social Shout for GiveWP,&#8221; we&#8217;re happy to answer your questions <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-social-shout-for-givewp/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
