The plugin also allows the attached PDF files to be embedded with images supplied by the WPForms fields. The filled PDF files can be saved on the web server.</p>\n<p>When your website visitor submits your WPForms form, the form in the PDF file is filled with the form information, images are embedded and the resulting PDF file is attached to the WPForms notification. The resulting PDF file can also be downloaded by your website visitors if this option is enabled in your form&#8217;s options.</p>\n<p>What makes this plugin special is its approach to preparing PDF files. It is not generating PDF documents from scratch. It modifies the original PDF document that was prepared using third party software and supplied to the plugin. This allows users the freedom to design exactly what they need and use their pre-existing documents.</p>\n<p>An external web API (https://pdf.ninja) is used for filling PDF forms (free usage has limitations).</p>\n<p>Requirements:<br />\n * PHP 5.5 or newer<br />\n * WordPress 5.4 or newer<br />\n * WPForms 1.6.9 or newer<br />\n * Chrome 63, Firefox 58 (or equivalent) or newer</p>\n<p>Known incompatible plugins:<br />\n* <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/\" rel=\"ugc\">Imagify</a> (strips forms from PDF files)<br />\n* <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/\" rel=\"ugc\">ShortPixel Image Optimizer</a> (strips forms from PDF files)</p>\n<p>Special thanks to the following sponsors of this plugin:<br />\n * <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BrowserStack</a></p>\n",

No special software or PHP extensions are needed. Working with PDF files is done through <a href=\"https://pdf.ninja\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pdf.Ninja API</a>. It is recommended to have a working SSL/TLS certificate validation with cURL.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20wpforms%20form%20fields%20mapped%20to%20pdf%20form%20fields%3F'>\nHow are WPForms form fields mapped to PDF form fields?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The field mapper tool allows you to map fields individually and, when needed, generate new WPForms fields on the fly. WPForms fields can be mapped to multiple PDF fields. Mappings can be associated with a specific PDF attachment or all PDF attachments. Field value mappings can also be created, allowing filled PDF fields to be filled with data that differs from the originally filled values.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20fields%20are%20not%20getting%20filled%2C%20what%20is%20wrong%3F'>\nMy fields are not getting filled, what is wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the mapping exists in the list of mappings and the field names match.</p>\n<p>If you attached an updated PDF file and your mappings were associated with the old attachment ID then those mappings will be deleted and you will need to recreate them.</p>\n<p>Sometimes PDF form fields have validation scripts which prevent value with an incorrect format to be filled in. Date PDF fields must be <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/developers/how-to-customize-date-format-in-the-date-smart-tag/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">formatted with a smart tag</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20update%20the%20attached%20pdf%20file%20without%20attaching%20a%20new%20version%20and%20losing%20attachment%20id%20associated%20mappings%20and%20embeds%3F'>\nHow do I update the attached PDF file without attaching a new version and losing attachment ID associated mappings and embeds?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/\" rel=\"ugc\">Enable Media Replace plugin</a> to replace the PDF file in-place in the Media Library.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20checkboxes%20and%2For%20radio%20buttons%20are%20not%20getting%20filled%2C%20what%20is%20wrong%3F'>\nMy checkboxes and/or radio buttons are not getting filled, what is wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure your PDF checkbox/radio field&#8217;s exported value matches the value of the WPForms form&#8217;s checkbox value. Usually, it is &#8220;On&#8221; or &#8220;Yes&#8221;. If you need to display a different value in the WPForms form, you will need to create a value mapping.</p>\n<p>WPForms allows you to have multiselect checkboxes, however, PDFs can&#8217;t have multiple values with checkbox fields. You either need to switch to using a listbox in your PDF or rename your checkboxes such that each has a unique name and then map them appropriately.</p>\n<p>Some PDF viewers don&#8217;t render checkboxes correctly in some PDF files. You may be able to solve this issue by recreating the PDF in a different PDF editor. If you are still using Pdf.Ninja API v1, switching to v2 may resolve your issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20remove%20the%20watermark%20in%20the%20filled%20pdf%20files%3F'>\nHow do I remove the watermark in the filled PDF files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://pdf.ninja\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pdf.Ninja API website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
