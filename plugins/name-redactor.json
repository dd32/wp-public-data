        "description": "<p>Note: This plugin requires at least version 3.3 of WordPress.</p>\n<p>The Name Redactor is a WordPress plugin which allows WordPress users to<br />\nhide personal data from search engines. As the name of the plugin implies,<br />\nthe type of content we are talking about in this context are personal<br />\nnames. The plugin works by checking whether the visitor to the site is<br />\nhuman or a search engine robot. If the visitor is a search engine robot,<br />\nthe plugin will redact any personal names before delivering the content,<br />\nreplacing them with the text <em>[redacted]</em>. To human visitors, the names<br />\nwill appear as normal.</p>\n<h3>Purpose of the Name Redactor</h3>\n<p>The web is full of personal names, which is usually attached to some<br />\ncontextual data (e.g. utterances, images, etc.). If these personal names<br />\nare indexed by search engines, along with the contextual<br />\ndata attached to them, both will be discoverable by anyone searching for a<br />\nspecific name. While some such discoveries may be beneficial to the<br />\nsubject, others may be harmful. The purpose of the Name Redactor is not to<br />\nblock search engines from accessing your WordPress site or indexing your<br />\ncontent. The purpose is to avoid having personal names being indexed along<br />\nwith contextual data attached to those names.</p>\n<h4>Features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Manually tag names to be redacted in pages, posts and comments by using<br />\nthe &#8216;Redact&#8217; button in the Text Editor.</li>\n<li>Automatically redact names in pages, posts and comments, using a simple<br />\nset of rules.</li>\n<li>Create an opt in list of names that should always be redacted,<br />\nregardless of any automatic name detection.</li>\n<li>Create an opt out list of names that should <em>not</em> be redacted<br />\nautomatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Detailed description</h3>\n<p>The Name Redactor plugin works by detecting if a visitor to the site is a<br />\nsearch engine robot, and if so, the plugin will redact any personal names<br />\n(which have been tagged with <code>&lt;redact content=\"name\"&gt;&lt;/redact&gt;</code>) before<br />\ndelivering the content, replacing them with the text <code>[redacted]</code>.<br />\nThe tagging can either be done manually by the publisher, or automatically<br />\nby the program.</p>\n<h4>Manually tag names</h4>\n<p>When you install the plugin for the first time, it is set by default to<br />\nonly redact names that have been manually tagged. If you go to add a new<br />\npost, page, or comment (or edit already existing content) and select the<br />\nText Editor, you will see that a new button has been added to the<br />\npre-existing ones. This button, labeled <strong>redact</strong>, allows you to tag a<br />\nname in the text. Simply select the name you want to tag, and press the<br />\nredact button. Alternatively, place the cursor before a name, press the<br />\nredact button to add the name redact tag, place the cursor after the name,<br />\nand press the redact button again to close the tag. Note that these tags<br />\nwill only be visible in the page source of the website. Before publishing<br />\nsomething, you can view the text from a bot&#8217;s point of view by pressing<br />\nthe &#8216;Preview&#8217; button (note that you first need to select this option from<br />\nthe plugin settings menu).</p>\n<p>Also note that when uninstalling the plugin, any manually tagged names<br />\nwill remain tagged. If you want to remove the tags, you will have to<br />\nremove them manually as well, by going back and editing the content.</p>\n<h4>Automatic name detection</h4>\n<p>You can also set the plugin to automatically try to detect personal names,<br />\nand redact them accordingly. This automatic name detection is accomplished<br />\nby using a simple set of rules, written as regular expressions:<br />\n1. It will match a single word with the first letter capitalized, as long<br />\nas that word is not at the beginning of the sentence.<br />\n2. It will match two or more consecutive words starting with the first<br />\nletter capitalized, as long as the first word is not at the beginning<br />\nof the sentence.</p>\n<p>Names that have been tagged manually will continue to be tagged until the<br />\ntags are manually removed (so if you at a later date should wish to remove<br />\ntags from a name, you will have to go back and edit the post, comment or<br />\npage in question). Automatic tagging is done on the spot whenever the<br />\ncontent is requested by a search engine bot. This means that the content<br />\nin the database is left unchanged, and no tags are saved along with the<br />\ntext.</p>\n<p>Detecting whether or not a visitor to the site is a web crawler, is done<br />\nby checking the &#8220;User-Agent&#8221; header of the client software originating the<br />\nrequest (see the<br />\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia page</a> for<br />\nmore information on this). Whenever a visitor requests to view the content,<br />\nbe it a page, comment, or post, the plugin will check the user-agent<br />\nstring up against a list containing a set of known search engine bot<br />\nnames. If the User-Agent matches a name in the list, the plugin will<br />\nredact any tagged content before returning it to the bot. Upon<br />\ninstallation, the plugin will add a default set of bot names to the list.<br />\nThe user can then freely add or delete names to or from the list.</p>\n<p>Note that while the plugin is primarily meant as a way of preventing<br />\nsearch engines from indexing personal names, it can, in theory, also be<br />\nused to prevent disclosure of other types of personal data, by manually<br />\ntagging it in the same manner as you would do names.</p>\n<h4>Plugin settings</h4>\n<p>You can change the settings for the plugin in the &#8216;Name Redactor Settings&#8217;<br />\nsub menu, located in the &#8216;Tools&#8217; menu in the admin panel. The Name<br />\nRedactor settings menu is organized into three different options pages,<br />\nwith tabs to make navigation easier. The option pages are organized as<br />\nfollows: Options, Opt-in/opt-out, and Bots.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Options page allows you to change all the different settings of the<br />\nplugin, like which redact-mode to use. Each setting is accompanied by an<br />\nexplanation of what it does.</li>\n<li>The Opt-in/opt-out page allows you to create a list of names that should<br />\nalways be redacted, regardless of any automatic name detection, or names<br />\nthat should <em>not</em> be redacted automatically. Each name in the list is<br />\naccompanied by an opt-in or opt-out status. Names that are opt-in will be<br />\ntagged automatically, while names that are opt-out will not. You can add<br />\nor remove names to/from the list, as well as change the opt-in/opt-out<br />\nstatus of each name in the list at any time.</li>\n<li>The Bots page displays a list of search engine bot names. Whenever<br />\nsomeone visits the site, the plugin will check the visitor (or rather,<br />\nits user agent) up against this list, and if the visitor matches a name<br />\nin the list (which means the visitor is a search engine bot), personal<br />\nnames that have been tagged will be redacted before the content is<br />\nreturned to the bot. For example, the search engine bot from Google is<br />\nnamed Googlebot. So by adding the name Googlebot to the list, you avoid<br />\npersonal names (that have been tagged for redaction) being indexed by<br />\nGoogle. The plugin comes with a default set of bot names, and you can<br />\nadd or remove names at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Credit</p>\n<p>The original idea for this plugin comes from Gisle Hannemyr<br />\n<a href=\"http://hannemyr.com/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://hannemyr.com/index.php</a>.</p>\n<h3>Uninstallation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If you want the plugin to remove all tables and options associated with<br />\nthe plugin upon deactivation, you can choose this in the Name Redactor<br />\nSettings sub menu, located in the &#8216;Tools&#8217; menu in the admin panel.</li>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>If you want to completely remove the plugin, click &#8216;Delete&#8217; next to the<br />\nplugin name in the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress, or delete the folder named<br />\n&#8216;name-redactor&#8217; in the &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory.
