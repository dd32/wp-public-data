With WP VisitorFlow you can see at a glance how visitors interact with your website: All paths taken by your visitors are summarized in a comprehensive flowchart.</p>\n<h4>Fast and Clear Visualization</h4>\n<p>WP VisitorFlow not only tracks the flow of visitors to your WordPress website, it  makes the flow visible. Detailed but still clear diagrams provide you with the full information about the visitor flow. See, how your visitors use your website. Learn, how changes in your website&#8217;s structure or new posts or pages influence the visitor flow. Use WP VisitorFlow to get feedback on your publishing actions and integrate it in your search engine optimization process.</p>\n<h4>Highly Performant, Independent and Privacy-Friendly</h4>\n<p>WP VisitorFlow has been developed with focus on website performance, usability and data privacy. Although tremendous amounts of data can arise from the flow on highly frequented websites, the plugin is optimized for minimized data storage and a minimum database load. All data is stored in your own WordPress database &#8211; no third party tool or service is necessary. Last but not least, the software has been developed to fulfill strict data privacy regulations.</p>\n<h4>Feature List</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Storage of visitor data – Web browsers, operation systems, and IP address (encryption possible).</li>\n<li>Page views – Any view of any page on your WordPress website including date and time.</li>\n<li>Visualization of the visitor flow – Step-by-step diagrams providing at-a-glance information about your visitors’ routes on your website.</li>\n<li>Statistics on search engines, web crawlers, spiders and bots, including search key words.</li>\n<li>Encapsulated data storage – All data is stored only in your own WordPress database, no external source or additional service necessary.

There is an option regarding compatibility with caching plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20no%20data%20collected%3F'>\nWhy is no data collected?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If no page view on your website is recorded by WP VisitorFlow please check the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is data recording activated under under VisitorFlow/Settings/Storage?</li>\n<li>Are you logged in as an administrator? If so, are page views by administrators excluded from data collection? This is the default setting, which can be changed under VisitorFlow/Settings/Storage.</li>\n<li>Have you visited only admin pages and are admin pages excluded from data collection? This is the default setting, which can be changed under VisitorFlow/Settings/Storage.</li>\n<li>Does your web browser submit a HTTP user-agent string and are unknown user agents excluded from data collection? Please check the &#8220;Exclude empty UA strings&#8221; settings under VisitorFlow/Settings/Storage.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20exclude%20404%20error%20pages%3F'>\nHow to exclude 404 error pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default also 404 error pages are recorded by WP VisitorFlow.

Older data is automatically is automatically aggregated on a daily basis, and only the total number of page views per post/page and the total number of referrer webpages are stored per day. This data is much smaller and is stored for an unlimited amount of time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
