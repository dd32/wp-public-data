The login takes care of this. The login directs user to the customer&#8217;s area. It will also be in the same post.</p>\n<h4>How wide should my post or page be for the calendar?</h4>\n<p>Although, the calendar supports mobile view it is your preference how wide to display your calendar. Both desktop view and mobile view display content differently and accordingly to the device screen&#8217;s width and height.</p>\n<p>So keep in mind to give the post area enough room to display calendar information for desktop view.</p>\n<h4>Can I override the plugin CSS?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you can. You can change the color and styling of the plugin. Css override is in the Control Pane1.</p>\n<p>Go to &#8220;Booking Management&#8221; -&gt; Click &#8220;Control Panel&#8221; Button<br />\n-&gt; Settings icon -&gt; Scroll down to &#8220;CSS Override&#8221;</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t my password working?</h4>\n<p>Your username and password will not work if you did not receive a plugin email password.
