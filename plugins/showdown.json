        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I name my Groups anything?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, they work just like regular WordPress categories. However, two word Group names like &#8220;My Cats&#8221; won&#8217;t work. You can try &#8220;MyCats&#8221; or just &#8220;Cats&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I specify the Group name in the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you embed the shortcode via the generator on your Post/Page write panel you can specify the Group name in the popup screen. So to specify your &#8220;Cats&#8221; Group, you would write cats in the field provided. The shortcode would then show it as: <code>group=\"cats\"</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>What features are available in the ShowDown Pro version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the feature set available in the ShowDown Pro version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Battle Mode: Create contests to pit one Competitor against another.
