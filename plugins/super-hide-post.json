Now whenever you edit a post/page or create a new one, you will see a small panel on the bottom right of the screen that shows the applicable options.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It enables you to create posts/pages that can be <em>hidden</em> (temporarily or permanently) from the homepage, feeds and/or other places. The post/page will remain accessible normally through other means, such as permalinks, archives, search, etc&#8230; and thus will remain visible to search engines.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I make a post or a page private so that no one can see it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to make a post/page completely private you don&#8217;t need this plugin. WordPress supports options such as private and/or password-protected posts/pages out of the box.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I make a post or a page *hidden* for a while, but then make it normal again?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The <em>hidden</em> flags are just another set of attributes of a post/page. They can be added or removed at any time, just like editing anything else about the post.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
