All it does it read a database table that Gravity Forms uses to store incomplete submissions.</p>\n<p>Since that database table may persist even after Gravity Forms is deleted, I decided to not require Gravity Forms’s presence to use it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin to recover Save and Continue links for other forms plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This only works for Gravity Forms. Other forms plugins may handle Save and Continue links in different ways.</p>\n<p>If I ever come across a similar need for another form plugin, I’ll make a new plugin just for that. This one will only ever work with Gravity Forms.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Works with Gravity Forms 2.3.x which changed the database table name for incomplete submissions. Will no longer work with older versions of Gravity Forms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
