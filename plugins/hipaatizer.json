        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20hipaatizer%3F'>\nWhat is HIPAAtizer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer is a WordPress plugin for a HIPAA-Compliant form builder and HIPAA-Compliant document sharing solution. Download the plugin and create a Free Sandbox Account to help your clients implement fully HIPAA-Compliant forms on their websites. You and your clients have the choice of using one of our templates or you can create customized forms using our drag &amp; drop functionality, which allows maximum customization and flexibility. You can use the WordPress HIPAA-Compliant Plugin with Gutenberg Component, HIPAAtizer dashboard, Developer Account and Contact Form 7 importer, all for free. You can add your HIPAA-Compliant form to any website with just one line of embedded code. Moreover, you can share and send your HIPAA-Compliant forms by copying short links.</p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer&#8217;s full service includes a form conversion service that allows a user to keep their existing forms, but in a fully HIPAA-Compliant and online format. In addition, HIPAAtizer provides HIPAA forms for WordPress with fully customizable, encrypted, printable PDF forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20phi%3F'>\nWhat is PHI?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAA is an act that regulates how Protected Health Information (PHI) is secured. PHI includes all individually identifiable health information, including demographic data, medical histories, test results, insurance information, and other information used to identify a patient or provide healthcare services or health care coverage. “Protected” means the information is protected under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20hipaa-compliant%20online%20form%3F'>\nWhat is a HIPAA-Compliant online form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For online forms to be fully HIPAA Compliant, all the PHI data should be encrypted at rest and in transit. To ensure <a href=\"https://www.hipaatizer.com/hipaa-compliance-resources/hipaa-compliance/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HIPAA Compliance</a>, HIPAAtizer uses FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption. In addition to data encryption, HIPAA requires that the PHI data be securely backed-up and that deletions are permanent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20hipaatizer%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does HIPAAtizer cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin and cloud sandbox account are free for developers. Covered Entities sign a Business Associate Agreement and choose an appropriate plan. Plans start from $29 a month with annual billing, depending on the size of the practice or organization. Moreover, custom packages are available for developers, marketing agencies and IT service providers  who manage multiple websites, giving them a range of advanced features and functions, all at a reasonable price. <a href=\"https://www.hipaatizer.com/contact-us/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ask us</a> about our discounts for multiple accounts.  See more information at the <a href=\"https://www.hipaatizer.com/hipaa-compliance-pricing/?utm_source=wps\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20hipaatizer%E2%80%99s%20partnership%20program%20work%3F'>\nHow does HIPAAtizer’s Partnership Program work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAAtizer appreciates that no matter what form solution you choose, you will invariably be the first point of contact for your clients when they start using the service.  In recognition of your key role in ensuring a smooth implementation, HIPAAtizer offers you an automatic 20% sales commission on any Covered Entity that you refer to the service.  As our relationship grows, you can earn 30% commission on 10 or more clients.  Do you want to handle billing or need a white label solution?   HIPAAtizer has the features and functionality to help you maintain full control of the client relationship.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20hipaatizer%20keep%20phi%20data%20protected%3F'>\nHow does HIPAAtizer keep PHI data protected?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All data that is created within HIPAAtizer is stored on fully HIPAA-Compliant servers.  HIPAAtizer’s responsibilities are clearly set out in our Business Associate Agreement that we sign with all Covered Entities.  HIPAAtizer, as a Business Associate, is subject to the same stringent privacy and security regulations as a Covered Entity.  In addition, emails, forms and other documents originating in HIPAAtizer use FIPS 140-2 compliant protocols to encrypt messages for full end-to-end encryption, and all communication is secured using SSL (TLS 1.2).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20a%20user%20be%20notified%20when%20someone%20fills%20out%20an%20online%20form%3F'>\nWill a user be notified when someone fills out an online form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, when the Covered Entity sets up its team members in HIPAAtizer, it chooses which of its users will receive a notification every time a form is submitted. Only internally approved team members will have the necessary access to open the forms to view the PHI. PHI can be included in these notifications as the PDF files containing the PHI are fully encrypted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20add%20a%20hipaa-compliant%20form%20to%20a%20website%3F'>\nHow to add a HIPAA-Compliant form to a website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install the plugin. You will see HIPAAtizer in the WordPress menu on the left. Connect your website to an existing HIPAAtizer account or create a free developer account. You can choose a form template, customize it or create your own.  After you&#8217;re happy with the form, you can publish it.  To fully activate the form, your client, the Covered Entity, should accept the HIPAAtizer Terms of Use and agree to the Business Associate Agreement.  Once this is done, the form is now fully HIPAA-Compliant and ready to use!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20forms%20can%20i%20add%3F'>\nHow many forms can I add?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are a developer, you can create as many forms as you want for free. Also, you can create forms for different Covered Entities and keep them in your folders.  For a Covered Entity, the price for our products starts from $29/month. Our custom packages give the Covered Entity an unlimited number of active forms.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
