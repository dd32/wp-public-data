If so — hooray! — it knows the share URL, and off you go.</li>\n<li>It looks for a <code>&lt;link rel=“share-url”&gt;</code> header tag on the page. The href attribute should be set to the share URL for the site, with template variables {text} and (optionally) {url} present where the share text and URL should go. (If {url} is not present, the URL to share will be appended at the end of the text.) If it’s there — yay! — we forward there, replacing {text} and {url} as appropriate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you’ve shared to a site, the next time you visit ShareOpenly, it will be in the quick links.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20let%20shareopenly%20know%20it%20can%20share%20to%20my%20social%20web%20platform%3F'>\nHow can I let ShareOpenly know it can share to my social web platform?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ShareOpenly knows about most major social networks, as well as decentralized platforms like Mastodon, Bluesky, and Known. However, if ShareOpenly is having trouble sharing to your platform, and if your platform supports a share intent, you can add the following meta tag to your page headers:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link rel=\"share-url\" href=\"https://your-site/share/intent?text={text}\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>https://your-site/share/intent?text=</code> is the URL of your share intent.</p>\n<p>The special keyword <code>{text}</code> will be replaced with the URL and share text.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
