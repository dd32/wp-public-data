For example, <code>artist=\"my-artist-name\"</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ALBUM_NUMBER will be a number.  For example, <code>album=\"55402\"</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>width and height are numbers, given without units.  For example, <code>width=\"500\"</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>STYLE is the desired player style, either &#8220;default&#8221; or &#8220;artwork&#8221;.

Save your artist name on the plugin settings, and just specifiy the album number for the shortcode:  <code>[vibedeck album=\"####\"]</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if my album has a lot of tracks and doesn&#8217;t fit in the player window?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the height parameter in the shortcode: <code>[vibedeck height=\"900\"]</code> or some other big number.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have more than one player on a screen?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, you can have multiple players on a page, in a post, or have one player in each post and list them all in an archive.  Multiple sidebar widgets are also allowed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
