The plugin will ensure your editorial calendar is consistent and predictable.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are publish dates and times determined?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a new post is saved, the plugin will check all previously scheduled posts against the publication schedule and update the new post&#8217;s publish date to the next available time slot.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I set a specific publish date and time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Admins and Editors can use the &#8216;Publish Now&#8217; to publish a post immediately, or manually override the scheduled date on the Post and Quick Edit screens. Authors do not have the ability to set a custom date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens to a time slot if I manually publish (or override) a scheduled post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The time slot that the post was originally scheduled for is freed and becomes available for the next new post. Posts already scheduled will not be modified.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
