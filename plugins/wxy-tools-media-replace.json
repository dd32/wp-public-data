No need to go to a special window or panel just to replace an image, the plugin automatically intercepts the upload and takes cares of the housekeeping.</p>\n<p>Matching is based on filenames, so the new and old filenames must be the same. This plugin searches all of your uploads folders and subfolders to find every instance of your old attachment and replaces them with the new version of your attachment so you don&#8217;t need to find and replace all your linked images in your website.</p>\n<p>New thumbnails are also generated which will reflect the new content of your latest upload(s). Also, if you have saved any meta data in the upload&#8217;s Attachment Details, these will be preserved and moved to the new upload&#8217;s Attachment Details.</p>\n<p>Works with single or multiple file uploads. The plugin also only loads if you are signed in to the admin area and have upload privileges.</p>\n<p>Temporarily turning the plugin on or off, or hiding the status messages is easy. There is a settings button on all messages or you can go to the setting menu and select the Media Replace option.
