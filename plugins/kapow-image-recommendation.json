Specifically, KAPOW will analyse your copy and identify the core topics. However, a topic can be related to other concepts. For example, if you are talking about knights this could be related to history, literature or even chess. The larger the value you set for <em>Threshold</em> the closer KAPOW remains to the main topics. If you want KAPOW to explore further afield just lower the <em>Threshold</em> value. This typically results in a larger number of images returned. Thus, if KAPOW doesn&#8217;t immediately find images, try lowering the <em>Threshold</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20minimum%20topic%20score%20%28mts%29%20slider%20do%20in%20the%20kapow%20admin%20settings'>\nWhat does the Minimum Topic Score (MTS) slider do in the KAPOW admin settings\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>KAPOW analyses your text to identify the core topics. KAPOW expresses the confidence it has about the relevance of a topic in the form of a score. The higher this score the more confident KAPOW is about the relevance of a topic. If you set a high value to the <em>MTS</em> parameter, KAPOW will dismiss any topics that score lower than that value. Sometimes however, you may purposely want to allow topics that score lower in order to create more variety and surprise in the images returned. The lower the <em>MTS</em> value, the more topics are allowed and therefore, typically, more images will be returned. As above, if KAPOW does not immediately find images, try to lower the <em>MTS</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20number%20of%20images%20per%20keyword%20%28nik%29%20do%20in%20the%20kapow%20admin%20settings'>\nWhat does the Number of Images per Keyword (NIK) do in the KAPOW admin settings\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It allows you to set the approximate number of image suggestions for each topic and concept extracted from your text.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
