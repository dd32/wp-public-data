This was causing random issues in combination with <a href=\"https://pressidium.com/blog/wordpress-plugin-conflicts-how-to-prevent-composer-dependency-hell/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">incompatible autoloading by other plugins</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.2.3 &#8211; 03/19/2024</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Recurssion error with taxonomy queries due to calling setup_post during get_terms query.

The plugin likely still works on older versions, but now only officialy support these versions and up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Preloaded plugin settings on admin pages to decrease delay before settings are available to JS. This should help settings not showing up in the editor when first loading the page.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Changed <code>'content_control/get_block_control_classes'</code> filter to include the $controls found in the block.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Various style improvements to admin pages for consistency.</li>\n<li>Fix: Typo in fetching of taxonomy labels for rule generation. This could have led to rule search results not being shown with proper labels (or empty labels).</li>\n<li>Fix: Block scanner running for all users, not just admins, triggered AJAX events that were denied every time author entered block editor.</li>\n<li>Fix: Styling issues with WP 6.4 checkbox changes.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug when filtering restrictions in the list view and no results remained, causing the filters to not work properly witoout a page refresh.</li>\n<li>Developer: Core plugin class now is extendible to allow addons to get full access to plugin internals.</li>\n<li>Developer: Added useFields api which will be used in future versions of the plugin to allow 3rd party plugins to add their own fields to the restriction editor.</li>\n<li>Developer: Added multiple new components for field organization and layout: <code>FieldRow</code>, <code>FieldPanel</code>.</li>\n<li>Developer: Added new <code>'content-control.data.registry'</code> hook in JavaScript to allow addons to register their own data stores for use in the editor &amp; settings pages.</li>\n<li>Developer: Added new <code>'content_control/restriction/bypass_user_requirements'</code> PHP filter to allow addons to bypass user requirements for more specific restrictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.0.12 &#8211; 10/26/2023</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Prevent extra 301 redirect due to missing trailing slash on some URLs.</li>\n<li>Fix: Issue with Custom Message replacement not always working on pages built with Elementor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.0.11 &#8211; 10/04/2023</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Query Monitor integration to show which restrictions are active on a page.\n<ul>\n<li>Shows global settings that may be affecting the page.</li>\n<li>Shows which restrictions are active on the page.</li>\n<li>Shows which posts are being filtered out of queries and by which restriction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Tweak: Ensure upgrade stream doesn&#8217;t send headers if they were already sent.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Make second arg on get_the_excerpt filter optional to prevent errors with some plugins.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug when using <code>content_control/check_all_restrictions</code> filter that caused rules to not compare properly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.0.10 &#8211; 10/01/2023</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: If no v1 global restrictions existed, skip the migration step entirely.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Default to late init of post query filtering until after plugins_loaded should be finished. This should prevent help prevent random errors due to restrictions being checked before plugins have had a chance to register their post types, and thus restrictions won&#8217;t properly match those post type rules.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Add check to prevent restriction checks for <strong>WP CLI</strong> requests.</li>\n<li>Improvement: Add notice to indicate is when waiting for post/page search results in the restriction editor fields.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Fix issue in build that caused autoloader to not fully use optimized classmap, should result in improved performance.</li>\n<li>Fix: Ensure <code>$wp_rewrite</code> is available before calling <code>is_rest()</code> -&gt; <code>get_rest_url()</code>. This should prevent errors when using the plugin with <strong>WP CLI</strong> and when plugins make <code>WP_Query</code> calls during <code>plugins_loaded</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix: Don&#8217;t attempt to initialize side query filtering until after_theme_setup hook. This should prevent errors when plugins make <code>WP_Query</code> calls during <code>plugins_loaded</code>, and allow further delaying initialization if needed from themes <code>functions.php</code> file.</li>\n<li>Fix: Backward compatibility issue with WP versions &lt;6.2 that made settings page not render.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug where Block Controls didn&#8217;t work on WooCommerce pages. This was filtering <code>pre_render_block</code> but not returning a value. Now we run our check after theirs to ensure that bug has no effect on our plugin. <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/11077\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Report</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>v2.0.9 &#8211; 09/24/2023</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: Better handling of restriction titles &amp; content. Admins with priv can insert any content into the restriction messages.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: Added new filter <code>content_control/query_filter_init_hook</code> to allow delaying query filtering for compatibility with plugins that make custom queries before <code>template_redirect</code> action.</p>\n<p><code>add_filter( 'content_control/query_filter_init_hook', function () {<br />\nreturn 'init'; // Try setup_theme, after_theme_setup, init or wp_loaded<br />\n} );</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tweak: Ensure our restriction checks work within a nested post loop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Tweak: Change how restriction title &amp; descriptions were sent/received over Rest API.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug that caused some shortcodes to not render properly.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug where override message wasn&#8217;t used.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug where Elementor Post loop would render incorrectly when using ACF fields in the loop template.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>v2.0.8 &#8211; 09/22/2023</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweak: Ignore many Elementor queries from being restricted.</li>\n<li>Fix: Error when required upgrade was marked as complete.</li>\n<li>Fix: Bug that caused secondary queries to be handled like main queries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v2.0.7 &#8211; 09/21/2023</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweak: Only log each unique plugin debug notice once to prevent filling log files quickly.</li>\n<li>Tweak: Replace usage of <code>wp_upload_dir</code> with <code>wp_get_upload_dir</code> which is more performant.</li>\n<li>Fix: Error in upgrades when no data is found to migrate.</li>\n<li>Fix: Error when function is called early &amp; global $wp_query is not yet available.</li>\n<li>Fix: Conditional check that could always return false.</li>\n<li>Developer: Implemented PHP Static Analysis to catch more bugs before they happen.
