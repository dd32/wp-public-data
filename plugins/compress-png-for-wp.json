        "faq": "\n<h4>Broken Images after Uploading?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes a recent API update from TinyPNG was causing images sent for compression to be overwritten with 0 size.  This has been since fixed in v1.3 but any previously broken images will have to re-uploaded.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>After uploading a JPEG/PNG file or manually shrinking, I get an error saying Unauthorized: Credentials are invalid. What is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure to enter in your API key obtained from <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/developers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TinyPNG</a> into the correct text box in the &#8216;Settings &gt; Media&#8217; page. If you do not remember your key, you can get it by entering in your email in the &#8216;Already Subscribed&#8217; box on the <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/developers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TinyPNG Developers</a> page and following the link in the email sent to you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I get an error message stating that I have &#8216;Too Many Requests&#8217;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each plan with TinyPNG has a limit of monthly requests. For example the free plan only allows 500 requests per month. If you would like to see how many requests you have made or even upgrade your plan, enter in your email in the &#8216;Already Subscribed&#8217; box on the <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/developers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TinyPNG Developers</a> page. Follow the link in the email that you receive to see your API subscription page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I get an error message sometimes stating; the php curl extension is not enabled. Compress PNG for WP will not be functional without the use of curl, what is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Compress PNG for WP uses the cURL php extension which most servers should already have installed. If you are receiving this message, check with your hosting provider to see if cURL can be enabled. <a href=\"http://us1.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read More Here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What additional image sizes (i.e. thumbnail, medium, large..) are compressed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.2 users can select exactly which additional images that are compressed via the &#8216;Settings &gt; Media&#8217; page. In version 1.1 only the original file and the large size were compressed. Prior to version 1.1 all images were compressed. However, we found that compressing all images was not efficient and many users were running out of their monthly TinyPNG credits. Since version 1.2 users get the best of both worlds, just remember each additional file size will reduce your TinyPNG monthly credits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I compress the additional image sizes that WordPress creates?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can select which additional image size to compress via the &#8216;Settings &gt; Media&#8217; page. Just select the image sizes and compress your image again in the Library page.</p>\n<p><em>Note: When compressing an image that was originally compressed in a version prior to 1.2, initially any previously compressed images will be compressed again. However, subsequent compressions will only compress images that have not yet been compressed</em>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
