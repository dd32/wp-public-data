        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20are%20false%20positives%20handled%3F'>\nHow are false positives handled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We spend a lot of time ensuring that the detection accuracy is as high as<br />\npossible but there&#8217;s always a small chance of a false positive depending on<br />\nwhere you set your threshold. In general we recommend against discarding<br />\nmessages entirely. Instead messages should be sent to a spam only address or<br />\nplaced in your Spam/Junk folder and reviewed periodically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20spampatrol%20replace%20captchas%20and%20honey%20pots%3F'>\nDoes SpamPatrol replace CAPTCHAs and honey pots?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. If you are looking for a cleaner form experience to save end-users time<br />\nand frustration SpamPatrol can replace other mechanisms. It&#8217;s also fine to use<br />\nit in addition to existing mechanisms you have in place.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20form%20plugins%20does%20it%20integrate%20with%3F'>\nWhich form plugins does it integrate with?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SpamPatrol plugin currently supports Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms and<br />\nFormidable Forms.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
