At the moment of writing this I&#8217;m running this plugin on <strong>WordPress 2.9 and PHP 5.x</strong> and works fine, and was running without problems on <strong>WP 2.8.x and 2.7.x</strong> too. If you run anything below <strong>WP 2.7 and PHP 5.x</strong>, please update for your own good! (and dont ask me for support).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why you did this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We wanted a <strong>(single) simple</strong> plugin to control the revisions on our blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are you planning to add more features?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At first only a few little improvements maybe. But if someone suggest a nice feature, and if I have time enough maybe I&#8217;ll add it.<br />\nBut it&#8217;s not my priority. I want to keep it simple.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
