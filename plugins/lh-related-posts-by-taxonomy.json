Almost all including this one I use. As I use it is built with two principles in mind. Firstly to one thing thing very well, hence no bloat and no upsells. Secondly to follow wordpress standards.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20give%20me%20some%20examples%20of%20sites%20running%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nCan you give me some examples of sites running this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://lhero.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LocalHero project website</a> and the <a href=\"https://princesparktouch.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Melbourne touch rugby association</a> I founded both run on the same multisite that uses this plugin.

Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-related-posts-by-taxonomy\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-related-posts-by-taxonomy/</a>.
