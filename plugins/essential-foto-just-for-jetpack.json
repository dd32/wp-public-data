        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1.) Since this plugin is a &#8220;skin,&#8221; you must have installed and activated Jetpack or a compatible plugin such as Gallery Carousel Without JetPack.</p>\n<p>2.) Make sure you enabled the Carousel feature under WordPress&gt; Settings&gt; Media&gt; Image Gallery Carousel.</p>\n<p>3) Simply install and activate Essential Foto Just for JetPack. There are no other settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Essential Foto Just for JetPack free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It is distributed and may be modified under the GPL, version 3 or later.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a paid version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. The free and open-licensed version is the only one. However, if this plugin is of value to you and you&#8217;d like to give back, visit (http://EssentialFoto.com) to make a voluntary payment. This is also a good place to seek tech support from the developer or other users &#8230;and thanks!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a WordPress.com account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not if you use a plugin such as Gallery Carousel Without JetPack. If you use the JetPack plugin by WordPress.com, then yes, (JetPack comes with many other features besides a gallery carousel).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Essential Foto Just for JetPack make third party connections?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not even to Google Fonts. Though the plugin it runs alongside of may or may not be set up to use 3rd party services.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I send a feature request?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. I&#8217;d love to hear what you think about Essentail Foto Just for JetPack, and how it can be improved. Head over to (http://EssentialFoto.com/Feature-Requests).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a stand-alone gallery solution?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The Essential Foto theme (not the plugin) can be used alongside any website, or as your main WordPress blog. Check it out at (http://EssentialFoto.com).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
