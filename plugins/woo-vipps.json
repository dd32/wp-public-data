        "description": "<p><em>Official Vipps MobilePay payment plugin for WooCommerce. Let your Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish customers pay with Vipps and MobilePay for an easy, fast, and familiar shopping experience</em></p>\n<p>Vipps is used by more than 77 % of Norway&#8217;s population (4.2 million users).</p>\n<p>MobilePay is used by more than 75 % of Denmark&#8217;s population (4.4 million users), and more than 36 % of Finland&#8217;s population (2 million users).</p>\n<p>Vipps and MobilePay are payment methods offered by Vipps MobilePay.</p>\n<p>When you enable this plugin, you will choose between offering either Vipps or MobilePay as a payment method for your customers &#8211; hence &#8220;Vipps/MobilePay&#8221; going forward.</p>\n<p>This is the official plugin for Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, Vipps/MobilePay ePayments (<em>Vipps Nettbetaling</em>), and Vipps Express Checkout (<em>Vipps Hurtigkasse</em>). Increase your conversion rate by letting your customers choose Vipps/MobilePay directly in the checkout or even do an Express Checkout (Vipps only) from the cart or a product page directly.</p>\n<p>You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from WooCommerce. Easy for your customer and easy for you.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">information from Vipps</a> about the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Vipps/MobilePay Checkout</h3>\n<p>With Vipps/MobilePay Checkout enabled in the plugin, you will get a complete checkout in your webshop, designed by Vipps MobilePay. It contains regular Vipps/MobilePay payments, a card payment option for those that can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t use Vipps/MobilePay, as well as the ability to get the shipping address of the customer in an easy way. Read more about <a href=\"https://vipps.no/checkout\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vipps Checkout here</a></p>\n<h3>Vipps/MobilePay ePayment</h3>\n<p>When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps/MobilePay as a payment method in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer choose Vipps/MobilePay, they fill in their name and address and is then asked to enter their phone number in the Vipps/MobilePay dialogue. They then confirms the payment in the Vipps/MobilePay app. Customer info like name and address is sent to the store from Vipps MobilePay.</p>\n<h3>Mobilepay Reservations are currently for 14 days</h3>\n<p>When a payment is completed with Vipps Mobilepay, the money will be reserved, but only transferred to the merchant when the order is set to &#8220;Complete&#8221; or the money is captured manually. <em>For Mobilepay, this reservation period is 14 days</em>, so you will need to ship and fulfill orders before this; or to make an agreement with the customer to capture the money before this period is over. For Vipps, the period is 180 days. For payments made by credit card in Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, the period can again be as short as 7 days.<br />\nFor details, please read the <a href=\"https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/reserve-and-capture/#reserve-and-capture-faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">developer FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>If the order only contains virtual and downloadable products, the plugin will capture the order automatically and set the order to &#8220;Completed&#8221; as is the standard WooCommerce rule.</p>\n<h3>Vipps Express Checkout</h3>\n<p>When you enable Express Checkout, your customers can choose between the regular checkout or to go directly to Vipps. If they choose Vipps, they just submit their phone number, and the rest of the checkout is done in the Vipps app.</p>\n<p>Since Vipps knows who the customers are, they don&#8217;t have to enter all their personal information. The customer just choose the shipping method and accepts the payment. Vipps will send all the necessary info back to the store. Easy, fast and secure.</p>\n<p>The express checkout can be done in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the cart</li>\n<li>From the category pages</li>\n<li>From the product page</li>\n<li>From shareable links distributed by email, banners etc</li>\n<li>From QR codes distributed digitally or in print</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Settings for the cart, category and product pages can be found in the WooCommerce settings for the Vipps payment gateway.</p>\n<p>Shareable links and QR codes can be generated from the Vipps tab on the product page.</p>\n<h3>How to get started</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up in the <a href=\"https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vipps MobilePay portal</a> and choose your product.</li>\n<li>After 1-2 days you will get an email with login details to Vipps Developer Portal, where you can get the API credentials</li>\n<li>Download and install the plugin</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to install the plugin</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin using WordPress’ <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">built-in installer</a>. The plugin can also be installed manually by upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Go to the WooCommerce Settings page and choose Payment Gateways (Betalinger) and enable Vipps.</li>\n<li>Go the settings page for the Vipps plugin and enter your Vipps account keys. Your account keys are available in the Vipps Developer Portal (detailed info in the section below)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to get Vipps account keys from Vipps Developer Portal</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the Vipps Portal at <a href=\"https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com/</a> using Bank ID</li>\n<li>Select the &#8220;Utvikler&#8221; (&#8220;Developer&#8221;) tab and choose Production Keys. Here you can find the merchant serial number (6 figures)</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Show keys&#8221; under the API keys column to see “Client ID”, “Client Secret” and “Vipps Subscription Key”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Contributing on Github</h3>\n<p>This project is hosted on Github at: https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-woocommerce</p>\n<h3>Extending the Order Management API integration</h3>\n<p>From version 1.10.0, this plugin implements the Vipps Order Management API, sending a receipt to the customers&#8217; app, and sending the order confirmation link as the Order Confirmation link category.  You can, using this api, send over an image and a link for the categories receipt (RECEIPT), ticket (TICKET), shipping (DELIVERY), booking (BOOKING) and a general category (GENERAL).</p>\n<p>For instance, if you have a page or url for tracking shipping, you can add this to the customers&#8217; app by extending the &#8216;woo_vipps_add_order_categories&#8217; filter like so:</p>\n<pre><code>   add_filter('woo_vipps_add_order_categories', function ($categories, $order, $gateway) {\n          $shippingpagedata = array(\n            'link' =&gt; &lt;your shipping URL here&gt;, \n            'image' =&gt; &lt;filename or attachment ID of your illustration for shipping here, if required&gt;,\n            'imagesize' =&gt; &lt;for attachments, the image size to use&gt;);\n          $categories['DELIVERY'] = $shippingpagedata;\n          return $categories;\n      }, 10, 3);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can similarily send ticket information (with e.g. a QR code) for the TICKET or BOOKING category and so forth.</p>\n<h4>Javascript filters and actions</h4>\n<p>From version 1.1.13 you can also modify the javascript using the new WP hooks library for javascript:<br />\n * &#8216;vippsBuySingleProduct&#8217; &#8211; action which is run whenever a customer tries to buy a single product using express checkout<br />\n * &#8216;vippsBuySingleProductCompatMode&#8217; &#8211; filter which should return true or false, if true, the compatibility mode action will be run instead of the standard ajax.<br />\n * &#8216;vippsBuySingleProductCompatModeAction&#8217; &#8211; filter which should return a javascript function to run when buying a product and compatibility mode is on. Will normally press the &#8220;Buy&#8221; button for you.<br />\n * &#8216;vippsRemoveErrorMessages&#8217; &#8211; runs when Vipps error messages are to be removed.<br />\n * &#8216;vippsErrorMessage&#8217; &#8211; runs for every Vipps error message added with Javascript. Takes the message as an argument<br />\n * &#8216;vippsAddErrorMessage&#8217; &#8211; runs when an error message is about to be added. Takes the message as an argument<br />\n * &#8216;vippsInit&#8217;  &#8211; runs when a page with a Vipps button is initialzed<br />\n * &#8216;vippsStatusCheckErrorHandler&#8217; &#8211; A filter that should return function taking a statustext and an error object. It receives the default error handler, and is called when checking the order status with ajax for some reason ends up in an error.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='in%20which%20countries%20can%20i%20use%20vipps%2Fmobilepay%3F'>\nIn which countries can I use Vipps/MobilePay?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Vipps is currently only available in Norway (77 % user adoption in 2022)<br />\nMobilePay is currently only available in Denmark and Finland (75 % and 36 % user adoption in 2022, respectively).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20help%20if%20i%20have%20any%20issues%3F'>\nHow can I get help if I have any issues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For issues with your WooCommerce installation you should use the support forum here on wordpress.org. For other issues you should contact Vipps MobilePay.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20orders%20put%20on-hold%20and%20not%20processing%20or%20completed%3F'>\nWhy are orders put on-hold and not processing or completed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This was the old default of this plugin until version 2.0. The newer default is now &#8216;processing&#8217;, but this also means that orders that are &#8216;processing&#8217; will have their payment reserved, but not transferred to the merchant. You can still choose the status on-hold in the options screen.</p>\n<p>If you choose on-hold, orders with this status will have the payment reserved, but not yet transferred to the merchant. The money must be &#8216;captured&#8217; before they are actually transferred to the merchant. You are normally only allowed to do this at the same time as the order is shipped. You can &#8216;capture&#8217; the money explicitly on the order screen; but the money will be captured automatically when the order is set to &#8220;Processing&#8221; or &#8220;Complete&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you use the default or choose &#8220;processing&#8221;, the same applies to this status: The order will be reserved, but not captured. You can do the capture manually, or it will automatically happen when the order is set to &#8220;Complete&#8221;. Please note that you should ensure that your workflow is then so that the order is captured just before the package is shipped.</p>\n<p>There is an exception for orders where all items are both virtual and downloadable: These are not considered to need processing and will be captured automatically (and go directly to the &#8216;Complete&#8217; status). It is possible to customize this property for your needs using the woocommerce_order_item_needs_processing filter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20refund%20orders%20or%20part%20of%20orders%20using%20vipps%2Fmobilepay'>\nCan I refund orders or part of orders using Vipps/MobilePay\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can do refunds, including partial refunds, using the standard WooCommerce mechanism (https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-refunds/). Additionally, if you cancel an order that was already captured, the money will be refunded for the whole order if the order is not too old. For older orders, you must use the refund mechanism explicitly. This is a safety feature.<br />\n If automatic refund through the Vipps API should fail, you will need to refund manually; in this case an error message to this effect will be displayed and the order annotated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20%27compatibility%20mode%27%20in%20the%20settings%3F'>\nWhat is &#8216;compatibility mode&#8217; in the settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some plugins add new features to products or entirely new product types to WooCommerce; which the &#8216;Express Checkout&#8217; function may not be able to handle. It can be possible to fix this using hooks and filters, but if you choose this feature, express checkout will be done in a different manner which is very much more likely to work for a given plugin. The cost is that the process will be <em>slightly</em> less smooth.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20my%20shipping%20wrong%20when%20using%20express%20checkout%3F'>\nWhy is my shipping wrong when using express checkout?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It may be that the shipping method you are using some how does not work when calculated from the Vipps app, where the customer is somewhat anonymous. However, since version 1.4.0 this problem ought to be greatly reduced, so if you still have this problem, report this on the forum and we&#8217;ll try to fix it.</p>\n<p>If you have shipping methods that add additional information on the &#8216;normal&#8217; checkout page they will not be able to provide that information to Express Checkout plugin, since that page is bypassed. You may be able to add those options on a different page; but you may want to remove those options when using Express Checkout.</p>\n<p>Formerly, there was a filter used to work around this, namely &#8216;woo_vipps_shipping_methods&#8217;. This still works, but if you use it, it will disable the &#8216;new&#8217; shipping method calculation. You may still customize the Express Checkout shipping; the new filter is called &#8216;woo_vipps_shipping_rates&#8217;.</p>\n<p>To be sure, you should test your shipping methods in Express Checkout before going live.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27d%20like%20to%20use%20sequential%20order%20numbers%20at%20vipps%20instead%20of%20the%20woocommerce%20order-ids%20using%20a%20sequential%20order%20number%20plugin.%20does%20this%20plugins%20support%20that%3F'>\nI&#8217;d like to use sequential order numbers at Vipps instead of the WooCommerce order-ids using a sequential order number plugin. Does this plugins support that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, though you need to ensure that the order-id&#8217;s you produce like this are unique for your Vipps account, and you currently have to use a filter in your themes&#8217; functions.php file. We recommend using a prefix for your order ids, so a filter that will work with sequential order numbers would look like</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('woo_vipps_orderid', function ($default, $prefix, $order) {\n    return $prefix . $order-&gt;get_order_number();\n}, 10, 3);\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='firewall%20ports'>\nFirewall ports\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ensure <em>outgoing</em> traffic to port 443 is open. This is used to communicate with Vipps servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20vipps%20offer%20a%20test%20environment%20for%20vipps%20for%20woocommerce%3F'>\nDoes Vipps offer a test environment for Vipps for WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but you will need a separate account, and you will need to install a special test version of the Vipps app, available trough Testflight. For your test account, the keys will be at https://portal-test.vipps.no; you will configure these in the developer mode settings.</p>\n<p>Contact Vipps for access to the test app. This app must be installed on a device that does not have the normal Vipps app installed, or there will be conflicts.</p>\n<p>To use test mode, switch &#8220;Developer mode&#8221; on. There you can input the test keys from portal-test.vipps.no and turn test mode on and off.</p>\n<p>If this isn&#8217;t practical for your usage, we recommend that you &#8220;test in production&#8221; with a small amount, like 2 NOK. Just refund or cancel the purchase as needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20requirements%3F'>\nWhat are the requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.3.4 or newer is required</li>\n<li>PHP 7.0 or higher is required.</li>\n<li>An SSL Certificate is required.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='filters%20and%20hooks%20for%20customization'>\nFilters and Hooks for customization\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several filters and hooks you can use to customize the behaviour of this plugin:<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_is_available&#8217;: Takes a boolean availability argument and the gateway and must return true or false<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_express_checkout_available&#8217;: Takes a boolean availability argument and the gateway and must return true or false.<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_cart_express_checkout_button&#8217;: Receives a complete button text and the URL needed to proceed to the express checkout page.<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_express_checkout_banner&#8217;: Receives a message with an express checkout button and an URL for the same, should return a message for the express checkout banner normally shown on the checkout page<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_buy_now_button&#8217;: Takes HTML for the button, and optionally product id, variation id, sku and if the button is to be shown as disabled by default<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_show_express_checkout&#8217; &#8211; Takes a boolean, returns whether or not to show the express checkout button<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_show_single_product_buy_now&#8217; &#8211; Takes a boolean and a product, returns true if the product should show a &#8216;buy now with vipps&#8217; button<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_show_single_product_buy_now_in_loop&#8217; &#8211; Like above, but especially for products shown in the loop &#8211; catalog pages, archives and so forth<br />\n * Filter: &#8216;woo_vipps_spinner&#8217;: takes one argument which is a &#8216;wait&#8217; spinner for certain pages<br />\n * Filter &#8216;woo_vipps_express_checkout_shipping_rates&#8217; which replaces the &#8216;woo_vipps_shipping_methods&#8217;.

This precalculates the shipping options before sending the user to Vipps, but be aware: All the options must be static (like fixed price and so forth).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020.03.03 version 1.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tiny change to avoid logging non-errors if no shipping method has been chosen at all</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020.02.25 version 1.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: The template chooser mechanism caused WP_DEBUG to print out error messages if the option wasn&#8217;t set.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020.02.24 version 1.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly round prices with wc_format_decimal (Thanks to Shattique @ netthandlesgruppen for reporting)</li>\n<li>Ensure &#8216;spinner&#8217; on page forwarding to Vipps is centered</li>\n<li>New option in settings: Override the page template used for the Vipps special pages (choose &#8216;full width&#8217; and so forth here.)</li>\n<li>New shipping handling of shipping callbacks in Express Checkout makes shipping methods using meta data work &#8211; that is, all shipping methods that have added meta data for for instance integration with transport companies and so forth.t</li>\n<li>DEPRECATION: The filter &#8216;woo_vipps_shipping_methods&#8217; is <em>deprecated</em> as of version 1.4.0. If you use it, it will continue to work as before, but it will disable the new Express Checkout Shipping mechanism, and thus will not support metadata in the shipping methods; which certain shipping methods need &#8211; in particular those with integration with other services. A notice will be printed on the admin screen, and an option will be shown in the settings that will allow you to silence this warning (and then everything will work as before) or to disable this filter if you prefer to use the new method.</li>\n<li>New filter &#8216;woo_vipps_express_checkout_shipping_rates&#8217; which replaces the filter above, taking the same arguments (a list of shipping methods, and order, and a cart). The format of the shipping methods is however different: They will consist of an array of &#8216;rate&#8217; which is a WC_Shipping_Rate object, &#8216;priority&#8217; which is an integer and the sort-order Vipps will use to display the alternatives, and &#8216;default&#8217;, which is a boolean: This will be the default choice</li>\n<li>New filter &#8216;woo_vipps_default_shipping_method&#8217; taking the default shipping method ID, a list of the shipping methods available (as a table from method id to WC_Shipping_Rate object) and the order. Return a shipping rate id, like &#8216;local_pickup:5&#8217;.</li>\n<li>New filter &#8216;woo_vipps_vipps_formatted_shipping_methods&#8217;. This will take an array of the methods to be sent to Vipps, formatted as required by Vipps. This is mostly for debugging.</li>\n<li>DEPRECATION: the filter &#8216;woo_vipps_express_checkout_shipping_rate&#8217; will only be applied if you use the old method of doing shipping for express checkout; thus you will have to have overridden the  &#8216;woo_vipps_shipping_methods&#8217; filter too. This is replaced by the filter &#8216;woo_vipps_express_checkout_final_shipping_rate&#8217;, which takes an WC_Shipping_Rate object, the order and the shipping info from Vipps and must return a WC_Shipping_Rate object.</li>\n<li>Replace use of file_get_contents with the WP http api methods, thus there is no longer any requirement for having allow_url_fopen true</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020.02.07 version 1.3.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved error-handling in validate-express-checkout; thanks to lykkelig @wp.org</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020.02.03 version 1.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added protection for repeat orders from customers who don&#8217;t get enough feedback that their order is complete</li>\n<li>Added terms-and-conditions checkbox to the interstitial screen on Vipps Express Checkout</li>\n<li>Added filters and hooks to facilitate validation of an express checkout order</li>\n<li>Fixed fee calculations for carts in express checkout (thanks to Shattique @ netthandelsgruppen for reporting &amp; fixing)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2020.01.22 version 1.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested up to version 3.9.0 of WooCommerce and 5.3.2 of WP</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2018.06</h4>\n<p>Initial version &#8211; changelog truncated</p>\n"

    "description": "<p><em>Official Vipps MobilePay payment plugin for WooCommerce. Let your Norwegian, Danish, and Finnish customers pay with Vipps and MobilePay for an easy, fast, and familiar shopping experience</em></p>\n<p>Vipps is used by more than 77 % of Norway&#8217;s population (4.2 million users).</p>\n<p>MobilePay is used by more than 75 % of Denmark&#8217;s population (4.4 million users), and more than 36 % of Finland&#8217;s population (2 million users).</p>\n<p>Vipps and MobilePay are payment methods offered by Vipps MobilePay.</p>\n<p>When you enable this plugin, you will choose between offering either Vipps or MobilePay as a payment method for your customers &#8211; hence &#8220;Vipps/MobilePay&#8221; going forward.</p>\n<p>This is the official plugin for Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, Vipps/MobilePay ePayments (<em>Vipps Nettbetaling</em>), and Vipps Express Checkout (<em>Vipps Hurtigkasse</em>). Increase your conversion rate by letting your customers choose Vipps/MobilePay directly in the checkout or even do an Express Checkout (Vipps only) from the cart or a product page directly.</p>\n<p>You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from WooCommerce. Easy for your customer and easy for you.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">information from Vipps</a> about the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Vipps/MobilePay Checkout</h3>\n<p>With Vipps/MobilePay Checkout enabled in the plugin, you will get a complete checkout in your webshop, designed by Vipps MobilePay. It contains regular Vipps/MobilePay payments, a card payment option for those that can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t use Vipps/MobilePay, as well as the ability to get the shipping address of the customer in an easy way. Read more about <a href=\"https://vipps.no/checkout\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vipps Checkout here</a></p>\n<h3>Vipps/MobilePay ePayment</h3>\n<p>When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps/MobilePay as a payment method in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer choose Vipps/MobilePay, they fill in their name and address and is then asked to enter their phone number in the Vipps/MobilePay dialogue. They then confirms the payment in the Vipps/MobilePay app. Customer info like name and address is sent to the store from Vipps MobilePay.</p>\n<h3>Mobilepay Reservations are currently for 14 days</h3>\n<p>When a payment is completed with Vipps Mobilepay, the money will be reserved, but only transferred to the merchant when the order is set to &#8220;Complete&#8221; or the money is captured manually. <em>For Mobilepay, this reservation period is 14 days</em>, so you will need to ship and fulfill orders before this; or to make an agreement with the customer to capture the money before this period is over. For Vipps, the period is 180 days. For payments made by credit card in Vipps/MobilePay Checkout, the period can again be as short as 7 days.<br />\nFor details, please read the <a href=\"https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/reserve-and-capture/#reserve-and-capture-faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">developer FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>If the order only contains virtual and downloadable products, the plugin will capture the order automatically and set the order to &#8220;Completed&#8221; as is the standard WooCommerce rule.</p>\n<h3>Vipps Express Checkout</h3>\n<p>When you enable Express Checkout, your customers can choose between the regular checkout or to go directly to Vipps. If they choose Vipps, they just submit their phone number, and the rest of the checkout is done in the Vipps app.</p>\n<p>Since Vipps knows who the customers are, they don&#8217;t have to enter all their personal information. The customer just choose the shipping method and accepts the payment. Vipps will send all the necessary info back to the store. Easy, fast and secure.</p>\n<p>The express checkout can be done in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the cart</li>\n<li>From the category pages</li>\n<li>From the product page</li>\n<li>From shareable links distributed by email, banners etc</li>\n<li>From QR codes distributed digitally or in print</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Settings for the cart, category and product pages can be found in the WooCommerce settings for the Vipps payment gateway.</p>\n<p>Shareable links and QR codes can be generated from the Vipps tab on the product page.</p>\n<h3>How to get started</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign up in the <a href=\"https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Vipps MobilePay portal</a> and choose your product.</li>\n<li>After 1-2 days you will get an email with login details to Vipps Developer Portal, where you can get the API credentials</li>\n<li>Download and install the plugin</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to install the plugin</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin using WordPress’ <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">built-in installer</a>. The plugin can also be installed manually by upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Go to the WooCommerce Settings page and choose Payment Gateways (Betalinger) and enable Vipps.</li>\n<li>Go the settings page for the Vipps plugin and enter your Vipps account keys. Your account keys are available in the Vipps Developer Portal (detailed info in the section below)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to get Vipps account keys from Vipps Developer Portal</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the Vipps Portal at <a href=\"https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com/</a> using Bank ID</li>\n<li>Select the &#8220;Utvikler&#8221; (&#8220;Developer&#8221;) tab and choose Production Keys. Here you can find the merchant serial number (6 figures)</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Show keys&#8221; under the API keys column to see “Client ID”, “Client Secret” and “Vipps Subscription Key”</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Contributing on Github</h3>\n<p>This project is hosted on Github at: https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-woocommerce</p>\n<h3>Extending the Order Management API integration</h3>\n<p>From version 1.10.0, this plugin implements the Vipps Order Management API, sending a receipt to the customers&#8217; app, and sending the order confirmation link as the Order Confirmation link category.  You can, using this api, send over an image and a link for the categories receipt (RECEIPT), ticket (TICKET), shipping (DELIVERY), booking (BOOKING) and a general category (GENERAL).</p>\n<p>For instance, if you have a page or url for tracking shipping, you can add this to the customers&#8217; app by extending the &#8216;woo_vipps_add_order_categories&#8217; filter like so:</p>\n<pre><code>   add_filter('woo_vipps_add_order_categories', function ($categories, $order, $gateway) {\n          $shippingpagedata = array(\n            'link' =&gt; &lt;your shipping URL here&gt;, \n            'image' =&gt; &lt;filename or attachment ID of your illustration for shipping here, if required&gt;,\n            'imagesize' =&gt; &lt;for attachments, the image size to use&gt;);\n          $categories['DELIVERY'] = $shippingpagedata;\n          return $categories;\n      }, 10, 3);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can similarily send ticket information (with e.g. a QR code) for the TICKET or BOOKING category and so forth.</p>\n<h4>Javascript filters and actions</h4>\n<p>From version 1.1.13 you can also modify the javascript using the new WP hooks library for javascript:<br />\n * &#8216;vippsBuySingleProduct&#8217; &#8211; action which is run whenever a customer tries to buy a single product using express checkout<br />\n * &#8216;vippsBuySingleProductCompatMode&#8217; &#8211; filter which should return true or false, if true, the compatibility mode action will be run instead of the standard ajax.<br />\n * &#8216;vippsBuySingleProductCompatModeAction&#8217; &#8211; filter which should return a javascript function to run when buying a product and compatibility mode is on. Will normally press the &#8220;Buy&#8221; button for you.<br />\n * &#8216;vippsRemoveErrorMessages&#8217; &#8211; runs when Vipps error messages are to be removed.<br />\n * &#8216;vippsErrorMessage&#8217; &#8211; runs for every Vipps error message added with Javascript. Takes the message as an argument<br />\n * &#8216;vippsAddErrorMessage&#8217; &#8211; runs when an error message is about to be added. Takes the message as an argument<br />\n * &#8216;vippsInit&#8217;  &#8211; runs when a page with a Vipps button is initialzed<br />\n * &#8216;vippsStatusCheckErrorHandler&#8217; &#8211; A filter that should return function taking a statustext and an error object. It receives the default error handler, and is called when checking the order status with ajax for some reason ends up in an error.</p>\n",
