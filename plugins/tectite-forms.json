We all know email can be unreliable.  We record form submissions so you<br />\ncan check that you haven&#8217;t lost a contact. Plus, we send you a daily report so you<br />\ncan reconcile the emails you&#8217;ve received with the count shown.<br />\nThese features are critical if your website visitors are important to you.</li>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>.  Historically, many PHP mail scripts have been notoriously insecure.<br />\nBy using our server for form processing your server cannot be compromised by a faulty<br />\nmail script you might install.</li>\n<li><strong>Anti-spam</strong>. We have over 10 years experience (since 2002) in anti-spam technology for form processing &#8211; without<br />\nrequiring the CAPTCHA that your visitors probably dislike.  Also, by analyzing spam information from many Hosted<br />\nForm users, we&#8217;re always improving the technology to minimize any form spam.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
