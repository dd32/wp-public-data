Post and page authors can navigate available galleries from their SmugMug account and choose images to add.</p>\n<p>The plugin first authorizes the user to a smug mug account.

        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow does an admin decide which galleries to display?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the &#8220;Gallery Options&#8221; tab on the settings page of SmugMug Embed, administrators choose which galleries they want to display on the embed form by navigating their SmugMug folder structure and selecting galleries.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nNo galleries are being displayed on the settings page&#8230;What is happening?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin must first authenticate with smugmug.  If this has not been done, please click the &#8220;Start Activation With SmugMug&#8221; button.<br />\nIf the plugin has been authenticated in the past and something is still wrong, click the &#8220;Delete SmugMug Authentication&#8221; button on the setting page for SmugMug Embed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is the process to authenticate with SmugMug?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Start Authentication With SmugMug&#8221; button.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Click here to log into SmugMug to approve access&#8221;.  This will open a new window on SmugMug.com which will ask the user to verify credentials.</li>\n<li>Enter the username and password when prompted (if not already logged into SmugMug).  Once complete, the screen will display &#8220;SmugMugEmbed was added to your Authorized Applications&#8221; and will take you back to the settings page on your website.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWill the Demo version expire?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no expiration date for the demo version. However, the demo version only allows one image to be embedded with the plugin per page or post.  Also, there is a watermark placed on all embeded images.  The watermark will be be removed automatically when you upgrade to the full version. Upgrade to the full version (including 1 year of support) to unlock all the features of SmugMug Embed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I get the full version of the SmugMug Embed plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply follow the upgrade link on the settings page to purchase a support license. An email will be sent with your password. Plug that password along with your email address into the SmugMug Embed settings page.  The plugin update will be available through the standard plugin mechanism within 12 hours of purchase.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
