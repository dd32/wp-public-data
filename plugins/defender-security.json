Limit login attempts so hackers can&#8217;t guess passwords. Permanently ban IPs or trigger a timed lockout after a set number of failed login attempts. Use Geo IP blocking to ban users from specific countries or locations.</p>\n<h3>Firewall Security and IP Manager</h3>\n<p>Improve your website security with Defender&#8217;s IP manager and firewall. Manually block specific IPs, import a list of banned IPs, and set automated timed and permanent lockouts. Defender makes it easy to block and unblock specific locations quickly thanks to its advanced firewall security(WAF) offering Geographical IP blocking.</p>\n<h3>User Agent Banning</h3>\n<p>Add user agents to the block or allowlist and stop bad bots from spamming and scraping your site. All major search engines and special network bots are allow-listed out of the box. Easy to set up, Defender&#8217;s user agent banning tool does all the security work, with no editing of the .htaccess file required.</p>\n<h3>Google reCAPTCHA Integration</h3>\n<p>Add reCAPTCHA security to your login / registration pages, lost password forms, and post comments in a couple of steps to up security and help protect from fraud and abuse. Select reCAPTCHA type, language, location, and style to suit. As well as Google, Defender also supports the following reCAPTCHA types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress reCAPTCHA</li>\n<li>WooCommerce reCAPTCHA</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Login Screen Masking</h3>\n<p>Defender makes it easy to move your login screen to a custom URL. Not only does login screen masking improve security, but it also lets you white label your login user experience and improves branding.</p>\n<h3>Force Password Reset</h3>\n<p>Enhance site security by forcing all users with selected roles to reset their password at any time. Especially helpful if you suspect a possible data breach on your site.</p>\n<h3>Security Headers</h3>\n<p>Protect your site against common attacks, such as: XSS, code injection, cross site scripting, and more. Enable the following security headers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X-Frame-Options</li>\n<li>X-XSS-Protection</li>\n<li>X-Content-Type-Options</li>\n<li>Strict Transport</li>\n<li>Referrer Policy</li>\n<li>Permissions-Policy</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>404 Limiter</h3>\n<p>Detect when bots are being used to scan your site for security vulnerabilities and shut them down. The 404 limiter lets you stop the scan by detecting when a bot keeps visiting pages that do not exist, which can also save you from a giant strain on your site&#8217;s performance.</p>\n<h3>Security Notifications and Reports</h3>\n<p>Defender runs surveillance and sends security notifications with information that matters. All activity and notifications are recorded in the activity log to let you see at a glance the website security actions that have been taken by the Defender security plugin.</p>\n<h3>Reduce Security Setup Time With Saved Configs</h3>\n<p>Save your Defender security plugin configurations and reapply them to your other sites in just a few clicks. You can create and save an unlimited number of security configurations.</p>\n<h3>Pwned Password Check</h3>\n<p>Entered passwords are checked against public database breach records to further boost security. If a password is identified as compromised, the user will be asked to change it.</p>\n<h3>Global IP Block/Allowlists</h3>\n<p>Create your IP block/allow list once, then apply and automatically sync it to all your other sites with just a single click. Save hours by not having to manually add IPs to each individual site. *Note: a [free WPMU DEV account] (https://wpmudev.com/register) is required to access this feature.</p>\n<h3>What Do People Say About Defender?</h3>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…<br />\n&#8220;I found other pro security plugins a bit too fiddly for my taste&#8230;I&#8217;m delighted with Defender&#8221; &#8211; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/keithadv\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">KeithADV</a></p>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…<br />\n&#8220;Thank you for bringing back a free and easy to use 2-Factor Authentication after Clef!

This means you get all the most effective and proven protection methods other services provide with fewer settings, one-click hardening and faster setup.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20installing%20defender%20the%20only%20step%20i%20need%20to%20take%20for%20better%20wordpress%20security%3F'>\nIs installing Defender the only step I need to take for better WordPress security?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hackers and bot attacks are not the only security threats to your site. No matter what security plugin or service you use, always be prepared with a secure backup stored in a safe location away from your live site. Security does not protect from hosting outages, server errors and accidentally lost or damaged data. We recommend <a href=\"https://wpmudev.com/project/snapshot/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=defender-readme&amp;utm_content=snapshot#trial\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Snapshot</a>.

Limit login attempts so hackers can&#8217;t guess passwords. Permanently ban IPs or trigger a timed lockout after a set number of failed login attempts. Use Geo IP blocking to ban users from specific countries or locations.</p>\n<h3>Firewall Security and IP Manager</h3>\n<p>Improve your website security with Defender&#8217;s IP manager and firewall. Manually block specific IPs, import a list of banned IPs, and set automated timed and permanent lockouts. Defender makes it easy to block and unblock specific locations quickly thanks to its advanced firewall security(WAF) offering Geographical IP blocking.</p>\n<h3>User Agent Banning</h3>\n<p>Add user agents to the block or allowlist and stop bad bots from spamming and scraping your site. All major search engines and special network bots are allow-listed out of the box. Easy to set up, Defender&#8217;s user agent banning tool does all the security work, with no editing of the .htaccess file required.</p>\n<h3>Google reCAPTCHA Integration</h3>\n<p>Add reCAPTCHA security to your login / registration pages, lost password forms, and post comments in a couple of steps to up security and help protect from fraud and abuse. Select reCAPTCHA type, language, location, and style to suit. As well as Google, Defender also supports the following reCAPTCHA types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyPress reCAPTCHA</li>\n<li>WooCommerce reCAPTCHA</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Login Screen Masking</h3>\n<p>Defender makes it easy to move your login screen to a custom URL. Not only does login screen masking improve security, but it also lets you white label your login user experience and improves branding.</p>\n<h3>Force Password Reset</h3>\n<p>Enhance site security by forcing all users with selected roles to reset their password at any time. Especially helpful if you suspect a possible data breach on your site.</p>\n<h3>Security Headers</h3>\n<p>Protect your site against common attacks, such as: XSS, code injection, cross site scripting, and more. Enable the following security headers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>X-Frame-Options</li>\n<li>X-XSS-Protection</li>\n<li>X-Content-Type-Options</li>\n<li>Strict Transport</li>\n<li>Referrer Policy</li>\n<li>Permissions-Policy</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>404 Limiter</h3>\n<p>Detect when bots are being used to scan your site for security vulnerabilities and shut them down. The 404 limiter lets you stop the scan by detecting when a bot keeps visiting pages that do not exist, which can also save you from a giant strain on your site&#8217;s performance.</p>\n<h3>Security Notifications and Reports</h3>\n<p>Defender runs surveillance and sends security notifications with information that matters. All activity and notifications are recorded in the activity log to let you see at a glance the website security actions that have been taken by the Defender security plugin.</p>\n<h3>Reduce Security Setup Time With Saved Configs</h3>\n<p>Save your Defender security plugin configurations and reapply them to your other sites in just a few clicks. You can create and save an unlimited number of security configurations.</p>\n<h3>Pwned Password Check</h3>\n<p>Entered passwords are checked against public database breach records to further boost security. If a password is identified as compromised, the user will be asked to change it.</p>\n<h3>Global IP Block/Allowlists</h3>\n<p>Create your IP block/allow list once, then apply and automatically sync it to all your other sites with just a single click. Save hours by not having to manually add IPs to each individual site. *Note: a [free WPMU DEV account] (https://wpmudev.com/register) is required to access this feature.</p>\n<h3>What Do People Say About Defender?</h3>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…<br />\n&#8220;I found other pro security plugins a bit too fiddly for my taste&#8230;I&#8217;m delighted with Defender&#8221; &#8211; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/keithadv\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">KeithADV</a></p>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…<br />\n&#8220;Thank you for bringing back a free and easy to use 2-Factor Authentication after Clef!
