Then activate the plugin &#8220;PostLists-Extension Navigation&#8221; in your WordPress admin panel.</p>\n<p>Usage: Select a list in the PostLists-AdminPanel for editing. Define the new link placeholders in the fields &#8220;Navigation next-link&#8221; and &#8220;Navigation prev-link&#8221; by using the other ple-navigation placeholders. For example &#8220;Navigation next-link&#8221; could be &#8220;<a href=\"%ple_navigation_next_url%\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More &raquo;</a>&#8220;. If the links are defined, you can use the placeholders %ple_navigation_next_link% and %ple_navigation_prev_link% within the html output fields for before and after the list, and within the html output field that is used if there are no more posts. If there are no prev posts %ple_navigation_prev_link% will not be replaced and be removed. If the maximum number of posts to display is not reached %ple_navigation_next_link% will also be only removed. This means, the links are only added if needed (if you use them via the placeholders). If you like to use AJAX to load the next posts of a list without refreshing the complete page, set &#8220;Navigation AJAX Support&#8221; to yes.</p>\n"
