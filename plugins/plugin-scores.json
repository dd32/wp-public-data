Clicking on the<br />\nnumber brings you to the right page.<br />\nAlso adjusted the language file</p>\n<h4>1.5</h4>\n<p>Fixed sime minor bugs</p>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<p>Code cleanup</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<p>Added translation support. For now there&#8217;s an extra dutch translation.<br />\nOther languages are of course appriciated. I used the &#8220;CodeStyling Localization&#8221; for my translation and it worked like a dream.</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed the timezone for the time shown under the table. The WordPress<br />\ntimezone setting is used.</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Added caching. The results are cached for half an hour. If you really want to change this time; it&#8217;s defined in the header of the plugin as<br />\ndefine(&#8216;CACHE_TIMEOUT&#8217;,30<em>60); Just change the 30</em>60 (30 minutes times 60 seconds) in any time you want.</p>\n<p>If for what reason you want to clear the cache manualy, just go to the settings page and hit save.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release</li>\n</ul>\n"
