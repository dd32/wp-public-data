        "description": "<p>This plugin will verify every email address submitted by users.<br />\nIt&#8217;ll automatically detect and block disposable, temporary email addresses.<br />\nIt&#8217;ll give a nice warning message when users are signing up, logging in,<br />\nor changing email to a temporary email.</p>\n<p>The plugin checks the domain name using a service named<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.istempmail.com/?ref=wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IsTempMail</a>.<br />\nIf a domain name is blocked, it will be stored into a local blacklist.<br />\nYou can also manage your own local whitelist and blacklist to allow or<br />\ndisallow certain domains.</p>\n<p>The plugin integrates with the WordPress built-in function <code>is_email()</code>.<br />\nIt works seamlessly with other plugins including WooCommerce,<br />\nContact Form 7, Gravity Form, Jetpack/Grunion contact forms, Kadence Blocks Forms as well as<br />\nother formbuilders and ecommerce plugins and WordPress&#8217; own registration form.</p>\n",

The plugin will only send the domain part of email address to validate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20free%3F'>\nIs the plugin free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin is free to use. IsTempMail also offers a free plan that will be sufficient<br />\nfor most blogs. You will be notified when you use more credits than included in the free plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20the%20service%20is%20down%3F'>\nWhat happens if the service is down?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A downtime is very unlikely, the IsTempMail service has outstanding availability of 99.99%<br />\nover the last 6 months.<br />\nBut the plugin was developed to be stable in the unlikely event of a temporary downtime. It<br />\nwill continue to work, validating emails using your local blacklist and whitelist. Your users<br />\nwill be able to sign up, log in and comment on your blog just fine.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20to%20existing%20users%20with%20fake%20email%20address'>\nWhat happens to existing users with fake email address\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Existing users registered with fake email addresses won&#8217;t be able to log in to your blog when<br />\nthe plugin is activated. Be prepared for users contacting you regarding this topic. Usually<br />\npeople who used a disposable email address won&#8217;t come back to your website though.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
