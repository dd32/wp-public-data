        "faq": "<p>Q. Can you make it so the discounts can be cash value instead of percentage?</p>\n<p>A. The next release will feature an options setting to change the type of coupon the plugin uses, in the meantime if you want me to I can tell you where to make the changes for this, just drop me an email: michael@hallnet.com.au.</p>\n<p>Q. Why are there lots of wierd &#8216;bulk-buyer-discount&#8230;&#8217; coupons in my woocommerce coupons page now?!</p>\n<p>A. The WC Bulk Buyer Discounts plugin creates unique coupons for each user as they create and modify their shopping cart, this ensures no coupons are abused again and again, each coupon can only be used once, expires after 1 day and will be removed if the cart items do not meet the required quantity and allowed products. The coupons will build up BUT as long as the &#8220;Expired Coupon Cleanup&#8221; checkbox is ticked the plugin will look for and delete any coupons it created that are expired.</p>\n",
