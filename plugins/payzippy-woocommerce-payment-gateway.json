        "faq": "\n<h4>It works only for Credit Cards. What about other methods?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the payment gateway is still not complete from Payzippy&#8217;s side, the currently supported method is credit card only. As soon as the payment gateway becomes ready the plugin will be updated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There is only SHA256 encryption but no MD5. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since SHA256 is a better method over MD5, we directly used it rather than providing a choice. We chose the better one for you and stripped off the less secure one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>All I can see is Redirect mode. What about the Iframe mode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s scheduled for the next release. Stay tuned.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I find more support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Drop me an email at <a href=\"mailto:&#x76;&#x69;&#112;&#117;&#x6c;&#x75;c&#107;&#121;&#x39;&#x33;&#064;&#103;&#x6d;&#x61;i&#108;&#046;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;\" title=\"Mail Me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">vipulucky93[at]gmail[dot]com</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am a developer and would like to contribute.
