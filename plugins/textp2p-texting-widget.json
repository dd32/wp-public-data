The area code is determined based on your existing cell phone number you sign up with. For example if your current phone number starts with 703 we will first try to get you a 703 number if one is available. If there are no 703 numbers we will try for other related area codes in the same general area. If no area codes found in that general area we will widen our search to the entire state or providence.</p>\n<p>If you need a different area code from your cell phone, then please contact support and we can manually assign you whatever you need.</p>\n<p>If you want to use your existing business number it can be ported over but the process can take several weeks. Additionally not all numbers support all features, for example toll-free 800 numbers don’t support MMS. Finally, additional per minute charges may be applied each month depending on usage. Contact us to discuss further details if interested.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20a%20mobile%20app%3F'>\nDo you have a mobile app?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

Short Codes are used for mass marketing texts and are now being blocked by many of the carriers. Verizon announced it won’t be supporting shared short codes soon.</p>\n<p>If you would like a vanity number we can help you purchase one and port it over to us to use for keywords and texting.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
