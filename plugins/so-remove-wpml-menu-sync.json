However not all people (developers) have that luxury and therefore choose to translate the navigation menu(s) manually.</p>\n<p>In that case it would not be a good idea when the client unwittingly clicks on that WPML submenu (or on the synchronization link in the Menus page) and starts syncing menus.</p>\n<p>It is therefore that I have developed this small Addon. Of course people other than developers can also use the addon if they don&#8217;t want to use the navigation menu synchronization tool of WPML.</p>\n<p>First of all it checks whether WPML has been installed. If it has it will hide the synchronization link from the Appearance &gt; Menus page.</p>\n<p>It also removes the link from the WPML submenu in the Dashboard sidebar.</p>\n<p>The Addon doesn&#8217;t come with any settings.</p>\n<p>I have decided to only support this plugin through <a href=\"https://github.com/senlin/so-remove-wpml-menu-sync/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.
