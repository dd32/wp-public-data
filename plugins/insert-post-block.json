Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation\" title=\"Manual plugin installation\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.</p>\n",
