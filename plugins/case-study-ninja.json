        "description": "<p>The Case Study Ninja WordPress Plugin enables third party WordPress sites to display a set of case study previews (picture, title, Case Study Ninja link, author) from a selected team on pages within their site. It is possible to have case studies from different teams on different pages.</p>\n<p>To set up your team and start creating case studies visit: www.casestudyninja.com</p>\n<p>Both free and paid for packages are available.

        "installation": "<p><strong>To install the Case Study Ninja WordPress Plugin onto a WordPress website:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder ‘caseStudyNinja’ to the WordPress plugin directory (usually found in /wp-content/plugins/).</li>\n<li>Log into the WordPress admin panel and go to Plugins / Installed Plugins.</li>\n<li>Look for Case Study Ninja and click the ‘Activate’ link located underneath it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>The Case Study Ninja Admin Panel</h4>\n<p>Once the Case Study Ninja plugin is activated, you can access its admin panel by going to Tools / Case Study Ninja.</p>\n<p>The Case Study Ninja admin panel can be used to customize how your case study previews appear on your website.</p>\n<p>The following controls are available to you:</p>\n<p><strong>Display as directory listing?</strong> – this allows you to choose to display case study previews as a directory list with case study showing per row. If you select no, then case studies will display in a grid format and you can choose the number of case studies displayed on each row.</p>\n<p><strong>Help support us by displaying Powered by Case Study Ninja</strong> – if you’d like to help us grow, please select yes to display a small Case Study Ninja logo at the bottom of your case studies with ‘Powered by Case Study Ninja’ text.</p>\n<p><strong>Total number of case study previews to display</strong> – this allows you to specify the total number of case study previews that will be displayed.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of case study previews to display per row (for non-directory listing style)</strong> &#8211; this allows you to specify the number of case study previews to display per row. For example, if you chose to display a total of 10 case studies and 2 per row, a total of five rows would be displayed with 2 case studies on each row. This setting is only used if you have selected ‘no’ in the ‘Display as a directory listing’ setting.</p>\n<p><strong>You can edit the Case Study Ninja CSS here</strong> – the CSS that is used to style Case Study Ninja previews is contained in this text box and advanced users can edit this as required. It is recommended you copy the css into an external editor to make modifications.</p>\n<h4>Adding Case Study Ninja Previews</h4>\n<p>To add Case Study Ninja previews to any part of your WordPress site simply use the following shortcode (replacing the text in bold with the Case Study Ninja team id you want to use: [case-study-ninja team=&#8221;Your team id here&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Note: if you would like to add the shortcode into a widget, then you need to install the third party plugin Shortcode Widget.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Will the plug in work on my own website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes – the plug in is a perfect way to display your case studies on your website or intranet without having to update them in multiple places</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will the plug in work on business directory pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes – the plug in allows you to showcase your case studies as part of any WordPress business directory profile.</p>\n<p>If you are a member of a business directory that does not currently display case studies, ask them to contact Simon@CaseStudyNinja.com and we’ll help them get set up.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to join Case Study Ninja to display case studies via the plug in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes – the good news is that you can upload up to 3 case studies to our <a href=\"http://www.CaseStudyNinja.com/gallery\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Case Study Gallery</a> for free.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I stop subscribing to Case Study Ninja will you delete my case studies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No – case studies are only removed if you delete them or if you ask us to delete them.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
