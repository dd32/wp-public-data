        "faq": "<ul>\n<li>Do I need a SKU for all my products?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No. Although a SKU is recommended to allow for a unique identifier that can move from one product to another, we will fallback to the<br />\nproduct ID. The only caveat is that if you later need to create a new product meant to replace this old product, we will see it as a<br />\nbrand new product.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I need to set dimensions (length, weight etc) in all my products?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No, you can set a default in the admin. But it is very important to understand that wrong dimensions could lead to wrong rates, specially<br />\nin international shipments. This could cause your customer to underpay for the rate, or possibly see a rate much higher than it should be.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where do I get the needed tokens to add to the settings page?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To request the tokens, please reach out to us on https://shipshap.com/contact-us</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where do I get the needed tokens to add to the settings page?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To request the tokens, please reach out to us on https://shipshap.com/contact-us .
