Quiz Cat’s drag and drop interface lets you move quiz questions and answers around to get your quiz just how you want it.</p>\n<p>When a reader takes a fun quiz on your site, they will remember you. They won’t remember all the other “same old” blog posts they read that day. Even better, a quiz inspires each user to share their quiz results with their friends. These friends take your quiz, they share with their friends, and you get a viral stream of traffic to your site. All thanks to the few minutes it took to create a quiz with Quiz Cat.</p>\n<h4>A Powerful Plugin that Won’t Slow Down Your Site</h4>\n<p>Don’t sacrifice power for site speed.

Your quiz will size itself to fit your content area, allowing you to add text above and below your quiz, maximizing SEO value and engagement.</p>\n<h4>Convenient Shortcode Publishing</h4>\n<p>Want to add your quiz to a dedicated landing page, or insert it into a page builder like Elementor? You can display your quiz anywhere that supports shortcodes.</p>\n<h4>Looks Great on All Devices</h4>\n<p>Quiz Cat quizzes are fully responsive. No matter what device your readers are on, your quiz will look and function great.</p>\n<h4>Fully Translatable</h4>\n<p>All text strings in Quiz Cat’s backend support translation. On the frontend, most content can be changed to fit your target audience’s language, and the few things that can’t be changed from the user interface can be changed with PHP Filters (see the “Frequently Asked Questions” tab for more).</p>\n<h4>Extensive Support Articles</h4>\n<p>We’ve put together an extensive collection of help articles to give you all the knowledge you need to get your quiz up and running in minutes.
