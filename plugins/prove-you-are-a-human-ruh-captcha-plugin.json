IMO, we have to use cutting-edge technologies to be one (or, better, two) step ahead of bot-writing people.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do you think about this technique? &#8211; nobotsallowed.com</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thank you for the link, it is very interesting technique.<br />\nThe only disadvantage, IMO, is that it tells the User what to do in plain English, it might be a weak spot.  My method and the code don’t use any meaningful words which can be used as a clue how to solve the puzzle.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Please, take a look on typical comments on the Web: &#8220;I hate any intellectual captcha. If I see it, I never send a comment and leave the site&#8221;. What do you think about this issue?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I believe that most of these comments are about reCAPTCHA (i.e. text-based CAPTCHA) because of difficulties in decifering the scrambled text even for humans.  Although, in order to be more tolerant to the people, the plugin might be activated only for initial registration, leaving comments either unprotected or choosing another, ‘lighter’ CAPTCHA for them.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
