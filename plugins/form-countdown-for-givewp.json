How do these work together?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The goal and the countdown clock work indepent from each other, generally speaking. This allows you to show the clock for as long as your goal is active, or even after the goal is reached. The one exception is if you chose to close the form after your goal is achieved. In that case the countdown clock will not appear, and instead your goal achieved message will appear alone.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20test%20the%20completion%20message%3F'>\nHow can I test the completion message?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way is to manually change the date of your duration to be in the past. If you are comfortable with code, there is a line in the main template file intended just for testing which sets the countdown clock at 5 seconds from the present.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20submit%20support%20questions%3F'>\nWhere can I submit Support Questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have purchased any of our Premium Add-ons, we can provide with your <a href=\"https://givewp.com/support/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Free_Addons&amp;utm_content=Countdown_Timer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Priority Support here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are a free GiveWP user and have a general question about GiveWP, submit a ticket here.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, if your question is specific to GiveWP Form Countdown we&#8217;re happy to answer your questions <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/form-countdown-for-givewp\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20feature%20request%2C%20or%20would%20like%20to%20contribute%20to%20this%20plugin.%20where%20can%20i%20do%20that%3F'>\nI have a feature request, or would like to contribute to this plugin.
