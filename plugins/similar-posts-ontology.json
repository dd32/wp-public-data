There are two ways to show related posts within your page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first way to show related content on your post is to use the widget provided. This only works when is_single() is true</li>\n<li>The second way to show similar content on your site is to use the pk_related_return($post-&gt;ID); function which can be<br />\ncalled programmatically anywhere you wish!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Widget included with this plugin gives you the option to limit the amount of posts; it allows you to determine which<br />\nfields to show: Featured Image, Author, Date, and Excerpt (Title is required);  it allows you to determine which<br />\nvariant of the featured image to show: thumbnail, medium, large, or full. As of version 2.0, you can now decide whether the<br />\n&#8216;similar posts&#8217; sorting prefers posts that are newer or posts that were created closer to the date of the post you&#8217;re<br />\nviewing.</p>\n<p>If you find the Widget doesn&#8217;t meet your needs or is too limiting, you can call the functionality programmatically using<br />\nthis function:</p>\n<pre><code>pk_related_return($post-&gt;ID, $args);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where $post-&gt;ID is the ID of the post for which you are wanting to show related articles.</p>\n<p>The $args parameter is an array with the following values available to you (more coming soon):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>posts_per_page (int defaults to 5)</li>\n<li>thumbnail_size (string consisting of one of these values: &#8220;thumbnail&#8221;, &#8220;medium&#8221;, &#8220;large&#8221;, &#8220;full&#8221;.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does this plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two aspects to it. First, it finds all similarly tagged, categorized, and otherwise taxonomically created content<br />\non your site, then sorts it by what has the most similarities. Second, if there is a tie between two posts it will give<br />\nthe edge to the newest content, or content posted closer to the time your current post was posted, depending how you configure it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20ontology%3F%20what%27s%20an%20ontology%3F'>\nWhy Ontology? What&#8217;s an Ontology?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ontology is the study of the nature of &#8216;being&#8217;. This plugin uses the ontological philosophy of determining an entities<br />\nplacement within its own &#8216;type&#8217; by studying the entities relationships.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20not%20seeing%20any%20content%20when%20i%20install%20this%3F'>\nWhy am I not seeing any content when I install this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use this in two ways. Either by calling pk_related_return() in your theme or by placing the widget on your site.<br />\nIf you are using the widget, remember that it only works on any &#8220;single&#8221; page (where is_single() would return true). The<br />\npk_related_return() can theoretically work anywhere as long as you provide a proper post ID. Try var_dump() with<br />\npk_related_return() and look at the description for proper usage of this function.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20my%20results%20coming%20back%20with%20weird%20content%20that%20i%20wouldn%27t%20expect%3F'>\nWhy are my results coming back with weird content that I wouldn&#8217;t expect?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This issue may be your taxonomies. The content for which you&#8217;re trying to find related content needs to have tags,<br />\ncategories, and/or custom taxonomies. Also, to properly find your content, tags/categories/taxonomies must be used on<br />\nthe <em>related</em> content as well. The more you intentionally use your tags and categories, the better your results set will be.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
