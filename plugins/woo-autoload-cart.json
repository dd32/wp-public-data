When picking a product from settings, just choose the specific variation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why must there be a URL Prefix?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The prefix is used to efficiently test if the incoming URL should be used to potentially auto load products. Without it, this plugin would have to do a database lookup for every single URL on your site, which could slow it down. The prefix is also used to reduce naming conflicts with other URLs on your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
