        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>In your WordPress dashboard go to &#8220;Plugins&#8221;, &#8220;Add New&#8221;. Search for &#8220;Tip Jar WP&#8221; and click &#8220;Install&#8221;. Then click &#8220;Activate&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Find &#8220;Tip Jar WP&#8221; on the left sidebar in your WordPress dashboard and click on it.</li>\n<li>Follow the step-by-step &#8220;wizard&#8221; to make sure everything that needs to be configured, is! We made sure it covers all of the most important things so you don&#8217;t need to do any guesswork during setup.</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve completed the set-up wizard, use the [tipjarwp] shortcode on any page/post, or use our Block in the Block Editor by typing /tipjarwp.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Find out more about installation on our guide:<br />\n<a href=\"https://tipjarwp.com/getting-started-with-tip-jar-wp/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://tipjarwp.com/getting-started-with-tip-jar-wp/</a></p>\n",
        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Does this include the Stripe integration for free?<br />\nYes. Stripe is the payment gateway that works with Tip Jar WP, and it is included for free.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are there any up-sells or extensions?<br />\nNo. Everything you will need to accept single and recurring tips is included in Tip Jar WP for free.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do I need an SSL certificate in order to use this?<br />\nYes. Most webhosts are now able to set this up for you at no extra cost. Ask them about &#8220;LetsEncrypt&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is this plugin free to use?<br />\nTip Jar WP is totally free to install. There is a 1% transaction fee (plus Stripe fees). So we (Tip Jar WP) don&#8217;t make money until you do. That means we have your best interests in mind at all times; we aren&#8217;t successful unless you are.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What about GDPR Compliance?<br />\nThis plugin stores absolutely no personally identifiable information about your users when they make a payment. No names, credit card information, IP addresses, nothing. Only emails are stored in WordPress core&#8217;s &#8220;users&#8221; table, and can be erased using WordPress&#8217;s normal erase-personal-data process. We recommend adding a note to your privacy policy stating that the only information recorded during a payment is the email address, and that all other data is handled by Stripe.com.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
