The plugin is still functional and it can be used, but it&#8217;s no longer maintained or supported. We&#8217;re keeping it available for a while longer as a courtesy to existing users who have developers who can take care of its maintenance and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>For more information about the plugin retirement and the recomemnded alternative, please refer to the sticky post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/eu-vat-assistant-end-of-life-and-recommended-alternative/\" rel=\"ugc\">EU VAT Assistant – End of life and recommended alternative</a>.</p>\n<h4>This is a full version of the premium EU VAT Assistant plugin</h4>\n<p>We are proud to say that this is <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/eu-vat-assistant-woocommerce/?src=wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the most powerful <strong>free</strong> EU VAT solution</a> on the market. <strong>It was designed with you, the merchant, in mind</strong>, and it will make it easier to deal with the new, complex EU VAT regulations. this plugin was developed by <a href=\"https://aelia.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aelia Team &#8211; The WooCommerce internationalisation experts</a>.</p>\n<p>The WooCommerce EU VAT Assistant is designed to help achieving compliance with the new European VAT regulations, coming into effect on the 1st of January 2015. Starting from that date, digital goods sold to consumers in the European Union are liable to EU VAT, no matter where the seller is located. The VAT rate to apply to each sale is the one charged in the country of consumption, i.e. where the customer  resides. These new rules apply to worldwide sellers, whether resident in the European Union or not, who sell their products to EU customers. For more information: <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/tax/articles/eu-2015-place-of-supply-changes-mini-one-stop-shop.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">EU: 2015 Place of Supply Changes &#8211; Mini One-Stop-Shop</a>.</p>\n<h4>How this plugin will help you</h4>\n<p>The EU VAT Assistant plugin extends the standard WooCommerce sale process and calculates the VAT due under the new regime. The information gathered by the plugin can then be used to prepare VAT reports, which will help filing the necessary VAT/MOSS returns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tracks and records customers&#8217; location</strong>. The EU VAT Assistant plugin also records details about each sale, to prove that the correct VAT rate was applied. This is done to comply with the new rules, which require that at least two pieces of non contradictory evidence must be gathered, for each sale, as a proof of customer&#8217;s location. The evidence is saved automatically against each new order, from the moment the EU VAT compliance plugin is activated.</li>\n<li><strong>Collects evidence required by the new regulations</strong>. All the data used to determine the VAT regime to apply is recorded in real-time, stored with the order and made available as needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Accepts and validates EU VAT numbers, adjusting VAT accordingly</strong>. Validation of European VAT numbers is performed via the official VIES service, provided by the European Commission. This feature is equivalent to the one provided by the EU VAT Number plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports a dedicated VAT currency</strong>, which is used to generate the reports. You can sell in any currency you like, the EU VAT Assistant plugin will take care of converting the VAT amounts to the currency you will use to file your returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Can automatically populates the VAT rates for all EU countries</strong>. With a single click, you enter the VAT rates for all 28 EU countries. No more tedious manual typing!</li>\n<li><strong>Includes advanced Reports</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>EU VAT report by Country</em>. This report will show you all the VAT collected under the VAT MOSS regime, as well as the VAT collected for your domestic VAT return.</li>\n<li><em>VIES report</em>. This report shows all the supplies provided to B2B customers.</li>\n<li><em>INTRASTAT report</em>. This report shows all the sales made to the EU.</li>\n<li>Sales by Country (<strong>in development</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Supports ECB exchange rates in VAT MOSS reports</strong>. VAT MOSS Reports can use either the exchange rate saved with each order, or the European Central Bank rate required to produce the official VAT MOSS returns (ref. <a href=\"https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/leaflets/mini-one-stop-shop.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official documentation</a>). This feature will allow you to use the most appropriate rate when producing your domestic VAT return and the VAT MOSS return.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports mixed products/services scenarios</strong>. The new EU VAT MOSS regime applies to the sale of digital products and services that do not require significal manual intervention. Sale of services that are provided with human intervention, such as support, consultancy, design, are still subject to VAT at source. In this case, VAT has to be paid to the revenue in merchant&#8217;s country. WooCommerce allows to specify to which country a tax applies, but not to which country it should be paid once collected. The EU VAT Assistant can help, by allowing merchants to specify the &#8220;payable to&#8221; country for each VAT. Such information is then displayed in the VAT reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Allows to force B2B or B2C sales</strong>. You can decide if you wish to force customers to a valid EU VAT number at checkout, thus accepting only B2B transactions, or prevent them from doing it, thus accepting only B2C transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Can prevent sales to specific countries</strong>. You can exclude some countries from the list of allowed ones, thus preventing customers from those countries from placing an order.</li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s fully compatible with our internationalisation solutions</strong>, such the <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/currency-switcher-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Currency Switcher, for multi-currency support</a>, <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/prices-by-country-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Prices by Country</a>, <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/tax-display-by-country-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tax Display by Country</a> and Prices by Role (coming soon).</li>\n<li><strong>Automatically updates the exchange rates that are be used to produce the VAT reports in the selected VAT currency</strong>. The plugin can fetch exchange rates from the following providers:\n<ul>\n<li>European Central Bank</li>\n<li>HM Revenue and Customs service</li>\n<li>Bitpay</li>\n<li>Irish Revenue (experimental)</li>\n<li>Danish National Bank (sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.asoundeffect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Asbjoern Andersen</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fully supports refunds</strong>. Refunds were introduced in WooCommerce 2.2, and support for it was added to our plugin right from the start.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrates with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips plugin</a></strong>, to automatically generate EU VAT-compliant invoices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.0 or newer.</li>\n<li>PHP 7.1 or newer.</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.5 or newer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aelia.co/downloads/wc-aelia-foundation-classes.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aelia Foundation Classes</a> framework 2.1.0.201112 or newer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This product has been designed to help you fulfil the requirements of the following new EU VAT regulations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify customers&#8217; location.</li>\n<li>Collect at least two non-contradictory pieces of evidence about the determined location.</li>\n<li>Apply the correct VAT rate.</li>\n<li>Ensure that VAT numbers used for B2B transactions are valid before applying VAT exemption.</li>\n<li>Collect all the data required to prepare VAT returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot, however, give any legal guarantee that the features provided by this product will be sufficient for you to be fully compliant.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20include%20features%20to%20comply%20with%20the%20eu%20vat%20oss%20regulations%20that%20apply%20to%20physical%20products%3F'>\nDoes the EU VAT Assistant include features to comply with the EU VAT OSS regulations that apply to physical products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In short, no. We originally developed the EU VAT Assistant to help with the VAT MOSS regulations that apply to <strong>digital</strong> products from the 1st of January 2015 (VAT MOSS regulations). The EU VAT Assistant can be used, to a certain extent, even after the 1st of July. It&#8217;s possible, with some custom filters, to cover some the rules applicable to the shipping of goods, such as the VAT exemption over 150 EUR (or 135 GBP, for the UK). However, please keep in mind that it&#8217;s designed primarily for digital products, and doesn&#8217;t implement features specific to physical goods, such as handling the aspects of shipping.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20aelia%27s%20recommended%20solution%20for%20compliance%20with%20rules%20introduced%20by%20the%20vat%20oss%20regime%2C%20brexit%20and%20norway%27s%20voec%3F'>\nWhat is Aelia&#8217;s recommended solution for compliance with rules introduced by the VAT OSS regime, Brexit and Norway&#8217;s VOEC?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Over the course of 2021 we have been working on a new plugin to handle the new VAT regulations, to replace the EU VAT Assistant. After carefuly consideration, we came to the conclusion that the product we have been developing could not be competitive, in a market where several of these solutions already exist. Due to that, we opted not to release our own premium VAT compliance product, and collaborate with the authors of existing plugins instead.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of 2021, Aelia established a collaboration with David Anderson, founder of Simba Hosting and author of the popular Updraft Plus backup plugin, and of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/\" rel=\"ugc\">the WooCommerce EU/UK VAT / IVA Compliance plugin</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for a comprehensive plugin to help you complying with the new regulations, we recommend to try that plugin.</p>\n<p>We chose to endorse the David&#8217;s solution, instead of releasing our own, because we have been working together and exchanging information for years and we know that it&#8217;s a reliable product.</p>\n<p>We are also organising to offer an optional migration service, to convert the data stored by the Aelia EU VAT Assistant into the formate used by the WooCommerce EU/UK VAT / IVA Compliance plugin. This will be an optional, paid service, which we will provide on request.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the collaboration between Aelia and Simba Hosting in the following article: <a href=\"https://aelia.co/ioss-compliance-aelia-eu-vat-assistant/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">VAT OSS Compliance – From Aelia EU VAT Assistant to Simba Hosting&#8217;s WooCommerce EU/UK VAT/IVA Compliance</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20features%20are%20included%20in%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%3F'>\nWhat features are included in the EU VAT Assistant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The EU VAT Assistant includes all the features to handle the VAT MOSS regulations for EU countries (see notes about UK Brexit, applicable from the 1st of January 2021). It&#8217;s based on the same framework we use for our other premium products, such as the <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/currency-switcher-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aelia Currency Switcher for Woocommerce</a>, <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/prices-by-country-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Prices by Country for WooCommerce</a>, <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/tax-display-by-country-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aelia Tax Display by Country for WooCommerce</a>, and it follows the same quality standards. All the included features are fully functional, without restrictions or time limitations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20validate%20eu%20vat%20numbers%3F'>\nCan the EU VAT Assistant validate EU VAT numbers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The EU VAT Assistant automatically validates the EU VAT number entered by the customer on the checkout page. When a valid VAT number is entered, the plugin informs WooCommerce that a VAT exemption should be applied.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20validate%20eu%20vat%20numbers%3F'>\nHow does the EU VAT Assistant validate EU VAT numbers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our solution relies on the official VIES service to validate EU VAT numbers. The EU VAT Assistant also includes several options to accept VAT numbers when the remote VIES service is unavailable or overloaded. Such options are disabled by default, and can be enabled in the plugin settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20validate%20uk%20vat%20numbers%3F'>\nDoes the EU VAT Assistant validate UK VAT numbers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The EU VAT Assistant could validate UK VAT numbers up until the 31st of December 2020. From the 1st of January 2021, the VIES service no handles UK VAT numbers, which must be validated through a different service, provided by the UK Revenue Office (HMRC). <a href=\"https://aelia.co/ioss-compliance-aelia-eu-vat-assistant/#brexit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">We wrote an addon for the EU VAT Assistant to cover that aspect</a>, but we have since shifted our focus on other endeavours (see FAQs above).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20include%20features%20dedicated%20to%20uk%20merchants%3F'>\nWill the EU VAT Assistant include features dedicated to UK merchants?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The EU VAT Assistant features aim to simplify compliance with the VAT MOSS regulations that apply to EU merchants. Out of the box, the plugin which should cover most of the needs of UK merchants as well (with the exclusion of the validation of UK VAT number). If you&#8217;re looking for a comprehensive solution that covers that aspect, we recommend <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-eu-vat-compliance/\" rel=\"ugc\">the WooCommerce EU/UK VAT / IVA Compliance plugin</a>, developed by David Anderson.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20show%20the%20correct%20vat%20rate%20as%20soon%20as%20a%20visitor%20lands%20on%20the%20site%3F'>\nCan the EU VAT Assistant show the correct VAT rate as soon as a visitor lands on the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Such feature is provided by our <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/tax-display-by-country-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tax Display by Country plugin</a>. If you like the EU VAT Assistant, we invite you to purchase the Tax Display by Country as well, and enjoy the powerful features of a comprehensive tax compliance solution, at a small price.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20would%20like%20to%20show%20the%20same%20prices%20to%20all%20customers%2C%20regardless%20of%20the%20applicable%20vat'>\nI would like to show the same prices to all customers, regardless of the applicable VAT\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/tax-display-by-country-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tax Display by Country plugin</a> includes such feature as well, using it is as simple as ticking a box.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20eu%20vat%20assistant%20guarantee%20compliance%20with%20regulations%3F'>\nDoes the EU VAT Assistant guarantee compliance with regulations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We developed the EU VAT Assistant to be as accurate as possible, in order to help fulfil the requiremenets of the EU VAT MOSS regulations. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">As required by WordPress policies</a>, we can&#8217;t guarantee legal compliance.<br />\nSimilarly, although our solution is flexible enough to cover scenarios that falls outside the EU VAT MOSS regulations (e.g. the sale of physical products), we can&#8217;t promise that it will cover all of them. That&#8217;s simply due to the presence of too many variables, which could introduce edge cases that our tests didn&#8217;t cover.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you spot a specific condition in which the EU VAT Assistant doesn&#8217;t seem to work as expected, please feel free to report any issue you might encounter, either <a href=\"https://aelia.co/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">via our contact form</a> (premium support) or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-eu-vat-assistant\" rel=\"ugc\">on the public forum</a> (free support).

The plugin is still functional and it can be used, but it&#8217;s no longer maintained or supported. We&#8217;re keeping it available for a while longer as a courtesy to existing users who have developers who can take care of its maintenance and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>For more information about the plugin retirement and the recomemnded alternative, please refer to the sticky post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/eu-vat-assistant-end-of-life-and-recommended-alternative/\" rel=\"ugc\">EU VAT Assistant – End of life and recommended alternative</a>.</p>\n<h4>This is a full version of the premium EU VAT Assistant plugin</h4>\n<p>We are proud to say that this is <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/eu-vat-assistant-woocommerce/?src=wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the most powerful <strong>free</strong> EU VAT solution</a> on the market. <strong>It was designed with you, the merchant, in mind</strong>, and it will make it easier to deal with the new, complex EU VAT regulations. this plugin was developed by <a href=\"https://aelia.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aelia Team &#8211; The WooCommerce internationalisation experts</a>.</p>\n<p>The WooCommerce EU VAT Assistant is designed to help achieving compliance with the new European VAT regulations, coming into effect on the 1st of January 2015. Starting from that date, digital goods sold to consumers in the European Union are liable to EU VAT, no matter where the seller is located. The VAT rate to apply to each sale is the one charged in the country of consumption, i.e. where the customer  resides. These new rules apply to worldwide sellers, whether resident in the European Union or not, who sell their products to EU customers. For more information: <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/tax/articles/eu-2015-place-of-supply-changes-mini-one-stop-shop.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">EU: 2015 Place of Supply Changes &#8211; Mini One-Stop-Shop</a>.</p>\n<h4>How this plugin will help you</h4>\n<p>The EU VAT Assistant plugin extends the standard WooCommerce sale process and calculates the VAT due under the new regime. The information gathered by the plugin can then be used to prepare VAT reports, which will help filing the necessary VAT/MOSS returns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tracks and records customers&#8217; location</strong>. The EU VAT Assistant plugin also records details about each sale, to prove that the correct VAT rate was applied. This is done to comply with the new rules, which require that at least two pieces of non contradictory evidence must be gathered, for each sale, as a proof of customer&#8217;s location. The evidence is saved automatically against each new order, from the moment the EU VAT compliance plugin is activated.</li>\n<li><strong>Collects evidence required by the new regulations</strong>. All the data used to determine the VAT regime to apply is recorded in real-time, stored with the order and made available as needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Accepts and validates EU VAT numbers, adjusting VAT accordingly</strong>. Validation of European VAT numbers is performed via the official VIES service, provided by the European Commission. This feature is equivalent to the one provided by the EU VAT Number plugin.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports a dedicated VAT currency</strong>, which is used to generate the reports. You can sell in any currency you like, the EU VAT Assistant plugin will take care of converting the VAT amounts to the currency you will use to file your returns.</li>\n<li><strong>Can automatically populates the VAT rates for all EU countries</strong>. With a single click, you enter the VAT rates for all 28 EU countries. No more tedious manual typing!</li>\n<li><strong>Includes advanced Reports</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><em>EU VAT report by Country</em>. This report will show you all the VAT collected under the VAT MOSS regime, as well as the VAT collected for your domestic VAT return.</li>\n<li><em>VIES report</em>. This report shows all the supplies provided to B2B customers.</li>\n<li><em>INTRASTAT report</em>. This report shows all the sales made to the EU.</li>\n<li>Sales by Country (<strong>in development</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Supports ECB exchange rates in VAT MOSS reports</strong>. VAT MOSS Reports can use either the exchange rate saved with each order, or the European Central Bank rate required to produce the official VAT MOSS returns (ref. <a href=\"https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/leaflets/mini-one-stop-shop.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official documentation</a>). This feature will allow you to use the most appropriate rate when producing your domestic VAT return and the VAT MOSS return.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports mixed products/services scenarios</strong>. The new EU VAT MOSS regime applies to the sale of digital products and services that do not require significal manual intervention. Sale of services that are provided with human intervention, such as support, consultancy, design, are still subject to VAT at source. In this case, VAT has to be paid to the revenue in merchant&#8217;s country. WooCommerce allows to specify to which country a tax applies, but not to which country it should be paid once collected. The EU VAT Assistant can help, by allowing merchants to specify the &#8220;payable to&#8221; country for each VAT. Such information is then displayed in the VAT reports.</li>\n<li><strong>Allows to force B2B or B2C sales</strong>. You can decide if you wish to force customers to a valid EU VAT number at checkout, thus accepting only B2B transactions, or prevent them from doing it, thus accepting only B2C transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Can prevent sales to specific countries</strong>. You can exclude some countries from the list of allowed ones, thus preventing customers from those countries from placing an order.</li>\n<li><strong>It&#8217;s fully compatible with our internationalisation solutions</strong>, such the <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/currency-switcher-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Currency Switcher, for multi-currency support</a>, <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/prices-by-country-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Prices by Country</a>, <a href=\"https://aelia.co/shop/tax-display-by-country-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tax Display by Country</a> and Prices by Role (coming soon).</li>\n<li><strong>Automatically updates the exchange rates that are be used to produce the VAT reports in the selected VAT currency</strong>. The plugin can fetch exchange rates from the following providers:\n<ul>\n<li>European Central Bank</li>\n<li>HM Revenue and Customs service</li>\n<li>Bitpay</li>\n<li>Irish Revenue (experimental)</li>\n<li>Danish National Bank (sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.asoundeffect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Asbjoern Andersen</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fully supports refunds</strong>. Refunds were introduced in WooCommerce 2.2, and support for it was added to our plugin right from the start.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrates with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"ugc\">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips plugin</a></strong>, to automatically generate EU VAT-compliant invoices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.0 or newer.</li>\n<li>PHP 7.1 or newer.</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.5 or newer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aelia.co/downloads/wc-aelia-foundation-classes.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Aelia Foundation Classes</a> framework 2.1.0.201112 or newer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This product has been designed to help you fulfil the requirements of the following new EU VAT regulations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify customers&#8217; location.</li>\n<li>Collect at least two non-contradictory pieces of evidence about the determined location.</li>\n<li>Apply the correct VAT rate.</li>\n<li>Ensure that VAT numbers used for B2B transactions are valid before applying VAT exemption.</li>\n<li>Collect all the data required to prepare VAT returns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot, however, give any legal guarantee that the features provided by this product will be sufficient for you to be fully compliant.
