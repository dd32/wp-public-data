Use it to create and replicate content as if it were an PHP include.</p>\n<h4>Overview</h4>\n<p>This plugin allows you to easily replicate redudant information/data on different pages by defining them as shortcodes. You can use any type of content, like Text, HTML or Javascript.</p>\n<p>It has now become easier to reuse content without having to edit code or manually editing on multiple pages. This plugin is useful when you need to display a block of content on several different pages, for example, display the same text on certain pages or different posts, put a block of instructions that can be modified, a disclaimer, etc. Basically any content you want to copy and replicate on multiple pages, as if it were a PHP include. If you edit it, all pages with the shortcode will be updated with the new content.</p>\n<p>It works very simply:<br />\n* Create a new Custom Post Type, where you can create content as if it were a normal post.<br />\n* Generate a Shortcode for this new created post.<br />\n* When you write the shortcode on another page, the created content will be displayed.<br />\n* When this post is edited, content will be automatically updated on all pages with the shortcode.<br />\n* You can create as many shortcodes as you want.</p>\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>easy-shortcode-creator-by-wppug</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Click on the Easy Shortcode Creator link from the main menu</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Create new Shortcode&#8221;, create your first replicable content and publish.</li>\n<li>Copy the generated shortcode and paste it into another page or post to display the content.</li>\n</ol>\n"
