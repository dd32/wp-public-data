When running migrations with plugins like WP Migrate DB (Pro), or even manually, it&#8217;s usually necessary to have the source and destination site running on the same table prefix.</p>\n<p>Also, some people think that changing your table prefix from <code>wp_</code> to something else provides some security through obscurity. This probably isn&#8217;t very true.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if something goes wrong</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is imperative that you make and test backups of your database and wp-config.php file before running RDTP. If something goes wrong and you find that your site is broken, you will need to restore your site from those backups.</p>\n<p>The first thing RDTP does is try to change the <code>$table_prefix</code> variable in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and this is the most likely point that you will encounter an error. If RDTP is unable to update your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, it won&#8217;t continue on to update the database, so you&#8217;ll probably just need to check the permissions on your <code>wp-config.php</code> and try again.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
