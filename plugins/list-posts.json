        "description": "<p>This allows you to create &#8220;hybrid&#8221; pages, with a fixed page content, as well as a list of the latest posts.<br />\nThis is very, very basic. I want to get fancier in the near future, but this gives me what I need for now.<br />\nI created this, because I need a static front page with stable text, but I also want a roll of the latest<br />\ndynamic content, displayed below the static text.</p>\n<h3>TO DO</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Add an admin page</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>list-posts</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Place <code>&lt;!--LIST_POSTS--&gt;</code> or <code>[[LIST_POSTS]]</code> in the HTML view of a page. It will be replaced by the plugin.</li>\n<li>As of version 1.0, you can specify two items of metadata (Custom Fields) for a given page. This will control what is displayed in the plugin.</li>\n<li>As of version 1.1, more metadata has been added (Item &gt;= C). You can now specify how many posts are shown (-1 is all of them), and you can now filter for series (from the excellent organize-series plugin).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A. <code>list_posts_include</code><br />\nThis is a comma-separated list of integers (category IDs), category slugs, or tags; each of which is a tag, category ID or slug. Any posts that claim this category in their taxonomy will be included, unless their category is in <code>list_posts_exclude</code>. If this custom field is defined, then <em>ONLY</em> those categories will be displayed. If it is not specified, then all categories will be displayed.</p>\n<p>B. <code>list_posts_exclude</code><br />\nThis is a comma-separated list of integers (category IDs), category slugs, or tags; each of which is a tag, category ID or slug.  Any posts that claim this category/tag in their taxonomy will be excluded. Exclude always overrides include. If you exclude a parent category, you cannot include children categories.</p>\n<p>C. <code>list_posts_count</code><br />\nA simple integer. If set to 0, then all posts in the filter specified will be displayed (watch out -this could be a lot). If not specified, then the default (&#8216;num_posts&#8217; option, set to 5 for now).</p>\n<p>D. <code>list_posts_series</code><br />\nThis is a comma-separated list of integers or series slugs, each of which is an organize-series plugin series ID or slug. Any posts that are in this series will be included, unless their category is in <code>list_posts_exclude</code>. If this custom field is defined, then <em>ONLY</em> those series will be displayed. If this field is specified, then list_posts_include is ignored. If the organize-series plugin is not installed and activated, then this will be ignored.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>1.1.1 -December 22, 2010<br />\n    There was a bug in the post count custom field (&#8216;list_posts_count&#8217;). This has been fixed.</p>\n<p>1.1 -December 21, 2010<br />\n    Added tags to the include and exclude lists. Also added the ability for individual pages to specify a series (organize-series) and a post count.</p>\n<p>1.0.3 -July 29, 2010<br />\n    Now automatically split long posts with no &#8220;more&#8221; tag.</p>\n<p>1.0.2 -July 25, 2010<br />\n    Fixed an issue where the filter interferes with other content filters.</p>\n<p>1.0.1 -July 25, 2010<br />\n    Fixed an issue where a trailing &gt;\\p&lt; element was left behind.</p>\n"
