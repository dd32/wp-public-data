        "description": "<p>This plugin enables your customers to complete their billing/shipping addresses by entering their postcode and selecting their address from the options given.</p>\n<p>It utilises getAddress.io (https://getaddress.io) to do the lookup using their Royal Mail Postcode Address File.</p>\n<p>An API key is required for the integration to work, and the integration only appears when the customer has selected United Kingdom (or, more specifically, the ISO-3166-2 code &#8220;GB&#8221;) for their country.</p>\n<p>It can optionally be turned off for the shipping or billing addresses, and can be enabled or disabled in each of the checkout, customer account and WooCommerce admin screens.</p>\n<p>Postcodes that are looked up are saved in a custom database table for 24 hours to help reduce your costs for use of the getAddress.io API.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce</a>, at least version 3.0.<br />\n<a href=\"https://getaddress.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">getAddress.io API Key</a>. A number of pricing plans are available.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, this plugin does NOT support WooCommerce Checkout Blocks introduced as the default checkout experience in WooCommerce version 8.3, it can only be used with the WooCommerce checkout shortcode. I aim to make this plugin compatible with Checkout Blocks as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Once installed and activated, you need to go to the WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; General page in the WordPress dashboard. You can enter your API key and set your other options here.</p>\n<h3>Conflicts with other plugins</h3>\n<p>Certain plugins that also modify checkout fields can conflict with this plugin and prevent it from working.</p>\n<p>Usually, the symptom of this is that the &#8220;Find Address&#8221; button does not appear.</p>\n<p>Since version 2.1, I&#8217;ve added a Hook Priority setting at the bottom of the settings for the plugin that you can use to try and fix these conflicts.</p>\n<p>The default priority is 10, but using a higher number makes my plugin modify the checkout later in the process &#8211; you will probably need to experiment to find the priority that makes my plugin&#8217;s changes happen after the conflicting plugin.</p>\n<p>For example, a priority of 1001 seems to fix conflicts with the &#8220;Checkout Field Editor&#8221; plugin by ThemeHigh.</p>\n<h3>Filter Reference</h3>\n<p>For developers, I&#8217;ve included a few filters that you can use to customise certain aspects of the plugin. These are:</p>\n<h4>User Interface</h4>\n<p>All of these filters take one argument, <code>$text</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_find-address-button-text - the text shown on the Find Address buttons (default: Find Address)\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_find-address-searching-text - the text shown when the Find Address button is selected (default: Searching...)\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_enter-address-manually-text - the text shown for the \"Enter an address manually\" link (default: Enter an address manually)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Although these two texts are translatable, filters will override any translations.</p>\n<h4>Error Messages</h4>\n<p>All of these filters take one argument, <code>$message</code>, the error message that will be displayed to the user.</p>\n<pre><code>gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_400 - shown when the postcode supplied is invalid/empty\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_401 - shown when the API key provided in the settings is invalid\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_404 - shown when no addresses were found for the supplied postcode\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_429 - shown when the API key has hit its usage limit\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_api_error_500 - shown when there is a server error at getAddress.io\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: By default, the error messages are &#8220;customer friendly&#8221;, i.e. they don&#8217;t go into much detail about the cause of the error!</p>\n<h4>Styling</h4>\n<pre><code>gazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_billing_selector_row_class - changes the CSS class on the form-row that the billing address selector is placed into\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_shipping_selector_row_class - changes the CSS class on the form-row that the shipping address selector is placed into\ngazchaps-woocommerce-getaddress-io_clear_additional_fields - defaults to true, set to '__return_false' to stop the \"additional fields\" area of the checkout having a clear style applied to it&lt;h3&gt;License&lt;/h3&gt;Licensed under the [GNU General Public License v2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)\n</code></pre>\n",
