You may need to disable button encryption, and allow non-encrypted payments. <em>s2Member &gt; PayPal Options &gt; Account Details &gt; Button Encryption</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Framework) <strong>UI</strong>: Brought back the &#8220;Expand All&#8221; and &#8220;Collapse All&#8221; buttons for the admin panels.

I made it so you shouldn&#8217;t need to change anything, it should work with your existing configuration. Still worth doing a test or checking that things are normal after the update, and report any issues you notice.

The subscription saved the first card, instead of defaulting to the card in the customer&#8217;s profile. This release fixes that. The card is not added to a new subscription anymore, only to the customer&#8217;s profile, and updating his profile&#8217;s card with the Billing Update pro-form, will also update the subscription so it uses it. Thanks to Jim Antonucci for his help with this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Pro) <strong>Enhancement</strong>: The Stripe Billing Update pro-form now includes a field for the cardholder&#8217;s name (i.e. Name On Card). Adding the name to the card will improve successful subscription charges.

Now s2Member Pro attempts to find a draft or open invoice for the subscription being cancelled, and void it. Thanks Alan for reporting it. See <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/8098\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 8386</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>UI Enhancement</strong>: Improved Stripe pro-form error message when trying to create a subscription with a bad card.

See <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1187\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #1187</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Framework and Pro) <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Refactored PHP&#8217;s deprecated <em>create_function</em> with anonymous functions. Kudos to Berry for reporting it, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/6069\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 6069</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Framework) <strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Added a check for empty return variable before trying to use it in paypal-utilities.inc.php.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Framework) <strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Added checks for undefined indexes before trying to use them in paypal-return-in-subscr-or-wa-w-level.inc.php.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Framework) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Added a check for undefined index before using it to define a couple of s2 constants. Kudos to Berry for reporting it, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/8181/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 8181</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix</strong>: s2&#8217;s payment notification when creating a Stripe subscription, was being sent twice. Added a check to ignore the webhook for the subscription&#8217;s on-session first payment; s2&#8217;s webhook endpoint is for off-session events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Framework) <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added a new hook for the payment notification on subscription creation or buy now payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Stripe paid trials were accumulating on failed payment attempts, causing a larger charge when it finally succeeded. Kudos to Alan for his help through the many attempts to fix this one, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/7002\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 7002</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Enhancement</strong>: Stripe duplicate payments were happening randomly to a few site owners, apparently from bad communication between their server and Stripe&#8217;s. Added idempotency to prevent duplicates. Kudos to Alan and everyone in the forum that reported and gave details on this behavior, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/7002\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 7002</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v200301</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Enhancement:</strong> Added &#8220;Powered by Stripe&#8221; to Stripe pro-form&#8217;s payment card field. Kudos to Josh, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/6716\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 6716</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Stripe subscription cancellations were not happening when they should. This release updates the API integration for it and fixes that behavior. Kudos to Matt for reporting it, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/6909\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 6909</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Updating the card with Stripe&#8217;s pro-form sometimes gave an incorrect &#8220;missing billing method&#8221; error. Kudos to Corey, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/7058\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post 7058</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Small fix:</strong> Removed Bitcoin mention next to Stripe in Gateways list. Missed it in <a href=\"https://s2member.com/s2member-v191022-now-available/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">v191022</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v200221</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> In some rare cases, another plugin loaded Stripe&#8217;s class before s2Member, so when s2 tried loading it there&#8217;d be an error. This release fixes the check for the class before trying to load it. See <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1170\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #1170</a></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> s2Member won&#8217;t have control over what version of the Stripe SDK was loaded by the other plugin. You&#8217;ll need to get that other plugin to have an up-to-date version. If you don&#8217;t have another plugin loading Stripe, this is not relevant to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> When using a 100% off coupon, requiring no payment, the Stripe pro-form was still loading the card field and requiring it, preventing the free signup. That&#8217;s fixed in this release. See <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1171\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #1171</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The Stripe pro-form, when given an invalid card, didn&#8217;t give a clear error message for it, and instead just &#8220;invalid parameter&#8221;. Now it shows the correct card error, making it possible for the customer to try a different card to complete the payment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Update:</strong> The Indian Rupee was added to the list of currency symbols.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> The s2Member Pro add-on, not being a regular plugin was not uploadable via the WP plugin manager. This made it necessary to FTP, which is complicated for some site owners. In this release I made it possible for the plugin manager to upload or remove the Pro add-on.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It still is not a regular plugin. The activation link or status in the plugins manager is irrelevant, but I couldn&#8217;t find how to remove it. s2Member Pro activates automatically when its version matches the Framework&#8217;s, and it&#8217;ll be mentioned next to the Framework&#8217;s version in the plugins manager.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v191022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> The Stripe pro-forms can now handle 3D Secure 2 for <a href=\"https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Strong Customer Authentication</a>, as required by the new European regulation that came into effect recently. Props to those in the beta testing group, especially Brice and Felix. See <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5585/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">thread 5585</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> The Stripe pro-form now has the card field inline, instead of opening a modal to enter it. Before it required clicking the link to open the modal, enter the card details, submit that, and then submit the pro-form. Now you enter the card details as part of the pro-form. See <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/588\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #588</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Stripe Integration Updates:</strong> Upgraded the Stripe PHP SDK from v1.18 to v7.4.0, and the API from 2015-07-13 to 2019-10-08. Upgraded the integration from the Charges API to the latest Payment Intents API. Upgraded the card input from the old Stripe Checkout modal, to the new Stripe.js and Elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Optimization:</strong> Stripe&#8217;s JavaScript now only gets included if the page has a Stripe pro-form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Removed Stripe Bitcoin</strong>: Stripe <a href=\"https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">dropped Bitcoin</a> last year, it&#8217;s not available anymore. This update removes the Bitcoin options and mentions from the s2 admin pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Subscriptions without at trial were showing a &#8220;trialing&#8221; status in Stripe for the first period. This behavior has now been solved. It will only say trialing when you set a trial period (free or paid) in your Stripe pro-form shortcode. See <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1052\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #1052</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The Stripe pro-form installments via the <code>rrt</code> shortcode attribute were charging an extra payment before ending the subscription. There was an error in the time calculation for this. This is solved in this release. Props to Brice. See <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5817/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">thread 5817</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Some payments through the Stripe pro-form were creating a new Stripe customer when the user was already a customer. The Stripe customer ID was not being saved correctly in the user&#8217;s profile. This is solved in this release. Props to demeritcowboy for reporting it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v190822</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member) <strong>PayPal Integration Update:</strong> PayPal deprecated the subscription modification button. Using the old possible values for this, now gives an error on PayPal&#8217;s site. This button has been removed from the PayPal Standard integration in s2Member. Props to Tim for reporting it, see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5861\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum thread 5861</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1157\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issue #1157</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> PayPal would sometimes return the customer without the Custom Value expected by s2Member, incorrectly triggering an error. A small delay has now been added when needed to wait for PayPal to provide the missing value, so that the customer is met with the correct success message on return. Props to Josh Hartman for his help. See <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5250\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum thread 5250</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Google&#8217;s URL shortening service has been <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/transitioning-google-url-shortener.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">discontinued</a>. The s2Member integration with it was removed in this release. Props to Felix Hartmann for reporting it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member) <strong>Feature Enhancement:</strong> The popular URL shortening services have been abused in spam emails, and this can cause your site&#8217;s emails with shortened signup URLs to end up in the spam folder. It&#8217;s now possible to disable URL shortening when trying to avoid this problem. Props to Felix Hartmann for suggesting it. See <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5697\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum thread 5697</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>New Feature:</strong> It is now possible to use a custom URL shortener other than the defaults in the s2Member Framework. This is particularly useful to use <a href=\"http://yourls.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">YOURLS</a> for your links, making them unique to your site, looking more professional and avoiding the spam filters issue mentioned above. For more info see this <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5697/19\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum post</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v190617</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Authorize.Net Hash Upgrade:</strong> Authorize.Net <a href=\"https://support.authorize.net/s/article/MD5-Hash-End-of-Life-Signature-Key-Replacement\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">announced</a> the end-of-life for their MD5 Hash in favor of their new SHA512 Signature Key. Support for this has been added to s2Member Pro. The MD5 Hash is not provided by Authorize.Net any more, so the field for it in s2Member has been disabled. Props @krumch for his work. For further details see <a href=\"https://f.wpsharks.com/t/5514\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum thread 5514</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> For those that already used the MD5 Hash in their configuration, it is kept there and will keep working while Authorize.Net accepts it, which will not be much longer. It&#8217;s important to update your integration with the new Signature Key. Once you have your Signature Key in the s2Member configuration, it will be favored over the old MD5 Hash._</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The multisite patch for <code>wp-admin/user_new.php</code> wasn&#8217;t finding the code to replace because of changes in the latest releases of WordPress. It has now been updated, as well as the instructions in the Dashboard for those that prefer to apply it manually. Props @crazycoolcam for reporting it. For further details see <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1132\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #1132</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you already had patched this file in the past, it&#8217;s recommended that you remove the previous patch restoring it to the original file, and let s2Member Pro patch it again now, otherwise you risk getting it patched over the previous one and ending up with errors. After the new patch, please review that file to verify that it&#8217;s correct._</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member Pro) <strong>Bug Fix:</strong> The search results for <code>s2Member-List</code> were not being ordered as specified in the <code>orderby</code> attribute when this was a field from the <code>usermeta</code> table in the database, e.g. <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>. This is now fixed and working correctly. Props to @stevenwolock for reporting it. For further details see <a href=\"https://github.com/wpsharks/s2member/issues/1103\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #1103</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(s2Member) <strong>WP 5.2 Compat. Enhancement:</strong> s2Member has been tested with WP up to 5.2.2-alpha. With <code>WP_DEBUG</code> enabled, only one &#8220;notice&#8221; was found. In <code>wp-login.php</code> it said &#8216;login_headertitle is deprecated since version 5.2.0! Use login_headertext instead.&#8217; This release now uses <code>login_headertext</code> and doesn&#8217;t get that notice anymore. Props Azunga for reporting it.
