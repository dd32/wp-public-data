        "description": "<p>Verge3D is the most artist-friendly toolkit for creating interactive WebGL-based and immersive AR/VR experiences. Among the features of this framework are top-class graphics, integration with your favorite modeling suites, efficient web-friendly format for loading assets, seamless integration with WordPress and WooCommerce plugin. Interactivity is enabled with Puzzles, an intuitive and easy-to-learn visual scripting environment.</p>\n<p>Verge3D can be used to create product configurators, 3D presentations, online stores, e-learning apps, 3D portfolios, browser games, and more.</p>\n<p>You can try this plugin live using this <a href=\"https://sandbox.soft8soft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sandbox website</a> or follow the quick-start guide <a href=\"https://www.soft8soft.com/making-3d-product-configurator-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Take 3D web for a spin</h4>\n<p>The high-tech WebGL technology becomes accessible with Verge3D. Your beautiful content will live on your WordPress website and thus will be available to billions of Internet users.</p>\n<p>Interactivity, true 360 view and zooming capabilities bring your creation to entirely new level of engagement. It will work everywhere, from a small smartphone to workstation and even a TV set. We designed and assembled all tools you need in one place and called it Verge3D!</p>\n<h4>Quality real-time graphics</h4>\n<p>With Verge3D, real-time graphics are no longer associated with video games. Realistic visuals become possible with a sophisticated yet easy-to-use material system which is fully consistent with the modeling suite of your choice.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, physically based rendering (PBR) which comes with Verge3D simplifies the task of creating engaging 3D Web content even more. You no longer need to be an experienced 3D specialist or graphics programmer to achieve a high level of representation. We already took care of it!</p>\n<h4>Use familiar tools</h4>\n<p>We designed Verge3D to be closely integrated with your favorite tools. You can create your 3D content in Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya, and export straight to a web page. You can also preview your scene in the browser using the Sneak Peek feature.</p>\n<p>But, of course, aside from the 3D part, there is also web! With Verge3D, you can completely forget about building HTML/CSS layouts and JavaScript coding by<br />\nhand. Verge3D perfectly works with WordPress and WooCoommerce, as well as the design software such as Webflow or Google Web Designer.</p>\n<h4>Interactivity without coding</h4>\n<p>Verge3D Puzzles are a fun, yet powerful tool to develop smart web applications of any complexity. With Puzzles, you can easily add behavior scenarios to your 3D content, making it interactive and responsive to user actions. Puzzles will increase efficiency of your team by distributing responsibilities between programmers and designers.</p>\n<p>This amazing tool can be used both for fast prototyping and in production. For 3D artists, this invaluable tool overcomes technological barriers of web development thus making it possible to apply their creativity in the realm of interactive 3D Web!</p>\n<h4>No vendor locks, no strings attached</h4>\n<p>It’s up to you to decide whether to keep your 3D works private, show to your partners or share with the general public. Verge3D-based apps are hosted on your own WordPress servers and have no dependencies on any cloud platforms.</p>\n<p>As such, you are in control of your own data, being able to choose how to store it, where and for how long.</p>\n",
