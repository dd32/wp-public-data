        "installation": "<p>You can use the built in installer or you can install the plugin manually. This plugin does require that you are running WhippleHill&#8217;s Podium platform and have the WordPress integration activated.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You can either use the automatic plugin installer or your FTP program to upload it to your wp-content/plugins directory. Make sure you upload the entire <code>whipplehill-integration</code> folder. Don&#8217;t just upload all the php files and put them in <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create two <code>Super Admin</code> accounts in WordPress. One will be for you to manage your install with once the integration is active and the other will be for Podium to use to control WordPress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins</code> menu in WordPress. Make sure you don&#8217;t get any warnings from the plugin. If you do please correct them before proceeding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don&#8217;t activate the <code>SSO</code> under <code>WhippleHill Integration Settings</code> until you have complete all the steps below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact WhippleHill to get your <code>API key</code> and have the integration in Podium activated. You will need to provide WhippleHill with a <code>Super Admin</code> account and have RPC enabled on your main site. This is what Podium uses to authenticate with your WordPress install.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter your <code>API key</code> in the <code>WhippleHill Integration Settings</code> on the <code>Options</code> page in WordPress.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now you can activate the <code>SSO</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Self-Hosted Settings</h4>\n<p>If you would like your WordPress Managers from WhippleHill to be full Super Admin&#8217;s you will need to add this setting to your wp-config.php.</p>\n<p>define(&#8216;WH_WPM_AS_SUPER_ADMIN&#8217;, true);</p>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Will WhippleHill help me setup this plugin?</h4>\n<p>Of course we will. Feel free to contact either your WhippleHill Account Manager or Project Lead about receiving assistance when setting up the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Can I use this with more then one WordPress installation?</h4>\n<p>Currently we only support a connection between one WordPress installation and Podium.</p>\n<h4>Why do I need to create two extra &#8216;Super Admin&#8217; accounts?</h4>\n<p>This is due to how the integration works. When you install the plugin a new Role is created in WordPress called <code>WhippleHill WordPress Manager</code>. This Role is a clone of the <code>Super Admin</code> Role but has reduced capabilities. One of the removed capabilities is <code>Plugin</code> installation and upgrading, so you will need a true <code>Super Admin</code> account that is not managed by Podium to do upgrades and installs with.</p>\n",
