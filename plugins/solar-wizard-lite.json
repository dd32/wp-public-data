Simply select your colors, upload a logo, set your incentives, utility rate, and the price you want to sell at high/low for cash, loan, or solar lease purchases. Trusting Solar Calculator Pro offers solar companies the option to add battery storage for residential, commercial solar settings, EV calculations, currency changes, web hooks, customizable email templates, Google API, supports multi language and more!</p>\n",
