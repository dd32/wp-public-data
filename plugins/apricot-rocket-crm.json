Designed to work seamlessly with Word Press by using this<br />\nplugin the ApricotRocket system can also be easily integrated with any other<br />\nwebsite content management system.</p>\n<p>We believe that we compete very well with top shelf systems such as InfusionSoft,<br />\nSalesforce, Marketo, Pardot, and HubSpot. We price our system competitively with<br />\ntools like ConstantContact, Mail Chimp, and Aweber.</p>\n<p>We believe that it should not be terribly expensive to have a full featured<br />\nmarketing automation system. In fact, we price our system at a level that we<br />\nthink makes ApricotRocket the best value in the market. We hope you agree.</p>\n<h3>CRM Database</h3>\n<p>A Customer Relationship Management database is the core of our system. We have<br />\ndesigned the CRM Database to be incredibly intuitive and to have the most essential<br />\ndata fields automatically included. Included is a simple classification process<br />\nthat allows you to assign each record to one of 6 separate Classes, each of which<br />\ncan be customized with an unlimited number of class descriptions.</p>\n<p>Three of these six standard Classes are what we call MOSS&#8230; multiple option<br />\nsingle select. Three of the six standard Classes are what we call MOMS&#8230; multiple<br />\noption multiple select.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each CRM Database record can be classified according to a Sales<br />\nFunnel Stage. The Stages in the Sales Funnel can be customized&#8230; as many or<br />\nas few as you wish. Each record in your CRM Database can be assigned a Stage<br />\nin the Sales Funnel. As various Events occur you can change the Stage either<br />\nmanually or automatically.</p>\n<p>All information in the CRM Database can be downloaded at any time with a single<br />\nclick. Downloads are generated as .csv files that you can store wherever you wish.<br />\nYour data is always yours and can be stored safely offsite anytime you wish.</p>\n<h3>Custom Forms</h3>\n<p>One of the best features is the ability to quickly create Custom Forms and easily<br />\nplace them on your website. If you have a Word Press website you can use the<br />\nform shortcodes and simply copy and paste them to your Word Press website on any<br />\npage, post, or sidebar text widget. If you wish you can use the HTML<br />\ntag to insert Custom Forms on website pages other than Word Press websites.</p>\n<p>Custom Forms can be created with any combination of CRM Data Fields inserted<br />\ninto the Custom Form. This allows you to capture exactly the information you need<br />\nfrom your customers and prospects. You can fully customize the forms and change<br />\nthe background colors, form border colors, text fonts, buton colors, and many<br />\naspects of the look and feel of your Custom Form.</p>\n<p>You can create either Vertical or Horizontal forms. If you create a Horizontal<br />\nform you can decide if there is one, two, or three columns and you can place<br />\nspecific Data Fields in each row and column to control placement. Then, again,<br />\nyou can place the form on your website exactly where you want it by just copying<br />\nand pasting either a shortcode or an HTML code.</p>\n<p>You do not need to know any HTML to create Custom Forms.</p>\n<h3>LogicGates</h3>\n<p>LogicGates are one of the features of ApricotRocket which make the system so<br />\npowerful. LogicGates allow you to create a form where you ask questions. Each<br />\npotential answer to the question you ask can be set up to send your visitor to<br />\na different next step. For example&#8230; if someone says that they are a Tall Man<br />\nyou can send them to the page where you offer clothes for Tall Men. If they are<br />\na Petite Woman you can send them to a pager where you offer clothes for Petite<br />\nWomen.</p>\n<p>LogicGates are extremely simple to set up and, just like Custom Forms, you can<br />\neasily control all aspects of how the form looks. Also like Custom Forms,  you<br />\ndo not need to have any special HTML or programming skills to create LogicGates<br />\nor to put them on your website.</p>\n<h3>Event Triggers</h3>\n<p>Event Triggers can be connected to either Custom Forms or to LogicGates. Event<br />\nTriggers allow you to respond to your customer or prospect other than simply<br />\nsending them to another page or form. Event Triggers allow you to take specific<br />\nactions such as:<br />\n*   Send an Email to the Customer<br />\n*   Send an Email to yourself<br />\n*   Send a Text Message to the Customer<br />\n*   Send a Text Message to yourself<br />\n*   Start an Email Marketing Campaign to the Customer<br />\n*   Start a Text Messaging Campaig to the Customer<br />\n*   Send a Voice Mail Message to the Customer<br />\n*   Change data in the CRM Record for the Customer<br />\n*   All of the above in any combination</p>\n<p>Event Triggers are also very simple to set up. You do not need any programming<br />\nskills or experience to create and use Event Triggers.</p>\n<h3>Email Newsletters</h3>\n<p>ApricotRocket creates beautiful emails and delivers them with great efficiency.</p>\n<p>ApricotRocket offers a very intuitive and powerful Email Newsletter creation and<br />\nmanagement system. Lots of Templates are provided to select from and it is easy<br />\nto take a Template and customize it with your own images and text and links. Once<br />\nyou have created your newsletters you can connect them into a sequence of<br />\nEmail Campaigns. Email Newsletters and Email Campaigns can be sent to groups of<br />\npeople in your CRM Database or they can be automatically sent using Event Triggers<br />\nbased on the actions your visitors take when they fill out Custom Forms or<br />\nLogicGates.</p>\n<p>Every message sent is tracked through our system and we show whether or not it was<br />\ndelivered, opened, clicked, bounced, unsubscribed, or reported as spam. Our<br />\nsystem automatically flags messages that are unsubscribed or reported as spam and<br />\nyou do not have to worry about removing them. We automatically take care of this<br />\nfor you. Our statistics programming is very intuitive and comprehensive.</p>\n<p>When someone clicks on a link in an Email you know who and if you want to we can<br />\nsend you an email or a text message when this happens. Also, when they click on<br />\na link you can use the Email Click Trigger system just like the Event Trigger to<br />\ndo the same things that Event Triggers can do.</p>\n<h3>Custom Data Fields</h3>\n<p>No CRM Database comes out of the box with all of the data fields that every<br />\nbusiness needs. Each business is unique and while we have a lot of standard data<br />\nfields we also make it very easy and intuitive for you to create new data fields<br />\nand add them to your CRM Database. Create as many new data fields as you need for<br />\nyour business.</p>\n<p>After you create new data fields you can select them when you create a new Custom<br />\nForm. This makes it very easy for you to create truly Custom Forms designed<br />\nspecifically for your business. When someone fills out a Custom Form the<br />\ninformation you collect goes directly into your database. Seamlessly integrated<br />\nand without any hassle. This is the easiest way to manage your data that there<br />\nis anywhere.</p>\n<p>Once you have added new data fields they show up automatically in the Search<br />\nprocess. This means that you can immediately start searching your CRM Database<br />\nfor exactly the customers that you need to find.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p>We are proud of our pricing system.</p>\n<h3>Free up to 100</h3>\n<p>We offer everything (except SMS Text Messaging) free to anyone using<br />\nApricotRocket for FREE&#8230; up to a database of 100 records. The reason that we<br />\ncannot include SMS Text Messaging is that we incur a delivery charge for each<br />\nmessage and therefore we cannot include SMS Text Messaging on the FREE accounts.</p>\n<p>All of the other features are available for free&#8230; just like for any of our<br />\nUpgraded clients.</p>\n<h3>60 Day Money Back Guarantee</h3>\n<p>We also offer a 60 Day Money Back Guarantee. This means that when you decide to<br />\nUpgrade to one of our Paid Subscription Levels you have the confidence of knowing<br />\nthat if you ever decide to quit you can request the last 2 monthly fees as a<br />\nrefund if you wish.</p>\n<p>We trust that our clients will love our system and we place our trust in our<br />\nsoftware. If it is not something that you feel was worth your investment we do<br />\nnot want to take your money. Simple. No questions asked&#8230; just fill out a form<br />\non our system requesting a refund and we will cancel your account and refund<br />\nyour last 2 payments.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade Options</h3>\n<p>We offer a variety of Upgrade Options. When you reach a limit you can simply<br />\nto the next level and pay the fee. If your database reaches a limit you will be<br />\nunable to add new records either by uploading records or by people filling out<br />\na form on your website. We send you notifications when this is the case so that<br />\nyou can upgrade and avoid loosing out on growing your database.</p>\n<h3>Email and SMS Text Limits</h3>\n<p>We do offer a limit on the # of emails you can send and the # of sms text messages<br />\nthat you can send each month. The reason is that we incur costs for the delivery<br />\nof these messages and we have to make sure that we are covering our costs. We<br />\nare sure that you understand.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>We have built our system to be incredibly intuitive. In fact, we think that it<br />\nmay be the most intuitive Marketing Automation tool on the market today.</p>\n<h3>Video Tutorials</h3>\n<p>If you are using the Free service we provide you with a growing library of video<br />\ntutorials that we have created to try and cover every aspect of the system that<br />\nwe think you may need some help with.</p>\n<h3>Client Support Options</h3>\n<p>If you are a Paying Client we are delighted to answer your questions by either<br />\nemail or phone.

In fact, we price our system at a level that we<br />\nthink makes ApricotRocket the best value in the market. We hope you agree.</p>\n<h3>CRM Database</h3>\n<p>A Customer Relationship Management database is the core of our system. We have<br />\ndesigned the CRM Database to be incredibly intuitive and to have the most essential<br />\ndata fields automatically included. Included is a simple classification process<br />\nthat allows you to assign each record to one of 6 separate Classes, each of which<br />\ncan be customized with an unlimited number of class descriptions.</p>\n<p>Three of these six standard Classes are what we call MOSS&#8230; multiple option<br />\nsingle select. Three of the six standard Classes are what we call MOMS&#8230; multiple<br />\noption multiple select.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each CRM Database record can be classified according to a Sales<br />\nFunnel Stage. The Stages in the Sales Funnel can be customized&#8230; as many or<br />\nas few as you wish. Each record in your CRM Database can be assigned a Stage<br />\nin the Sales Funnel. As various Events occur you can change the Stage either<br />\nmanually or automatically.</p>\n<p>All information in the CRM Database can be downloaded at any time with a single<br />\nclick. Downloads are generated as .csv files that you can store wherever you wish.<br />\nYour data is always yours and can be stored safely offsite anytime you wish.</p>\n<h3>Custom Forms</h3>\n<p>One of the best features is the ability to quickly create Custom Forms and easily<br />\nplace them on your website. If you have a Word Press website you can use the<br />\nform shortcodes and simply copy and paste them to your Word Press website on any<br />\npage, post, or sidebar text widget. If you wish you can use the HTML<br />\ntag to insert Custom Forms on website pages other than Word Press websites.</p>\n<p>Custom Forms can be created with any combination of CRM Data Fields inserted<br />\ninto the Custom Form. This allows you to capture exactly the information you need<br />\nfrom your customers and prospects. You can fully customize the forms and change<br />\nthe background colors, form border colors, text fonts, buton colors, and many<br />\naspects of the look and feel of your Custom Form.</p>\n<p>You can create either Vertical or Horizontal forms. If you create a Horizontal<br />\nform you can decide if there is one, two, or three columns and you can place<br />\nspecific Data Fields in each row and column to control placement. Then, again,<br />\nyou can place the form on your website exactly where you want it by just copying<br />\nand pasting either a shortcode or an HTML code.</p>\n<p>You do not need to know any HTML to create Custom Forms.</p>\n<h3>LogicGates</h3>\n<p>LogicGates are one of the features of ApricotRocket which make the system so<br />\npowerful. LogicGates allow you to create a form where you ask questions. Each<br />\npotential answer to the question you ask can be set up to send your visitor to<br />\na different next step. For example&#8230; if someone says that they are a Tall Man<br />\nyou can send them to the page where you offer clothes for Tall Men. If they are<br />\na Petite Woman you can send them to a pager where you offer clothes for Petite<br />\nWomen.</p>\n<p>LogicGates are extremely simple to set up and, just like Custom Forms, you can<br />\neasily control all aspects of how the form looks. Also like Custom Forms,  you<br />\ndo not need to have any special HTML or programming skills to create LogicGates<br />\nor to put them on your website.</p>\n<h3>Event Triggers</h3>\n<p>Event Triggers can be connected to either Custom Forms or to LogicGates.

Lots of Templates are provided to select from and it is easy<br />\nto take a Template and customize it with your own images and text and links. Once<br />\nyou have created your newsletters you can connect them into a sequence of<br />\nEmail Campaigns. Email Newsletters and Email Campaigns can be sent to groups of<br />\npeople in your CRM Database or they can be automatically sent using Event Triggers<br />\nbased on the actions your visitors take when they fill out Custom Forms or<br />\nLogicGates.</p>\n<p>Every message sent is tracked through our system and we show whether or not it was<br />\ndelivered, opened, clicked, bounced, unsubscribed, or reported as spam. Our<br />\nsystem automatically flags messages that are unsubscribed or reported as spam and<br />\nyou do not have to worry about removing them. We automatically take care of this<br />\nfor you. Our statistics programming is very intuitive and comprehensive.</p>\n<p>When someone clicks on a link in an Email you know who and if you want to we can<br />\nsend you an email or a text message when this happens. Also, when they click on<br />\na link you can use the Email Click Trigger system just like the Event Trigger to<br />\ndo the same things that Event Triggers can do.</p>\n<h3>Custom Data Fields</h3>\n<p>No CRM Database comes out of the box with all of the data fields that every<br />\nbusiness needs. Each business is unique and while we have a lot of standard data<br />\nfields we also make it very easy and intuitive for you to create new data fields<br />\nand add them to your CRM Database. Create as many new data fields as you need for<br />\nyour business.</p>\n<p>After you create new data fields you can select them when you create a new Custom<br />\nForm. This makes it very easy for you to create truly Custom Forms designed<br />\nspecifically for your business. When someone fills out a Custom Form the<br />\ninformation you collect goes directly into your database. Seamlessly integrated<br />\nand without any hassle. This is the easiest way to manage your data that there<br />\nis anywhere.</p>\n<p>Once you have added new data fields they show up automatically in the Search<br />\nprocess. This means that you can immediately start searching your CRM Database<br />\nfor exactly the customers that you need to find.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p>We are proud of our pricing system.</p>\n<h3>Free up to 100</h3>\n<p>We offer everything (except SMS Text Messaging) free to anyone using<br />\nApricotRocket for FREE&#8230; up to a database of 100 records.
