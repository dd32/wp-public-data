At this point, Recapture starts the timers for your recovery emails.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20get%20emails%20from%20my%20customers%3F'>\nHow do you get emails from my customers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Recapture can get an email in a few different ways&#8211;First, any logged in customer who abandons a cart will receive recovery emails because of their WP profile.  Any guest customer who has entered a full, valid email address somewhere in the site (e.g.  email popup, our Add to Cart popup, even OTHER plugins that collect emails&#8211;Recapture can track that, easily) will receive recovery emails too.  Our success here comes from a few secrets in our JavaScript library that makes Recapture so powerful.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20include%20unique%20coupon%20codes%20in%20my%20emails%3F'>\nCan I include unique coupon codes in my emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep!
