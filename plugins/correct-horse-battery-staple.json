As Windows doesn&#8217;t have this list available, the plugin will have no effect on a Windows server or PC.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20it%20work%20for%20me%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t it work for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin does work on the sites it has been tested on. Feel free to ask for help on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/correct-horse-battery-staple\" title=\"Correct Horse Battery Staple plugin support page on WordPress.org\" rel=\"ugc\">Correct Horse Battery Staple Passwords plugin support page on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20for%20new%20users%20subscribing%20themseleves'>\nDoes it work for new users subscribing themseleves\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This version is designed for use on the <em>Add New user</em> (user-new.php) and <em>Your Profile</em> (profile.php) admin pages. <a href=\"http://cubecolour.co.uk/downloads/correct-horse-battery-staple-plus/\" title=\"Correct Horse Battery Staple Plus\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Correct Horse Battery Staple Plus</a> enables the XKCD-style passwords to also be generated for users registering themselves.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20like%20the%20words%20chosen%20for%20the%20password%20and%20want%20to%20change%20them%3F'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t like the words chosen for the password and want to change them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After saving the user, go to Users -&gt; All Users and click on the User you have just set up. You can then have WordPress generate a new password by clicking the &#8216;Generate Password&#8217; button. If you still don&#8217;t like the words in that password refresh the page to be able to generate another new password. You can still override the auto-generated password by overtyping if you want to change it manually.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='some%20of%20the%20words%20returned%20in%20the%20auto-generated%20password%20are%20a%20bit%20esoteric.%20can%27t%20we%20just%20have%20common%20words%20returned%3F'>\nSome of the words returned in the auto-generated password are a bit esoteric. Can&#8217;t we just have common words returned?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The words are taken from the dictionary words list contained in the server&#8217;s operating system, so it is not possible to exclude a subset of the list in this version of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20saw%20an%20article%20which%20said%20that%20using%20this%20style%20of%20password%20isn%27t%20such%20a%20good%20idea.%20why%20should%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nI saw an article which said that using this style of password isn&#8217;t such a good idea. Why should I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Instead of using a memorable password it would normally be preferable for people to use a password manager to remember their passwords. If a password manager is used, the passwords would not need to be memorable, so the default complex passwords generated by WordPress would be appropriate. It is not always practical or possible to insist that everyone logging onto a WordPress site will be using a password manager.</p>\n<p>This plugin offers a more memorable alternative to the default complex passwords which are not normally very memorable. A manually entered memorable password may not be very complex, so this plugin offers an alternative to entering a memorable but less strong password.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20levels%20of%20support%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat levels of support are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I offer free forum support for free cubecolour plugins where all communication takes place on the plugin&#8217;s own forum on the WordPress.org forums and (if applicable) a link is provided to the page on your site where I can see the issue without needing a password. Non-free support via email is available if the conditions of obtaining free support on the public forum are not compatible with the level of support required.
