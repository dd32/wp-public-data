Just install it and it will start logging events.</p>\n<h3>✨ Simple History Features</h3>\n<p>Out of the box Simple History has support for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Posts and pages</strong> – see who added, updated or deleted a post or page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Attachments</strong> – see who added, updated or deleted an attachment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Taxonomies (Custom taxonomies, categories, tags)</strong> – see who added, updated or deleted an taxonomy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comments</strong> – see who edited, approved or removed a comment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Widgets</strong> – get info when someone adds, updates or removes a widget in a sidebar</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Plugins</strong> – activation and deactivation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User profiles</strong> – info about added, updated or removed users</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User logins</strong> – see when a user login &amp; logout.

No site is the same and the usage together with the plugin can be very different from site to site. So you should always make sure that you are compliant with GDPR when using the plugin.</p>\n<p>That said, the plugin does not use Google Fonts, does not set cookies, uses no local storage, and by default the ip addresses are anonymized. The plugin is however a plugin that logs events and that can contain personal data, so you should always make sure that you are compliant with GDPR when using the plugin.</p>\n<p>Read more at the <a href=\"https://simple-history.com/docs/faq-frequently-asked-questions/#is-the-plugin-GDPR-complient\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ on the plugin website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
