You need to replace the sample URL with the actual URL of the video stream.</li>\n<li>&#8220;duration&#8221; contain length in seconds of video, so it can be displayed on player before staring playback.</li>\n<li>&#8220;poster&#8221; is location of poster image, which should be displayed on player.

You just need to copy your &#8220;Tracking ID&#8221; from Google Analytics page into player settings.</p>\n<p>For finding &#8220;Tracking ID&#8221; please open: <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Analytics</a> &gt; Admin &gt; Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code .</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tracker ID&#8221; is code having form &#8220;UA-XXXXXXXX-X&#8221;, where X is 0-9 digit and you have to copy it into ga_tracker_id video shortcode option (see section below).</p>\n<p>Player collects video playback details as &#8220;Events&#8221; in your Google Analytics account. There are available in sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Analytics panel &gt; Real-Time &gt; Events</li>\n<li>Google Analytics panel &gt; Behaviour &gt; Events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Player is sending events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>event category: view , event action: started (send on starting video playback)</li>\n<li>event category: player event, event action: playing/paused (send on play/pause video)</li>\n<li>event category: progress seconds, event action: progress seconds (send every 10 sec of playback)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each media distinction in statistics you have to specify in video shortcode option &#8220;media_id&#8221;. Then each event got additionaly &#8220;Event Label&#8221; with data provided from media_id parameter. media_id can be any text, which you want to define, but it is recomended to keep it short.</p>\n<h4>Video Shortcode Options</h4>\n<p>The following options are supported in the shortcode.</p>\n<p><strong>Autoplay</strong></p>\n<p>Causes the video file to automatically play when the page loads.<br />\nNote: Currenlty this option is working only on desktop devices with muted sound (see &#8220;Mute&#8221; shortcode). On mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.) this option is not working.<br />\nIt is platform limitation and clicking on video is required for starting playback.</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" autoplay=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Mute</strong></p>\n<p>Causes the video starts with muted sound. This option is usefull for starting video automatically with &#8220;autoplay&#8221; option.</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" autoplay=\"true\" mute=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong></p>\n<p>Defines length of video stream in seconds. Can contain fraction of second.

When PIP mode is enabled then player is detached from browser and user can watch video over other screens.<br />\nNote: This feature requires player at last v2.12.0 version. If you are using older customized player (changed colors, skin, etc.), then you have to generate new one on bradmax.com page.<br />\nPIP button appears after starting playback. Before it is blocked by browser.</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" pip=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Chapters &amp; Time markers</strong></p>\n<p>Defines additional info for video chapters.

Sometimes wordpress can have problems with multiline in shortcodes. Using semicolons will solve it.</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/440272.mpd\" duration=\"100.1\" chapters=\"0:00 - Intro ; 0:23 - 1. Preparations ; 3:18 - 2. Simulation ;7:18 - 3. Defense ; 8:48 - 4.

Subtitles files has to be in SRT or VTT format (file extension *.srt or *.vtt). Format for subtitles list subtitles=&#8221;LANG_CODE=FILE_LINK LANG_CODE=FILE_LINK &#8230;&#8221;, where LANG_CODE is two letter language code (ISO 639-1 standard &#8211; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for defining subtitles language. FILE_LINK is link to file stored on some HTTP server, which player will be able to download during playback.</p>\n<p>Working example (subtitles in Czech language):</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/tesla/tesla.m3u8\" subtitles=\"cz=https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/tesla/tesla_cz.srt\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Example with multiple languages for video:</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" subtitles=\"en=https://example.com/subtitles_en.srt cz=https://example.com/subtitles_cz.srt sk=https://example.com/subtitles_sk.srt\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>ga_tracker_id</strong></p>\n<p>Defines Google Analytics tracker id. When defined video playback is tracked in your Google Analytics account in &#8220;Events&#8221; sections.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tracker ID&#8221; is code having form &#8220;UA-XXXXXXXX-X&#8221;, where X is 0-9 digit and is located in <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Analytics</a> &gt; Admin &gt; Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" ga_tracker_id=\"UA-XXXXXXXX-X\" media_id=\"my example stream\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>media_id</strong></p>\n<p>This parameter is used, when Google Analytics plugin is active (see ga_tracker_id video shortcode). It is used for each media distinction, so for each different video diferent value should be provided. It can be any text, but it is recomended to keep it short.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative stream formats (url_2, url_3, url_4)</strong></p>\n<p>If you got video content (same title/media) in multiple formats eg. MPEG-DASH, HLS, MS Smooth Streaming you can provide them to player using shortcodes url_2, url_3, url_4 . Player automatically choses format with best support for device. You can put links in any order.</p>\n<p>Example for video with many formats (MPEG-DASH and HLS):</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/440272.mpd\" url_2=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/440272.m3u8\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>live_</strong></p>\n<p>Player supports playback for live stream transmissions (HLS, MPEG-DASH, MS Smooth Streaming). For such transmissions are additonal parameters, which improve user experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>live_end_date: Date time as ISO 8601 string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Examples: “2020-06-10T20:00:00Z” (2020-06-10 20:00:00 UTC time zone), “2020-06-12T18:00:00+08:00” (2020-06-12 18:00:00 GMT+8 time zone). If defined, then player is able to detect end of live stream transmission. Without it player will be assume end of transmission and end splash screen will be presented.</li>\n<li>live_thank_you_image_url: Link to custom end splash image, which should be shown after end of live stream transmission. If not defined then default start splash will be shown after end of transmission.</li>\n<li>live_waiting_for_transmission_image_url: Link to custom waiting for transmission image, which should be shown when player is waiting for live stream transmission start. Requires live_end_date parameter for correct work &#8211; player is aware if it is before or after transmission.</li>\n<li>live_low_latency_mode: Indicates if lowLatencyMode should be enabled. By default it is disabled. When live_low_latency_mode then latency optimization is used at the expense of quality (stream is in lower quality and can buffer more frequently, but with much lower latency). This mode is working only for HLS and MPEG-DASH streams. example configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_live_stream.m3u8\" live_waiting_for_transmission_image_url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/images/waiting_for_transmission.jpg\" live_thank_you_image_url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/images/thankyou_endsplash.jpg\" live_end_date=\"2020-06-14T14:00:00+08:00\"]\n\n[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_live_stream.m3u8\" live_low_latency_mode=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>drm_</strong></p>\n<p>Player supports playback for DRM protected video &#8211; paid version of player downloaded from bradmax.com is required.

Then each event got additionaly &#8220;Event Label&#8221; with data provided from media_id parameter. media_id can be any text, which you want to define, but it is recomended to keep it short.</p>\n<h4>Video Shortcode Options</h4>\n<p>The following options are supported in the shortcode.</p>\n<p><strong>Autoplay</strong></p>\n<p>Causes the video file to automatically play when the page loads.<br />\nNote: Currenlty this option is working only on desktop devices with muted sound (see &#8220;Mute&#8221; shortcode). On mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.) this option is not working.<br />\nIt is platform limitation and clicking on video is required for starting playback.</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" autoplay=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Mute</strong></p>\n<p>Causes the video starts with muted sound. This option is usefull for starting video automatically with &#8220;autoplay&#8221; option.</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" autoplay=\"true\" mute=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Duration</strong></p>\n<p>Defines length of video stream in seconds.

FILE_LINK is link to file stored on some HTTP server, which player will be able to download during playback.</p>\n<p>Working example (subtitles in Czech language):</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/tesla/tesla.m3u8\" subtitles=\"cz=https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/tesla/tesla_cz.srt\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Example with multiple languages for video:</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" subtitles=\"en=https://example.com/subtitles_en.srt cz=https://example.com/subtitles_cz.srt sk=https://example.com/subtitles_sk.srt\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>ga_tracker_id</strong></p>\n<p>Defines Google Analytics tracker id. When defined video playback is tracked in your Google Analytics account in &#8220;Events&#8221; sections.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tracker ID&#8221; is code having form &#8220;UA-XXXXXXXX-X&#8221;, where X is 0-9 digit and is located in <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Analytics</a> &gt; Admin &gt; Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_stream.m3u8\" ga_tracker_id=\"UA-XXXXXXXX-X\" media_id=\"my example stream\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>media_id</strong></p>\n<p>This parameter is used, when Google Analytics plugin is active (see ga_tracker_id video shortcode). It is used for each media distinction, so for each different video diferent value should be provided. It can be any text, but it is recomended to keep it short.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative stream formats (url_2, url_3, url_4)</strong></p>\n<p>If you got video content (same title/media) in multiple formats eg. MPEG-DASH, HLS, MS Smooth Streaming you can provide them to player using shortcodes url_2, url_3, url_4 . Player automatically choses format with best support for device. You can put links in any order.</p>\n<p>Example for video with many formats (MPEG-DASH and HLS):</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/440272.mpd\" url_2=\"https://bradmax.com/static/video/tos/440272.m3u8\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>live_</strong></p>\n<p>Player supports playback for live stream transmissions (HLS, MPEG-DASH, MS Smooth Streaming). For such transmissions are additonal parameters, which improve user experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>live_end_date: Date time as ISO 8601 string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Examples: “2020-06-10T20:00:00Z” (2020-06-10 20:00:00 UTC time zone), “2020-06-12T18:00:00+08:00” (2020-06-12 18:00:00 GMT+8 time zone). If defined, then player is able to detect end of live stream transmission. Without it player will be assume end of transmission and end splash screen will be presented.</li>\n<li>live_thank_you_image_url: Link to custom end splash image, which should be shown after end of live stream transmission. If not defined then default start splash will be shown after end of transmission.</li>\n<li>live_waiting_for_transmission_image_url: Link to custom waiting for transmission image, which should be shown when player is waiting for live stream transmission start. Requires live_end_date parameter for correct work &#8211; player is aware if it is before or after transmission.</li>\n<li>live_low_latency_mode: Indicates if lowLatencyMode should be enabled. By default it is disabled. When live_low_latency_mode then latency optimization is used at the expense of quality (stream is in lower quality and can buffer more frequently, but with much lower latency). This mode is working only for HLS and MPEG-DASH streams. example configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<pre><code>[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_live_stream.m3u8\" live_waiting_for_transmission_image_url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/images/waiting_for_transmission.jpg\" live_thank_you_image_url=\"https://bradmax.com/static/images/thankyou_endsplash.jpg\" live_end_date=\"2020-06-14T14:00:00+08:00\"]\n\n[bradmax_video url=\"http://example.com/hls_live_stream.m3u8\" live_low_latency_mode=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>drm_</strong></p>\n<p>Player supports playback for DRM protected video &#8211; paid version of player downloaded from bradmax.com is required.
