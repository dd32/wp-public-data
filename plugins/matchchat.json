The reverse is now true, by default Matchchat appears on all posts and previous comments are hidden, but this can be changed from the Settings menu as described in the installation instructions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I update Matchchat?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We update all the parts your audience sees from our servers, so you&#8217;ll always have the latest features and the most stable version.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, we&#8217;ll update this plugin which will give you more features in the dashboard &#8211; we&#8217;ll contact you whenever to do this and help you through the process.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
