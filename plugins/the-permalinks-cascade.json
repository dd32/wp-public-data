        "description": "<p>The Permalinks Cascade is a lightweight solution to enhancing a WordPress website with a multi-page Site Tree, Google Sitemaps and News Sitemaps. Thanks to Gutenberg blocks, hyper-lists of Posts, Pages, Custom Posts and Terms are swiftly added to any of your website&#8217;s page. Developed prioritising user-friendliness, The Permalinks Cascade is a totally plug-and-play plugin.</p>\n<h3>An overview of the major features:</h3>\n<h4>A Family of Dynamic Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>Be it a Site Tree, a collection of Google Sitemaps or a Google News Sitemap, the sitemap of your choice will always be up-to-date. The Permalinks Cascade produces sitemaps dynamically and, dynamically, adapts them to the size of your website.</p>\n<h4>The Dashboard</h4>\n<p>Where you can control the activation of the sitemaps and the enabling of the automatic pinging functionality, choose which types of content to include, adjust the sitemap split-up threshold, reorder with a drag-and-drop the hyper-lists composing the Site Tree, and generally know details about the building process and the latest pinging events.</p>\n<h4>Code-free Customisation</h4>\n<p>WordPress-like settings pages together with the plugin&#8217;s dashboard are where all your customisations take place. No need to be a developer to use The Permalinks Cascade.</p>\n<h4>Custom Post Types Support</h4>\n<p>You can include in the sitemaps any kind of content, custom or built-in. Yes, even in the Google News Sitemap.</p>\n<h4>Block-enabled</h4>\n<p>Four Gutenberg Blocks will let you insert a hyper-list of Pages, Posts, Custom Posts or Terms inside any kind of WordPress Post editable through the Gutenberg Editor. Each one of the Blocks is supplied with a settings panel and a in-editor-preview functionality.</p>\n<h4>Exclude and Disallow, Even in Bulk</h4>\n<p>Posts, Pages and Custom Posts can be excluded, singly, from the editor screen of WordPress or more at once, by using the Bulk Edit UI. And with no more than a tick of a checkbox you can add to the <code>robots.txt</code> file generated by WordPress a <code>Disallow</code> rule for each web page excluded from the Google Sitemaps.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemap Index</h4>\n<p>An expanding website cannot welcome Googlebot but with a Sitemap Index: The Permalinks Cascade creates a distinct sitemap, or a group of sitemaps, for each type of content the included permalinks belong to, and the best part is that The Permalinks Cascade can silently switch between single and multi-sitemap mode while keeping unchanged the location of the main sitemap.</p>\n<h4>Automated and Upon-request Pinging</h4>\n<p>The Permalinks Cascade can ping Google both on request, and automatically whenever a permalink is added to a Google Sitemap or to a News Sitemap. A chronological log of the latest thirty pinging events is always at hand when you need it.</p>\n<h4>Site Tree Pagination</h4>\n<p>When the need comes to untangle the usability of a medium-to-large Site Tree, the pagination facility is never slow to take action.</p>\n<h4>Compatible with WPML</h4>\n<p>You will be able to show localised versions of your Site Tree to the people visiting your WPML-powered website, and your Google Sitemaps will be complete with information about the language of your website&#8217;s public web pages.</p>\n<h4>This is a Ghost Page</h4>\n<p>When a page is flagged as Ghost Page, The Permalinks Cascade automatically excludes the Page from all the sitemaps and hyper-lists, prevents the WP Super Cache plugin from caching the Page and hides the Page from crawlers without showing up its path in the <code>robots.txt</code> file.</p>\n<h4>A Dynamic Shortcode and a Flexible Template Tag</h4>\n<p>Fully documented and always ready-to-use, the <code>[permalinks-cascade]</code> shortcode and its workmate <code>tpc_get_hyperlist()</code> are flexible like only a few other developer tools, they fittingly complement Gutenberg Blocks — you just have to change one attribute, or argument, for a whole new, dynamic list of hyperlinks to be all set for your visitors.</p>\n<h3>A Site Tree made up of details:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Drag-and-drop reordering of the hyper-lists composing the Site Tree.</li>\n<li>Hierarchical or flat list styles.</li>\n<li>Group Pages by Topic</li>\n<li>De-hyperlinking of parent Pages up to the third level.</li>\n<li>Exclude all child Pages.</li>\n<li>Order Pages by menu order or title.</li>\n<li>Group Posts by date, category or author with the ability to toggle the hyperlinking of the group&#8217;s title.</li>\n<li>Order Posts by title, publication date or popularity.</li>\n<li>Order Custom Posts by title or publication date.</li>\n<li>Stick featured Posts on top of the hyper-list.</li>\n<li>Show an excerpt of user defined length for Posts.</li>\n<li>Show authors&#8217; avatar and biographical info.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Upload in the &#8216;plugins&#8217; folder, and activate.</p>\n<h4>To Completely Uninstal</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the &#8216;Advanced Settings&#8217; screen of SiteTree and tick the &#8216;On uninstalling&#8217; setting — this will enable the deep-uninstallation mode.</li>\n<li>Deactivate The Permalinks Cascade from the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen.</li>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Delete&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n",

The plugin automatically disables the Core Sitemap functionality when the Google Sitemap is active.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20xml%20sitemaps%20produced%20by%20the%20permalinks%20cascade%20human-readable%3F'>\nAre the XML Sitemaps produced by The Permalinks Cascade human-readable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, they are. Although the Google Sitemaps and the Google News Sitemaps are crawler-oriented sitemaps, they are all equipped with an XSL Template that makes them human-readable.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20permalinks%20cascade%20generate%20google%20sitemaps%20complete%20with%20change%20frequency%20and%20priority%20metadata%3F'>\nCan The Permalinks Cascade generate Google Sitemaps complete with Change Frequency and Priority metadata?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it cannot. The use of such metadata has become obsolete by now.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
