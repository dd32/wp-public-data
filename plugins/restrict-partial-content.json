This should correspond to the WordPress roles. Can take multiple values which are comma separated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>allow_user =&gt; The User ID(s) OR user login name to allow access to the restricted content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>message =&gt; The message that is visible when content is restricted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>open_time =&gt; The exact date and time when the content should become visible (format to use YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS example 2016-03-24 13:00:00 will mean that the content should show after 24 March 2016 from 1pm onwards)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>condition =&gt; options are &#8220;any&#8221; and &#8220;all&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;any&#8221; will mean that any single parameter that matches the criteria will result in the protected content being shown. &#8220;all&#8221; will mean that only when all criteria is matched will the restricted content be shown.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rule =&gt; Now you can define rules and use these easily. This gives the flexibility of changing the criteria in one location and having it apply everywhere that the rule has been used. If the rule parameter is used then it will overrule the other parameters.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some examples<br />\nExample 1<br />\n[restrict allow_role=&#8221;subscriber&#8221; allow_user = &#8220;1, 2, adam&#8221; open_time=&#8221;2016-03-14 11:00:00&#8243; condition=&#8221;any&#8221; message=&#8221;hello&#8221;] secret here[/restrict]<br />\nThis will show the restrcited to all subscribers, users with ID 1 and 2, username &#8220;adam&#8221;. As soon as the open_time is passed it will show the restricted content to everyone.</p>\n<p>Example 2<br />\n[restrict allow_role=&#8221;author&#8221; open_time=&#8221;2016-03-14 11:00:00&#8243; condition=&#8221;all&#8221; message=&#8221;hello&#8221;] secret here[/restrict]<br />\nThis will show only when the user is logged in with a subscriber role and the open_time has passed</p>\n<p>Example 3<br />\n[restrict rule=&#8221;2&#8243;] secret here[/restrict]<br />\nThis will apply rule with id 2. Rules can be defined from inside the WP dashboard.</p>\n",
