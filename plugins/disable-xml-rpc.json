The WordPress mobile app should tell you that &#8220;XML-RPC services are disabled on this site&#8221; if the plugin is activated.</li>\n<li>Use the curl command to send an XML-RPC request to your site. If the response contains &#8220;XML-RPC services are disabled on this site&#8221; then the plugin is working properly and WordPress will not send data back to XML-RPC requests.</li>\n<li>Try the XML-RPC Validator, written by Danilo Ercoli of the Automattic Mobile Team &#8211; the tool is available at <a href=\"https://xmlrpc-check.hostpress.me/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://xmlrpc-check.hostpress.me/</a>. Information and source code for the tool are available on GitHub at <a href=\"https://github.com/daniloercoli/WordPress-XML-RPC-Validator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/daniloercoli/WordPress-XML-RPC-Validator</a>. Keep in mind that you want the validator to fail and tell you that XML-RPC services are disabled.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See the screenshots for examples of what these tools will return when the plugin is enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='something%20doesn%27t%20seem%20to%20be%20working%20correctly'>\nSomething doesn&#8217;t seem to be working correctly\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin is activated, but XML-RPC appears to still be working &#8230; OR &#8230; the plugin is deactivated, but XML-RPC is not working, then it&#8217;s possible that another plugin or theme function is affecting the xmlrpc_enabled filter. Additionally, server configurations could be blocking XML-RPC (i.e. blocking access to xmlrpc.php in the .htaccess file).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
