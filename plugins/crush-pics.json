        "faq": "\n<h4>\nDo I need to be an expert to use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not! We designed Crush.pics to be simple for everyone to use.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow does Crush.pics compare to other image optimization plugins\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are many great options to choose from. Using any of them is a huge step in the right directly which we wholeheartedly support. One major difference; While most plugins use the same compression level for every file, our <strong>Balanced Compression</strong> algorithm calculates the optimal compression level for each file individually. Ultimately resulting in the biggest size savings possible while still keeping beautiful, sharp, high quality images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I use the same API Key on multiple web sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I optimize my current images and new images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat image formats does Crush.pics support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently &#8211; JPEG, PNG and GIF.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIf I delete the Crush.pics plugin, will my images stay optimised?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! Once optimized the images will remain optimized unless you explicitly choose to restore them. But why would you do that? ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I do a one-time compression of my images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! Simply select the appropriate plan for your needs, and once your compression is complete simply downgrade to the Free Plan within 30 days. This process will charge your chosen plan&#8217;s fee one-time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if my plan&#8217;s quota isn&#8217;t enough?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Crush.pics will notify you if your current plan is unable to compress all your images. To complete the compression of your images you&#8217;ll need to upgrade to a higher plan, then any remaining images will continue compressing automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHave more questions? = Great!
