        "faq": "\n<h4>What exactly does this plugin do to my WordPress instalation</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>This plugin will use a filter to add a new box to the profile pages of your authors. It will also save the contents of that box into your database.</li>\n<li>The plugin runs a conditional filter so if the page is an author profile page then the user description call will return the big bio box data and if the page is a single post then the user description call will return the default bio contents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The conditional filter means that if you are using an author box pluin or function to display deatils about the author then it will still return the default description.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin does not work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin in was tested on a clean install of wordpress 3.3 and a child theme of 2010. If the plugin does not work then raise a topic for this plugin and tell me: what version of wordpress you are using, what theme are you using, do you have problems with any other tinymce call in your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the future hold for Big bio Box</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There seems to be a IE8 specific issue with the tinymce editor. When you use one of the drop down menus such as headings then the drop down on the first instance goes to the top of the web page. This problem does not happen in chrome or firefox.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
