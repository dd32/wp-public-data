        "faq": "\n<h4>What is DarkOnyx?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>DarkOnyx is not just a Flash/HTML5 Video Player for Web, but also a powerful Video Platform similar in functionality to Brightcove or Ooyala.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What differs DarkOnyx from other video players like JWPlayer or FlowPlayer</h4>\n<p>\n<p>DarkOnyx is an intelligent HTML5/Flash hybrid player, that can automatically switch between its two modes, depending on available sources, and end-user&#8217;s system (instead of just a simple fallback mechanism). It also comes with a powerful, dedicated CMS.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If the player already has got its own CMS, why do I need this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin itself is a bridge between two platforms (DarkOnyx &amp; WordPress). Thanks to that, you will be able to setup most of the settings from WordPress level without a need to operate between two scripts all the time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to install DarkOnyx?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The installation process is almost identical to how you set up WordPress. Check our site to learn more about it. Video tutorials both for player and plugin installation are also available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is DarkOnyx free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is â€“ just like the plugin. You will have to register an account on web-anatomy.com to download the player.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you offer a free tech support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure to check forum on our website, we will be glad to help you!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I would like to have a certain feature in DarkOnyx plugin&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feel free to contact us and share with your ideas!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I display my own ads in Free Edition too?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure you can!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What video/audio codecs does DarkOnyx support</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flash &#8211; H.264, On2VP6, H.263+ (Sorenson Spark), AAC, MP3</li>\n<li>HTML5 &#8211; H.264, Theora, VP8, MP3</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Is live-streaming possible with that player?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is!</p>\n<p>More FAQ: http://darkonyx.web-anatomy.com/en/Faq</p>\n</p>\n\n",
