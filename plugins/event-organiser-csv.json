You can also export events from<br />\nEvent Organiser into a CSV file.</p>\n<p>Please note that this plug-in still in <strong>beta</strong>. I welcome feedback, issues and pull-requests.</p>\n<h4>Aim</h4>\n<p>To allow users to export / import events in CSV format between various calendar applications, and to do this flexiably<br />\nso as to limit the number of requirements on the CSV file before it can be read correctly. To allow users to move events<br />\nbetween installations of Event Organiser while preserving data that is not suported by iCal.</p>\n<p>In the vein of flexibility columns do not have to be in any prescribed order: you tell the plug-in which columns pertain to what (start date, end date etc)<br />\nafter importing the file.</p>\n<h4>How to use this plug-in</h4>\n<p>Once installed, go to <em>Tools &gt; Import Events</em>. Here you can export a CSV file or select a file to import one. To import an file:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select browse and select the file, click &#8220;Upload file and import&#8221;</li>\n<li>All being well you should now see a preview of the CSV file, along with a drop-down option at the base of each column. If the preview looks wrong, try<br />\nselecting a different delimiter type (comma, tab, space) at the top.</li>\n<li>If the first row of the CSV file is a header, select the option indicating this. The first row will then be ignored.</li>\n<li>At the bottom of each column select what the column represents. The options are (not all are required):\n<ul>\n<li>Title</li>\n<li>Start (formatted in Y-m-d format, and also indicating time <strong>only</strong> if the event is not all-day)  </li>\n<li>End (formatted as above)</li>\n<li>Recur until (if the event recurs, the date of its last occurrence)</li>\n<li>Recurrence Schedule (if the event recurs, how it repeats: once|daily|weekly|monthly|yearly|custom).</li>\n<li>Recurrence Frequency (if the event recurs, an integer indicating with what frequency)</li>\n<li>Schedule Meta (See documentation for <a href=\"http://codex.wp-event-organiser.com/function-eo_insert_event.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">eo_insert_post()</a>, e.g. &#8220;MO,TU,THR&#8221; (weekly), &#8220;BYDAY=2MO&#8221; or &#8220;BYMONTHDAY=16&#8221; (monthly)</li>\n<li>Content (HTML post content)</li>\n<li>Venue (Venue slug)</li>\n<li>Categories (comma seperated list of category slugs) </li>\n<li>Tags (comma seperated list of tag slugs)</li>\n<li>[Any custom event taxonomies registered] (comma seperated list of slugs)</li>\n<li>Include dates (comma seperated list of Y-m-d dates to include from the event&#8217;s schedule)</li>\n<li>Exclude dates (as above, but added to the event&#8217;s schedule)</li>\n<li>Post Meta (an option will appear to provide the meta-key)</li>\n<li>Click import.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Importing new venues, categories and tags</h4>\n<p>By default the plug-in will only import venues, categories and tags that already exist.<br />\nTo allow the plug-in to create new venues, categories and tags you can add the following<br />\ncode (to a seperate plug-in or your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code>).</p>\n<pre><code> function my_set_import_imports( $args, $file ){\n      $args['import_new_event-category'] =  true; //create category if it doesn't exist\n      $args['import_new_event-venue']    =  true; //create venue if it doesn't exist.\n      $args['import_new_event-tag']      =  true; //create tag if it doesn't exist. \n\n      return $args;\n }\n add_filter( 'eventorganiser_csv_import_args', 'my_set_import_imports', 10, 2 );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please note the limitations on importing venues discussed below.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>Current limitations apply. See the examples folder for an archetypal CSV file</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All dates are read using PHP&#8217;s DateTime. While various formats are supported, Y-m-d (e.g. 2013-12-31) formats are <strong>strongly</strong> recommended</li>\n<li>Starts dates must be provided in Y-m-d (e.g. 2013-12-31) for all day events and also include a time-component (e.g. 2013-12-31 11:30pm) for non-all-day events. There is no<br />\nprescribed format for the time but 24-hour time is recommended. You do not need to specify seconds.</li>\n<li>Include/exclude dates should be given as comma-seperated list of dates in Y-m-d format.</li>\n<li>Categories and tags must be given as comma-seperated list of names</li>\n<li>It does not support venue meta-data (yet)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Please note that in theory all dates (other than the start date) can be given in any format, however, to<br />\nensure dates are interpreted correctly it is strongly recommended to give dates in Y-m-d (or Y-m-d H:i for non-all day events) format.
