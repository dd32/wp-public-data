The alignment and thumbnail size can be set in the options panel,<br />\nand thumbnails can also be disabled.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with custom post types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, it does not. I may add custom-post type support in the future, depending on user feedback.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I show related posts by tag or a custom taxonomy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time. This is also a feature I may add in future versions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I Choose the Number of Related Posts to Show?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This setting is available in the options panel. Nifty is configured to show up to 20 related posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where Can I Get Support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may seek community support within the WordPress.org forums. I will try to monitor and assist as needed. If you need immediate, hands-on, paid support, please contact me through my website: www.edwardrjenkins.com</p>\n</p>\n\n",
