You may notice a sharp drop in your WordPress site page speed score especially for Core Web Vitals.</p>\n<p>In this plugin, we use a combination technique of both delayed loading and lazy load of the Microsoft Clarity script. When you use our plugin to place Microsoft Clarity script, it will not affect your page speed score.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20speed%20up%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill this plugin speed up my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically, this plugin doesn&#8217;t speed up your website. If your website has a score of 80 (Core Web Vitals) before placing the clarity script, after using our plugin. The score will remain the same (80).</p>\n<p>But if you place the code directly copied from official website without using this plugin. You may notice, your website core web vitals score might drop a bit. Our plugin can help you avoid a drop in your core Web Vitals score.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='more%20questions%3F'>\nMore Questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have questions about the plugin, please use the support tab of this page.
