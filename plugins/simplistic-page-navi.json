In such cases, when the function is called a second time, the list created the first time is reused from memory to avoid having the same process performed twice.</p>\n<p>This plugin has a custom block for Gutenberg Block Editor.</p>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t know much html or php, this plugin has the ability to insert linked list at the beginning and end of an html element using Javascript by specifying the ID of the html element where you want to display it.<br />\nFurthermore, if you have no idea about the ID of html elements, etc., go into the plugin&#8217;s options settings page and try typing &#8220;search&#8221; in the &#8220;Page-lists outputted by javascript&#8221; field. When the page is displayed, the plugin uses javascript to find the html elements of the main content, and if it is lucky enough to find it, it will use Javascript to insert a page-lists at the beginning and end of that HTML element. Perhaps it might work.</p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section 1</h3>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload &#8220;simplistic_pagenavi&#8221; folder which include &#8220;simplistic_pagenavi.php&#8221; to the &#8220;/wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to &#8220;WP-Admin -&gt; Settings -&gt; Simplistic Page-navi Option&#8221; to configure the plugin options</li>\n<li>Add a template tag &#8220;splcpn_echopager&#8221; to the place where you would like to display page-navigation in your theme. Or, if you don&#8217;t want to touch HTML or PHP at all, try into a word &#8220;search&#8221; in the &#8220;Page-lists outputted by javascript&#8221; option box. If this plugin can successfully find the main content, maybe it will work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Usage is as follows.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    if ( function_exists( 'splcpn_echopager' ) ) {\n        splcpn_echopager( 1 );\n    }\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, HTML will be generated as follows when you set 1 as an argument.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;nav id=\"toppagelink\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pagenavilist\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you set 0 or if you omit it ( optional in the case because 0 is default value) is as follows.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;nav id=\"bottompagelink\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"pagenavilist\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to display page-lists twice in the same page, you can setting of position in detail for each.</p>\n<p>I think it is common to display two pagenations  at the top and bottom of a page. In that case, the second time the function is called, the first creation is stored in memory and reused.</p>\n<p>Other parameters (like options, but those related to style sheets are useless) can also be specified as the second argument in an array, as shown bellow.</p>\n<p>By specifying options in the function arguments, you can have different displays even within the same page. (e.g., a full list at the top and a minimalist list at the bottom)</p>\n<p>The following is a list of all the items that can be specified, but in reality, only the necessary items need to be specified in an array.</p>\n<p>When specifying the second argument, the first argument must be specified even if the first argument is the default value of 0 (otherwise an error will occur).</p>\n<p>The last parameter &#8220;max_page_num&#8221; is not an option value. For example, when you get a list of the specific category post using the WP_Query at a &#8220;static&#8221; page, there is a case where &#8220;$wp_query-&gt;max_num_pages&#8221; is no value. In that case, pagenation will be not displayed. You should specified in this parameter by getting the total number of pages in some way.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    if ( function_exists( 'splcpn_echopager' ) ) {\n        $args = array(\n            'reverse' =&gt; '0', // 0:normal(from left) 1:reverse(from right)\n            'above' =&gt; '7', // Show jump-box when the total number of pages is more than this number, default:7\n            'minimum_unit' =&gt; '1', // 0:minimum-list 1:full-list\n            'adjacent_num'=&gt; '3',// Number of pages that adjacent to current page to be displayed, 1-5\n            'larger_page'=&gt; '3',// Number of pages that multiples of 10 to be displayed, 0-5\n            'top_label' =&gt; 'Top',\n            'last_label' =&gt; 'Last',\n            'connection_str'=&gt;'~',// Connection string, empty is disable.\n            'div_id'=&gt;'pagenavilist',// ID name of parent div tag.\n            'font_size'=&gt;'0',//specify font size. set 0 to disable. -10 : 0.5em ~ 10 : 1.5em, at intervals of 0.05em.\n            'top_text_align'=&gt;'0',// Text-align of id=\"toppagelink\" of \"nav\" tag. 0 : disable, 1:left, 2: right, 3:center.\n            'top_margin'=&gt;'',// Margin of  id=\"toppagelink\" of \"nav\" tag.
