        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I customize the article views?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Client Reference looks for a <code>wpclientref-views</code> directory in your current theme&#8217;s directory. If it finds <code>front.php</code> (the default view), <code>single.php</code> (a single article), or <code>wpclientref.css</code> (article styles), it will use those files instead of the plugin&#8217;s defaults.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the name of the custom post type?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! If you need to change the name of the custom post type (default is <code>client_reference</code>) you can do so in the &#8220;Article Options&#8221; page. This will also update the posts in <code>wp_posts</code> accordingly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why has the Knowledgebase replaced my Users menu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Version 0.4 of the plugin used menu position 70 as its default, which is normally occupied by the Users menu. It&#8217;s been patched in version 0.41 but any users who installed pre-0.41 should manually change the menu position (Articles &gt; Options) to a position not occupied by a native WordPress menu (71 is the new default for WP Client Reference).</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Special thanks to Chris VanPatten for tracking this down!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.41</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with default &#8216;Knowledgebase&#8217; position preventing access to Users menu (special thanks to duckgoesoink)</li>\n</ul>\n"
