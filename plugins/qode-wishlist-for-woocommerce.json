button inside loops and product pages, customize the &#8220;Add to Wishlist&#8221; <strong>button appearance</strong> (labels, colors, icon &amp; more), as well as <strong>modify the columns</strong> shown in wishlist tables.</p>\n<p>On top of that, you can enable automatic item wishlist <strong>removals</strong> for products added to carts, and you can automatically <strong>redirect users</strong> from wishlist to cart pages once they add a wishlisted product to their cart.</p>\n<p>The wishlist pages themselves come in two layouts, <strong>table</strong> and <strong>grid</strong>, and can feature a <strong>sorting switcher</strong>, table <strong>items</strong> (e.g., prices, product variations, stock status etc.), <strong>related products</strong>, total <strong>product amounts</strong> as well as a <strong>share</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Visitors can access their wishlists either from the dropdown or in the side area, with the appearance of each <strong>fully adjustable</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Let Users Create Multiple Wishlists</h3>\n<p>Furthermore, you can allow your visitors to create <strong>multiple wishlists</strong> which can be either <strong>private</strong>, <strong>public</strong> or visible only to users that obtained a link to them.</p>\n<p>Multi wishlist pages can contain item counts, dates of creation and more, and much like standard wishlist pages, there are two layout types to choose from – grid and table.</p>\n<h3>Include Superbly Practical Wishlist Product Counts</h3>\n<p>One more highly useful functionality this plugin boasts is enabling <strong>wishlist counts</strong> for products in lists and single pages. This shows the total number of times users on your website added a specific item to their personal wishlists.</p>\n<h3>Get Analytic Insights in the User Behavior Admin Area</h3>\n<p>Another practical feature comes in the form of the <strong>user behavior admin area</strong>, where you can obtain analytic data and <strong>follow conversions</strong> either by user or by product.</p>\n<p>Here you’ll find the number of times users added specific products to their wishlists, as well as the number of times a product was purchased, allowing you to monitor the overall interest in specific products.</p>\n<h3>Enable Automatic Promotional Email Campaigns</h3>\n<p>Last but not least, the <a href=\"https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</a> plugin provides you with a number of options related to <strong>promotional email campaigns</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can enable and configure automatic <strong>on sale</strong>, <strong>promotional</strong> and <strong>back in stock</strong> emails, and on top of that you also have the option to set up <strong>Ask for Estimate</strong> forms with ease.</p>\n<h3> Documentation &amp; Support </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Check out our step-by-step <a href=\"https://qodeinteractive.com/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/documentation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">user guide</a> on how to install and use QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce.</li>\n<li>You can also submit a topic to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> at and our support team will be glad to help you out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>We use our services</p>\n<p>Qode&#8217;s CDN &#8211; The domain https://export.qodethemes.com is a service from which we retrieve the list of all Qode plugins displayed in the admin dashboard.<br />\nQode&#8217;s API &#8211; The domain https://api.qodeinteractive.com is an API that&#8217;s called when a user deactivates the plugin, to retrieve the reason for deactivation.

button inside loops and product pages, customize the &#8220;Add to Wishlist&#8221; <strong>button appearance</strong> (labels, colors, icon &amp; more), as well as <strong>modify the columns</strong> shown in wishlist tables.</p>\n<p>On top of that, you can enable automatic item wishlist <strong>removals</strong> for products added to carts, and you can automatically <strong>redirect users</strong> from wishlist to cart pages once they add a wishlisted product to their cart.</p>\n<p>The wishlist pages themselves come in two layouts, <strong>table</strong> and <strong>grid</strong>, and can feature a <strong>sorting switcher</strong>, table <strong>items</strong> (e.g., prices, product variations, stock status etc.), <strong>related products</strong>, total <strong>product amounts</strong> as well as a <strong>share</strong> feature.</p>\n<p>Visitors can access their wishlists either from the dropdown or in the side area, with the appearance of each <strong>fully adjustable</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Let Users Create Multiple Wishlists</h3>\n<p>Furthermore, you can allow your visitors to create <strong>multiple wishlists</strong> which can be either <strong>private</strong>, <strong>public</strong> or visible only to users that obtained a link to them.</p>\n<p>Multi wishlist pages can contain item counts, dates of creation and more, and much like standard wishlist pages, there are two layout types to choose from – grid and table.</p>\n<h3>Include Superbly Practical Wishlist Product Counts</h3>\n<p>One more highly useful functionality this plugin boasts is enabling <strong>wishlist counts</strong> for products in lists and single pages. This shows the total number of times users on your website added a specific item to their personal wishlists.</p>\n<h3>Get Analytic Insights in the User Behavior Admin Area</h3>\n<p>Another practical feature comes in the form of the <strong>user behavior admin area</strong>, where you can obtain analytic data and <strong>follow conversions</strong> either by user or by product.</p>\n<p>Here you’ll find the number of times users added specific products to their wishlists, as well as the number of times a product was purchased, allowing you to monitor the overall interest in specific products.</p>\n<h3>Enable Automatic Promotional Email Campaigns</h3>\n<p>Last but not least, the <a href=\"https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce</a> plugin provides you with a number of options related to <strong>promotional email campaigns</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can enable and configure automatic <strong>on sale</strong>, <strong>promotional</strong> and <strong>back in stock</strong> emails, and on top of that you also have the option to set up <strong>Ask for Estimate</strong> forms with ease.</p>\n<h3> Documentation &amp; Support </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Check out our step-by-step <a href=\"https://qodeinteractive.com/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/documentation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">user guide</a> on how to install and use QODE Wishlist for WooCommerce.</li>\n<li>You can also submit a topic to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/qode-wishlist-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> at and our support team will be glad to help you out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>We use our services</p>\n<p>Qode&#8217;s CDN &#8211; The domain https://export.qodethemes.com is a service from which we retrieve the list of all Qode plugins displayed in the admin dashboard.<br />\nQode&#8217;s API &#8211; The domain https://api.qodeinteractive.com is an API that&#8217;s called when a user deactivates the plugin, to retrieve the reason for deactivation.
