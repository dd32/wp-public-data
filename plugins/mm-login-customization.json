Being secure in the online world becomes more and more important every day and it is vital to protect your website and the data it holds now. This plugin helps web-admins to protect their WordPress website in a specific way.</p>\n<p>&#10020; Before taking a look at the detailed description of the plugin, let’s check the URL of the demo page. <a href=\"https://www.betatesting.net/projects/mm_login_customization/2fal2b6q\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click Here</a>, let&#8217;s see what this plugin can do.</p>\n<p>&#10020; The default admin login URL of any website developed in WordPress is with ../wp-admin or ../wp-login.php. The problem is, this type of admin log-in makes the WordPress admin section predictable and hence vulnerable. Using this vulnerability, an unauthenticated person can breach the admin section of the website. These unauthenticated breaches not only damages the reputation of the website but also offers the miscreants a chance to misuse sensitive and important information.</p>\n<p>&#10020; This plug-in ensures that such breaches never happen to your website. It ensures the security of your website admin login section as well as the website data. Using this plugin, you can generate dynamic admin URLs for login and choose a template for the custom login page as well. This login masks wp-login.php and wp-admin during the login process.</p>\n<p>&#10020; The admin of the website can change the login URL frequently by deactivating the old URL with subsequent activation of the plugin status. Once that is done, save the newly activated plugin status. This plug-in generates different admin log-in URLs for every website. This feature ensures that the miscreants cannot predict the admin log-in URL of your website.</p>\n<p>&#10020; Procedure &#10020;<br />\nActive plugin MM Login Customization -&gt; Go to menu option named MM Login Customization -&gt; Choose settings -&gt; Active option from Status tab -&gt; Save URL -&gt; Copy auto generated admin link for future login<br />\nYou may choose template from Choose Template tab for admin login page look and feel.</p>\n<p>For any query please email us at &#8211; <a href=\"mailto:&#x77;&#x6f;&#114;&#100;&#x70;&#x72;&#101;&#115;&#x73;&#x40;&#109;a&#x74;&#114;&#105;x&#x6e;&#109;&#101;&#x64;&#x69;&#097;&#046;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wordpress@matrixnmedia.com</a></p>\n",
