        "installation": "<h4>Assisted Installation</h4>\n<p>Installation is free, quick, and easy. <a href=\"https://access.watch/wordpress/install\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Install Access Watch from our site with our assistant</a> in a few clicks.</p>\n<h4>Manual Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Alternatively, install Access Watch via the plugin directory, or upload the files manually to your server and follow the on-screen instructions. If you need additional help <a href=\"https://access.watch/wordpress/manual\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">read our step by step instructions</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Who&#8217;s behind Access Watch?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Access Watch service is operated by “Access Watch Technologies GmbH”, a company based in Berlin (Germany) with an international team. Our servers are also currently located in Germany, so is your data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After each HTTP request on your WordPress website, the metadata are logged to the Access Watch service. The data sent is commonly named “Access Logs”, it contains things like the client IP Address, the HTTP Method, the HTTP Headers and the URL.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, a free version of Access Watch will always be available for the community! The free plan allows users to connect 1 website and processes up to 100,000 requests each month. If you would like to use Access Watch for multiple websites or a higher volume of requests we also offer paid plans to suit your needs, starting at just €19 per month. More information can be found on <a href=\"https://access.watch/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our pricing page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about performance?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, Access Watch is caching data in your website MySQL database using the &#8220;Transients API&#8221; from WordPress. While it works well for most websites, for demanding websites we suggest using an alternate WordPress object cache, such as the one provided by the &#8220;W3 Total Cache&#8221; plugin. Please let us know if there is any issue or if you need help!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
