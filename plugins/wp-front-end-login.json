Feedback is welcome for any success or failures with other login plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are all the login styles and scripts loaded?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin only loads the admin forms css, not the complete login css collection. This seems to work well with most themes during testing.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
