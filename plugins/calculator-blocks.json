However if you want to create your own custom widgets and/or upload your own spreadsheets you will need to create an account. Be sure to create an <a href=\"https://excelkits.com/account/api-keys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API Key</a> and add it to your Excelkits settings in your WordPress admin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://excelkits.com/signup?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&amp;utm_campaign=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=marketplaces\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">You can create your account here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20calculator%20blocks%20work%20exactly%3F'>\nHow Do Calculator Blocks Work Exactly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple, first you <a href=\"https://excelkits.com/signup?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&amp;utm_campaign=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=marketplaces\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sign up for Excelkits</a> and select a starter template. Upload your own spreadsheet and customize the results.  When you are ready, create your <a href=\"https://excelkits.com/account/api-keys\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Excelkits API Key</a> then add it to your WordPress Excelkits settings menu in the admin.  You should then see your custom widget selectable within the Gutenberg editor&#8217;s calculator block.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20my%20excel%2Fgoogle%20sheets%2Fetc%3F'>\nWill It Work With My Excel/Google Sheets/Etc?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Download your sheet as an XLS or XLSX file and upload that file within Excelkits. You can then select your spreadsheet data just as you do for charts and graphs in your favorite spreadsheet software. Be aware not all functions you use may be supported, generally we support functions defined by the <a href=\"https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/os/part4-formula/OpenDocument-v1.3-os-part4-formula.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenDocument Format</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20on%20mobile%3F'>\nDoes It Work On Mobile?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. All layouts are designed for the needs of mobile users first, expanding elegantly as more screen space becomes available.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='deos%20it%20work%20with%20page%20builders%3F'>\nDeos It Work With Page Builders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The Calculator Blocks plugin is for the WordPress Gutenberg editor and is not compatible with 3rd party page builders such as Elementor and Divi. However Excelkits will still work on these platforms. Simply copy the HTML snippets from the Excelkits editor and paste them into your page builder of choice as custom HTML.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20it%20integrate%20with%20my%20wordpress%20database%3F'>\nCan It Integrate With My WordPress Database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Although currently, it takes a little technical ability in order to integrate it.  Reach out to Excelkits tech support for more details on setting this up.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%3F'>\nHow Much Does It Cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s free.  However, if you’d like access premium features or support for a large number of widgets you’ll have to purchase a subscription.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
