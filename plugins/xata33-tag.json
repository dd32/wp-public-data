If you don&#8217;t like how plugin automatically displays tags and tag cloud, you may output it manually. Just insert this code in template file for displaying tag cloud: </p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>for displaying tags associated with some post.</p>\n<p>Tag&#8217;s size and color calculations are based on percent of posts, associated with this tag.</p>\n"
