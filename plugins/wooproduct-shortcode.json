It was built with the intention of creating lists of recommended products.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work for any shopping cart?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this shortcode works exclusively with WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I paste my product SKU or ID into the shortcode and nothing shows up! Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to be careful copying and pasting numbers from your product list into your page editor. Sometimes it can also copy over colors and formatting code (HTML) that will break the shortcode. If you&#8217;re having trouble with a code, try highlighting the shortcode and clicking &#8220;Remove Formatting&#8221;, then save your post again.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
