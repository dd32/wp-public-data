The difference is that this plugin provides more options for how you export your data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin replace the built-in export tool?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No &#8211; it adds a secondary export page that you can use instead of WordPress&#8217; built-in one. However, if you would like to hide the built-in export tool from the menu simply add this code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file: <code>add_filter('export_plus_hide_export', '__return_true');</code>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
