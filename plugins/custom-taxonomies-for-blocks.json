Sites using custom taxonomies that were created prior to this likely do not have this property set. Additionally, the default value for &#8220;show_in_rest&#8221; is <em>&#8220;false&#8221;</em> (this is poorly documented), ergo older custom taxonomies will not appear in the WordPress block editor interface.</p>\n<p>This plugin will take any custom taxonomy where the &#8220;show_in_rest&#8221; feature is set to &#8220;false&#8221; and change it to &#8220;true&#8221;. It will <em>not</em> add any additional REST properties, such as &#8220;rest_base&#8221; or &#8220;rest_controller_class&#8221;.

Doing so will enable older custom taxonomies to be accessed in the WordPress block editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any settings for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at present, but a later version of this plugin will allow site administrators to choose which custom taxonomies they want to enable for the block editor interface.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with the Classic Editor plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">Classic Editor</a> plugin disables the WordPress block editor completely, there is no need for this plugin if Classic Editor is installed and activated.</p>\n<p>If Classic Editor is installed and activated, this plugin will not run.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
