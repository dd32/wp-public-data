        "faq": "\n<h4>What is bitcoin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. No one controls it. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros – they’re produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why bitcoin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s cheap</p>\n<p>With credit card transactions, your merchant account bills you on a per-transaction basis. Some merchant accounts will charge a fee for debit card transactions, as you have to pay a ‘swipe fee’. Bitcoin transaction fees are minimal, or in some cases free.</p>\n<p>It’s as private as you want it to be</p>\n<p>Sometimes, we don’t want people knowing what we have purchased. Bitcoin is a relatively private currency. On the one hand, it is transparent – thanks to the blockchain, everyone knows how much a particular bitcoin address holds in transactions. They know where those transactions came from, and where they’re sent. On the other hand, unlike conventional bank accounts, no one knows who holds a particular bitcoin address.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to trust anyone else</p>\n<p>In a conventional banking system, you have to trust people to handle your money properly along the way. You have to trust the bank, for example. You might have to trust a third-party payment processor. You’ll often have to trust the merchant too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/information/why-use-bitcoin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More on why bitcion is an important payment layer here</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why adblockers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are in a macro environment in which publishers are openly wondering where their revenues are going to come from in 20 years.  On a micro scale, there has been a lot of ink (and bits) spilled about the resounding need for change in the ad and publishing space <em>today</em>.  Some analysis’ have shown that 9.26% of impressions were found to be ad-blocked, with some sites reaching as high as 50%  While there is innovation happening in online payments, no one has yet connected the dots in a meaningful way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why Block Ads to Bitcoin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Block Ads to Bitcoin is a free and easy way to monetize ad space that is unused due to adblockers.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much can I expect to monetize with Block Ads to Bitcoin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen CPMs of over $2.00.
