Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-log-queries/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-first-comment-redirect/</a> .
