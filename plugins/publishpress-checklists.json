With PublishPress Checklists, you can choose pre-publishing requirements for your content. Using PublishPress Checklists, you define tasks that must be completed before content is published.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s show you a few possible options for your posts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your posts have a minimum or maximum number of words.</li>\n<li>Require your posts have a featured image.</li>\n<li>Check for any broken links.</li>\n<li>Force authors to use a specific number of Tags or Categories.</li>\n<li>Require posts to be approved by a user in a specific role.</li>\n<li>Use OpenAI to scan your content and make sure it uses good grammar or the correct tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next to every post and page, writers see a checklist box, showing the tasks they need to complete. Tasks can either be recommended or required. As authors complete each task, the red X automatically turns to a green checkmark.</p>\n<p>PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use OpenAI technology to scan your posts and check for the right tone, good spelling, or correct grammar.</p>\n<h3>PublishPress Checklists Pro</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Checklists Pro</strong><br />\n  This plugin is the free version of the Checklists Pro plugin that comes with all the features you need to set standards for your WordPress content. <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/checklists\" title=\"Checklists Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to purchase the best premium WordPress checklists plugin now!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>You Can Set These Checklist Requirements</h3>\n<p>Each task on your pre-publish checklist can be configured to meet your site’s needs. You can also set maximum and minimum values.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/checklists-started/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read the Getting Started guide for PublishPress Checklists</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the default tasks you can use on your checklists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Title</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of characters</li>\n<li><strong>Body text</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of words</li>\n<li><strong>Categories</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of categories</li>\n<li><strong>Tags</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of tags</li>\n<li><strong>Taxonomy terms</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of terms</li>\n<li><strong>Excerpt</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of characters</li>\n<li><strong>Internal links</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of internal links</li>\n<li><strong>External links</strong>: Maximum or minimum number of external links</li>\n<li><strong>Featured image</strong>: Require a featured image</li>\n<li><strong>Featured image size (Pro version)</strong>: Require a maximum and minimum height and width for featured images</li>\n<li><strong>ALT text</strong>: Require ALT text for all images</li>\n<li><strong>Broken links</strong>: Check that all links use a valid format</li>\n<li><strong>Permalink</strong>: Control the characters in the URL</li>\n<li><strong>User approval</strong>: Require that posts are approved by users in a specific role</li>\n<li><strong>Yoast SEO</strong>: Require that posts get Yoast SEO approval</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can configure each requirement, depending on whether you want to require writers to complete the tasks. Here are the three options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabled</li>\n<li>Recommended</li>\n<li>Required</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you choose the “Required” option, it will be impossible to publish without completing the task.</p>\n<h3>OpenAI Checklist Requirements</h3>\n<p>PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use prompts to analyze your content. If OpenAI decides that your content doesn&#8217;t meet the requirements, it will show the task as incomplete.</p>\n<p>You can create checklist requirements like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Is the content clear and easy to read?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Is this content tone professional?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Does this article use correct grammar?&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OpenAI will scan your content and given a detailed verdict. This is an excellent way to catch errors and improve your content before publishing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see how to create OpenAI requirements</a>.</p>\n<h3>You Can Create New Checklist Requirements</h3>\n<p>You can create new requirements for your checklists by clicking the “Add custom task” link. For example, you can require authors to get a green Yoast sign, or force them to run a spell-check before publishing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see how to create custom requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to create more powerful requirements using a custom plugin. We have created a sample plugin to show how to do this. The sample plugin will automatically check that your site’s authors have included a specific word in their main content. If this new requirement is enabled, it will automatically search the text of your content to make sure it contains the word you choose.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version: Checklists for WooCommerce Products</h3>\n<p>The Pro version of PublishPress Checklists has support for WooCommerce.

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/checklists/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PublishPress Checklists</a> is the best plugin to make sure your content is ready to go live. With PublishPress Checklists, you can choose pre-publishing requirements for your content. Using PublishPress Checklists, you define tasks that must be completed before content is published.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s show you a few possible options for your posts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your posts have a minimum or maximum number of words.</li>\n<li>Require your posts have a featured image.</li>\n<li>Check for any broken links.</li>\n<li>Force authors to use a specific number of Tags or Categories.</li>\n<li>Require posts to be approved by a user in a specific role.</li>\n<li>Use OpenAI to scan your content and make sure it uses good grammar or the correct tone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next to every post and page, writers see a checklist box, showing the tasks they need to complete. Tasks can either be recommended or required. As authors complete each task, the red X automatically turns to a green checkmark.</p>\n<p>PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use OpenAI technology to scan your posts and check for the right tone, good spelling, or correct grammar.</p>\n<h3>PublishPress Checklists Pro</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Checklists Pro</strong><br />\n  This plugin is the free version of the Checklists Pro plugin that comes with all the features you need to set standards for your WordPress content. <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/checklists\" title=\"Checklists Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to purchase the best premium WordPress checklists plugin now!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>You Can Set These Checklist Requirements</h3>\n<p>Each task on your pre-publish checklist can be configured to meet your site’s needs.

Here are the three options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disabled</li>\n<li>Recommended</li>\n<li>Required</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you choose the “Required” option, it will be impossible to publish without completing the task.</p>\n<h3>OpenAI Checklist Requirements</h3>\n<p>PublishPress Checklists integrates with OpenAI. You can use prompts to analyze your content. If OpenAI decides that your content doesn&#8217;t meet the requirements, it will show the task as incomplete.</p>\n<p>You can create checklist requirements like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Is the content clear and easy to read?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Is this content tone professional?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Does this article use correct grammar?&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OpenAI will scan your content and given a detailed verdict. This is an excellent way to catch errors and improve your content before publishing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/custom-requirements-checklist/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see how to create OpenAI requirements</a>.</p>\n<h3>You Can Create New Checklist Requirements</h3>\n<p>You can create new requirements for your checklists by clicking the “Add custom task” link.
