Additional instructions about manual installation of plugins can be found <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Setup</h4>\n<p>To complete the installation process, you need to configure the Sheepy plugin with relevant API credentials.</p>\n<p>Log in to your Sheepy account -&gt; Go to the Integration -&gt; <a href=\"https://www.sheepy.com/integration/api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API Integration</a> section and click the &#8220;Add New API Token&#8221; button. You will be provided with a pair of API Key and Secret Key. Write them down so you don&#8217;t lose them. The Secret Key is displayed only once when the token is created. Then click the &#8220;Save&#8221; button. You can configure the remaining parameters of the token later.</p>\n<p>In addition, you need to get a Notification Secret Key to sign notifications that will be sent to your store upon receipt of payment. To get it, go to the Integration -&gt; Integration Profile -&gt; Webhooks section, click the &#8220;Reveal Secret Key&#8221; button at the bottom of the form, and apply the settings by clicking the &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; button.</p>\n<p>In the WordPress admin panel, go to WooCommerce tab -&gt; Settings -&gt; Payments -&gt; Manage. Enter the API access details obtained earlier and click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button.</p>\n",
