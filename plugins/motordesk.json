Please ensure you maintain a separate backup of your /template_custom/ directory in case of upgrade failures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively you can maintain the template files in another location in which case you can set the path to your templates directory below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can include the search form and latest vehicles in other pages of your website using the shortcodes [MOTORDESK-SEARCH] and [MOTORDESK-LATEST].</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
