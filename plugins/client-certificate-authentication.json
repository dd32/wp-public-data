By limiting login and registration to users providing a client certificate, bots are locked out and spam is eliminated.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements:  This plugin is based on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/http-authentication/\" title=\"HTTP Authentication plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">HTTP Authentication plugin</a> by Daniel Westermann-Clark.
