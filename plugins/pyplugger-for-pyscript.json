PyScript aims to give users a first-class programming language that has consistent styling rules, is more expressive, and is easier to learn.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about PyScript at: (https://pyscript.net/)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20pyplugger%20for%20pyscript%3F'>\nHow do I use the PyPlugger for PyScript?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once activated, go to any page or post and enter Pythonic commands between the following PyScript tags as HTML content:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;py-script&gt; &lt;/py-script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, to print a &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; statement, you would enter the following as html content:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;py-script&gt; print('Hello World!') &lt;/py-script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>An additional feature to create an REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop component can be rendered by using the following tag:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;py-repl&gt; &lt;/py-repl&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, on the end-user page, enter data for evaluation and then press SHIFT+ENTER to compute.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20or%20the%20pyplugger%20for%20pyscript%20plugin%20associated%20with%20the%20official%20pyscript%20organization%3F'>\nAre you or the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin associated with the official PyScript Organization?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, neither I nor the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin are associated with the official PyScript Organization nor any of its&#8217; parent companies, sister companies, nor subsidiaries which may include Pyodide or Anaconda Inc.</p>\n<p>I developed the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin in adherence to the PyScript&#8217;s Organization&#8217;s governance policy for use of its&#8217; trademark and open-source license, which can be found on their GitHub repository at the following link: (https://github.com/pyscript/governance)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20develop%20the%20pyplugger%20for%20pyscript%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you develop the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I developed the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin out of curiosity. I love a challenge and wanted to see if it would work on one of my websites as this is the very first plugin I&#8217;ve ever developed for WordPress. I also wanted to make it available free of charge as I am excited about learning Python and PHP, and I would like to contribute to the software development community beyond Twitter and GitHub. As a newbie freelance software developer, I thought this would also be a great opportunity to add experience to my resume by publishing a plugin to the mostly widely used content management system in the world, one that I&#8217;ve used for almost a decade as a hobbyist Web Administrator and Front-End Web Developer, which is WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20you%20a%20donation%3F'>\nCan I send you a donation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I thought you&#8217;d never ask, and you most certainly can! I would be honored to accept your donation to further my learning experience in Software Development. Please use the following link for your generous offer, and I humbly thank you with great joy in advance:<br />\n(https://technocannon.com/donate)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20uninstall%20the%20pyplugger%20for%20pyscript%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to uninstall the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry you are unsatisfied with the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin.</p>\n<p>Simply deactivate and delete the plugin.</p>\n<p>I also ask that you leave some feedback if you can spare the time so I can learn how to improve the PyPlugger for PyScript plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
