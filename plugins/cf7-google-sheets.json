All instructions are provided in the <strong>Settings</strong> screen.</p>\n<p>After successfully creating application credentials and uploading them (i.e. completing steps 1 and 2), you will see <em>Client ID</em> and <em>Client Email</em> that represent your instance of &#8220;Google Sheets for Contact Form 7&#8221; plugin. You will need to share your sheets with <em>Client Email</em> (as <em>Editor</em> role) to grant &#8220;Google Sheets for Contact Form 7&#8221; plugin permissions to edit them.</p>\n<h4>Using the Plugin</h4>\n<p>After successfully connecting the plugin to Google Sheets, do the following to configure your Contact Form 7 to send data to Google Sheets on form submission.</p>\n<p><em>In Google Sheets</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a new Google Sheet</li>\n<li>Switch to the tab where you want to capture the data</li>\n<li>\n<p>Determine <em>Sheet ID</em> and <em>Tab ID</em> from the sheet&#8217;s URL that looks as follows: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<em>sheet-id</em>/edit#gid=<em>tab-id</em></p>\n<p>For example, for URL https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/142XLjqRCpr7iWldfARhSS_GiFoy4l5RqZfSD6RHXM64/edit#gid=0 <em>Sheet ID</em> is &#8220;142XLjqRCpr7iWldfARhSS_GiFoy4l5RqZfSD6RHXM64&#8221; and <em>Tab ID</em> is &#8220;0&#8221;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter &#8220;datetime&#8221; in the the first column if you want to capture time and date of submission</p>\n</li>\n<li>There is no need to enter names for other columns &#8211; they will be automatically added upon form submission</li>\n<li>Share the sheet with <em>Client Email</em> that represents your instance of &#8220;Google Sheets for Contact Form 7&#8221; plugin &#8211; as <em>Editor</em> role</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>In Contact Form 7</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open your contact form</li>\n<li>Switch to <strong>Google Sheets</strong> tab</li>\n<li>Configure <em>Sheet ID</em> and <em>Tab ID</em> and click <em>Save</em></li>\n<li>Submit a test form and verify that the data shows up in your Google Sheet</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic Header Generation</h4>\n<p>The plugin verifies spreadsheet header on each new form submission and adds new fields to it if needed. Note that it never deletes fields from the header &#8211; as this would also delete some submission data &#8211; though you can do it manually. You may also manually reorder columns as you wish.</p>\n<h4>Capturing Submission Metadata</h4>\n<p>In addition to the <em>datetime</em> and regular form fields, you may also capture Contact Form 7 <a href=\"https://contactform7.com/special-mail-tags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">special mail-tags</a>. In order to do so, add <em>manually</em> corresponding headers to your spreadsheet. Remove square brackets and first underscore from the tag name, and replace remaining underscores with dashes. For example, add <em>remote-ip</em> header to capture <em>[_remote_ip]</em> mail-tag.</p>\n<h4>Integration with &#8220;Contact Form 7 Database Addon &#8211; CFDB7&#8221;</h4>\n<p>If you use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-cfdb7/\" rel=\"ugc\">Contact Form 7 Database Addon &#8211; CFDB7</a> to save your submissions, you will also be able to resend already submitted forms to Google Sheets. This may be useful if something went wrong during initial form submission and/or someone deleted data in Google Sheets by mistake. In order to do so, in CFDB7 plugin, choose your form, open specific submission and click <em>Send to Google Sheets</em> button.</p>\n<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>\n<p>Initial version of this plugin was inspired by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cf7-google-sheets-connector/\" rel=\"ugc\">CF7 Google Sheets Connector</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>However it&#8217;s implementation is quite different:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it uses service principle for authentication with Google Sheets</li>\n<li>it has completely different and much more reliable sheets update logic</li>\n<li>it implements automatic header generation, to ensure that no submission data is lost</li>\n<li>it supports capturing submission meta-data</li>\n<li>it provides integration with CFDB7 plugin for forms re-submission</li>\n</ul>\n",
