No options page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope, you simply upload and activate it; and the plugin do the rest&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So, how can I use this plugin&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using a shortcode:</p>\n<pre><code>To show a filter of course categories names, followed by a two-column grid of all the courses:\n    [xtraslms_portfolio]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This shortcode has many arguments; which self-explanatory names.<br />\n &#8216;tax&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;cat&#8217;, //&#8217;tag&#8217; or &#8216;cat&#8217;</p>\n<pre><code>    'progress' =&gt; 1,\n    'my' =&gt; 1,\n    'q' =&gt; -1, //quantity\n\n    'iclass' =&gt; 'thumbnail'\n</code></pre>\n<p>The main argument is SHOW, it decides what to show. It has one of these values: f (for shows only filter), p (for shows only the portfolio of courses), a (for show the authors, it means, the professors), and al (for shows a list of courses per professor). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>    To show only a filter:\n    [xtraslms_portfolio show=\"f\"]\n\n    To show only a portfolio of courses (it means, image and title) as well as the name of the professor:\n    [xtraslms_portfolio show=\"p,a\"]\n\n    To show only a portfolio of the image and name of professors:\n    [xtraslms_portfolio show=\"a\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can apply a class to the images, using the argument  ICLASS (its value is &#8216;thumbnail&#8217; by default).</p>\n<p>You can decide how many columns in the grid (from 1 to 5) with the argument COLS; and how many courses to show, with the argument Q; and the order, using the argument ORDERBY, which has the values &#8216;modified&#8217; or &#8216;rand&#8217;. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>    To show one course, randomly:\n    [xtraslms_portfolio show=\"p\" q=\"1\" orderby=\"rand\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Back into the filter, you can filter by categories or by tags, using the argument TAX (which can take &#8216;cat&#8217; or &#8216;tax&#8217; value.</p>\n<p>** to be continued **</p>\n</p>\n\n",
