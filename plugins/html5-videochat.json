        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Make sure to enable the <code>allow_url_fopen</code> and <code>opcache</code> options in the php.ini configuration file to ensure proper PHP environment functionality.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin. Upon activation, an account will be automatically created on <a href=\"https://www.html5-videochat.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.html5-videochat.com/</a>, and login credentials will be sent to your email address.</li>\n<li>Upon activation, you will automatically receive your password via email.</li>\n<li>Insert the <code>[HTML5VIDEOCHAT width=100% height=640px]</code> shortcode into your page or post.</li>\n<li>To make the chat fullscreen, use <code>height=fullscreen</code>. Example: <code>[HTML5VIDEOCHAT width=100% height=fullscreen]</code></li>\n<li>The chat requires users to specify their gender, as it distinguishes between males, females, or couples. By default, WordPress does not include a user gender field in the profile fields. Therefore, we recommend installing the BuddyPress plugin available at <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://it.wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/</a>. Once installed, please refer to the tutorial on how to manage gender fields at the following link: <a href=\"https://www.html5-videochat.com/index.php?/blogs/entry/52-to-properly-add-the-plugin-to-your-wordpress-site-follow-these-steps/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.html5-videochat.com/index.php?/blogs/entry/52-to-properly-add-the-plugin-to-your-wordpress-site-follow-these-steps/</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
