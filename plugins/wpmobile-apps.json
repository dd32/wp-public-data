By default, it will set the default settings in your WordPress local<br />\n(e.g. en_US). If you use a multi-lingual site with a plugin (such as mqTranslate) you have to enter<br />\nthe corresponding text in the App settings.

You will need to put ?theme=active to<br />\nswitch back to your current theme or simply delete your cookies.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to disable the mobile theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the Theme Activation submenu of the plugin, choose the theme you want to use for mobile devices (i.e. tablet, smartphone).<br />\nYou can use your current theme for example.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to disable the Apps?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the general settings of the Apps configuration, choose to disable the Apps. This will not load them<br />\non your website at all.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to use the Apps also in desktop browsers such as Chrome?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the enable Apps in desktop option in the Apps configuration panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to change the CSS styles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a file for this /core/css/app-panel-custom.css. Apply your custom styles there.
