        "description": "<h3>Sell digital products on WordPress</h3>\n<p>If you want to sell digital products on WordPress today, it’s going to take a lot of tools, time, and effort to get something off the ground. Even if you have a simple product, it will often require bloated plugins to launch a store and start making sales.</p>\n<p><strong>That is, until now.</strong> <a href=\"https://lemonsqueezy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lemon Squeezy</a> is our fresh take on digital commerce. Lemon Squeezy is focused on helping creators sell their digital products — everything from digital downloads (eBooks, PDFs, design assets, photos, audio, and videos), subscriptions, and software licenses — without the hassle. The ability to manage your products, customers, taxes and VAT, discounts, email lists, and more is all perfectly packaged into every Lemon Squeezy store.</p>\n<p>Our all-in-one, no-code platform is everything you need to start making money with your digital products. It’s blazing fast, super secure, and beautifully-designed with <strong>you</strong> in mind.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcFSb5EMiI0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Relax, we got you covered</h3>\n<p><strong>We’re also the merchant of record</strong>, which means we take responsibility and liability for payment methods, complicated tax laws, fraud prevention, subscription billing, invoicing, secure file delivery, and virtually every other complicated aspect of running an online store. We make it easy-peasy so you don’t have to think about any of it.</p>\n<p>The icing on the cake? Lemon Squeezy supports 95 different <a href=\"https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/payments/currencies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">currencies</a> and offers <a href=\"https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/getting-started/getting-paid\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">payouts</a> for over 280+ countries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When launching Iconic, Lemon Squeezy literally took care of everything. No need to think about taxes, VAT, license keys, etc. The setup really was easy-peasy. – James McDonald / iconic.app</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Powerful checkout pages, anywhere you want them</h3>\n<p>No e-commerce software on your WordPress site? No problem. Each Lemon Squeezy store comes with a blazing-fast, secure checkout page for each of your products. You can either send customers directly to your hosted checkout page, or you can bring the beautiful Lemon Squeezy checkout experience to your website with our Checkout Overlay feature.</p>\n<p>With Checkout Overlay, your customers can make purchases directly on your WordPress website, without installing any bloated e-commerce software.</p>\n<h3>Sell your software the easy way</h3>\n<p>Selling software and apps is a piece of cake with Lemon Squeezy. With our powerful software licensing and subscription features, you can control access to your software and charge customers a regular fee to continue accessing your product.</p>\n<h3>Why use Lemon Squeezy over WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads?</h3>\n<p>Glad you asked! Although these are powerful plugins, they both can be cumbersome to use, leaving WordPress creators to manage plugin updates, security, payments, taxes, customer accounts, extensions, and GDPR laws. On top of that, it can be difficult to manage customers, products, and orders via the often-crowded WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>We created Lemon Squeezy specifically so you don’t have to think about <em>any</em> of those headaches. Using the Lemon Squeezy app, you can launch your store, create &amp; market products, manage customers &amp; subscribers, and more – all within a beautifully-designed interface tailor made for digital products.</p>\n<p>When you’re ready to sell on your WordPress site, you simply install the Lemon Squeezy WordPress plugin and add your products to any post, page, or content area to start generating sales. Easy-peasy!</p>\n<h3>Auto Updates for your WordPress Themes and Plugins with Lemon Squeezy</h3>\n<p>Having the ability to release updates to your WordPress digital products is essential. This gives your customers the ability to get the latest features and bug fixes. When distributing your premium WordPress products, this is critical. Currently, this is very difficult to do, and few services are available to help you do it.</p>\n<p><strong>With Lemon Squeezy</strong>, these auto-updates are taken care of for you. The Lemon Squeezy team has worked hard to bring this advanced feature to our platform and it makes the entire process a breeze. With Lemon Squeezy, you’ll be able to sell your WordPress products, ship updates to paying customers and grow a thriving WordPress business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Check out our WordPress Plugin documentation</a> for more detailed information.</p>\n<h3>Ready to get started?</h3>\n<p>Let’s get you set up on Lemon Squeezy so you can start selling your products!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Head over to <a href=\"https://lemonsqueezy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lemon Squeezy</a> and pick a pricing plan.
