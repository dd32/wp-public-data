Note that page request information is only logged for users with the <code>manage_options</code> capability in the free version of this plugin.  The premium version logs page request information for all users regardless of their capability.</p>\n<p>By default the memory meter will be shown in the admin bar if you are logged in as user with the <code>manage_options</code> capability such as an administrator (the capability can be modified if required, see the configuration tab via the Memory Meter page).</p>\n<p>In this scenario you will see the meter in the admin bar at the top of your WordPress dashboard and the frontend of your website. Note that there is a user profile setting in WordPress to enable the admin bar, it is enabled by default, if this is not enabled you will not be able to view the memory meter in the admin bar.</p>\n<p>If you hover over the memory meter you will see a number of options, such as logs and configuration. In addition to the admin bar, a menu item is included in your WordPress dashboard to give access to the logs, confirguration, etc.</p>\n<p>Note that the memory meter doesn&#8217;t need to be displayed to ensure memory usage is logged, this is done regardless of whether the memory meter is being displayed.</p>\n<h4>Donate</h4>\n<p>If this product has helped you, please consider <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/ninetyninew\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">making a donation</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Before using this product, please ensure you review and accept our <a href=\"https://99w.co.uk/#terms-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">terms and conditions</a> and <a href=\"https://99w.co.uk/#privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">privacy policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Before using this product on a production website you should thoroughly test it on a staging/development environment, including all aspects of your website and potential data volumes, even if not directly related to the functionality the product provides.</p>\n<p>The same process should also be completed when updating any aspect of your website in future, such as performing installations/updates, making changes to any configuration, custom web development, etc.</p>\n<p>Always refer to the changelog before updating.</p>\n<h4>Installation</h4>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins-1\" rel=\"ugc\">this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updates</h4>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#updating-plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">this documentation</a>.</p>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 7.4.0</li>\n<li>WordPress 6.4.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>BETA Functionality</h4>\n<p>We may occasionally include BETA functionality, this is highlighted with a <code>(BETA)</code> label. Functionality with this label should be used with caution and is only recommended to be tested on a staging/development environment. The functionality is included so users can test the functionality/provide feedback before it becomes stable, at which point the <code>(BETA)</code> label will be removed. Note that there may be occasions where BETA functionality is determined unsuitable for use and removed entirely.</p>\n<h4>Caching</h4>\n<p>If you are using any form of caching then it is recommended that the cache lifespan/expiry should be set to 10 hours or less. This is recommended by most major caching solutions to avoid potential issues with WordPress nonces.</p>\n<h4>Screen Sizes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Frontend: Where elements may be displayed on the frontend they will fit within the screen width</li>\n<li>Backend: Where interfaces may be displayed it is recommended to use a desktop computer with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 or higher, for lower resolutions any interfaces will attempt to fit within the screen width but some elements may be close together and/or larger than the screen width</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translation</h4>\n<p>We generally recommend <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/\" rel=\"ugc\">Loco Translate</a> to translate and/or adapt text strings within this product.</p>\n<h4>Works With</h4>\n<p>Where we have explicitly stated this product works with another product, this should only be assumed accurate if you are using the version of the other product which was the latest at the time the latest version of this product was released. This is because, while usually unlikely, the other product may have changed functionality which effects this product.</p>\n",

If you want to change these default percentages you can use the <code>wpmm_memory_meter_memory_usage_percentage_warning</code> and <code>wpmm_memory_meter_memory_usage_percentage_bad</code> filter hooks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20can%20see%20the%20memory%20meter%2Fcan%20i%20make%20it%20visible%20to%20specific%20users%3F'>\nWho can see the memory meter/can I make it visible to specific users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The memory meter displays by default in the admin bar for any user with the <code>manage_options</code> capability, which is usually administrators. You can change the capability required to display the memory meter by using the <code>wpmm_memory_meter_capability</code> filter hook. Note that this filter hook does not effect memory usage logging, and the memory meter being displayed or not doesn&#8217;t effect memory usage logging.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20disable%20the%20memory%20meter%20colors%3F'>\nCan I disable the memory meter colors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can disable the colors using the <code>wpmm_memory_meter_memory_usage_colors</code> filter hook.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20disable%20logs%3F'>\nCan I disable logs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can disable the logs using the <code>wpmm_memory_meter_logs</code> filter hook.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
