        "installation": "<h4>1. Plugin Installation</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload plugin-folder to your &#8220;/wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins-menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>2. Plugin Setup</h4>\n<p>Scripts-Tab: Fill in the scripts you would like to execute<br />\nSettings-Tab: Choose your custom wording and styling</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20another%20cookie%20notice%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy another cookie notice plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many popular Cookie-Notice-Plugins will fail if you try to set them up together with server-side caching plugins. That is because they check the opt-in cookie in PHP, which will be cached. This plugin works differently, since the whole logic happens in JavaScript. So everything can be cached server-side without any troubles for the opt-in process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20settings%3F'>\nWhere are the settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Look for &#8220;Cookie-Optin &amp; JS&#8221; in your Settings-Tab in the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20so%20many%20input%20fields%3F'>\nWhy so many input fields?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin will put your JavaScript code into the  or  section of your website. For each section you can decide if you want to have code there all the time or only after opt-in. So this can be used as an all-in-one solution for placing website-wide JavaScript used for tracking and so on in your website. Since this is done after page load it will also have a good impact on website speed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20place%20inline%20javascript%20or%20html'>\nIs it possible to place inline JavaScript or HTML\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we provide a shortcode for that which enables the same functionality as for the head or body scripts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20revoke%20the%20decision%20from%20the%20cookie%20banner%3F'>\nIs it possible to revoke the decision from the cookie banner?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we provide a shortcode which will display a button to revoke. Additionally, you can define the name of cookies which you want to unset when a user clicks this revoke button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20multilingual%20sites%3F'>\nWhat about multilingual sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>So far we only support polylang. If you use polylang, you can translate the strings which will be visible in the banner in the &#8220;Strings translations&#8221; settings from polylang. If you use any other plugin or want to change texts and settings programmatically, you can use actions and filters like described in our <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/falkemedia/Caching-Compatible-Cookie-Opt-In-and-JavaScript-4375c9b364b04b51bbd396e1514f105b\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20further%20questions%3F'>\nDo you have further questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will do our best to answer them in the support threads.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
