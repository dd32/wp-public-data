        "faq": "<p>For all frequently asked questions, and their answers, check the <a href=\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/docs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MonsterInsights Docs</a>.</p>\n\n<dt id='why%20use%20google%20analytics%20vs%20wordpress%20stats%3F'>\nWhy use Google Analytics vs WordPress stats?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Native WordPress stats plugins will always slow down your website because they rely on your WordPress hosting server. Most of them do not provide accurate WordPress analytics either.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress stats plugins use third-party servers to mitigate this issue, but they all lack powerful features that Google Analytics can offer.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics is the #1 analytics solution in the world. It comes with all the powerful features that you can ever ask for. MonsterInsights makes it easy for you to use all advanced Google Analytics features in WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20choose%20google%20analytics%20by%20monsterinsights%20vs%20google%20site%20kit%3F'>\nWhy choose Google Analytics by MonsterInsights vs Google Site Kit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The MonsterInsights Google Analytics plugin is built for all types of websites, large or small, to get up and running quickly with Google Analytics and Google Analytics 4.</p>\n<p>Beyond simply providing a Google Analytics dashboard, our plugin makes configuring advanced features as easy as point-and-click that would otherwise still require a developer to implement.</p>\n<p>Our Google Analytics plugin also includes many features such as Google Ads tracking, Google Optimize support, form conversion reporting, goal tracking, Search Console integration, Pagespeed insights, advanced eCommerce tracking, and more.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a reason over 3 million users have trusted MonsterInsights to provide Google Analytics data to their website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20monsterinsights%20together%20with%20another%20google%20analytics%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I use MonsterInsights together with another Google Analytics plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You should only use one Google Analytics plugin on your WordPress site. If you use multiple Google Analytics plugins, then you will compromise your data integrity.</p>\n<p>We recommend uninstalling other Google Analytics plugins before you install MonsterInsights.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20monsterinsights%20load%20google%20analytics%20in%20wordpress%20header%20section%3F'>\nWhy does MonsterInsights load Google Analytics in WordPress header section?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some people believe that loading Google Analytics in WordPress header will slow down your website. That&#8217;s a myth. The Analytics code loads asynchronously which means that it does not impact your website speed at all.</p>\n<p>MonsterInsights loads code in WordPress header because it makes sure that you have the most accurate tracking.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20monsterinsights%20work%20with%20ad%20blockers%3F'>\nDoes MonsterInsights work with ad blockers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 7.18, Pro users of MontersInsights can use a locally hosted version of Google Analytics (gtag) which helps with tracking data accuracy. This version can also improve the performance of your website, compared to hosting the script on Google Analytics servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20hide%20google%20analytics%20from%20tracking%20administrators%20and%20editors%3F'>\nCan I hide Google Analytics from tracking Administrators and Editors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By default we do not send data to Google Analytics for logged-in WordPress administrators and editors. You can add easily <a href=\"//www.monsterinsights.com/docs/exclude-user-roles-from-google-analytics-tracking\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">block additional user roles</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20monsterinsights%20help%20with%20google%20analytics%20gdpr%20compliance%3F'>\nHow does MonsterInsights help with Google Analytics GDPR compliance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>MonsterInsights helps make Google Analytics GDPR compliance easier for business owners.</p>\n<p>Our EU compliance addon allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anonymize IPs to Google Analytics</li>\n<li>Disable the Demographics and Interest Reports for Remarketing and Advertising</li>\n<li>Disable UserID and author name tracking</li>\n<li>Integrate with Cookie Notice and CookieBot plugins to collect user consent before tracking</li>\n<li>Integrate with Google AMP Consent Box before enable tracking</li>\n<li>Integrate with Google Analytics Chrome browser opt-out extension and built-in cookie opt-out system</li>\n<li>Offer Easy Opt Out link for Google Analytics tracking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While no single plugin can guarantee 100% GDPR compliance in WordPress, MonsterInsights goes to great lengths in helping business owners with GDPR compliance.</p>\n<p>For more details, see: <a href=\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/gdpr-and-monsterinsights-everything-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">GDPR and MonsterInsights &#8211; Everything You Need to Know</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20ecommerce%20plugins%20are%20compatible%20with%20monsterinsights%20enhanced%20ecommerce%20tracking%20feature%3F'>\nWhich eCommerce plugins are compatible with MonsterInsights Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking feature?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are looking to enable Google Analytics Ecommerce tracking in WordPress, then MonsterInsights is the best solution to do that.</p>\n<p>With just 1-click, you can enable Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking for WooCommerce and see WooCommerce analytics report right inside your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>MonsterInsights Enhanced eCommerce tracking works out of the box with WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, MemberPress and 10+ other advanced integrations.
