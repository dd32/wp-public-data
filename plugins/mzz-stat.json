Then in the WordPress admin area, in the Dashboard menu under Tools &gt; Mzz-stat, a page shows a report of these statistics, including a count of how many URI (page/post) views per day. Thus by looking at the statistics page the WordPress administrator can know whether anyone is visiting their site, and, how many uri requests were made on which page on which day.</p>\n<p><strong>How the Mzz-stat plugin works</strong><br />\nUpon installing and activating the Mzz-stat plugin, it installs its own table in the WordPress database alongside the other database tables. The plugin logic hooks into the wp_footer action hook, and each time someone requests any page on the site, the plugin inserts a record of that visit into the database table. Then, at any time the WordPress Administrator can go to the Admin page and see the report in the Dashboard menu under Tools &gt; Mzz-stat menu. There will be a list of each page visited (for a time period) along with a count of how many visits for that page per day. If one deactivates the plugin, it will no longer insert records of uri requests unless/until the plugin is again activated. If one deletes the plugin then that will completely uninstall the plugin and remove the files, database table, and data.</p>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>Thanks to CrazyStat ( http://www.christosoft.de/CrazyStat ) for inspiring me and thanks to this discussion: ( https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stats-plugin-8 ) for helping steer the direction of the plugin.</p>\n",

More on this: Just before the last mzz-stat plugin v.20160503.2046, there was a notable database table change. In other words if you want to do an upgrade that jumps from before to after plugin version no. 20160503.2046, then please hit version 20160503.2046 along the way, because it contained logic to perform the upgrade from the old table to the new table. This logic isn&#8217;t present in subsequent versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>20160503.2046</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added fix to address &#8230;Missing argument 1 for mzz_mzzstat_upgrade_migrate_db_v1_v2&#8230;bug</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>20160320.2203</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>20 March 2016 by mjjojo(mjassen)</li>\n<li>Extensive changes including the table schema and reporting format.</li>\n<li>Now stores in the database table one row per-page-per-month and has a field representing 31 days of that month.</li>\n<li>Now updates/increments the hit count for the given day in the database, instead of inserting a new record for each hit.</li>\n<li>Now tracks hits by the day &#8212; no longer records any record of the hh:mm:ss</li>\n<li>Includes logic to perform the upgrade from the old table to the new table, including migrating the data and deleting the old table.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>20151230.2238</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>30 December 2015 by mjjojo(mjassen)</li>\n<li>Changed what data is seen in the Admin page.
