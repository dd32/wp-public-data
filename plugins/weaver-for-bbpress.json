Unfortunately, sometimes they add features that don&#8217;t including styling that matches the rest of your forum, or doesn&#8217;t work will with some WP Themes. We&#8217;ve added integrated styling support for other plugins.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>bbPress Pencil Unread</strong>: We think the ability to know if posts have been read or not is essential. <strong>Turnkey bbPress</strong> adds color matched Unread indicators and makes the &#8220;Mark Unread&#8221; link a theme matched button at the top of forum lists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The essentials, all in one</h4>\n<p>The developer of this plugin also created the original and best options based WordPress theme: Weaver Xtreme. Weaver Xtreme has its own bbPress based support forum. In the process of running the support forum, we&#8217;ve found that the features included in this plugin are really essential for running a truly vibrant forum, especially one used for technical support.</p>\n<p><strong>Turnkey bbPress</strong> is small and efficient. Options are only loaded and used if individually enabled. No unnecessary code bloat!</p>\n<h4>Great Support</h4>\n<p>We do not support <strong>Turnkey bbPress</strong> on the default WordPress Support Forum. Instead, we support it only on our own <em>bbPress</em> based forum: <a href=\"//forum.weavertheme.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Weaver Support Forum</a>.</p>\n<p>It is easy to get started with <strong>Turnkey bbPress</strong>.
