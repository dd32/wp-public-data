This isn&#8217;t a common need.</p>\n<p>Arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$custom_field_key (string): The custom field key to be used by the plugin. By default this is &#8216;_stealth-publish&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Defines a custom meta key to be used by Stealth Publish.\n *\n * @param string $custom_field_key The default custom field key name.\n * @return string\n */\nfunction override_stealth_publish_key( $custom_field_key ) {\n    return '_my_custom_stealth-publish';\n}\nadd_filter( 'c2c_stealth_publish_meta_key', 'override_stealth_publish_key' );\n</code></pre>\n<h4>c2c_stealth_publish_silent (filter)</h4>\n<p>The &#8216;c2c_stealth_publish_silent&#8217; filter allows you to override whether the plugin also ensure the post gets published silently (i.e. without sending out pingbacks, tracbacks, and pings to update services).</p>\n<p>Arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$publish_silently (bool): Should stealth published posts also be published silently?

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want to stealth publish a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is probably the kind of thing that you would recognize the need for or you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s beneficial in instances where you want to publish new content without any fanfare and just want the post added to archive and category pages and its own permalink page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have the checkbox checked by default?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. See the Filters section (under Other Notes) and look for the example using the &#8216;c2c_stealth_publish_default&#8217; filter. You&#8217;ll have to put that code into a site-specific plugin or your active theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is the checkbox still present when editing a post that has already been published?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The checkbox is always present since it continues to have an effect on published posts, such as preventing the post from appearing on the front page or in feeds. You may, after publication, decide to not have the post be stealthy. In such a case, you can do so directly by editing the post and unchecking the checkbox; you do not need to change it back to a draft and then republish it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin know which posts are stealth published?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>(This is a developer-level question that doesn&#8217;t affect general users.) The plugin assigns a custom field of &#8220;_stealth-publish&#8221; with a value of &#8220;1&#8221; to indicate posts that are stealth published. Unless, of course, the name of the custom field was changed via use of the &#8216;c2c_stealth_publish_meta_key&#8217; filter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin include unit tests?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
