Can I change it back?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Go to Dashboard -&gt; Settings -&gt; JMIG Options. Check the box DO NOT allow jMIG to add any CSS that modifies your gallery or gallery items, then save.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The specified amount of columns in the gallery short code is not working. What&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using a fixed layout and/or want Masonry to respect the column count in the gallery shortcode, then go to Settings -&gt; Jmig options and make sure the box is checked and click save.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>All my thumbnails are the same size so they don&#8217;t stack. Can I fix this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It&#8217;s actually really easy. Go to the Dashboard -&gt; Settings -&gt; Media. Make sure &#8220;Crop thumbnail to exact dimensions (normally thumbnails are proportional)&#8221; is unchecked. You can also change the size of thumbnails as well. I like to set my thumbnail width between 150px and 250px, then set the height to 9999px. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"ugc\">Then install the Regenerate Images plugin</a> and run it. Now your gallery images will stack.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Also, removed the has_shortcode conditional since it feels like more and more people are putting the gallery shortcode in fields generated by ACF, Meta Fields, etc. Also, started setting up the plugin for multiple language support.
