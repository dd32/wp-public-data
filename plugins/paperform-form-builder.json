        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20this%20plugin%20do%3F'>\nWhat does this plugin do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin helps you embed forms created with <a href=\"https://paperform.co?utm_source=wordpress_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Paperform</a>. It provides a block for embedding forms via the Gutenberg editor, along with a shortcode for embedding Paperform forms &#8220;[paperform id=my-form-id]&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20paperform%20block%3F'>\nHow do I use the Paperform block?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy! Just follow the following steps.</p>\n<p>1) Insert the Paperform block<br />\nEither choose Paperform from under the embed section in the block menu, or type <code>/paperform</code> on a new line inside the Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>2) Copy and paste the form URL into the form URL box<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t have a form yet, you can create it at <a href=\"https://paperform.co/?utm_source=wordpress_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Paperform.co</a>.</p>\n<p>3) Your done! But you can configure more stuff if you want.</p>\n<p>There are some other options available in the block widget:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a popup button</li>\n<li>Turn on lazy loading (so the form only loads when it comes on screen)</li>\n<li>Show a spinner while the form is loading</li>\n<li>Disable automatic scrolling, or set an offset to account for fixed navigation bars on your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Save the post and check out your handy work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20paperform%20shortcode%3F'>\nHow do I use the Paperform shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple! Anywhere you can use a shortcode, simply type <code>[paperform my-form-name]</code> where &#8220;my-form-name&#8221; is part of the form URL before paperform.co. For example, if your form&#8217;s direct URL is https://newsletter.paperform.co, then the form&#8217;s ID would be &#8220;newsletter&#8221;. E.g. [paperform newsletter].</p>\n<p>Want to configure the embed? The embed supports a bunch of attributes to change the way the embed behaves. See https://paperform.co/help/articles/embed-forms for a full list of supported attributes. To add attributes to your shortcode, you can just add them before the closing &#8220;]&#8221;.</p>\n<p>For example, [paperform newsletter lazy=1 no-scroll=1].</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20paperform%20shortcode%20to%20embed%20a%20popup%20button%3F'>\nCan I use the Paperform shortcode to embed a popup button?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Follow the shortcode instructions above to embed the form, and then you can add the following additional attributes to turn it into a popup button.</p>\n<p>** popup-button **<br />\nThis will turn the embed into a button, that when clicked will open the form.</p>\n<p>** label **<br />\nThis will be the text displayed on the button</p>\n<p>** class **<br />\nAny additional CSS classes you would like to add to the form.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>[paperform newsletter popup-button=1 label=\"Show me the form please\" class=\"btn-default btn-lg\"]</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20paperform%20account%3F'>\nDo I need a Paperform account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can sign up for paperform at <a href=\"https://paperform.co/register?utm_source=wordpress_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Paperform.co</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20forms%20directly%20from%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I create forms directly from this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at this time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
