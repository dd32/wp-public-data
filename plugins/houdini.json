Save and view the page. Then using your mouse,<br />\nbegin selecting text, that text will soon disappear and be deselected with nothing to copy!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHoudini does not work with Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Google Chrome?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The disappearance of selected text feature works only with Internet Explorer. Using one of the above browser, when<br />\nyou select more than minimum characters defined in Admin|Settings|Houding page, that selection becomes unselected. Still annoyance to a content<br />\nstealer when they do not expect this feature!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
