How can i be sure that the job is not stuck?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The importer page uses and independent check to verify that the job is running and it does so at every page load, so if you see &#8216;Check is running&#8217; it means that all is going fine.<br />\nIf this check fails for more than a minute, you will see a red warning.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20see%20a%20red%20warning%20alerting%20me%20that%20the%20job%20is%20stuck.%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nI see a red warning alerting me that the job is stuck. What should i do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Something has stopped the running job. It may be a server side issue (for example your hosting not allowing long running tasks) or an error.<br />\nIn either case, you should cancel the job clicking on &#8216;Cancel job&#8217; and retry from start.
