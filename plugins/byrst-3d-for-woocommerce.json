It’s proven that 3D models can boost your conversion rate by 94%, because they let your customers see and experience your products in their own space with 3D and AR.</p>\n<p><strong>Byrst</strong> provides a complete solution for creating and publishing 3D models of your products. It consists of three components that work together on your WooCommerce site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>Byrst iOS app</strong> is the tool to create 3D models of your products from photos. You can take photos of your products from different angles and upload them to the Byrst Cloud Platform, where they are processed into 3D models. We offer the ability to create AIR Stickers and Full 3D Models. You can also edit and adjust your 3D models in the app to make sure they are oriented properly and at scale (so when customers view them in their spaces, the product will be lifesized).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>Byrst Cloud Platform</strong> allows you to process, manage and host your 3D models on our <strong>CDN</strong> (Content Delivery Network) which is a network of servers that ensures fast and reliable delivery of your 3D models to your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Byrst 3D for WooCommerce</strong> is a WordPress plugin that enables you to display your 3D models on your WooCommerce site. It integrates with the <strong>Byrst Cloud Platform</strong> to deliver and show your 3D models in <strong>3D and AR</strong> on your product pages. Your customers can interact with them and see how they fit in their space.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to create 3D models with Byrst</h3>\n<p>Creating 3D models is easy and fun with the Byrst iOS app. You can pick one of the two options to do so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AIR Stickers:</strong> This is the fastest and easiest way to create an AR experience from a single photo. Just snap a photo of your product, and our AI will automatically remove the background and generate a 3D model. You can then scale the 3D model to match the real size of your product and show it in AR at scale, so your customers can see how it fits in their space. The 3D model will have a fixed view angle, which is the same as the photo you took.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full 3D Model:</strong> This is a more advanced way to create a detailed and realistic 3D model from multiple photos. You take photos of an item from many different angles, and our platform creates a hi-res, lifelike 3D model that you can spin and view from all sides. You can also refer to our tutorials for more guidance on how to take photos for Full 3D Models.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After creating your 3D models, activate them with the Byrst iOS app to publish them from the Byrst Cloud platform to your store. Your WooCommerce site can show your 3D models in AR at scale using the Byrst 3D for WooCommerce plugin. Byrst hosts your 3D models on our fast and reliable CDN.</p>\n<h3>How to display 3D models on your WooCommerce site</h3>\n<p>To use Byrst 3D for WooCommerce, you need to follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the <strong>Byrst 3D for WooCommerce plugin</strong> on your WordPress site</li>\n<li>Download the <strong>Byrst app</strong> from the <strong>iOS app store</strong> on your smartphone</li>\n<li><strong>Create and edit</strong> your 3D models using the Byrst app</li>\n<li><strong>Activate</strong> your 3D models on the Byrst Cloud platform using the Byrst app</li>\n<li><strong>Pair</strong> your Byrst app with the Byrst 3D for WooCommerce plugin</li>\n<li><strong>Configure</strong> your 3D model settings in the plugin dashboard</li>\n<li><strong>Add</strong> your 3D model to your WooCommerce product page</li>\n<li><strong>Preview and publish</strong> your product on your WooCommerce site with <strong>3D and AR</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why choose Byrst</h3>\n<p>Byrst is a turnkey solution that enables you to create and display 3D models of your products in 3D and AR on your WooCommerce site.
