To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”</p>\n<h4>MANUAL INSTALLATION</h4>\n<p>Manual installation method requires downloading the post 2 odt plugin and uploading it to your web server via your FTP application.</p>\n<h4>UPDATING</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work fine.

Images blocks are export to have your images in the odt file but the file are not included in the odt file. This is just a link. This is why the generated odt file is small.When you open the file, to show the image libreoffice download images.To permanently integrate the image files into the image file, you must break the links in the edit and external links menu.Be careful, integrating a large quantity of images can generate a very large file.<br />\nIn these cases we recommend creating several small files and then creating a master document. Consult LibreOffice help if necessary.</p>\n",
