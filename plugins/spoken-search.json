Currently, the basic version this plugin only supports Chrome browsers. To support the vast majority of browsers and devices, upgrade to the pro version of this plugin by <a href=\"https://www.plnia.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">purchasing a paid plan</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20upgrade%20to%20the%20pro%20version%20of%20spoken%20search%3F'>\nHow can I upgrade to the pro version of Spoken Search?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To upgrade to the pro version of this plugin, <a href=\"https://www.plnia.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">purchase a paid plan</a> and gain access to a valid API key. Enter the API key in Spoken Search settings in the admin area of your website to complete activation of the pro version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20chrome%20the%20only%20browser%20in%20the%20basic%20version%3F'>\nWhy is Chrome the only browser in the basic version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not all browsers <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">include the Speech Recognition API</a>. Chrome is the one browser that does currently include the Speech Recognition API most of the time. For visitors using non-Chrome browsers, the Spoken Search plugin must operate in a completely different way. This adds complexity and cost to adding voice search capability to a website. To offer voice search in all browsers, consider purchasing one of our affordable <a href=\"https://www.plnia.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">paid plans</a> to upgrade to the pro version of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20spoken%20search%20results%20displayed%20on%20the%20site%3F'>\nHow are Spoken Search results displayed on the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose to display Spoken Search results on your standard WordPress search results page, or you can choose to display the results in an overlay.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20a%20spoken%20search%20box%20to%20my%20site%3F'>\nHow do I add a Spoken Search box to my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose to include a Spoken Search widget and/or shortcode to allow users to search the site by voice.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20is%20my%20site%20does%20not%20currently%20have%20an%20ssl%20certificate%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin is my site does not currently have an SSL certificate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is highly recommended to have an SSL certificate in place and serve pages via HTTPS when using this plugin. The vast majority of modern browsers require a secure connection via HTTPS in order to allow use of the microphone. Because of this, a website that does not have an SSL certificate in place and does not serve HTTPS pages will not be able to make use of this plugin completely.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
