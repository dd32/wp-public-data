This is likely because on larger sites, this would take up vast amounts of server resources.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to simply re-upload any desired image from your library, then I would recommend using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" title=\"Regenerate Thumbnails\" rel=\"ugc\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin (over 1 Million active installs). It will go through and recreate thumbnails for every single image in your library, ensuring that all images in your library can be used with HD Quiz.</p>\n<p>With that said, I do, however, have plans to integrate a solution that will work with images uploaded before the installation of HD Quiz.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20difference%20between%20wp%20pagination%20and%20jquery%20pagination%3F%20which%20should%20i%20use%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the difference between WP Pagination and jQuery Pagination? Which should I use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unless you are a unique situation, I&#8217;d almost always recommend using jQuery Pagination as it provides more control for you and a better experience for your users. WP Pagination should only be used if you are trying to increase your overall page views for ad revenue or something similar.</p>\n<p>More information can be found on the HD Quiz About / Options page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20feature%20request%21'>\nI have a feature request!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fantastic!
