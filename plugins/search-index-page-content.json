        "faq": "\n<h4>I placed the widget in a sidebar but it won&#8217;t show up!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widget is built to only show up on pages and posts for which the content has been surrounded by the [SIPC_Content] opening and closing shortcode tags as seen here:</p>\n</p>\n<h4>[SIPC_Content]</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All page / post content goes here.<br />\nHeaders will be indexed and content will be searchable.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>[/SIPC_Content]</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The reason being that you most likely only have a few pages or posts that are long enough to deserve an index. Wouldn&#8217;t it be annoying if this widget showed up on every page and post, even short ones with no headers?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this plugin work? I used to manually create anchor links&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin basically uses jquery (javascript) to search the content surrounded by the shortcode for headers and creates the links automatically each time the page is loaded. This all happens after the page is loaded, on the client side. The benefits are obvious: you no longer need to worry about updating anchor links manually, users get to reference long pages easily and the server doesn&#8217;t do any extra work.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
