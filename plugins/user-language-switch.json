        "faq": "\n<h4>What is User Language Switch?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>User Language Switch is a WordPress translation plugin that allows admin users to set the default language for the website and also include translations of pages, posts, custom post types, menus and sidebars. Visitors and users registered can see the website using any of its translations available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I only see English in the list of available languages</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably you don&#8217;t have any other language installed in your WordPress installation nor in your theme. Take a look to the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions to install other languages to your WordPress website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see the option to set the language and translations of my posts and pages</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the post or page edition page, scroll to the top of the page and click on tab &#8220;Screen Options&#8221;, then check the option &#8220;Language&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My posts and pages doesn&#8217;t appear on the option to add translations</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you are creating or editing a post, page or custom post page, you can assign as translations posts, pages and custom post types that are already published and that have a language assigned.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I click on a flag to see the translation of my page, but I don&#8217;t see content translated</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First check if your translation have been linked to your post, page or custom post in the edition page. If there is no translation available, then the content of the default language is displayed though other sections of the page could appear in the correct language.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see my posts in the blog</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the plugin filter posts in languages different to the language you are looking in the website. You can deactivate this feature in the settings page of the plugin. If a post doesn&#8217;t have a language assigned, then the plugin considers the post in the default language the website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I obtain the content translated for my page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin doesn&#8217;t translate content automatically, we recommend professional translations for websites instead automatic translations provided by online tools. Webilop team can help you to find professional translators for your website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I collaborate with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can submit your pull requests to the code of the plugin through the repository of <a href=\"https://github.com/Webilop/user-language-switch\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">User Language Switch in Github</a>. Additionally you can contact us at contact[at]webilop.com</p>\n</p>\n\n",
