        "faq": "<h4>Where does it store transaction details?</h4>\n<p>The plugin does not store any details. It only passes the details between the user, PayPalPro and ZetaPrints. There is no data left about the transaction once the user leaves the payments page.</p>\n<h4>Who can see the credit card details?</h4>\n<p>Credit card details are sent to PayPal Pro only.</p>\n<h4>Why is PayPal Pro better the usual PayPal payments page?</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s not better. It is more flexible. PayPal may be a bit picky with some credit cards and decline transactions you would risk to accept yourself. In this case you&#8217;d better use this plugin and PayPal Pro.</p>\n<h4>Does it work with ZetaPrints only?</h4>\n<p>Yes. Some interfaces are specific to ZetaPrints. You are welcome to modify the code and adapt it to your own system or shopping cart.</p>\n<h4>Technical support</h4>\n<p>Contact admin@zetaprints.com with your questions.</p>\n"
