        "faq": "\n<h4>Why&#8217;d you make this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I was looking into using WordPress for documentation within our department and knew it would be handy to have a<br />\nmechanism for users to let us know when something was old or confusing. Sure, they could just leave a comment,<br />\nbut I wanted something that would also limit the amount of feedback from one article. Also, I&#8217;d never written a<br />\nplugin and really had no knowledge of WordPress, so it seemed like a good way to learn.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can it be translated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you would like to see Suggest Review in another language, you can use the .pot file included with the plugin to<br />\ncreate a translation into any language. Email me the completed .po file and I&#8217;ll include it in future releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Captchas?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I always assumed that the standard use case would require logins, but I always have had the option of allowing<br />\nguest users to give feedback. In the event you are getting spam from using an open form like this, you would most<br />\nlikely want a captcha solution to minimize it. For my ease of coding, I integrated the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/securimage-wp/\" rel=\"ugc\">SecurImage</a> plugin when using the guest form.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added captchas via SecureImage. You must have that plugin installed and have &#8220;Allow unregistered users&#8221; set to yes for the captcha to appear.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed PHP4 constructor from class as WP 4.3 deprecated that type of constructor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The dashboard page added in 1.3.0 to show all flagged posts was only working with posts, not pages or any custom types. That should now be fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed some CSS for the legend on the settings page.</li>\n<li>Added Polish translation contributed by Jakub Gardner</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved some CSS to external stylesheet for easier editing.</li>\n<li>Added some options to make language translation easier.</li>\n<li>Thanks to Jakub for the feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor bug fix relating to CSS on the comment box.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to change the text of the button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to not display comment on posts.</li>\n<li>Added dashboard page that lists all flagged posts (that the current user has access to).</li>\n<li>Both new features are at WPHaider&#8217;s suggestion, so big thanks go to Haider!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug that caused the button to now appear when using http instead of https.
