        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use WP Phone?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply Install the plugin, register an account and a business phone number and then customize your call flow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the default call system do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not customize your call flow system at all it will work like this.<br />\n1. All calls placed from 9:00am-5:00pm that come into your WP phone number will then ring your personal phone number, if you don&#8217;t pickup the calls will then be forwarded to a unique business phone voicemail system that only you have access to.<br />\n2. Calls placed outside of 9-5 will be sent directly to a &#8220;we are closed please leave a voicemail message&#8221;.<br />\n3. You can access that voicemail system by calling your WP Phone from your personal number.<br />\n4. You can place outbound calls by calling your WP phone number from your personal number and following the instructions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get multiple phone numbers</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0 the plugin only supports 1 businesses phone number, but you can purchase additional phone number at www.ivrdesigner.com and use those on your website, however the shortcode for them will not work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I place outbound calls</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default if you call your business phone number from your personal number you will be presented with a voice menu that allows you to place outbound calls by inputing the number you would like to call.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much do calls cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All calls go through www.ivrdesigner.com so they will set the prices. At the time of this plugin launch they cost 4 cents/per minute.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get Help?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you need help installing or getting the WP Phone plugin working add a new topic under support and I will respond ASAP.</li>\n<li>If you need help setting up a call system take at the help videos at IVR Designer: http://www.ivrdesigner.com/help-videos.php or ask a question on there support forum http://help.ivrdesigner.com/kb/index.php.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
