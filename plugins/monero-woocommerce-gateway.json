        "faq": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What is Monero ?<br />\nMonero is completely private, cryptographically secure, digital cash used across the globe. See https://getmonero.org for more information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is a Monero wallet?<br />\nA Monero wallet is a piece of software that allows you to store your funds and interact with the Monero network. You can get a Monero wallet from https://getmonero.org/downloads</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is monero-wallet-rpc ?<br />\nThe monero-wallet-rpc is an RPC server that will allow this plugin to communicate with the Monero network. You can download it from https://getmonero.org/downloads with the command-line tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why do I see <code>[ERROR] Failed to connect to monero-wallet-rpc at localhost port 18080<br />\nSyntax error: Invalid response data structure: Request id: 1 is different from Response id:</code> ?<br />\nThis is most likely because this plugin can not reach your monero-wallet-rpc. Make sure that you have supplied the correct host IP and port to the plugin in their fields. If your monero-wallet-rpc is on a different server than your wordpress site, make sure that the appropriate port is open with port forwarding enabled.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
