        "faq": "\n<h4>The links I&#8217;m getting suck, they&#8217;re barely relevant at all.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>External Related Posts uses either your post&#8217;s tags, categories, or title to search for related blogs.  Try changing your tags, categories or title &#8212; this will also change the results you get.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>External Related Posts isn&#8217;t working! My posts don&#8217;t have any links.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not every post will return results.  There are a few potential reasons for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chance of running<br />\nExternal Related Posts contains a setting that determines how frequently it runs.  If &#8220;Chance of running&#8221; is not 100%, then not every post will activate External Related Posts.</li>\n<li>Use tags, categories, or a custom taxonomy<br />\nExternal Related Posts uses either your post&#8217;s tags, categories, or custom taxonomy to search for related blogs.  If you&#8217;re not getting many results, try changing which one you use.</li>\n<li>Search criteria<br />\nTry using different tags/categories/taxonomy term.  For example, if External Related Posts is searching by tags, try changing which tags you&#8217;re using.  Do your own manual Google Blog Search with your terms and see what results come up.</li>\n<li>Verify blog is accepting pingbacks<br />\nNot every blog accepts pingbacks.  You may not get pingbacks, but you will get links.</li>\n<li>Wait a few days and try again<br />\nGoogle Blog Search is always indexing new posts.  If you&#8217;re not getting any results, go back and re-publish your post at a later date and hope that someone has a post that matches your criteria.</li>\n<li>Number of results<br />\nIn External Related Posts settings, increase the number of results to get from blog search.  Note that this will increase the time it takes to publish your post.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does it take so long to post articles now?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>External Related Posts needs to fetch and process Google search results in order to do its job.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I get a &#8220;Page not found&#8221; error when posting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The script is either running out of memory or executing for too long.</p>\n<p>This can be remedied in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase PHP&#8217;s <code>max_execution_time</code> and/or <code>memory_limit</code> in your php.ini, or</li>\n<li>Reduce the &#8220;Number of links to make&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I prevent External Related Posts from running on a given post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Set &#8220;Chance of Running&#8221; to 0% until you want to use it again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I re-ping a given post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Delete the previously added links (including the title added by External Related Posts) from the post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don&#8217;t my pingbacks show up at the sites I&#8217;m pinging?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blog owners may delete your pingbacks.</li>\n<li>Blog owners may mark your pingbacks as spam.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;ve been spammy with pingbacks in the past, your new pingbacks might be marked as spam by anti-ping-spam plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
