It&#8217;s just like the &#8220;Bold&#8221; or &#8220;Italics&#8221;<br />\ncommands, except that it makes your text look like code &#8212; usually, this means<br />\nthat it&#8217;s drawn in a monospace font <code>like this</code>. The comand is accessible as a<br />\nbutton and with the keybinding <code>Alt-Shift-C</code>.</p>\n<p>The unmodified editor does provide a <code>pre</code> style that&#8217;s somewhat similar, but<br />\nit&#8217;s a <em>block</em> style, which means that you can only apply it to whole<br />\nparagraphs. I wrote this plugin because I found that I often want to apply<br />\ncode styling to shorter pieces of computer-y content, such as the<br />\n    Alt-Shift-C above.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to provide feedback about this plugin. Entries on the<br />\ncompatibility matrix are especially helpful so that people can feel confident<br />\ninstalling it. Thanks!</p>\n<p>The WYSIWIG Inline Code Command plugin provides precisely this one feature, so<br />\ndon&#8217;t expect it to be updated very often.
