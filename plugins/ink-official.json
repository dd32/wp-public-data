Available for download on Windows, Mac, Linux.<br />\nℹ️ INK Official offers limited functionality if used without the INK editor. INK is available for <a href=\"https://seo.app/l0SIDLV3g\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows drag &amp; drop import of .ink files, images, meta and optimized SEO content into WordPress.</p>\n<h3>INK: The First AI Web Content Optimization Platform for Writers</h3>\n<p>INK is a real-time web content optimization platform and first of its kind tool that gives writers control over their content’s organic search destiny. INK helps writers, non-SEO users, and WordPress users create high-quality, relevant, and well-optimized content. Forget about copy and pasting your content and redoing all the formatting in WordPress from scratch. The INK WordPress Plugin makes importing your INK files, including text, metadata, images, and videos, to WordPress faster and easier.</p>\n<h4>Change the Way You Optimize Your Content with INK</h4>\n<p>With INK, you can focus solely on the one thing you’re passionate about &#8211; writing. That’s while keeping track of the tasks needed for your content to rank. INK’s simple ‘to-do’ card structure will help you prioritize the elements of your content that require attention and better optimization. INK allows you to make your content the best that it can be with only one platform. Everything you need, from a spelling and grammar checker and an image editor to general insight into how your content will perform once published online, is in INK. And now, with the INK WordPress Plugin, you can easily import your completed INK files to your WordPress editor and post them right away.</p>\n<h4>Importing INK Files to WordPress Made Easy</h4>\n<p>INK empowers both professional and inexperienced SEO writers to write relevant and search engine-optimized articles and content pieces. To that end, a team of developers, SEO experts, testers, Internet technologists, and AI experts are working tirelessly to continuously improve INK and the INK WordPress Plugin. The INK WordPress Plugin offers the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Importing content (text, images, videos, and other media) created using INK to WordPress.</li>\n<li>Text formatting compatibility with WordPress.</li>\n<li>Importing metadata and additional optimization efforts like:<br />\n** Meta Title<br />\n** Meta Description<br />\n** Image Alt Text<br />\n** Image Captions<br />\n** Anchor text and links<br />\n** Image size optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Write and Rank in No Time with INK!</h4>\n<p>INK is not a miracle worker. But it can give you the ability to level up your SEO content writing skills. It will show you how to make your content better with actionable recommendations that you can implement as you revise. Writing is no easy feat. But, wondering whether your target audience will actually read your content or not makes the process more difficult.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, INK’s unique AI can help you answer this question. Our software’s Content Relevance Score considers all aspects of your content, from topical completeness to its readability score. Then, it will show you how well your piece will perform once published.</p>\n<p>Imagine importing a well-optimized and relevant piece of content to your WordPress editor in less than a minute. No need to worry about content editing and other optimization issues because INK will take care of that. Just import your INK file via the INK WordPress Plugin, publish your work, and wait for it to rank in no time!</p>\n<h4>What Makes INK Unique</h4>\n<p>INK is unique in a lot of ways. It’s the first writing editor to give writers complete control of their content’s organic search destiny. You can use it to write compelling and engaging content for your readers or dominate an online market. It’s the first word processing application to have a unique relevancy and AI system. These allow INK to analyze your content versus your competitors and give you real-time optimization recommendations. What makes INK so unique is that it is the only product that combines performance optimization and content writing seamlessly. Also, both INK and the INK WordPress Plugin are free to use.</p>\n<p>Still not convinced? Here are some reasons why you should use INK alongside your WordPress editor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every piece of content is analyzed individually. What works for one keyphrase won&#8217;t work for others, which is why we specifically analyze every individual keyword. </li>\n<li>INK is designed with the writer in mind &#8211; there&#8217;s no need to be an SEO expert to use INK.</li>\n<li>INK&#8217;s user-friendly interface gives smart advice that lets you get to the core of content optimization.</li>\n<li>Audience optimization: INK helps you to understand why your content is performing well. INK&#8217;s proprietary AI scans the digital landscape and distills which pieces you should be focusing on. </li>\n<li>We built our AI in-house from the ground up to understand the topical relevance of content in Google Search. This allows us to look deep into what Google’s AI is looking for.</li>\n<li>Accessibility for color blindness and dyslexia.</li>\n<li>Built-in image optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n",

What do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, WordPress only allows specific files to be uploaded, such as .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .zip. Our INK Content Optimizer exports an INK file with an .ink extension. So, to allow WordPress to upload an .ink file, we made changes to mime types. If it does not work, try to insert our code &#8220;define( &#8216;ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS&#8217;, true );&#8221; to the wp-config.php file. If your hosting provider does not allow writing wp-config.php and your .ink file is still not getting uploaded, please open wp-config.php and add &#8220;define( &#8216;ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS&#8217;, true );&#8221; just above &#8220;/That&#8217;s all, stop editing! Happy blogging./&#8221;. This allows the uploading of non-image file types for administrator-level users only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20ink%20wordpress%20plugin%20is%20not%20working.%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nThe INK WordPress plugin is not working. What should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In case the INK WordPress plugin fails to work after installation, please try the following troubleshooting tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that after installation, you activate the INK WP plugin.</li>\n<li>Check if other plugins are interfering with the INK WP plugin (conflict).</li>\n<li>Uninstall and reinstall the INK WP plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the problem persists and you think it’s not because of your WordPress editor configuration, feel free to open a ticket via the INK WP Plugin page so our developers can investigate the issue.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
