In order to start vulnerability scan and access sensitive results, we need you to verify the ownership of the website. For this purpose we created a very tiny, semi-transparent Netsecop seal. Netsecop scanner will check the presence of the Netsecop seal before starting the vulnerability scan.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the scope of vulnerability scan?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Netsecop performs a very detailed web application vulnerability scanning which covers all the steps listed in OWASP TOP 10 list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is remote malware scanning?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Netsecop visits your web page and scans your web pages for injected malicious codes, harmful scripts, backdoors and exploit kits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is blacklist scanning?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Netsecop searches your website in various blacklist and spam databases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are instant notifications?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Netsecop sends you e-mail notifications about your scan progress and results.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about hidden fees?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Netsecop provides you the features listed above for completely free. There is no hidden fees or extra charges.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will Netsecop decrease my site performance? Any other installations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Netsecop works in the cloud. It is extremely lightweight and doesn&#8217;t slow down your website. There is no extra installation on your premises.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
