Image resolutions can be any, but i recommend 1200&#215;630 for Facebook and 1024&#215;512 for Twitter.<br />\nIn other words, it is possible to activate my plugin and use third-party software to create any Open Graph images, they will be loaded automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why plugin not generate images automatically?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because is so slowly. Might be take a time over default 60 seconds for PHP scripts, so might break saving post process.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How about compatibility with SEO plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For SEO by Yoast you need uncheck &#8220;Generate all opengraph tags&#8230;&#8221; option, check &#8220;Enable Yoast SEO compatibility mode&#8221;. Then everything will be fine.<br />\nFor other plugins that generate Open Graph tags, uncheck the option &#8220;Generate all opengraph tags&#8230;&#8221;. Also need to make sure that other plugins do not create the tags &#8220;og:image&#8221; and &#8220;twitter:image&#8221; in HTML code of pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to correctly uninstall plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delete plugin in WP dashboard &#8211; Plugins (as all WP plugins are usually removed).</li>\n<li>Delete folder with images: /wp-content/uploads/social.<br />\nDone!</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
