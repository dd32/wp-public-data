To do an automatic install of MailPoet bbPress Add-on, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;MailPoet bbPress Add-on&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found my plugin extension you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you&#8217;re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading my plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it</li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s wp-content/plugins/ directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Upgrading</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",
