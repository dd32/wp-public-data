Default is &#8216;1760px&#8217;.</li>\n<li><strong>modal</strong> (optional): Whether to display the form in a modal window or not. Can be either &#8216;true&#8217; or &#8216;false&#8217;. Default is &#8216;false&#8217;.</li>\n<li><strong>max-width</strong> (optional): The maximum width of the form. Default is &#8216;940px&#8217;.</li>\n<li><strong>button-text</strong> (optional): The text to be displayed on the button.

To use this parameter, set its value to <code>true</code> in the URL.<br />\nFor example:<br />\nhttp://example.com/page-with-form/?modal=true<br />\nNote that this parameter will only have an effect if the <code>modal</code> attribute in the shortcode is also set to <code>true</code>. If the <code>modal</code> shortcode attribute is not set or is set to <code>false</code>, the form will not be displayed in a modal window regardless of the value of the <code>modal</code> URL parameter.<br />\nIf the <code>modal</code> attribute is set to <code>true</code> but the <code>modal</code> URL parameter is set to <code>false</code>, the form will still be displayed in a modal window when the button is clicked.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<p>If you encounter any issues with the plugin, try the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you have entered the correct page id in the shortcode</li>\n<li>Check the CanadaHelps website to ensure that their service is functioning properly</li>\n<li>If the issue persists, try deactivating and reactivating the plugin, or contact us for further assistance</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This plugin is provided as-is without any guarantees or warranties.
