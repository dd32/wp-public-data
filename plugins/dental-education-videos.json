        "description": "<p>This is the official WordPress plugin by Toothority Patient Education. This plugin lets you embed dental education videos using the block editor, as well as anywhere shortcodes can be used. Toothority Patient Education is a complete library of beautiful, peer-reviewed, 4K education videos for dentists.</p>\n<p>Please note: You may use the plugin for free to build your site, preview the videos, check theme compatibility, and experiment with placement. A sample video will appear in the editor. To unlock videos on live website, you must have a <a href=\"https://toothority.com/toothority-web.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ToothorWeb subscription</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to Use</h3>\n<p>There are two easy ways to embed our videos on your WordPress website. By default, the video element will scale to fill the width of its containing element. This can be changed with custom css targeting the muvi class. On your live website, the videos will autoplay with the volume muted. Clicking on the video will start from the beginning with the volume turned up.</p>\n<p><strong>Block Editor</strong></p>\n<p>Simply edit the page or post where you would like a video to appear, add a new block, and search for &#8220;Dental Video&#8221; from the menu. Once you add a Dental Video block, you will be able to select any video from our library to appear on the page.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcodes</strong></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may place videos anywhere shortcodes are accepted. A list of available shortcodes is available in the plugin admin page.</p>\n",
