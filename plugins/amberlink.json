        "faq": "<p>Here are two of the most frequently asked questions. A full list of FAQs, as well as all Amber documentation, can be found on the <a href=\"https://github.com/berkmancenter/amber_wordpress/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amber wiki guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>What are some legal issues I should be aware of when using Amber?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Those who copy third-party content should always be aware of copyright issues. This is no different when it comes to using Amber. When you use Amber, you are preserving the copyrighted content of other publishers. Many uses of Amber &#8212; linking to and preserving a webpage for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research &#8212; likely constitute fair use under United States law and thus do not infringe on copyrights. However, users of Amber should be aware that fair use rights vary significantly in different countries around the world. In addition, there are limits to fair use.</p>\n<p>For a helpful guide on fair use, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/fair-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Digital Media Law Project</a>.</p>\n<p>For additional information on intellectual property issues that concern bloggers, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can websites opt-out of having their webpages preserved through Amber?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Amber respects the Robots Exclusion Standard and does not preserve any web page that opts out of web crawling via this protocol. It also uses the user agent &#8220;Amber&#8221; when preserving web pages, which you can choose to disallow on your website. You can read a full overview at <a href=\"http://amberlink.org/fetcher/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amberlink.org</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

New in Amber v1.4.2 for WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Increased default snapshot size.</strong> The default limit for snapshot sizes has been increased to 5MB from 1MB.

If no country is specified for Amber Delivery, Amber no longer calls a third-party service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated dependency checking.</strong> If the cURL library is not installed, Amber now displays a notice and warning upon plugin activation (credit: <a href=\"https://github.com/webster\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">webster</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.4.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue with displaying saved pages to viewers. All users should upgrade Amber to v1.4.1.</p>\n<h4>Version 1.4</h4>\n<p><em>Release date: December 7, 2015</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re in the WordPress plugin directory! New and improved in Amber v1.4 for WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Storage of snapshots in other locations.</strong> You can now choose to store snapshots on one or more third party storage and archiving systems: the <a href=\"http://archive.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Internet Archive</a>, <a href=\"http://perma.cc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Perma.cc</a>, and <a href=\"http://https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amazon Web Services (S3)</a>. You can enable this feature to free up space, take advantage of donated host space, or simply to contribute to existing web archival efforts. Remember: lots of copies keeps stuff safe!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Display of snapshots from other archives.</strong> Amber can now also display to your visitors alternative versions of a URL from other archives, including the Internet Archive, the Library of Congress Web Archive, Archive-It, archive.is, Webcite, and more. If enabled, you can display to your visitors the Amber snapshot in addition to other available versions of the same page&#8211;providing even more routes to linked content. This is made possible through expanded support of the <a href=\"http://mementoweb.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Memento protocol</a> and the Memento project&#8217;s  <a href=\"http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/about/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;time travel&#8221; and &#8220;TimeGate&#8221; concepts</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Compatibility with academic efforts to retrieve more accurate data.</strong> This release defined parameters for Amber users to benefit from academic research efforts on Internet activity and content controls. The Berkman Klein Center&#8217;s <a href=\"https://thenetmonitor.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Internet Monitor</a> project compiles and curates quantitative data to give policy makers, digital activists, and researchers. Primary data collected by the Berkman Klein Center and our partners, as well as relevant secondary data, will one day help answer the difficult question of &#8220;Which URLs are down for whom, where, when, and why?&#8221; While such a complete system is not in operation right now, eventually users of Amber can enable this feature to benefit from (by retrieving and contributing) such data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Curious about previous releases before we were part of the WordPress plugin directory?
