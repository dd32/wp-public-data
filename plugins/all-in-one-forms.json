        "description": "<p>Do you want to create a complex form? and with that i mean a form with many calculations, conditions and weird behaviors? If so you are in the right place. <strong>this plugin whole objetive is to conquer those difficult forms so you have an easy time creating them</strong> and without coding a thing.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how we help you beat down those complex forms</p>\n<h3>40 Fields at your disposal (and we&#8217;re just talking about the free version, the full version has even more!)</h3>\n<p>To cook something you need tools and the more tools you have the more dishes you can prepare. Well, for a form builder the fields are like your tools that&#8217;s why we give you +40 fields and that&#8217;s only the free version (the full version has even more!). And we keep creating more fields constantly. Didn&#8217;t find the field you needed? Just let us know and we will create it for you.</p>\n<h3>An spectacular calculation builder that you&#8217;ll love (and yes all this is also available in the free version)</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Master the Art of Form Creation: 5 Quick Tips\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoFPZmqf_sg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Creating complex form can be frustrating. The problem is that <strong>you can fit all the form builder in one of these three categories:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>They offer very basic calculation support:</strong> They can just sum up some specific &#8220;payment&#8221; fields.</li>\n<li><strong>They offer a very limited calculation builder:</strong> You can do some basic operations (addition, multiplication etc) and if you are lucky maybe even some basic conditions</li>\n<li><strong>They straight up require you to become a developer:</strong> They support everything that you are able to code yourself. For example, do you want to change the minimum value of a numeric field depending on a calculation? Be ready to learn how to listen to the change events of the field so you can change the attribute manually.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s why <strong>we crafted this plugin from the ground up to make the creation of calculations as easy as possible</strong>, here are the main benefits you will find by using this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can use any field to create a calculation:</strong> Do you want to use the repeater or survey field to calculate a quiz result? Sure go ahead.  What about using the google maps field to calculate the distance between two points then calculate a price? Yes, that can be done too.  Date pickers, group panels every field can be used AND you don&#8217;t need to learn to code.</li>\n<li><strong>You can use calculations to customize your fields too:</strong> For example, you could use a calculation to define the minimum date of a date picker or to set the text of a html or text box.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart calculation builder:</strong> The plugin will accompany you while you are creating your calculation and will inform you of any issue and even give you suggestions for an easy stress-free time in creating calculations.</li>\n<li><strong>And more:</strong> Like calculations inside conditions, functions and (if you are a developer) a complete javascript and php api.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The full version has even more ways to help you in creating calculations so don&#8217;t forget to check the full version features.</p>\n<h3>A conditional logic for all your needs</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to create dynamic and easy to fill forms using conditions\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNGHwWdVQK4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>All other plugin has conditional logic to show and hide fields but once you want to do something more complex, lets say changing the price of the options of a dropdown conditionally, you will need to use your javascript expert hat or hire a developer to do that. With AIO Forms this is not needed as every field has it&#8217;s own set of conditions so you have an easy time creating your forms.</p>\n<h3>A sophisticated style designer</h3>\n<p>You can create a

    "description": "<p>Do you want to create a complex form? and with that i mean a form with many calculations, conditions and weird behaviors? If so you are in the right place. <strong>this plugin whole objetive is to conquer those difficult forms so you have an easy time creating them</strong> and without coding a thing.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how we help you beat down those complex forms</p>\n<h3>40 Fields at your disposal (and we&#8217;re just talking about the free version, the full version has even more!)</h3>\n<p>To cook something you need tools and the more tools you have the more dishes you can prepare. Well, for a form builder the fields are like your tools that&#8217;s why we give you +40 fields and that&#8217;s only the free version (the full version has even more!). And we keep creating more fields constantly. Didn&#8217;t find the field you needed? Just let us know and we will create it for you.</p>\n<h3>An spectacular calculation builder that you&#8217;ll love (and yes all this is also available in the free version)</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Master the Art of Form Creation: 5 Quick Tips\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoFPZmqf_sg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Creating complex form can be frustrating. The problem is that <strong>you can fit all the form builder in one of these three categories:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>They offer very basic calculation support:</strong> They can just sum up some specific &#8220;payment&#8221; fields.</li>\n<li><strong>They offer a very limited calculation builder:</strong> You can do some basic operations (addition, multiplication etc) and if you are lucky maybe even some basic conditions</li>\n<li><strong>They straight up require you to become a developer:</strong> They support everything that you are able to code yourself. For example, do you want to change the minimum value of a numeric field depending on a calculation? Be ready to learn how to listen to the change events of the field so you can change the attribute manually.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s why <strong>we crafted this plugin from the ground up to make the creation of calculations as easy as possible</strong>, here are the main benefits you will find by using this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can use any field to create a calculation:</strong> Do you want to use the repeater or survey field to calculate a quiz result? Sure go ahead.  What about using the google maps field to calculate the distance between two points then calculate a price? Yes, that can be done too.  Date pickers, group panels every field can be used AND you don&#8217;t need to learn to code.</li>\n<li><strong>You can use calculations to customize your fields too:</strong> For example, you could use a calculation to define the minimum date of a date picker or to set the text of a html or text box.</li>\n<li><strong>Smart calculation builder:</strong> The plugin will accompany you while you are creating your calculation and will inform you of any issue and even give you suggestions for an easy stress-free time in creating calculations.</li>\n<li><strong>And more:</strong> Like calculations inside conditions, functions and (if you are a developer) a complete javascript and php api.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The full version has even more ways to help you in creating calculations so don&#8217;t forget to check the full version features.</p>\n<h3>A conditional logic for all your needs</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How to create dynamic and easy to fill forms using conditions\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNGHwWdVQK4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>All other plugin has conditional logic to show and hide fields but once you want to do something more complex, lets say changing the price of the options of a dropdown conditionally, you will need to use your javascript expert hat or hire a developer to do that. With AIO Forms this is not needed as every field has it&#8217;s own set of conditions so you have an easy time creating your forms.</p>\n<h3>A sophisticated style designer</h3>\n<p>You can create a professional looking form with your own colors and styles without coding a thing using the style designer.</p>\n<p>Technical details</p>\n<h3>In detail, what is included</h3>\n<h4>A bunch of fields at
