If you are still getting this message, most likely you&#8217;ve entered an invalid code or you have just installed the widget. If you&#8217;ve just installed the widget, make sure you have entered in a code and that it is valid.</p>\n<p>Second, try deactivating the widget and reactivating it.</p>\n<p>Third, check permissions on the downloaded XML file (in wp-content/plugins/noaa-weather folder). The &#8220;noaa-weather&#8221; folder should be 0755 and the files should be 0644. You can use FileZilla client for your OS to check and set these permissions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you still have problems after trying these solutions, email the plugin author.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.4</h4>\n<p>Added plugin version constant.<br />\nAdded uninstall hook.<br />\nAdded code to the display weather function that checks for the existence of the weather XML file and if it doesn&#8217;t exist it attempts to download it.

Shout out to Will Floyd for the fix!</p>\n<h4>1.3.12</h4>\n<p>Checked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.9</p>\n<h4>1.3.11</h4>\n<p>Checked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.8<br />\nExtended the Copyright date to 2017.</p>\n<h4>1.3.10</h4>\n<p>Checked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.7<br />\nAdded the word &#8220;Optional:&#8221; to the City field and changed the text slightly.<br />\nExtended the Copyright date to 2016.</p>\n<h4>1.3.9</h4>\n<p>Checked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.6</p>\n<h4>1.3.8</h4>\n<p>Checked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.5</p>\n<h4>1.3.7</h4>\n<p>Checked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.4</p>\n<h4>1.3.6</h4>\n<p>Removed extra unescaped blackslash that was causing the xml weather file to download to the wrong folder. You may have to deactivate and then activate the plugin to get the updated weather file if it doesn&#8217;t do it automatically.</p>\n<h4>1.3.5</h4>\n<p>Removed extraneous code SVN left in this file that messed up the formatting and version compatibility check.<br />\nFixed minor sync update.</p>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<p>Added error checking when writing to weather file to fix &#8220;Cannot use object of type WP_Error as array&#8221; on line 92 errors.<br />\nChecked and verified compatibility up to WordPress 4.3.1</p>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed error in this document, you go to Plugins-&gt;Editor NOT Appearance-&gt;Editor to tweak the CSS.

Also removed an extraneous empty folder.</p>\n<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<p>There were problems with the icon data in the weather file so I rewrote the way the plugin gets the icon. Now all the icons are stored with the plugin and called up locally. Also changed the &#8220;default&#8221; icon to look better on darker backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Icons courtesy of NOAA here: http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/weather.php</p>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<p>Changed website URI&#8217;s and email address.</p>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<p>Added a default icon if not supplied in weather file.</p>\n<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<p>Rewrote widget to use WP_Http functions (wp_remote_get) to retrieve weather file instead of using Curl. This should fix the problem on some servers that didn&#8217;t have curl activated in PHP and thus the weather file never downloaded.</p>\n<h4>1.0.8</h4>\n<p>Renamed some internal functions so as not to conflict with other plugins.<br />\nIf there is no value for Windchill then Heat Index is displayed, if no Heat Index then Dewpoint is displayed.</p>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<p>Removed default title of &#8220;NOAA Weather&#8221; if the user left it blank in the widget setup for more flexibility with some themes.</p>\n<h4>1.0.6</h4>\n<p>Fixed a problem with a slash vs. backslash for WordPress installs on Linux servers.</p>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<p>Get current weather file for any codes &#8220;in use&#8221; when activating plugin.</p>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed problem when changing themes the weather file wasn&#8217;t being updated.</p>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed the links that broke when making them pass validation.</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>The widget should pass markup validation now.<br />\nThe NOAA code is trimmed of any extraneous spaces and is upper-cased.<br />\nThe weather is now retrieved immediately when you add/change the NOAA code. There is no need to deactivate/activate the plugin to get the weather to update.<br />\nIf there is no value for Windchill, Dewpoint is displayed instead.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<p>Added code to create &#8220;twicehourly&#8221; cron schedule.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<p>This is the first version released to the public.</p>\n<h4>0.9.1</h4>\n<p>Some minor tweaks to the css file.</p>\n<h4>0.9.0</h4>\n<p>First beta release to select test group.</p>\n"
