Simply put, a support desk allows you to organize information, steamline your workflow and eliminate any manual processes. By using a support desk such as Nifty Desk, you will no longer have to laboriously log issues by hand, dig through disorganized emails and let things slip through the cracks unknowingly.</p>\n<p>If you can say &#8216;yes&#8217; to any of the below points, it may be time to install Nifty Desk and declutter your product or service, one support ticket at a time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You find that things are inefficient, and often find that common issues are never addressed.</li>\n<li>Multitasking is nearly impossible, especially considering you&#8217;re never sure where half of the issues lie with your product or service. </li>\n<li>Your customers find it difficult to get in touch with you, or even obtain a resolution to an issue or problem. </li>\n<li>You&#8217;re unaware if you&#8217;re fixing or making more problems on a day to day basis for your customer.</li>\n<li>You have a negative or poor reputation as a business for following up and resolving your customer&#8217;s issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How can I provide outstanding support?</h4>\n<p>As a business, we all want to be known for the excellent support we provide our customers. Below are just a few points you should follow to ensure your customers are having a great experience with you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know your product well. Be confident about every aspect of it. Ensure your team is on the same page as well. </li>\n<li>Be friendly. Add your personal touch to a response to prevent sounding like a predefined response. </li>\n<li>Remember your manners &#8211; say please and thank you when asking and receiving something from the customer. </li>\n<li>Greet the customer accordingly. Using the customer&#8217;s name in a reply is impressive in every language. </li>\n<li>Show respect to the customer.</li>\n<li>Be patient. Some customers may not understand your solution fully the first time round. </li>\n<li>Listen. Take as much in from the customer before responding. This will allow you to provide a comprehensive and knowledgeable solution. </li>\n<li>Never assume. Go back to basics first, and work your way through the problem, until you&#8217;ve found a suitable solution.</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>How does the plugin work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When activated, the plugin automatically creates a &#8220;Submit Ticket&#8221; page where users can submit support tickets. Once a support ticket has been submitted, you will be notified via an email. To view the support ticket, log in to your wordpress admin section, click on &#8220;Support Tickets&#8221; in the left navigation and then click on &#8220;Edit&#8221;. At the top right, you should notice options to change your support ticket status as well as assign a ticket priority. Notifications are sent out when there is a new support ticket as well as when there are new support ticket responses &#8211; these can be changed in the settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I edit the Submit Ticket page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Submit Ticket page is created automatically upon activation. To edit, please go to Pages in your left navigation and edit the relevant page. Please remember to keep the shortcode on the page so that the submit ticket form shows correctly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
