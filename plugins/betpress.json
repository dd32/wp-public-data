        "description": "<p>BetPress is a WordPress plugin that allow your users to place betting slips on sports events and compete against each others.</p>\n<p>The main idea of the plugin is to add a fun game to your website where users compete against each other guessing the outcome of different events. It simulates the very basic functionality of a bookmaker&#8217;s website (like bwin, bet365, betfair etc) where bets are not made with real money but a virtual points.</p>\n<p>To make a bet, you have to create a slip having at least one bet option in it. The possible winnings of a slip are calculated by multiplying the odds of every bet option in it by the stake the user made. If all bet options turns out to be winning then the slip is winning. A slip could also end up losing, canceled or timed out. There is a detailed documentation for more info but you can understand how BetPress works by just seeing the demo: http://web-able.com/betpress/demo/<br />\n<br />Please note that this is the Lite version of BetPress and in the demo you see the full version which has many extra features.</p>\n<h4>BetPress Lite features:</h4>\n<p>\n &#8211; Game settings like starting points, min/max bets per slip etc.<br />\n &#8211; Leaderboards<br />\n &#8211; User adds &amp; deletes bet options from his slip via AJAX (no page refresh)<br />\n &#8211; User&#8217;s unsubmitted slip is saved no matter when he logs in again<br />\n &#8211; Prevent user submitting same slip twice<br />\n &#8211; Manual actions for emergency cases<br />\n &#8211; Unlimited bettings<br />\n &#8211; 29 colors settings<br />\n &#8211; Reminder widget in the admin dashboard to tell you which bettings are waiting<br />\n &#8211; Manually adjust user&#8217;s points and user&#8217;s bought points<br />\n &#8211; 1 widget containing the user unsubmitted slip and optionally the user&#8217;s points<br />\n &#8211; 4 shortcodes each containing multiple attributes<br />\n &#8211; Translation ready<br />\n &#8211; WPML compatible<br />\n &#8211; Responsive<br />\n &#8211; Documented<br />\n &#8211; Supported</p>\n<h4>BetPress full version features:</h4>\n<p>\n &#8211; <strong>Three odd types supported:</strong> European (decimal), UK (fractional) and USA (moneyline)<br />\n &#8211; <strong>Semi-automated:</strong> You are always few clicks away from inserting up-to-date sports bettings.
