        "faq": "\n<h4>What is SnapID WordPress plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SnapID WordPress plugin is a two-factor authentication plugin that can be installed on any WordPress website in 5 minutes. It allows you and your users to login to your website by simply sending a text message. No more IDs, passwords, password resets, customer support problems with lost IDs. Put a stop to hackers stealing your usernames and passwords and ransoming them.</p>\n<p>You install the SnapID WordPress plugin, activate an account for the website and then activate yourself as a user so that you can use it to login. That&#8217;s it! Check out how SnapID works here: https://vimeo.com/107771091</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I register my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To register your website to use SnapID authentication, <a href=\"https://snapid.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205910258-Register-your-website-to-use-SnapID-two-factor-authentication\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">follow the instructions here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do end users sign up to use SnapID on my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s very simple. Provide <a href=\"https://snapid.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205910288-Individual-user-SnapID-registration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">these instructions</a> to your users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is SnapID available outside US?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use SnapID internationally if you have a Google Voice number. You&#8217;ll send a text message using the Google Voice website instead of your phone. These numbers are free and take just a few minutes to set up. If you travel internationally often, we suggest you use a Google Voice Number with SnapID instead of your regular phone number.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a website admin and would like to allow international users to login with SnapID from mobile phones that don&#8217;t have US numbers please contact us directly for details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much does SnapID cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SnapID is free for all websites that use our <em>plug-n-play</em> softwares/plugins. If you require additional security features, analytics and premium support, please contact us at sales@textpower.com to get started.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I changed my phone number. What happens now?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Follow the instructions here: https://snapid.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205910198-I-changed-my-phone-number-What-happens-now-</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is my account protected if I lose my phone?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you lose or misplace your phone, you are still protected with multiple layers of protection:</p>\n<p><strong>PIN</strong>: When setting up a SnapID account you can choose to activate a PIN that will have to be placed before (prepended) or after (appended) the one-time-password (OTP) that you will text to login to your website.  Anyone other than you who has your phone wouldn&#8217;t know the PIN and wouldn&#8217;t know whether it had to be placed before or after the OTP.  It&#8217;ll never appear on the screen and therefore anyone else with the phone wouldn&#8217;t know what it was, that it had to be sent along with the OTP or what position it had to be in.</p>\n<p><strong>Delegate</strong>: When setting up a SnapID account you can designate a &#8220;delegate&#8221; that will have the ability to suspend your access privileges by, of course, sending a simple text message to our system.  That way when you find the phone between the couch cushions the delegate can send another text to our system reactivating your access privileges.</p>\n<p><strong>Carrier</strong>: If the phone is truly gone &#8211; dropped off the side of a boat or stolen &#8211; and must be replaced, you will have to tell the carrier so that the particular device is deactivated and your cell phone number is assigned to whatever new device replaces it.  When that happens you don’t need to do anything on your end to reactivate the phone with SnapID.  The carrier and SnapID will take care of everything in the background.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone Lock</strong>: Unlike traditional SMS two-factor authentication systems where any text received can be previewed on the lock screen, SnapID cannot be used when your phone is locked because you must send the text, which requires that the phone to be unlocked. This makes SnapID significantly more secure than ANY SMS-based system where the user receives a text message instead of sends one</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do if I lose my phone?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You are protected! Follow the instructions here: https://snapid.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/206082228</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I own or manage multiple WordPress sites. Are there any limits to how many sites I can register?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently you can register up to 5 websites for each unique phone number. To register a website, <a href=\"https://secure.textkey.com/snapid/siteregistration/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">please go here</a> and follow instructions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I find out my SnapID registration status?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can text MySnapID to 48510 and it will tell you if you are registered with SnapID or not. If you are registered, you will be told how many applications/websites are linked to your SnapID account. This information is sent to both your registered email and as a reply to your text.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I’m locked out of my WordPress site. How can I disable SnapID?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use one of the below methods to delete the SnapID WordPress plugin from your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Control panel provided by your web hosting company</li>\n<li>FTP</li>\n<li>SSH access</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the plugin at /wp-content/plugins/snapid. Once you delete the plugin, regular username/password access will be restored immediately. If you don&#8217;t have access to your WordPress site using one of the above means, please contact support @ your web hosting company and ask them to delete this folder.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
