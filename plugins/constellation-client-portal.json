However, some themes may work out of the box with client pages.  If your theme&#8217;s page builder does not work with client pages, check with the theme developer to see if they have a method for extending the page builder to custom post types (the client page post type is &#8220;accp_client_pages&#8221;).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20look%20of%20post%20lists%20displayed%20on%20the%20front-end%3F'>\nCan I customize the look of post lists displayed on the front-end?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
