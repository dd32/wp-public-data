        "installation": "<h4>Install the Plugin</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Login into WordPress as admin, go to the plugins screen and select the &#8220;Add New&#8221; submenu.</li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;SecSign&#8221; and click &#8220;Install Now&#8221; or click on &#8220;Upload&#8221; and select the downloaded zip archive.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin in the &#8220;Installed Plugins&#8221; list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Note</h4>\n<p>The SecSign ID WordPress plugin uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/SecSign/secsign-php-api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SecSign ID API</a>. The API requests from the SecSign ID server a so-called access pass (a session and a pass icon) which must be confirmed on the smartphone. In order to enable the plugin to establish a connection to the SecSign ID server, the curl packet (http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) must be installed for PHP, and the web server on which the WordPress site is running must be able to reach the SecSign ID server under https://httpapi.secsign.com. Otherwise, you have to make changes in the settings for firewall and/or proxy.</p>\n<h4>Add the Login Widget</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add the SecSignID login widget to your site to allow the login on, for example, the side menu.</li>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;Appearance&#8221; screen and click on the &#8220;Widgets&#8221; submenu.</li>\n<li>Drag and drop the &#8220;SecSign ID Login&#8221; widget to, for example, the &#8220;Main Sidebar&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General Configuration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;Settings&#8221; screen and select the &#8220;SecSign ID Login&#8221; submenu.</li>\n<li>Change the service address which will be shown to the user in the smartphone app. This should match the URL the users will see, when visiting your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Co-worker Configuration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can integrate the SecSign ID login on the wp-login.php page. This is done by default.</li>\n<li>Optionally, you can assign SecSign IDs to the WordPress users of your co-workers (admins, editors, authors and contributors). The users themselves can also assign a SecSign ID in their profile.</li>\n<li>You can also deactivate the normal password-based login for the users, so they can only login using the SecSign ID. It’s recommended that you deactivate the password login for all co-workers, so your site is secured against brute force attacks. You should only allow the password-based login for your own admin account, in case you lose your phone, and of course for all co-workers without smartphones. These accounts should be secured using a very strong password.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>User Configuration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Optionally, you can assign SecSign IDs to the WordPress users of your website users (subscribers). The users themselves can also assign a SecSign ID in their profile.</li>\n<li>It’s also possible to activate and deactivate the password-based login for your users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Fast Registration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In order not to have to create new user accounts yourself you can allow your co-workers or web site users to create user accounts themselves by logging in with their SecSign ID via wp-login.php or the login widget. You can allow them to create a new wordpress user or assign an existing one. After they created an wordpress account, you can assign wordpress roles to your co-workers via the user administration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/utphj_m6jd4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>Tutorial</h4>\n<p>See (https://www.secsign.com/wordpress-tutorial/)</p>\n",

You can find the code in the app: Click on Edit on the main screen, select your SecSign ID and click on Restoration settings.</p>\n<p>You can restore your ID on a new phone by going to More -&gt; Restore Identity.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20enabled%20the%20secsign%20id%20plugin%20and%20locked%20myself%20out'>\nI enabled the SecSign ID Plugin and locked myself out\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Do the following steps in order to disable the SecSign ID WordPress login:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your WordPress directory via (S)FTP and rename the folder wp-content/plugins/secsign to secsign1.</li>\n<li>Reload the backend login page and login with your WordPress username and password.</li>\n<li>Important: Immediately rename the folder back to secsign.</li>\n<li>The SecSign ID WordPress Plugin is now deactivated.

This error means it can&#8217;t connect to our server. There are some possible reasons for this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please check if you have a firewall or router that might block the connection to httpapi.secsign.com on port 443.</li>\n<li>Please check that the curl packet (http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) is installed in your PHP installation. If this is not the case you should see a curl error about this in your webserver logs.</li>\n<li>Please check if you have another wordpress plugin which might block the connection to our server. There are several wordpress security plugins doing this.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please contact us at support@secsign.com if this doesn&#8217;t help.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
