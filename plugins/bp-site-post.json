There are other considerations such as removing access to the WP back-end if that&#8217;s required. This plugin aims to help with both of these tasks by providing an editor that is closely integrated with BuddyPress and also providing options to better customize the overall look and feel of the users access to the site. So for example to can hide key elements of the WordPress Tool-bar, you can also disable any WordPress edit links that would traditionally go to the back-end. You can also deny users access to the backend altogether by redirecting to such requests to the home page.</p>\n<p>This plugin is a fork of DJD Site Post, it&#8217;s been updated in order to work with BP Post Status to deliver a front end editing experience which offers site admin a great degree of control over the user editing experience. A large number of features can be customized. It supports Group.
