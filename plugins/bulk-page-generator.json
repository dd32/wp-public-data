You can create the post with full details like title, content, thumbnail image, etc. Also, a great feature is given you can create data with dynamic content also. Create a dynamic variable to create multiple types of content, now add words or phrases to change dynamically all the variations.</p>\n<p><strong>Post With Same Content</strong><br />\nAs per the name of the tab, you know that here you can create multiple pages, posts, and products, but you have some restrictions, you have to create pages, posts, and products with the same content. But here you can create pages, posts, and products with a different title for each post and the rest of the content will remain the same. Users can use the &#8220;|&#8221; delimiter to separate the 2 titles. Content like post content, post excerpts, and featured images. The best thing is you can add pre-fix and post-fix to the post title.
