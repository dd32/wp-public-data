Meaning basically, by default all images in the posts on your site will automatically be displayed using Shadowbox. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>If you want more fine grain control over the links continue with the next steps. If not then stop here.</h4>\n<p>1&#046; Create a link in your post in the following format (This link can be to pretty much anything including websites, video files, YouTube, Google Video and inline content):</p>\n<pre><code>&amp;lt;a href=\"http://domain.tld/directory/to/image.jpg\" rel=\"shadowbox[album]\"&amp;gt;Image&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>2&#046; Be sure to include <code>rel=\"shadowbox\"</code> as this activates the plugin.<br />\n3&#046; If <code>rel=\"shadowbox[album]\"</code> is included the portion listed here as <code>[album]</code> will group multiple pictures into an album called album. Do not use <code>[gallery]</code> to define an album as WordPress has a shortcode that will interfere.<br />\n4&#046; If you are using this as a lightbox replacement you do not need to change <code>rel=\"lightbox\"</code> to <code>rel=\"shadowbox\"</code>. Shadowbox.js supports <code>rel=\"lightbox\"</code> natively.<br />\n5&#046; If you want to make a gallery/album and only want one link to display you can use <code>class=\"hidden\"</code> to hide the additional links.<br />\n6&#046; See <a href=\"http://shadowbox-js.com/doc/usage.html#markup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://shadowbox-js.com/doc/usage.html#markup</a> for detailed markup instructions.<br />\n7&#046; If you are using using Shadowbox globally for all images but have an image you do not wish to use Shadowbox on use <code>rel=\"nobox\"</code> in your image link.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>shadowbox-js</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory or install directly through the plugin installer</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress or by using the link provided by the plugin installer</li>\n<li>Visit the settings page in the Admin at <code>Settings -&gt; Shadowbox JS</code> and install the required dependencies</li>\n<li>Optional: Activate the &#8216;Shadowbox JS &#8211; Use Title from Image&#8217; plugin to push the title from &#8216;img&#8217; tags onto the parent &#8216;a&#8217; tag</li>\n</ol>\n",

What is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have probably used the wrong form of the YouTube URL. If you used something like <code>http:&#047;&#047;www.youtube.com&#047;watch?v=3D3kFn_3xRY</code> that will disaply the YouTube website and not just the video. To just get the video use a link that looks like <code>http:&#047;&#047;www.youtube.com&#047;v&#047;3D3kFn_3xRY</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use a custom Shadowbox skin without having to worry about it being deleted during the upgrade process?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first thing you will need to do is to download shadowbox.js source from the github repository: <a href=\"http://github.com/mjijackson/shadowbox/downloads\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://github.com/mjijackson/shadowbox/downloads</a></p>\n<p>Second modify and build as required, then follow the next 2 FAQs for using a custom shadowbox.js and a custom shadowbox.css.  I will not tell you how to build shadowbox, you can find that information in the source download.</p>\n<p>You do not necessarily have to do both.  It is possible to only load a custom markup or only a custom css.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I cannot seem to get the plugin to download the Shadowbox source. What can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can follow the steps outlined in the &#8216;How can I use my own shadowbox.js&#8217; and &#8216;How can I use my own shadowbox.css?&#8217; or you can manually download and extract as explained by the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want to downlaod the source from your site at all. How else can I get the source?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Follow the steps outlined in the &#8216;How can I use my own shadowbox.js&#8217; and &#8216;How can I use my own shadowbox.css?&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use my own shadowbox.js?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Download or purchase Shadowbox from http://www.shadowbox-js.com/ and then&#8230;</p>\n<p>This can be accomplished using filters.  You will need to run a filter on &#8216;shadowbox-js&#8217;; and here is some sample code to show you how:</p>\n<pre><code>function custom_shadowbox_js($url) {\n    return get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory') . '/js/shadowbox.js';\n}\nadd_filter('shadowbox-js', 'custom_shadowbox_js');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just drop that code, modifying to your needs, in a custom plugin or mu-plugin and enjoy.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use my own shadowbox.css?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just as above this can be accomplished using filters.  You will need to run a filter on &#8216;shadowbox-css&#8217;; and here is some sample code to show you how:</p>\n<pre><code>function custom_shadowbox_css($url) {\n    return get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory') . '/css/shadowbox.css';\n}\nadd_filter('shadowbox-css', 'custom_shadowbox_css');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just drop that code, modifying to your needs, in a custom plugin or mu-plugin and enjoy.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I selectively load Shadowbox on pages that need it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  However this functionality requires WordPress 2.8.  If you are running WordPress 2.8 and you would like to enable this functionality visit <code>Settings -&gt; Shadowbox JS</code> and set <code>Enable Smart Loading</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t this plugin working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check to make sure that you have <code>&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;</code> in your themes header.php and <code>&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;</code> in your themes fotoer.php. See the default WordPress theme for examples. Also see the FAQ below.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin has stopped working since I installed another plugin or another plugin has stopped working since I installed this plugin. What can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try changing the Javascript Library used by this plugin to something other than &#8216;None&#8217; on the Shadowbox JS settings page in the WordPress admin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin really GPL?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin itself is GPL, however Shadowbox and JW FLV Player are not GPL.  Without the non GPL Shadowbox component, this plugin cannot function.</p>\n<p>Shadowbox is licensed under the terms of the <a href=\"http://shadowbox-js.com/LICENSE\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shadowbox.js License</a>.

Please do not ask for support if you are using such a configuration.</p>\n<h3>Upgrade</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the plugin updater in WordPress or&#8230;</li>\n<li>Deactivate the Shadowbox JS plugin</li>\n<li>Delete the previous <code>shadowbox-js</code> folder from the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Upload the new <code>shadowbox-js</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the Shadowbox JS plugin</li>\n<li>Visit the settings page in the WordPress admin at <code>Settings -&gt; Shadowbox JS</code> and install the required dependencies if needed</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>By default this plugin will add the activator attribute to all image links, movie links, audio links and YouTube/Google Video links that do not already have the activator attribute. Meaning basically, by default all images in the posts on your site will automatically be displayed using Shadowbox. </li>\n</ol>\n<h4>If you want more fine grain control over the links continue with the next steps. If not then stop here.</h4>\n<p>1&#046; Create a link in your post in the following format (This link can be to pretty much anything including websites, video files, YouTube, Google Video and inline content):</p>\n<pre><code>&amp;lt;a href=\"http://domain.tld/directory/to/image.jpg\" rel=\"shadowbox[album]\"&amp;gt;Image&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>2&#046; Be sure to include <code>rel=\"shadowbox\"</code> as this activates the plugin.<br />\n3&#046; If <code>rel=\"shadowbox[album]\"</code> is included the portion listed here as <code>[album]</code> will group multiple pictures into an album called album. Do not use <code>[gallery]</code> to define an album as WordPress has a shortcode that will interfere.<br />\n4&#046; If you are using this as a lightbox replacement you do not need to change <code>rel=\"lightbox\"</code> to <code>rel=\"shadowbox\"</code>. Shadowbox.js supports <code>rel=\"lightbox\"</code> natively.<br />\n5&#046; If you want to make a gallery/album and only want one link to display you can use <code>class=\"hidden\"</code> to hide the additional links.<br />\n6&#046; See <a href=\"http://shadowbox-js.com/doc/usage.html#markup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://shadowbox-js.com/doc/usage.html#markup</a> for detailed markup instructions.<br />\n7&#046; If you are using using Shadowbox globally for all images but have an image you do not wish to use Shadowbox on use <code>rel=\"nobox\"</code> in your image link.</p>\n",
