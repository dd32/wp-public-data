This amazing plugin is built with <a href=\"https://leafletjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LeafletJS</a>, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. There are no fluff and redundant settings and a straightforward Map option for your Gutenberg block.</p>\n<p>WP Map Block is the ideal solution for you if you&#8217;re using the Gutenberg editor and require a map on your site. Using this plugin, you can easily customize Google Maps or OpenStreetMap for Gutenberg-supported posts, pages, or custom post types for your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>⭐ <a href=\"https://academylms.net/wp-map-block/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Live Demo</a><br />\n⭐ <a href=\"https://academylms.net/how-to-use-wp-map-block/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Docs</a></p>\n<h4>Plugin Features ✅</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Maps</li>\n<li>OpenStreet Maps</li>\n<li>Multiple Marker</li>\n<li>Zoom Control</li>\n<li>Full Screen Map Control</li>\n<li>Custom Marker Icon &amp; Popup</li>\n<li>Map Width &amp; Height</li>\n<li>Latitude and Longitude Generator from address</li>\n<li>Set any marker as center position</li>\n<li>Marker Builder</li>\n<li>Draggable Marker</li>\n<li>Don’t need any API key</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>🗺️Google Map:</strong> Set the default Google Map on any page or post of your WordPress site. With a single click, you can select this map anywhere on your site using WP Map Block.</p>\n<p><strong>🛣️OpenStreet Maps:</strong> We’ve included this option for you so you can enable OpenStreet Maps and tweak it within your site. OpenStreet Map is an open-source map where you can contribute to improving the quality of data on the map. Every update you make to Open Street Map is owned by both you and the community as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>📌Multiple Marker:</strong> By default, a marker will appear on the map based on your location. But you can add additional markers on your map by customizing the settings. Also, set the title and content for the marker as well as set the default position of the marker.</p>\n<p><strong>🔎 Zoom Control:</strong> Zoom in and out of the map with ease using the zoom option. The map works quickly since it is built using LeafletJS, and it does not take long to load the map after zooming in or out.</p>\n<p><strong>📲Full-Screen Map Control:</strong> Get a full-screen map view while using the map presented by this plugin. You can control the map very comfortably within the full screen and navigate the whole map freely.</p>\n<p><strong>🛠️ Custom Marker Icon &amp; Popup:</strong> Explore the settings and customize the marker on your map. You can place custom markers on the map and also place your preferred popups on the map.</p>\n<p><strong>🎚️Map Width &amp; Height:</strong> You can set your preferred width and height on the map by customizing it from the settings. This option allows you to set the displayed map at a certain height and width and then place it on the front end of your site. You can set it according to your viewing preference.</p>\n<p><strong>☸️ Latitude and Longitude Generator:</strong> You can generate addresses from the latitude and longitude of your location. With the help of latitude and longitude, you will get a precise location and address on the map.</p>\n<p><strong>📍Set any marker as the center position:</strong> You can set the marker in the central position on the map. If you have placed a custom marker on the map, you can set it as your default marker and set its position in the middle. This will show the marker as the main marker; it will be displayed at the center of the map.</p>\n<p><strong>☄️Marker Builder:</strong> You may be bored to see the same old marker icon on the map. WP Map Block allows you to customize the map beyond the traditional elements of the map. You can customize as well as build a new marker and place it on the map.</p>\n<p><strong>👋 Draggable Marker:</strong> Drag the marker in any position on the map and reveal the location swiftly. The dragging option is really smooth, and after dragging the marker, the location gets revealed instantly.</p>\n<p><strong>🔑 API key not required:</strong> To place the map on your site. Simply select the map block and place it on any page of your site. The vast majority of Google Map plugins now available on the market need the use of API keys in order to activate the map; however, our plugin does not.</p>\n<h3>🔥 WHAT’S NEXT</h3>\n<p>If you like WP-Map-Block, then consider checking out our other WordPress Plugins for FREE:</p>\n<p>🔝 <a href=\"https://academylms.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Academy LMS</a> –  WordPress Learning Management System, eLearning Platform, Online Education System &amp; Online Course Builder</p>\n<h3>💙 Loved WP-Map-Block?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Like on our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/academylmsteam\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Page</a></li>\n<li>Join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/academylmsteam\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Group</a></li>\n<li>Or rate us on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-map-block/reviews/?rate=5#new-post\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
