E.g. if you are based in the US but customize some content for Canadian or Mexican visitors, you can restrict separate caching to CA &amp; MX visitors; and all other visitors will see the same cached (&#8220;US&#8221;) content.</p>\n<p>You can also specify a single snapshot for a group of countries e.g. all European Union countries.</p>\n<p>It works on both normal WordPress and Multisite (see FAQ) installations.</p>\n<p>More info in <a href=\"http://wptest.means.us.com/geolocation-and-wp-super-cache-caching-by-page-visitor-country-instead-of-just-page/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the user guide</a></p>\n<p><strong>Identification of visitor country for caching</strong></p>\n<p>Via Cloudflare or Maxmind (when the plugin is first enabled it uploads GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com ). Cloudflare works with any PHP version, but Maxmind Geolite2 requires PHP 5.4 or later. <em>It is also possible to connect a different GeoLocation sytem of your choice (see documentation).</em></p>\n<p>If you use Cloudflare and have &#8220;switched on&#8221; their GeoLocation option ( see <a href=\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168236-What-does-CloudFlare-IP-Geolocation-do-\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cloudflare&#8217;s  instructions</a> ) then it will be used to identify visitor country.  If not, then the Maxmind Country Database will be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Updating</strong> (If not using Cloudflare for country) The installed Maxmind Country/IP data file will lose accuracy over time.  To automate a monthly update of this file, install and enable the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/category-country-aware/\" rel=\"ugc\">Category Country Aware (CCA) plugin</a> (Country Caching and the Cataegory Country Aware (CCA) plugins use the same Maxmind data file in the same folder and the CCA plugin includes code for its update).

WP Super Cache is no different; when I checked the first page of its support forum it included 4 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/site-broken-after-activate-wp-super-cache\" rel=\"ugc\">posts like  this</a>. Sometimes the only solution is to manually delete files using FTP or OS command line. When deactivated/deleted via Dashboard-&gt;Plugins; the Country Caching plugin deletes its files, but in &#8220;white screen&#8221; situations you may have to resort to &#8220;manual&#8221; deletion &#8211; see FAQ for instructions.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This program is free software licensed under the terms of the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GNU General Public License version 2</a> as published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>\n<p>In particular please note the following:</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>\n",
