        "faq": "\n<h4>What do I enter for my Timezone?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find all the supported timezones on <a href=\"http://us3.php.net/timezones\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP&#8217;s List of Supported Timezones</a>. Click on the link representing the region your located in and then find the matching timezone. The timezone you specify must exactly match one of the listed timezones.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does Format mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Format allows you to define your own customized date and time output format.</p>\n<p>The format used for the date and time is the same format used by <a href=\"http://us.php.net/date\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP&#8217;s date() function</a>. This format allows you to create date and time output that is extremely flexible and should meet most everyone&#8217;s needs.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;l jS \\of F Y h:i:s A&#8217; produces output with a format of &#8216;Monday 8th of August 2005 03:12:46 PM&#8217;.</li>\n<li>&#8216;l&#8217; simply outputs the full name of the day, such as &#8216;Monday&#8217;.</li>\n<li>You can even include text in the output. Each letter must be escaped by a \\ first. &#8216;l &#092;t\\h\\e jS&#8217; produces output with a format of &#8216;Monday the 8th&#8217;.</li>\n<li>&#8216;F j, Y, g:i a&#8217; produces &#8216;August 8, 2005, 3:12 pm&#8217;.</li>\n<li>You can even just show the date: &#8216;M j&#8217; produces &#8216;Aug 8&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Or you can just show the time: &#8216;H:i:s&#8217; produces &#8217;15:12:46&#8242;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, the format may be a bit confusing at first, but it is very capable of allowing you to specify just how you&#8217;d like to display the date and time.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
