        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20two%20factor%20authentication%20%28tfa%20%2F%202fa%29%20%3F'>\nWhat is two factor authentication (TFA / 2FA) ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s to do with securing your logins, so that there&#8217;s more than one link in the chain needing to be broken before an unwanted intruder can get in your website.</p>\n<p>By default, your WordPress accounts are protected by only one thing: your password. If that&#8217;s broken, then everything&#8217;s wide open.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Two factor&#8221; means adding a second requirement. Usually, this is a code that comes to a device you own (e.g. phone, tablet) &#8211; so, someone can&#8217;t get into your website without getting hold of your device. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_factor_authentication\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">You can get a longer answer from Wikipedia.</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes it is also called multi-factor authentication instead of two-factor &#8211; because someone could secure their systems with as many factors as they like.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20care%3F'>\nWhy should I care?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Read this: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20two%20factor%20authentication%20%28tfa%20%2F%202fa%29%20work%3F'>\nHow does two factor authentication (TFA / 2FA) work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since &#8220;two factor authentication&#8221; just means &#8220;a second something is necessary to get in&#8221;, this answer depends upon the particular set-up. In the most common case, a numeric code is shown on your phone, tablet or other device. This code be sent via an SMS; this then depends on the mobile phone network working. This plugin does not uses that method. Instead, it uses a standard mathematical algorithm to generate codes that are only valid once each, or for only for 30 seconds (depending on which algorithm you choose). Your phone or tablet can know the code after it has been set up once (often, by just scanning a bar-code off the screen).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20need%20to%20set%20up%20on%20my%20phone%2Ftablet%20%28etc.%29%20in%20order%20to%20generate%20the%20codes%3F'>\nWhat do I need to set up on my phone/tablet (etc.) in order to generate the codes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This depends on your particular make of phone, and your preferences. Google have produced a popular app called &#8220;Google Authenticator&#8221;, which is a preferred option for many people because it is easy to use and can be set up via just scanning a bar code off your screen &#8211; <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> follow this link, and ignore the first paragraph that is talking about 2FA on your Google account</a> (rather than being relevant to this plugin).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20do%20not%20have%20a%20phone%20or%20tablet%3F'>\nWhat if I do not have a phone or tablet?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many and various devices and programs can generate the codes. One option is an add-on for your web browser; for example, <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/authenticator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here are some apps and add-ons for Google Chrome</a>. Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm#Client_implementations\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">lists various programs for different computers</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20lost%20my%20device%20that%20has%20pass-codes%20-%20or%2C%20they%20don%27t%20work.%20what%20to%20do%3F'>\nI lost my device that has pass-codes &#8211; or, they don&#8217;t work. What to do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your pass-code used to work, but no longer does, then check that the time on your device that generates them is accurate.</p>\n<p>If you cannot get in and need to disable two-factor authentication, then add this to your wp-config.php file, using FTP or the file manager in your hosting control panel:</p>\n<pre><code>define('TWO_FACTOR_DISABLE', true);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add it next to where any other line beginning with &#8220;define&#8221; is.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have FTP or cPanel access to your web hosting space, you can de-activate the plugin; <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com/understanding-wordpress-installs-plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see this article.</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20the%20plugin%20not%20support%20sending%20the%20two-factor%20code%20by%20email%3F'>\nWhy does the plugin not support sending the two-factor code by email?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If someone has access to your email account, then they can send a password-reset code there using the password-reset mechanisms built into WordPress. Therefore, if the two-factor code was also sent there, then ability to read your email allows the breaking of both factors, and hence is no longer truly <em>two</em> factor authentication.</p>\n<p>Some users might have two factor authentication on their email account, but this is not knowable or controllable from inside WordPress, and so giving this option to users means that the administrator cannot see or enforce two-factor authentication. And even in this case, email is often sent between servers unencrypted, and so is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks beyond the control of WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20hotp%20and%20totp%3F'>\nWhat are HOTP and TOTP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These are the names of the two mathematical algorithms that are used to create the special codes. These are industry-standard algorithms, devised by expert cryptographers. HOTP is less popular, but the device that generates the codes does not need to know the correct time (instead, the codes are generated in a precise sequence). TOTP is much more popular, and generates codes that are only valid for 30 seconds (and so your device needs to know the time). I&#8217;d recommend TOTP, as HOTP can be annoying if something causes the sequences to get out of sync.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20shortcode%20to%20use%20for%20front-end%20settings%3F'>\nWhat is the shortcode to use for front-end settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[twofactor_user_settings]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20deliberately%20entered%20a%20wrong%20password%2C%20and%20it%20let%20me%20login%21'>\nI deliberately entered a wrong password, and it let me login!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have a password manager extension installed in your web browser, with the correct password entered in it. It has automatically replaced your wrong password with the right one from its saved store. This behaviour has been observed and confirmed by several users. You can verify it by using the web developer tools in your browser to look at the HTTP data sent to WordPress, and observe which password is actually in it. You can also open a fresh web browser with no such extension in it to re-test.</p>\n<p>Note that the two factor authentication plugin has no mechanism to compare or approve passwords; this is done by WordPress core. If the wrong password is sent, then this is handled by WordPress, and the login will not proceed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

20/Mar/2021</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When checking if a user has TFA enabled on a login page, perform the same sanitisation on the username as WP core, so that if the user mis-types their username (which WP accepts) e.g. by prefixing a space, then they will still be asked for their TFA code (instead of jumping straight to an error for not supplying one)</li>\n<li>TRANSLATIONS: Added an Italian translation, thanks to Edoardo Di Leginio</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.1 &#8211; 15/Feb/2021</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Correct the &#8220;for&#8221; attribute of the &#8220;mark as trusted&#8221; text label on the WooCommerce login form</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.0 &#8211; 09/Feb/2021</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: (Premium) If TFA is required for a user, and they have not yet set it up, then force them to be redirected to a configured URL</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Replace the deprecated jQuery.click() and .change() methods</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.8 &#8211; 16/Jan/2021</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Replace the deprecated jQuery.unbind() and .focus() methods</li>\n<li>TWEAK: If the free version is active, then throw an error if trying to activate the Premium version, explaining what needs to be done</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8.7 &#8211;

11/Sep/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: On multisites, administration of site users who were not present on the main site was not possible</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduce the WP action simba_tfa_activation_status_saved to allow developers to respond to activation status changes</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update updater class to 1.8 series</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1 &#8211; 10/Aug/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Response to an attempt to turn TFA on can now include an &#8220;error&#8221; attribute if the attempt failed due to failure to supply the current code</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.0 &#8211; 08/Aug/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: (Premium version) By using the parameter style=&#8221;require_current&#8221; with the shortcode twofactor_user_settings_enabled, the user will only be able to activate TFA if they enter the current TFA code</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove the incorrect suffix &#8220;(Premium)&#8221; (double-suffix in the actual Premium version) that appeared in the plugin title in 1.5.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.6 &#8211; 06/Aug/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Allow customisation of a particular message via a filter simbatfa_message_you_should_verify</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Replace &#8220;eachother&#8221; with &#8220;each other&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.5 &#8211; 30/Jul/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Force a global context when creating the initial Simba_Two_Factor_Authentication object, to work around direct accesses from components that do not set the scope correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.4 &#8211; 17/Jul/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: (Premium version) &#8211; allow the site administrator to forbid users who have compulsory TFA to turn it off (supplementing the additional capability to prevent them logging in)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.3 &#8211; 22/Jun/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When using your final emergency code (Premium version), and viewing your settings (which regenerated new ones), then if you did not follow the advice to reset your prviate key, you would get the same codes as before. This might be thought undesirable (though is not a security flaw, as the emergency codes are no more guessable the second time around than the first). This behaviour has now been changed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.2 &#8211; 08/Jun/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When php-mcrypt was not installed, pressing the &#8220;Reset private key&#8221; link in a user&#8217;s settings would cause an unnecessary PHP notice, and display a wrong &#8220;current code&#8221; for a few seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.1 &#8211; 05/May/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Support any login form (Premium version) via appending the TFA code onto the end of the password. This allows support even of login forms coded in a way that make integrations (that aren&#8217;t hacks or inordinate amounts of work-around code) impossible (e.g. PeepSo)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Minor wording tweak in the explanation of how TOTP works.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.12 &#8211; 18/Apr/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a filter simba_tfa_localisation_strings allowing further customisation of front-end strings</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add an extra instructional message in the &#8220;Make two factor authentication compulsory&#8221; section (Premium) to explain how to cope with existing users</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Cope with the user entering spaces in their two-factor code (TOTP protocol codes are numbers only, but some apps apparently display formatting and users are not aware)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Mark as supporting WP 5.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.11 &#8211; 08/Mar/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: On multisites, the user search should search on all sites, not just the main one</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.10 &#8211; 01/Mar/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduce a filter, simba_tfa_management_capability, allowing the WP capability (default: manage_options) required by a user to manage the plugin to be changed. (Be careful &#8211; giving the ability to manage could potentially mean the ability to lock any user out).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.9 &#8211; 20/Feb/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SECURITY: The security fix in version 1.4.7 was faulty and failed to completely fix the problem; it is now resolved in this release. Our apologies for the double update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.8 &#8211; 16/Feb/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: On some multisite setups, the link to the site-wide administration settings went to the wrong place</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.7 &#8211; 06/Feb/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SECURITY: If a user&#8217;s WordPress account username was in the form of an email address, and if their actual account email address was something different, and TFA was set up on that account, and used the &#8220;username&#8221; (that looked like an email address) to login, then TFA controls upon login on that account would be ineffective. Other accounts were not affected (regardless of whether you login by email or not). This vulnerability was inherited from the original &#8220;Two Factor Auth&#8221; plugin that this plugin was forked from, and so is present in all versions before this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.6 &#8211; 05/Feb/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: When displaying a user&#8217;s trusted devices in the admin page, the time that a device was trusted until was not shown correctly (instead, it showed the current time)</li>\n<li>FIX: Removing the first trusted device in a list did not always work</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Display &#8220;(none)&#8221; when there are no trusted devices</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.4 &#8211; 04/Feb/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Trusted devices are now listed in the user&#8217;s admin page, allowing them to see and remove trust from their devices.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated .pot file</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.3 &#8211; 28/Jan/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: The &#8220;Trusted devices&#8221; functionality (Premium) checkbox was not appearing when activated</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a missing translation domain to a phrase</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1 &#8211; 25/Jan/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Trusted devices: A site owner can now choose to allow particular user levels (e.g. admins, editors) to mark devices as &#8216;trusted&#8217; and thereby exempt from needing to enter a TFA code for a chosen number of days. This feature is off by default and requires https (i.e. SSL) on the login form and cookies to be kept in the trusted device.</li>\n<li>FIX: Fix a regression in 1.4.0 whereby when a site owner viewed another user&#8217;s current code, it could later self-update with the wrong user&#8217;s value</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add the robustness in parsing broken JSON present on the standard WP login form to other login forms</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Various internal code documentation improvements</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Suppress mcrypt deprecation notices in places where we would use an alternative if it was not present</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Bumped the support requirement up to WP 3.4. I&#8217;m not aware of anything done to break it on 3.3, but this is the official requirement (it&#8217;s very hard to test old WP versions as they don&#8217;t run on modern webserver stacks)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.0 &#8211; 24/Jan/2019</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Where the current OTP code is displayed (during setup), this will now self-update automatically (i.e. without needing a manual press on the &#8220;update&#8221; link).</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Various improvements to the layout and text of the setup page to help make the process more understandable</li>\n<li>TWEAK: The current code is shown next to the UI option for enabling TFA</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent a PHP notice if AUTH_KEY was not defined (on some very old WP installs)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.13 &#8211; 18/Dec/2018</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SECURITY: Fix a logged-in CSRF vulnerability reported by Martijn Korse (www.bitnesswise.com). Due to a missing nonce check, if an attacker was able to persuade a personally-targetted victim who was currently logged in to their WordPress account to visit a personally-crafted (for the individual victim) page in the same browser session, then the attacker would be able to de-activate two-factor authentication for the victim on that WordPress site (thus leaving the targetted account protected by the user&#8217;s password, but not by a second factor &#8211; the absence of a request for a TFA code would be apparent on the user&#8217;s next login). This vulnerability was inherited from the original &#8220;Two Factor Auth&#8221; plugin that this plugin was forked from, and so is present in all versions before this one.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Some minor code-tidying</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update bundled Premium updater library to current version (1.5.10)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.12 &#8211; 14/Dec/2018</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent a PHP debugging notice when $pagenow is not set</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.11 &#8211; 04/Dec/2018</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Add a &#8216;TFA&#8217; column on the Users screen in the WP admin dashboard to display TFA status, thanks to Enrico Sorcinelli.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.10 &#8211; 30/Nov/2018</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: TFA codes were not being requested on the login form on a WooCommerce dedicated order payment page (i.e. /checkout/order-pay/123456/?pay_for_order=true&amp;key=wc_order_blahblahblah) (meaning that if a user had TFA activated, login would fail).</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent a PHP notice if AUTH_SALT was not defined (on some very old WP installs)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.9 &#8211; 30/Oct/2018</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SECURITY: If you were not using the recommended option of requiring 2FA for XMLRPC requests, then an attacker could potentially also bypass requirements for 2FA on ordinary logins (i.e. only need the password). Such users will want to immediately update, though we recommend that all users do.
