For example:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;?php slidedeck(12,array('width'=&gt;'100%','height'=&gt;'300px')); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where 12 is the SlideDeck&#8217;s ID.

        "faq": "<p>The best place for getting your questions answered is via our <a href=\"http://www.getsatisfaction.com/slidedeck\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Satisfaction support thread</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>I can&#8217;t add a slide, it just shows me a wierd looking page</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that you are running up-to-date plugins on your website and that they are all compatible with the version of WordPress you are running. We find that the most common cause of any problem with getting SlideDeck working on a website has to do with a plugin that isn&#8217;t written for the version of WordPress you are running and it causes a conflict or a JavaScript failure (which prevents our JavaScript from loading).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I just purchased the Pro version, but I don&#8217;t see a feature that the SlideDeck JavaScript library has</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We try and move the features we develop for the JavaScript library over to the WordPress plugin as soon as possible, but it takes some time to integrate and create an interface to use the feature. Keep an eye on your Inbox for updates; we&#8217;ll let you know when the plugin is updated with the feature.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I just put a SlideDeck on my site and I&#8217;m getting tons of &#8220;Warning: cannot yet handle MBCS in html_entity_decode()!&#8221; errors, whats going on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This error appears if you are running PHP 4 on your server. This is a bug in PHP 4 itself that is causing this error to occur. Please contact your web hosting company and ask them how to upgrade your web server to PHP 5; this is usally a quick switch flip in your web host&#8217;s control panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My WYSIWYG editors are not loading</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you are running up-to-date plugins. Some older versions of common plugins that add buttons to the WYSIWYG editor (such as Vipers video plugin) may cause the WYSIWYG editor to error out when it is initializing, preventing much of the JavaScript on the page from working.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My SlideDeck isn&#8217;t loading</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that your theme is running both the <code>wp_head();</code> command and the <code>wp_footer();</code> command, otherwise SlideDeck will not work properly. If you are manually loading jQuery in your template or theme after the <code>&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;</code> command, you will overwrite the SlideDeck plugin extension. Make sure that <code>&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;</code> is the last thing loading in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. If you need to load JavaScript for your WordPress theme, make sure you are using the <code>wp_enqueue_script();</code> command in your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file. See https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script for more information on how to implement this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t get SlideDeck working with Buddypress</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made some serious improvements to the way we are implementing interface elements, doing previews, etc. in version 1.2 that may resolve some of these issues. Please try the latest version of SlideDeck and let us know how it is working for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Pieces of the SlideDeck look wierd on my website</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes you might see extra spaces between links or &#8220;closed&#8221; slides, this is usually due to a conflict with the WordPress theme you are running on your website and the SlideDeck CSS. We are constantly working to improve the stability of the CSS of SlideDeck, but sometimes there are some themes that do some CSS definitions we cannot accommodate for. We recommend looking into getting <a href=\"http://www.getfirebug.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Firebug</a> for <a href=\"http://www.firefox.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Firefox</a> and investigate the elements that look strange and try and correct your theme&#8217;s conflicting CSS.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to put video in my SlideDeck, how do I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We updated the WYSIWYG editor implementation method in version 1.2 to be more compatible with other plugins and to process shortcodes. Please be advised that it is up to the plugin author to choose to display their plugin buttons in WYSIWYG editors used outside of the Posts and Pages section of WordPress. So, you still may not see your shortcode buttons, but we do still process any shortcodes entered manually. Any sort of media though can still be embedded in a SlideDeck. Just click on the HTML edit tab for the slide and copy-and-paste the embed code for a video into a SlideDeck&#8217;s content area.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve placed a video in my SlideDeck, but it shows through the SlideDeck, even on closed slides</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Flash doesn&#8217;t play nicely all the time with fancy interactions like SlideDeck and the like, luckily there&#8217;s an easy fix. Just add the the <code>wmode=\"opaque\"</code> parameter to your embed code. For example, with a YouTube video embed code, this will change the code from this:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/au3-hk-pXsM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>to this:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/au3-hk-pXsM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Take note of the addition of the <code>&lt;param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag and the <code>wmode=\"opaque\"</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to customize the way my SlideDeck looks, how do I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We provide a few skins with SlideDeck, all of which you can edit. You will find all the skins located in the &#8220;skins&#8221; folder in the SlideDeck WordPress Plugin folder. Edit the CSS files in the skins folders to make changes. Just be sure and backup your changes before updating your plugin, otherwise you&#8217;ll loose them!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
