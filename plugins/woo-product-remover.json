        "description": "<p>Woo Product Remover allows you to, via a single click, remove all woocommerce products from your site. It cleans up your database from products, their metadata, relationships, as well as product variations and their related meta data.</p>\n<p>It handles removing all standard woocommerce product types including simple, grouped, external and variable, as well as related variations.</p>\n<p>Some of this work has been inspired by https://www.kingrosales.com/blog/how-to-properly-delete-all-woocommerce-products/ which has been improved upon and made to work properly within wordpress and to cleanup product variations.</p>\n<p>If you would like some custom work done, or have an idea for a plugin you&#8217;re ready to fund, check our site at www.greateck.com or contact us at info@greateck.com</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/woo-product-remover</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Click on the Woo Product Remover, and then click the Delete All button</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it! The plugin will let you know how many products/product variations have been deleted, if any.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do we delete products?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just setup the plugin, go to the Woo Product Remover screen, and click delete all.<br />\nThe plugin will confirm how many products/product variations have been deleted</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t have products, what happens?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have products, you don&#8217;t need to use the plugin .. lol .. But if you do, it will inform you that 0 products have been deleted</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin remove extra product database fields?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin cleans up your database from all product meta data that is stored by woocommerce. Deleting the products and leaving those will exhaust your resources, especially if you have a large database, which is why we handle removing them</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What types of products this plugin removes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin removes all standard woocommerce product types, including simple, grouped, external and variable, as well as related variations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How fast is this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Super fast! Since we are relying on mysql query, the plugin runs pretty quickly avoiding any layers and cleaning up all its work.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1.0</h4>\n<p>Adding support to keep categories, tags and taxonomies related to the removed products. These will be kept by default (new checkbox option) to prevent any accidental data loss.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Version *</li>\n</ul>\n"
