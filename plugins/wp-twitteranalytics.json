        "installation": "<p>Upload and install WP-TwitterAnalytics from your Plugins page in your WordPress dashboard.  You can also extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp content/plugins/ directory of<br />\nyour WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Why should I use WP-TwitterAnalytics?</p>\n<p>Because it leverages the power of WordPress to store real-time Twitter data in a WordPress MySQL database<br />\nand lets you publish analysis and results in a blog post. WP-TwitterAnalytics goes directly to the source using<br />\nthe Twitter Search API to collect data. Twitter data is also made available for download and offline analysis.</p>\n<p>Is there a limit to data monitoring?</p>\n<p>You can monitor up to 5 keywords and phrases, hash tags (#), stock tweets ($) or users(@) at any given time.<br />\nThere is no limit on how many tweets that can be stored online.</p>\n<p>Can I monitor Tweets when my WordPress dashboard is closed or I am not online? If not, why?</p>\n<p>No, your web browser must be open with WP-TwitterAnalytics running in order to monitor and<br />\nrecord data. WP-TwitterAnalytics is a very powerful, high-throughput tool that can monitor, store and<br />\nrecords tens of thousands of tweets (or more) during any session. Having the tool running continuously for<br />\nhigh tweet volume topics could crash a WordPress blog if it is not configured to handle massive amounts of data.<br />\nBy limiting the number of queries and ensuing that a user is aware of monitoring and recording conditions<br />\ndramatically reduces the likelihood of a server crash.</p>\n<p>What is the difference between WP-TwitterAnalytics and other social media monitoring tools?</p>\n<p>WP-TwitterAnalytics only monitors tweets from the Twitter Search API. It does have, however,<br />\nmany of the same features provided in the social media monitoring and analytics tools on the market<br />\ntoday such as share of voice analysis, tweet monitoring, recording and online storage, and download<br />\nto CSV functionality.</p>\n"
