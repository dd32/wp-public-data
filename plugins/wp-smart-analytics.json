It further distinguishes website visitors as administrator or visitor or bot.</p>\n<p>User interface is provided to retrieve statistics for a given period on Page Type, Page Title, Visitor Country, Visitor Platform, Visitor Browser and Visitor Source.</p>\n<p>The plugin offers readonly and manage roles based on user role.

        "faq": "<p>Q. Why is the plugin asking for ipstack.com API key?<br />\nA. IP stack has got a free API service used to obtain locality of an IP address. The plugin uses this. We are not affiliated with the service provider.</p>\n<p>Q. Is ipstack.com API key a must?<br />\nA. No. The plugin gracefully degrades without it. Unfortunately locality won&#8217;t be logged.</p>\n<p>Q. What is &#8216;Do not log&#8217; in settings?<br />\nA. File paths containing any one of the comma separated texts corresponding to ‘Do not log’ in settings panel are not logged when visited.</p>\n<p>Q. I want to reverse certain banned &#8216;IP&#8217;s?<br />\nA. You can update the ban texts by altering meta tags from settings panel and saving. Please be careful.</p>\n<p>Q. Can I use [wpsa_log] shortcode anywhere?<br />\nA. A shortcode [wpsa_log] is also provided to display visitor logs. We strongly suggest to keep it hidden from public.</p>\n<p>Q. How to use [wpsa_log] short code?<br />\nA. Shortcode [wpsa_log] has attributes style and heading_style.<br />\n&#8212; style is the general style you can add for the log (id = log) and defaults to &#8221;.<br />\n&#8212; heading_style is the inline style you can add for the headings (tag = h2) and defaults to &#8221;.</p>\n<p>Q. How to use [wpsa_count] short code?<br />\nA. Shortcode [wpsa_count] has attributes length, pad, offset and style added to display the unique visitor count on your website.<br />\n&#8212; length is the length of the counter and defaults to 8.<br />\n&#8212; pad is the padding character used and defaults to &#8221;.<br />\n&#8212; offset is the offset to be added to the counter and defaults to 0.<br />\n&#8212; style is the inline style you can add for the counter (id = count) and defaults to &#8221;.</p>\n<p>More questions, mail me at business[at]vinodsebastian.com<br />\nI will try to respond promptly.</p>\n",
