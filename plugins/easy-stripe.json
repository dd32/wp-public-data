Each button that you make will display a Stripe button on your site. The plugin lets you make as many Stripe buttons as you want, there are no limits.</p>\n<p>The plugin adds a new icon above your WordPress editor. So when you edit (or make a new) page or post, you can click this icon and insert a Stripe button onto your page, in just one click. You also have the option of manually placing a shortcode on your page or post to display the Stripe button.</p>\n<p>Each Stripe button is customizable, you can change the product description, price, if you want to collect a shipping address, and more.</p>\n<h4>Orders</h4>\n<p>View customer orders inside your WordPress admin dashboard. See the order total, customers shipping details, email address, Stripe transaction id, and more.</p>\n<h4>Emails</h4>\n<p>With built in email support, customers will get an email after purchase. As an admin, you can also choose to get an email whenever a sale is made.</p>\n<p>Email can be customized and can include order variables such as amount, product description, order number, and more.</p>\n<h4>Refunds</h4>\n<p>No one likes refunds, but they are a part of doing business. Easy Stripe makes it very easy to issue a customer a refund. In your admin dashboard, just view an order, and with two clicks you can issue the customer a refund.</p>\n<h4>Reports</h4>\n<p>This plugin comes with beautiful built in graphical reports.
