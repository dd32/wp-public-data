        "description": "<p>A community yard sale involves multiple yard sales within a community, usually at the same time. This event attracts<br />\nmore buyers. But buyers need to know where each yard sale is located and want to know what items are for sale at each<br />\nyard sale. This plugin helps address these issues by (1) providing sellers an input form to list their address and<br />\nitems being sold and (2) providing buyers a Google Map and searchable/filterable table of yard sale listings.</p>\n<p>The administrative control panel leads you through creating short codes that generate an (1) input form for sellers and<br />\n(2) Google Map and a listing table for buyers.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Your WordPress site must be running PHP5 or better. This plugin will fail to activate if your site is running PHP4.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nHow do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin gives you two short codes: one that places a form on a page for people to add a listing, a second to display<br />\nthe listing. Go to the Settings page and it will walk through creating the short codes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20edit%2Fdelete%20my%20yard%20sale%20entry%3F'>\nHow do I edit/delete my yard sale entry?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you add your entry initially, you will be emailed links that you can use to to edit or delete that entry.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='yard%20sale%20entries%20are%20not%20appearing%20on%20the%20listing%20page'>\nYard sale entries are not appearing on the listing page\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ensure that the &#8220;event&#8221; value used in the [yardsale-listing] short code matches that of the [yardsale-form] input form short code</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20we%20make%20only%20registered%20users%20be%20allowed%20to%20make%20and%20entry%20or%20can%20we%20require%20a%20login'>\nCan we make only registered users be allowed to make and entry or can we require a login\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin does not directly support this. But you can use the WordPress option to require a password on the<br />\npage on which the entry form is located.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20do%20a%20new%20yard%20sale%20event%2C%20how%20do%20i%20clear%20the%20old%20entries'>\nI want to do a new yard sale event, how do I clear the old entries\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have two choices: (1) delete existing entries, (2) use a new event tag. For (1), go to the admin setting panel,<br />\n&#8220;Delete Entry&#8221; tab and delete the event tag that you used in your short code. For (2), edit your [yardsale-form] and<br />\n[yardsale-listing] short codes by changing the &#8220;event&#8221; value to some new value. Be sure you use the same value for<br />\nboth tags so that they reference the same data.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
