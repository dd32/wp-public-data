You have to go to product editor, tab Price per unit and set an override to the rule you want. It works then even despite the global settings is turned off.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20recalculation%20on%2C%20but%20the%20price%20seems%20untouched.%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI have recalculation on, but the price seems untouched. What&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Recalculated price is shown only when the recalculation takes place. That means if you don&#8217;t have the weight set on the product, nothing happens to the price. Make sure you have weight set.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20use%20only%20other%20features%2C%20not%20recalculation.%20is%20it%20necessary%20to%20have%20recalculation%20on%3F'>\nI want to use only other features, not recalculation. Is it necessary to have recalculation on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Some features are independent on recalculation, you will find them as &#8220;General price options&#8221; and &#8220;Options for variable products&#8221; those settings are store wide &#8211; they will affect all products.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
