        "installation": "<p>It&#8217;s quite simple;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;bybrick-columns&#8217; folder to the &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>???</li>\n<li>Profit!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How does this work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin enables you to use short codes right in the TinyMCE editor when writing a post and/or page.</p>\n<p>For example: If you&#8217;d like to divide your content into two columns you would type:</p>\n<p>[one_half] This is the left column [/one_half] [one_half_last] This is the right collumn [/one_half_last]</p>\n<p>Remember to &#8220;close&#8221; your short code, just as you would with HTML. Also; did you see the &#8216;_last&#8217; add there? That&#8217;s REALLY important as it will remove the margin on the right side. If you forget it, your columns won&#8217;t work.</p>\n<p>How about another example?</p>\n<p>[two_third] This area is two thirds wide [/two_third] [one_third_last] This is some more content [/one_third_last]</p>\n<p>You can combine the available sizes any how you&#8217;d like, just as long as the math adds up.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know these columns width will fit my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All width is percentage based, so you should be safe!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a headers already sent error.</li>\n<li>Columns now stack the way they are supposed to when screen width is smaller than 767px.</li>\n<li>This plugin now fixes that empty </li>\n</ul>\n<p>tag that TinyMCE sometimes adds.</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin now features a button that hooks right onto your TinyMCE editor. Click the button, enter the desired number of columns and voil√°! No need to enter the shortcodes by hand ever again (if you wish to use something, for example, like [four_fifth] you&#8217;ll still need to enter those by hand). Oh; and the CSS file is now minified.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug with [one_fourth] columns not working. Thanks jmd4eva for noticing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for responsive wed design. Meaning; any columns you&#8217;ve created will wrap below each other and be 100% width if the screen width is a minimum of 480px (standard iPhone in landscape mode).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch baby, launch!</li>\n</ul>\n"
