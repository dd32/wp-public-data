        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.0 or greater</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Awesome for WC&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The<br />\nWordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;. That should return things to normal.</p>\n",
