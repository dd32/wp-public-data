        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWill this work on wordpress installs that do not use apache server\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  This plugin only works for wordpress installations on servers running apache, as it is depending on writing the rules to the .htaccess file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I have to manually create the .htaccess file in the uploads directory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will need to be able to write to the directory in order to work.  When you install the plugin, it will create the .htaccess file with the proper permissions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat happens to the .htaccess file if I uninstall the plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As there may be other items in the htaccess file that are important, uninstalling this plugin does not remove the .htaccess file.  You will have to do this manually.  It is important to note that uninstalling this plugin does not remove any content of the htaccess file.  If you wish to remove canonicals, you should use the bulk editor or manually edit the .htaccess file using the editor option.  When you remove by manually editing the htaccess file, the associations will still exist in the wordpress database as an option for that media item, but since they are not in the .htaccess file, they will be &#8220;useless&#8221;. This is why it is recommended to use the bulk editor vs. editing htaccess directly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy is there an option to edit the .htaccess directly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In some instances there may be files outside of wordpress&#8217;s database that you wish to canonical, so we wanted to make it accessible for adding those items. The most likely case for this would be if you migrated to wordpress and manually moved a directory or files into the uploads folder vs. uplaoding through wordpress.  Future iterations of this plugin might include a way to better manage non wordpress linked media files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nSome of my media files aren&#8217;t attached to a post, what happened?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This has nothing to do with our plugin, but occurs when you upload media files when you are not editing / creating a post.  The wordpress library has a filter for unattached media items, and you can attach them manually there.  Our editor does not require the media item be attached to a post, it just makes it possible to use the bulk feature to attach vs. having to do it one at a time. You can also use the post finder from the &#8220;attach media&#8221; option in our bulk editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWho built this awesome plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was developed by the good folks at <a href=\"https://www.hivedigital.com/?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_campaign=canonical-attachments&amp;utm_medium=plugin-page\" title=\"Awesome Digital Marketing Agency\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Hive Digital</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
