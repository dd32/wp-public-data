After a month, rankings will be reset and commenters will have to reclaim their status at the top.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I exclude names from ranking?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can prevent multiple names from appearing by simply typing the name you wish to remove in the Widget setting. Be sure to separate each name with a comma (,).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I list more than 5 commenters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of now, you will need to make edits to the template file if you really need more than 5. In the future, you’ll be able to edit the Leaderboard template <em>safely</em> through your child theme, so be careful if you choose to edit the plugin files.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
