Form Type Calculator:</p>\n<p>Field id=2 &#8220;A&#8221;: Term 1.<br />\nField id=3 &#8220;B&#8221;: Term 2.<br />\nField id=5 &#8220;Ratio&#8221;: Coefficient.<br />\nField &#8220;Calc&#8221;: C = (A + B) * Ratio</p>\n<p>When Importing Records, you usually need to prepare all the Values of all Fields:<br />\nA; B; Ratio; C.<br />\nSo, to carry out preliminary calculations.</p>\n<p>Difficulties begin when branched Inner Logic is used. When there are various additional Fields for selecting conditions in the form of Lists, Options. (&#8220;Gravity Forms&#8221; allows you to use both built-in Internal Logic in each of the Fields, and connect JS Scripts with Scripts.)<br />\nTransferring JS Scripts with Scripts to an Excel-prepared Table can be quite a difficult task. Errors are almost inevitable. Moreover, it is necessary to carefully maintain the correspondence of the calculated formulas in the Table with the Form Algorithms. And if you have changed something in the algorithms of the Form, then you again need to change and then test the Formulas in the Table. Even writing about it is tiresome.</p>\n<p>Moreover, some Field Values may have both Value and Format Constraints. In normal cases, import without checking such Restrictions may lead to an abnormal termination of the Import process, or to incorrectly filled Fields.<br />\nIn any case, manual correction of Records after such an Import can be costly and resource intensive.</p>\n<p>It is for such Tasks that this Plugin is needed.</p>\n<p>It is enough to fill in only the Initial Fields.<br />\nIn our Example &#8211; Fields: A B and Ratio.<br />\nCalculated Field &#8220;C&#8221; will be calculated in each imported Record by the internal Form algorithms and will be saved.</p>\n<p>If some of the Values are out of range, then such a Record will not be saved and will require correction directly during the Import process.</p>\n<p>You can watch and try the <a href=\"http://wpgear.xyz/import-excel-to-gravity-forms/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> Demo </a> on a real Form.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Works with PHP 7.4</li>\n<li>Works with Gravity Forms versions 2.3.3.4 and higher.
