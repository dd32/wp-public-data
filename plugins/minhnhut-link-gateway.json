If this was not created or you have deleted it by accident, just creating a new page with any title you want, and this shortcode [linkgate-redirector] in the content. Remember to add slug for your page. It should be \\&#8221;redirect\\&#8221;. If you use different page slug for redirector page, you might update it in Settings -&gt; Link Gate Redirector -&gt; Redirect page\\&#8217;s slug.</p>\n<h4>How do I change template for my redirector page?</h4>\n<p>Redirector page is just a normal page in WordPress. You can customize it easily by creating new page template file in your theme. And use it as template for your redirector page.</p>\n<h4>Does your plug-in support other language?</h4>\n<p>Front end redirector page\\&#8217;s texts are 100% customizable via Settings -&gt; Link Gate Redirector. However, Back end options page is currently in English. I just have a plan to translate it to many language. However, i don\\&#8217;t have much time to it right now. It would be appreciated if you could help me to translate it to your local language. Please send me a message, if you interest.</p>\n",
