        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20packaging%20fit%20documentation%3F'>\nWhere can I find Packaging Fit documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For help setting up and configuring Packaging Fit, please refer to <a href=\"https://tigriweb.gitbook.io/packaging-fit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our documentation</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20packaging%20fit%3F'>\nWhy should I use Packaging Fit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Packaging Fit significantly reduces the time and effort required to pack orders by automating the packing process. This ensures each package is packed as efficiently as possible, saving valuable time and reducing shipping costs. Additionally, Packaging Fit offers features like shipping cost comparison, fit verification, and visual packing assistance to further optimize your packaging process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20packaging%20fit%20calculate%20free%20space%3F'>\nHow does Packaging Fit calculate free space?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Free space is calculated by adding the specified free space value from each side of the package or product. For example, if you have a package with dimensions of 10x10x10 cm and you add 1 cm of free space, the actual internal dimensions will be 8x8x8 cm because 1 cm is added to each side, resulting in a total of 2 cm reduction. The same principle applies to products, ensuring that there is sufficient space around each item for optimal packing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20don%27t%20specify%20free%20space%20or%20rotation%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I don&#8217;t specify free space or rotation for a product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not specify free space or rotation settings for a product, Packaging Fit will use the global settings. This ensures that all products are packed efficiently even if individual settings are not provided.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20packaging%20fit%20help%20me%20compare%20shipping%20costs%3F'>\nCan Packaging Fit help me compare shipping costs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Packaging Fit allows you to compare shipping costs across different packing configurations. By providing detailed packing solutions, the plugin helps you choose the most economical option for shipping your products, reducing overall shipping expenses.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20visual%20packing%20assistance%20work%3F'>\nHow does the visual packing assistance work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Packaging Fit provides visual representations of how products can be arranged within a box using advanced packing algorithms. These visual layouts serve as helpful suggestions rather than strict guidelines, offering a starting point for packers to optimize the packing process. Manual adjustments can be made to achieve an even better fit, ensuring that the packing process is as efficient as possible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20should%20i%20do%20if%20i%20encounter%20an%20issue%20with%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat should I do if I encounter an issue with the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you encounter an issue with Packaging Fit, you can follow these steps to describe the error and seek support:<br />\n1.
