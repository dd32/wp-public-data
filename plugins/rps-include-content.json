For example, you may want to place your company boilerplate at the bottom of press releases in your News section.

There&#8217;s no need to open and modify multiple pages.</p>\n<p>When a user previews the post from the WordPress Administration, the included content is distinguished with an on-hover highlight.

The default is <em>content</em>. Note that if you set the content to none then the title attribute is automatically set to true, since something of the included content should be shown. Using the <em>full</em> option ignores the <em>more</em> tag of the included content.</li>\n<li><strong>length</strong> &#8211; Define the length in words of the text that appears before the more link.

If this is the case then you simply need to add the shortcode attribute &#8220;filter&#8221; and set it to &#8220;true&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20have%20shortcodes%20in%20my%20included%20content%20that%20i%20don%27t%20want%20to%20display%3F'>\nWhat if I have shortcodes in my included content that I don&#8217;t want to display?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add the &#8220;shortcode&#8221; attribute and set it to &#8220;false&#8221;. Keep in mind that using this method will remove all shortcodes from the included content, including any rps-include shortcodes that are designed to call included content that is nested inside other included content. However, this should not affect most users.</p>\n<pre><code>[rps-include post=\"500\" shortcodes=\"false\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may consider using the &#8220;allow_shortcodes&#8221; attribute instead to specify which shortcodes should be displayed when the content is included elsewhere. This overrides the &#8220;shortcode&#8221; attribute setting so there is no need to provide it. Be sure to pass the shortcodes as a comma delimited string as in the example below.</p>\n<pre><code>[rps-include post=\"500\" allow_shortcodes=\"gallery,caption\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20make%20a%20url%20in%20the%20included%20display%20as%20an%20embed%3F'>\nHow do I make a url in the included display as an embed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As long as the URL is on the WordPress embed whitelist you can make it display within the included content by adding the <em>embeds</em> attribute and setting it to <em>true</em>.</p>\n<pre><code>[rps-include post=\"500\" embeds=\"true\"]\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='so%20what%20if%20i%20want%20to%20show%20the%20title%20of%20the%20source%20content%20%28blog%202%2C%20post%20500%29%20wrapped%20in%20an%20h3%20with%20the%20title%20being%20a%20link%3F'>\nSo what if I want to show the title of the source content (blog 2, post 500) wrapped in an h3 with the title being a link?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[rps-include blog=&#8221;2&#8243; post=&#8221;500&#8243; title=&#8221;true&#8221; titletag=&#8221;h3&#8243; titlelink=&#8221;true&#8221;]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20only%20want%20to%20show%20the%20title%20of%20the%20source%20content%3F'>\nWhat if I only want to show the title of the source content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>[rps-include post=&#8221;500&#8243; content=&#8221;none&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Setting the content attribute to &#8216;none&#8217; forces the title to show.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20find%20the%20blog%20and%20post%20ids%3F'>\nHow can I find the blog and post IDs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To easily obtain the blog ID and post ID, install the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rps-blog-info/\" rel=\"ugc\">RPS Blog Info</a> plugin, which places that information (and much more) on your WordPress Toolbar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20include%20pages%20or%20posts%20that%20already%20have%20includes%20within%20them%3F'>\nCan I include pages or posts that already have includes within them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

Users that are not logged in, or do not have the appropriate capability will not see the error message.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20the%20included%20post%20is%20protected%20by%20a%20password%3F'>\nWhat if the included post is protected by a password?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The included post title will appear followed by the password form, just like the default WordPress behavior.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20easily%20access%20the%20source%20content%20to%20edit%20it%3F'>\nHow do I easily access the source content to edit it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The best way is to view the page on the public site while logged in. Each piece of source content will be marked with  an &#8220;i&#8221; symbol and a vertical line appearing in theright margin. Hovering over the included content will display &#8220;View&#8221; and &#8220;Edit&#8221; buttons.  Clicking Edit will take you to the source post/page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20include%20content%20into%20different%20web%20sites%3F'>\nIs it possible to include content into different web sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can include content across different Web sites as long as they are in the same network. A multisite network is a collection of sites that all share the same WordPress installation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20wrap%20the%20output%20from%20the%20plugin%20with%20my%20own%20markup%3F'>\nHow do I wrap the output from the plugin with my own markup?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should use the <code>rps_include_content_html</code> filter by adding the following to your theme’s functions file:</p>\n<pre><code>function rps_include_content_wrap( $html ) {\n    $html = '&lt;div class=\"rps_include_content_wrap\"&gt;' . $html .
