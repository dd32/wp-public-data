        "faq": "\n<h4>I received an email when I tried to login myself. Is this normal?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Because of the way the plug-in works, it will send an email no matter who it is that tries to login. It will also tell you the username attempted as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have the plug-in enabled, but I am not receiving any emails. Whats wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1 &#8211; This could be a few things. Number one, we use the email located in your WordPress dashboard, set under the Settings panel. If this is not the email you have set you wish to be reached at, then you would need to change it in the WordPress Dashboard.</p>\n<pre><code>2 - Check your spam folder. We send the email to you, from yourself.\n\n3 - Your running a server such as IIS, and you don't have a default mail system in place to send the emails. Because we use PHP to send the emails, you will need to speak with your Host provider, to ensure that you can use this feature.\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I see a bunch of user names and just received 30 emails from the plug-in. Is that normal?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>YES! And this is the reason I created the plug-in. If you are seeing a large amount of email alerts, even for your own username, but was not you attempting to login, then someone is attacking your site and trying to brute force their way into your site. We suggest you take the IP address listed in the email alert, and ban them from reaching your site. This is a security plug-in, and as such, is meant to help inform you of such attacks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I found a bug, or have a feature request. Do you think you could implement feature &#8220;xyz&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am always looking for ways to improve my plug-ins, as well as know if you&#8217;ve found any bugs so I can fix them and push them out to WordPress. If there is something you feel would bring value to this plug-in, or a feature specific to your own site, like adding additional email users, I could customize the plug-in for your specific site needs, such as adding additional email addresses, if you have more than one Administrator who handles your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
