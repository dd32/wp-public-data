        "installation": "<p>In order to use the Yougler Profile you must first set up an account at Yougler.com. It is quick, easy, and free.</p>\n<p>After that, login to your WordPress blog, go under the Users tab and set your website address to your Yougler address. For example if your Yougler username were john, enter &#8216;http://www.yougler.com/john&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Download the Yougler plugin from WordPress to your desktop. Upload the entire Yougler plugin folder to your WordPress plugins directory under wp-content/plugins/. You may also visit our plugin page at <a href=\"http://www.yougler.com/wordpress-plugins/yougler-blogger-profile-pages.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> this link </a>.</p>\n<p>Activate your plugin under the WordPress Plugins tab.</p>\n<p>Click options, click Yougler, set add signature and Yougler link at end of post to yes. Enter whatever signature you would like to add to the end of your posts in the box provided or you may leave this blank. Click update and you are done.</p>\n<p>The Yougler Plugin will now create a link to your Yougler Profile page at the end of all your posts. The link name will be your Display name publicly as: setting under the Users tab in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Yougler will display the authors name and url on each post so if a blog has multiple bloggers this should not be an issue.</p>\n<p>Your Yougler page will provide a form mail page for your readers to contact you. On your Yougler page you can also tell your readers a little about yourself or your blog. You can also add a picture (and maybe some more things in the future).</p>\n<p>Do not worry, Yougler is Spam free.</p>\n<p>If you like Yougler please feel free to donate at http://www.yougler.com/_donate.php OR even better, tell others about Yougler in your blogs. Yougler has many uses so look the site over.</p>\n<p>Help make Yougler Blogger Profile popular by blogging, digging, and bookmarking it. Since Yougler is a free site we have no advertising budget. We also hope to add some cool new features in the future.</p>\n<p>You can contact me with comments and suggestions at Yougler.com/pete.</p>\n<p>BTW your readers can also insert their Yougler Profile URLs in their comments so other readers can contact them too without getting spammed.</p>\n<p>Thanks and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Pete</p>\n"
