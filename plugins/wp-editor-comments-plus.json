Different themes may require some help with CSS classes to look and position buttons correctly. Use the Custom CSS settings to include CSS classes that tell the WP Editor Comments Plus buttons how to look and position themselves.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='huh%2C%20why%20doesn%27t%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nHuh, why doesn&#8217;t this plugin work with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Uh oh, it&#8217;s possible your theme uses different IDs than the default WordPress IDs. To accommodate this, you can update the WP Editor Comments Plus Settings -&gt; WordPress IDs &amp; Classes values with any IDs that don&#8217;t match the default IDs ( shown in the empty input boxes ). In case this starts to get too technical, feel free to reach out for help in the plugin page&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-editor-comments-plus\" rel=\"ugc\">support</a> tab.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
