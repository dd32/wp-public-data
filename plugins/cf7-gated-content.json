You can customize the output of the download box with CSS, or you can add this snippet to your theme\\&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>function my_content_button($url, $button_text, $button_classes, $content)\n{\n  return \"$button_text\";\n}\n\nadd_filter('wpcf7_gated_content_button', 'my_content_button', 10, 3);\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I disable the default CSS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The default CSS can be disabled on a per-form basis.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this secure my files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>No!</strong> Gating content does not secure it from outside access. While it does restrict visibility of a download link to those who have completed your form, it does nothing to make the file private. Anyone with the attachment link or a properly formatted cookie will be able to access your file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
