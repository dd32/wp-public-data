This is particularly useful when the visualization is not visible on the page by default, but it becomes visible as result of a user interaction (e.g. clicking on an element, etc.). It is also useful when using the same visualization multiple times on a page for different devices (e.g. using one instance of the plugin for mobile and another one for desktop). We recommend not using this by default but only on scenarios as those described above, as it may provide the end user with a small delay to display the visualization (optional).</p>\n",

For a list of all exchanges currently supported, please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/exchanges\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/exchanges</a>. If the stock exchange you&#8217;re looking for is not in the list, please contact us to info@stockdio.com. Once you have found in the list the stock exchange you need, you must pass the corresponding Exchange Symbol using the stockExchange parameter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20specify%20the%20symbols%20to%20display%3F'>\nHow do I specify the symbols to display?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can specify as many symbols as you want, from the selected exchange, separated by semi-colon (;). If any of the symbols you want to display does not show up, you can go to <a href=\"http://finance.stockdio.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://finance.stockdio.com</a> to verify if the symbol is currently available in Stockdio.

The exchange you define in the stockExchange parameter will be the default stock exchange to be used. However, if you want to include symbols from a different exchange, you must prefix the symbol with the exchange code and a colon (:). For example, if you want to include two symbols from NYSE/Nasdaq but additionally include one symbol from London Stock Exchange, you would specify stockExchange=&#8221;NYSENasdaq&#8221;, and equities=&#8221;AAPL;MSFT;LSE:BAG&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20include%20one%20or%20more%20market%20indices%20in%20the%20stock%20market%20overview%3F'>\nCan I include one or more market indices in the stock market overview?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can include them in the indices parameter.

Can I do that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we understand there are several scenarios in which you may want to display your own name, such as if you would like to display a commodities ticker in your own language. This can be easily done by specifying your custom name between parenthesis, right after you have specified the symbol.

This is particularly useful when the visualization is not visible on the page by default, but it becomes visible as result of a user interaction (e.g. clicking on an element, etc.). It is also useful when using the same visualization multiple times on a page for different devices (e.g. using one instance of the plugin for mobile and another one for desktop). We recommend not using this by default but only on scenarios as those described above, as it may provide the end user with a small delay to display the visualization (optional).</p>\n",
