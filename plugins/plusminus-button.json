You can imagine Woocommerce already, RIGHT, but not with clear plus &#8211; minus buttons.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the PlusMinus button responsive?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The PlusMinus Button can adapt to all devices in different sizes. But please note, if your shop is not responsive, it will be hard to show the PlusMinus Button responsive.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What benefits brings the PlusMinus Button to your customers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It adapts to different device sizes and is always displayed directly next to the <code>Add to cart button</code>. In contrast to arrows or a direct input of the number of the desired product, the plus and the minus are easy to use.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The PlusMinus Button is no good, what you can do then !?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We would appreciate a message in which you communicate your &#8220;annoyance&#8221; with the PlusMinus Button. Only then we can do better. You really want to get rid of the PlusMinus button. Simply deactivate or delete it in the plugin directory.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
