(If none selected, all will be tagged.)</li>\n<li>Use the slider to select the desired relevance score percentage of the tags generated. In general, scores of 80% are considered high, 50% moderate, and 20% low.</li>\n<li>If you wish to re-tag existing content after editing, check the &#8220;Add Tags on Post Update&#8221; box.</li>\n<li>Review batch tagging value. Recommended batch sizes are between 50 and 200, to prevent free Open Calais accounts from exceeding daily request limits. Automatic batches are run every 60 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: At the bottom of the plugin settings, it will display the amount of content remaining that has not yet been tagged. To initiate a batch process manually, click the &#8220;Run Batch Process&#8221; button.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat is Open Calais?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Open Calais is a free web service provided by Refinitiv. The API is used for incorporating semantic functionality into content management systems, applications, websites and even blogs. It enables users to create and attach rich semantic metadata (tags) from their submitted unstructured text.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy should I use Laiser Tag?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unlike other WordPress tagging plugins, Laiser Tag automates the tagging process by analyzing your content after you&#8217;ve saved and published it. There is no intervention required on your part, Laiser Tag takes care of the work. It&#8217;s useful for everyone, but especially useful for highly automated websites which aggregate a lot of content, or create large amounts of content in short periods of time. It&#8217;s also especially good if you simply want a reliable web service to manage the tagging of your site&#8217;s content automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I use other tagging API&#8217;s other than Open Calais?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Not at this time, however in future versions other tagging options may be made available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow often does the batch tagging process run?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The batch process runs once every 60 minutes, taking the newest content first. You can manually initiate a batch process by clicking the &#8220;Run Batch Process&#8221; button on the plugin settings screen. Only one batch may run at a time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nThe batch process keeps saying &#8220;Cannot run batch process; batch already started&#8221; and my posts are not being tagged.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The batch process uses a limiter file to make sure only one can run at a time. Deactivate and reactivate the plugin to reset this file and the batch process should start normally.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
