Users can give consent, or they can choose to block all or specific cookies.</p>\n<h3>Place sensitive cookies after consent has been given</h3>\n<p>Cookies that require consent will not be placed before consent has been given. This feature is essential to comply with the EU cookie law. Sadly, this is the part where many other cookie banner plugins fall short.</p>\n<p>Of course, cookies which do not require consent are placed immediately.</p>\n<h3>Privacy settings</h3>\n<p>Users can adjust their privacy settings at any time through a small form on your site. Even after they have given consent.</p>\n<h3>Built for speed</h3>\n<p>Caching plugins will not interfere with the Hayona Cookie Consent plugin.</p>\n<h3>Implied consent (optional)</h3>\n<p>When you enable implied consent, clicking to the next page will count as consent; cookies are placed and the banner disappears.</p>\n<h3>Google Tag Manager</h3>\n<p>This plugin does not handle the actual loading of tracking scripts but uses <a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Tag Manager</a>. Read more about this in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hayona-cookies/faq/\" rel=\"ugc\">FAQ</a>.</p>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hayona-cookies/installation/\" rel=\"ugc\">installation page</a> for a step by step guide.</p>\n<h3>About the cookie law in the EU</h3>\n<p>Compliance with the EU cookie law comes down to three basic steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you know exactly which cookies your site sets, what they are used for and if they are privacy sensitive, which means that they contain personal identifiable information (PII).</li>\n<li>Inform your visitors precisely how you use cookies.</li>\n<li>Obtain the visitor’s consent and give them some control over their preferences.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hayona-cookies/installation/\" rel=\"ugc\">installation page</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>Detect your cookies</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses Google Tag Manager to place tracking scripts / cookies. Therefore the plugin itself does not block scripts that you have placed directly in your website. This includes all default youtube videos and many social media buttons. Here are some suggestions on how to work around this issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable privacy mode when embedding a YouTube video. This way the embedded video will not place cookies.</li>\n<li>Do not use social media share buttons that place cookies. This includes many well-known solutions like the Facebook like button and the AddThis toolbar.</li>\n<li>We suggest that you use the <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/en/our-solutions/ghostery-add-on/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ghostery browser add-on</a> to measure which other cookies are placed on your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: Implementing this plugin will NOT automatically make your website in compliance with the EU cookie law.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need to install Google Tag Manager to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not handle the actual loading of tracking scripts. We use a dedicated tool for that, called <a href=\"https://www.google.nl/tagmanager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Tag Manager</a>. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No more conflicts with caching plugins</strong>. Loading tracking scripts based on user consent on the server side (within WordPress) usually does not work together with caching plugins. This is the case with many other cookie banner plugins.  This is a no go for us. Google Tag Manager enables us to do all this on the client side. That means that caching plugins do not get in the way anymore. </li>\n<li><strong>To make this plugin as fast as possible</strong>. Small plugins are fast plugins. The less our plugin has to do, the faster it will be. </li>\n<li><strong>To fit the workflow of online marketers</strong>. Tracking scripts are usually placed by marketing people. Since many of them are already using Google Tag Manager (like we do) we thought it would make sense to utilize that.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
