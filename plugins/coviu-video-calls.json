This standard is currently natively supported in Chrome, Firefox and Opera browsers. Internet Edge and Safari support are in progress.</p>\n<p>WebRTC leapfrogs legacy video conferencing technology through better audio and video quality, lower latency, and fully secured connections. Coviu adds additional security through its API.</p>\n<p>Coviu also uses Websockets to do the signalling necessary to make the video call participants aware of themselves.</p>\n<p>The call is subsequently set up directly between all the participants. All audio, video and data flows peer-to-peer directly between the participants and is securely encrypted, so you can be sure that your call is completely private.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get the API Keys for Coviu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sign up for a developer account at https://coviu.com/checkout/team?plan-type=api-plan .<br />\nAfter you sign in, you can create API keys.<br />\nMake sure to remember the password &#8211; it cannot be retrieved via the application.<br />\nYou will find pricing information associated with this API at https://coviu.com/checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work on mobile devices?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On mobile devices, Coviu works in the same browsers as on the desktop.<br />\nCoviu also offers Android and iOS applications in which the video calls can be held.<br />\nFor more information, see https://coviu.com/downloads</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is a session?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here are a couple of terms that we use and what they mean.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session: A Coviu call that occurs between two or more parties at a specified time, and has a finite duration. A Coviu call is a web (video, audio, data) call on Coviu held through either a browser, native app, or mobile. Currently sessions may have up to 5 participants.</li>\n<li>Participants: Users who may participate in a coviu call. We distinguish between hosts and guests.</li>\n<li>Hosts: A session participant who is hosting a session and who controls access to the session. Also called the session owner. In this plugin, they are registered wordpress users.</li>\n<li>Guest: A session participante who has been granted access to a session by the host.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How are a session host and a session guest matched up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Coviu API creates unique links to Coviu rooms where sessions can take place.<br />\nA session host is given a unique link and is able to enter the Coviu room immediately.<br />\nA session guest is given a different unique link, which only allows them to knock.<br />\nThe session host has to let the session guest enter to proceed with the session.</p>\n<p>For example, a doctor&#8217;s clinic runs a wordpress site and gets an API key from Coviu. The Clinic can then set up sessions for all of their doctors. A session is created by picking a date, start and end time and associating it with a doctor. Now the session has an owner. Guest links can now be created and shared with patients.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Holding sessions in WordPress pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to hold Coviu session on WordPress pages rather than on a coviu.com URL,<br />\nyou will want to activate the embedding of call pages in wordpress pages.<br />\nYou do that on the &#8216;Coviu Calls&#8217; settings page.<br />\nAfter that, the links on the Appointments page go to other WordPress pages and<br />\nyou are able to theme the layout of the page that surrounds the embedded Coviu call.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WordPress user roles and Appointments</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the logged in user has a &#8216;subscriber&#8217; role only, then they will only see their own apppointments, i.e. appointments where they are one of the hosts. Also, when they create<br />\na new appointemnt, the appointment will automatically have them as a host.<br />\nAll other users when logged in see all the appointments of all hosts.<br />\nEveryone can schedule appointments for any WordPress users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I use Coviu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Coviuâ€™s particular strength is in its focus on documents and data and its focus on keeping all the conversation and data shielded from external intrusion.</p>\n<p>Coviu goes beyond mere video conferencing.</p>\n<p>It allows the live sharing of documents and data and the live sharing of annotations on the rendered documents and data.</p>\n<p>This includes the sharing of a whiteboard to allow collaborative discussion and design.</p>\n<p>It also allows sharing of document camera input and thus the digitisation of paper documents.</p>\n<p>Coviu is extensible for other shared data. If you have a use case that is not satisfied yet, contact support@coviu.com.</p>\n<p>New features are being added constantly &#8211; you can always try out Coviu with a free &#8216;me&#8217; account at http://coviu.com/.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What shortcodes are available?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin currently provides no shortcodes.<br />\nIf you need any, please contact support@coviu.com.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
