No monthly subscriptions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20use%20jellyreach%3F'>\nHow much does it cost to use Jellyreach?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The price depends on the number of contacts in your Jellyreach account. With a one-time payment deal, you can cut recurring costs and save a lot of money. This saving increases as time passes and your number of contacts increases.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say that you have a list of 10k contacts. If you use Mailchimp, that would cost you around $948 per year, for their smallest plan.</p>\n<p>With the Jellyreach one-time payment deal, 10k contacts would cost you $99. Only in the first year, you would save 90% of your budget. Plus, you’d get forever access to all features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20want%20to%20upgrade%20my%20plan%20in%20the%20future%3F'>\nWhat if I want to upgrade my plan in the future?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As a one-time payment account owner, you will never have to switch to a monthly subscription. In the future, when this offer expires, you can upgrade to a higher plan just by paying the difference according to the pricing at the time of your initial payment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20such%20a%20price%20difference%20compared%20to%20other%20solutions%3F'>\nWhy is there such a price difference compared to other solutions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s because of an exclusive one-time payment offer. When this offer expires, there will be no such significant difference in pricing between Jellyreach and other solutions with similar features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20try%20jellyreach%20for%20free%3F'>\nCan I try Jellyreach for free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>During the one-time payment deal offer, in the first 30 days, if you’re not satisfied, you can get 100% of your money back with no questions asked. Also, feel free to schedule a demo call with us by clicking here.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20cancel%20a%20one-time%20payment%20deal%3F'>\nHow can I cancel a one-time payment deal?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To cancel a one-time payment deal, simply send an email to support@jellyreach.com. If you cancel the deal in the first 30 days from payment, we will return 100% of your money, with no questions asked.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
