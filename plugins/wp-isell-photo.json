Lot of users don&#8217;t even know about this neat little feature of WordPress. WP iSell Photo plugin will help you convert a built in WordPress gallery into a photo selling platform.</p>\n<p><strong>a)</strong> Creating a Photo Gallery in WordPress</p>\n<p>Create a new post/page on your WordPress Dashboard. There is an option to upload/insert media. Now select the photos/images from your computer and upload them to the media library. As you upload each image you will see a &#8220;Gallery&#8221; tab which contains those images. Switch to that tab once you are ready to insert the gallery to your current post/page.</p>\n<p>There are some options that you can configure for the gallery you just created (under the &#8220;Gallery Settings&#8221; section).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Link thumbnails to: a) Attachment Page (the page/post you are currently editing) b) Media File c) None</li>\n<li>Columns: 1 &#8211; 9 ( Number of thumbnails in each row)</li>\n<li>Thumbnail Order: a) Random b) Reverse c) Custom (Drag and drop to reorder images)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally hit the &#8220;Insert Gallery&#8221; button and the gallery will be automatically inserted to your current post/page.</p>\n<p>If you want to edit the gallery at any time you can always select the gallery (It looks like a rectangular image in the visual editor) and click on the &#8220;Edit&#8221; option.

For example:</p>\n<pre><code>[gallery amount=\"5.00\" ids=\"126,125,124,123,122\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>now each image of the current gallery will have a &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button with price 5.00</p>\n<p>You can also customize the look and feel of the &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button. Simply include a <code>button</code> parameter in the gallery shortcode and specify the text you want to use for the button. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>[gallery amount=\"3.99\" button=\"Buy it Now\" ids=\"126,125,124,123,122\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to use an image for the button you can do so by specifying the URL in the <code>button</code> parameter. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>[gallery amount=\"3.99\" button=\"http://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynow_LG.gif\" ids=\"126,125,124,123,122\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>For detailed documentation please visit the <a href=\"https://wp-ecommerce.net/wp-isell-photo-easily-sell-photos-wordpress-1800\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress iSell Photo</a> plugin page</p>\n",
