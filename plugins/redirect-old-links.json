If I find a post that matches, I&#8217;ll just redirect the visitor to that post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do you know when a post matches?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I take the last &#8220;chunk&#8221; of the URL and assume it&#8217;s a post name. Then I search for any posts with that name. If I find one, I redirect the user to the post I found. Since I use this method, I won&#8217;t work for <em>all</em> permalink structures. But the vast majority end in the post name, so I&#8217;ll work just fine on most sites.</p>\n<p>Examples:<br />\n* /2017/02/this-is-the-last-chunk/<br />\n* /announcements/this-is-the-last-chunk/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you work with custom post types like ecommerce products?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure do!
