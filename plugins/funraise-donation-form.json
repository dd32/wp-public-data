Funraise is a PCI Compliant Service Provider and tokenizes all credit card information in a PCI Level 1 certified tokenization vault. Communications to and from Funraise servers are encrypted by TLS 1.2+.</p>\n<h4>Processing fees</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>With Funraise you can connect your own Stripe, PayPal, or other payment processor. These payment processors charge a fee; for nonprofits collecting donations using Stripe or PayPal, this is usually 2.2% + 30Â¢.</li>\n<li>Funraise offers a free plan, with no monthly subscription costs. With the Free plan, Funraise charges an additional 3.5% for online donations. Funraise&#8217;s Platform Fee is based on your plan.</li>\n</ul>\n",
