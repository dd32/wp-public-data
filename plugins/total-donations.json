There you&#8217;ll be able to add new fields and customize the form the way you need them. After you have set that up, head over to the &#8217;email settings&#8217; page and set up your auto-reply &#8216;thank yous&#8217; and the email addresses to notify upon a successful donation.<br />\n Once you have it set up correctly, paste the shortcode [totaldonations] inside the page you&#8217;d like the form to show up on and then run some tests.
