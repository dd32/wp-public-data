        "description": "<p>The Live Property Map/List WordPress plugin was designed specifically for real estate developers who would like to include always up-to-date pricing and availability within their website.  The plugin allows the users of PropertyEngine, a third party service, to imbed live property information within WordPress websites by means of a shortcode.  The information displayed via the plugin includes a real estate map view showing availability, size, price and other information which would be of interest to clients. Alternatively, users are able to switch to a table or list view showing up to date property information in a familiar spreadsheet format.</p>\n<p>Unlike the majority of plugins, which are focussed upon single suburban homes, the Live Property Map/List plugin is geared specifically towards projects that involve the administration of many units in one geographic area, including estates, housing projects, apartments, condos, security complexes and other developments.</p>\n<p>The unique benefits of the plugin is the ability to update a record, and see this propagate immediately to the client website, in other words,  a dynamic relationship is maintained between the database of stored information and the information displayed on the public site.</p>\n<p>The dual list and map view caters for two unique ways of viewing and interpreting real estate information.  The ability to change a map symbolisation based upon a database entry is a further distinguishing feature, providing an immediately apparent view of property availability.</p>\n<p>The Live Property Map/List WordPress plugin makes it possible to forego the tedious tasks of trying to match sales reports from various agents, and does so by presenting a unified view in an ultra-accessible format.</p>\n<p>We have a live demo for those interested in how it looks and works : <a href=\"http://wordpress.propertyplugins.com/propertyengine-standard-view/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a></p>\n<p><strong>Hot Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>switch from TinyMCE to HTML without loosing anything!</li>\n<li>easy insertion from TinyMCE</li>\n<li>autoconfigure from copy/paste code</li>\n<li>minimal shortcodes (1 option and it runs)</li>\n<li>inline documentation for people who want to manually write PropertyEngine Shortcodes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Available PropertyEngine Widgets</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>LiveList Widget</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Built-in Translations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to look at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/propertyengine-real-estate/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">screenshots</a> if you are not convinced.</p>\n",
