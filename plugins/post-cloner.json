Once the permalinks are changed from the defaults you should have no problem changing the permlink of your page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20%28a%29%20custom%20post%20type%28s%29%20registered%20on%20my%20site.%20can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20to%20clone%20it%3F'>\nI have (a) custom post type(s) registered on my site. Can I use this plugin to clone it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We&#8217;ve built out a settings page (<code>'Settings &gt; WP Post Cloner'</code>) where you can specify which post types are cloneable. By default only pages and posts are active. You can add or remove any registered post type on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20custom%20post%20type%20doesn%27t%20have%20a%20%27duplicate%27%20button.%20why%20not%3F'>\nMy custom post type doesn&#8217;t have a &#8216;Duplicate&#8217; button. Why not?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to ensure that you&#8217;ve assigned the psot type as &#8216;clone-able&#8217; on the settings page. Head into <code>'Settings &gt; WP Post cloner'</code> and click inside the input field to reveal a full list of registered post types. You&#8217;ll want to make sure that your custom post type appears on this list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20whole%20bunch%20of%20custom%20meta%20assigned%20to%20my%20posts%2Fpages%2Fcustom%20post%20type%2C%20will%20this%20plugin%20transfer%20over%20everything%3F'>\nI have a whole bunch of custom meta assigned to my posts/pages/custom post type, will this plugin transfer over everything?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
