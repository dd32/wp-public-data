AutoCHMOD intensively use the <a href=\"http://it2.php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP chmod command</a>: if this funcion is usable on your system, AutoCHMOD would run just fine.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin works out-of-the-box?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe, or maybe not. You must double-check the configuration of the permission you&#8217;ll grant to your file and folders: if the configuration isn&#8217;t correct for your server, WordPress could not run anymore and you&#8217;ll need to restore the correct permissions manually. In future releases I&#8217;ll try to check the configuration BEFORE applying it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
