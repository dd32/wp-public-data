Once users become generally aware of the option, people just seeking attention may either be more polite or move somewhere else, while regular commenters &#8211; and lurkers &#8211; may become more willing to engage.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FE7jWG0w50s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>As depicted in the above video, the plug-in will add a (customizable) button to all comments (<em>in suitable WordPress installations</em> &#8211; see note below).

For the overwhelming majority of users &#8211; those who have cookies enabled and who return using the same browser &#8211; the &#8220;on ignore&#8221; designation will persist across multiple sessions.</p>\n<p>Customization options include a choice of any of four automatic button positions, and also of placement via template files or theme function.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install and activate the plugin</li>\n<li>View a comment thread and click the little gray x that (in the vast majority of cases) will show up next to each comment author&#8217;s name. They&#8217;ll be put &#8220;on ignore&#8221; (they won&#8217;t know!). Click the green x that replaced the gray one to un-ignore them.</li>\n<li>If the x&#8217;s don&#8217;t show up, or if you&#8217;re not happy with the results, or you just want to try some alternatives out, the settings pages offer a range of further options.</li>\n<li>Alert your commenters to the new tool or (or virtual weapon) at their disposal.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p><em>Installed it &#8211; but it&#8217;s not working as expected &#8211; so what do I do?</em></p>\n<p>You might have problems with another plugin that takes over and significantly changes the standard comment template, or that minifies or concatenates javascript (jQuery) and CSS files ineffectively. Try turning off plug-ins, starting with the best candidate for conflict, and seeing whether doing so fixes things. Let me know what you find out!</p>\n<p><em>Well, it&#8217;s kind of working, but the changes commenters make aren&#8217;t being carried over on the next refresh &#8211; why not?</em></p>\n<p>CIB was tested with major page-caching plug-ins, including the two by far most popular ones (WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache). Assuming your users have cookies enabled and are using the same browser, &#8220;on ignore&#8221; effects should both remain visible on page refresh and persistently. If it&#8217;s not working that way, let me know! (For more, see <a href=\"http://ckmacleod.com/2016/11/30/solution-caches-vs-cookies-going-get-trouble/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;Is This Solution for Caches vs Cookies Going to Get Me in Trouble?&#8221;</a> )</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve added the &#8220;On Ignore&#8221; list to my comments.php template, but it&#8217;s not showing up &#8211; so?</em></p>\n<p>It won&#8217;t show up at all if you don&#8217;t have anyone on ignore. The &#8220;Commenting Guidelines&#8221; header won&#8217;t show up unless you tick the box in settings. Otherwise, be sure that the template you&#8217;re editing is the one your theme is actually using: Some plug-ins, and not just major 3rd Party commenting systems like Disqus and Facebook Comments, will hijack your comments template and substitute their own, without making it clear that they&#8217;re doing so. To identify the source of the problem, first try disconnecting any plug-ins that affect comment threads, then try turning them all off except for Commenter Ignore Button, or try switching themes.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve tried all of the options, including the &#8220;Add CSS&#8221; alternative, and I still can&#8217;t get it right with my theme &#8211; can you code it for me?</em></p>\n<p>I can take a look at whatever problem you&#8217;re having, and, further, especially while the plug-in is new, I&#8217;m interested in accumulating documentable &#8220;use cases&#8221; and fixes, but I can&#8217;t promise to do extensive styling and custom-coding for you without compensation.</p>\n<p><em>How about extending CIB to &#8220;recent comments&#8221; widgets and other commenting widgets and things?</em></p>\n<p>Could be done, but only if you want to try some custom coding. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to wait for release of the developer&#8217;s <a href=\"http://ckmacleod.com/wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;Commentariat Suite&#8221;</a>, with which CIB will be integrated.</p>\n<p><em>How do you have all of these FAQs if this is the first version of the plug-in?</em></p>\n<p>From time to time while working on this thing, I&#8217;ve found myself perplexed, or aware of more that I could do, so frequently ask certain questions of myself or of the developer community&#8230;</p>\n",
