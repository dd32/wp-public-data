Go to the sharing and promote section at Magcloud and you will find the HTML code there.</p>\n<h4>Why is there a HTML file?</h4>\n<p>The plugin uses a parser library to parse the code from MagCloud. This would load the server if it happens several times. Therefore, instead of parsing every single visit, we parse it only once and generate the HTML file that is included later.</p>\n"
