        "description": "<p>There are many WordPress plugins out there which does a lot of fancy things with the cookie consent. We didn&#8217;t find one we really liked that was really lightweight and developer friendly and so we created our own.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t meant for the masses who want tons of configurable options in the admin (although it will work and look fine out of the box). Many use this plugin with the default styling because it is so light-weight and good-looking.</p>\n<p>For the developer who wants the functionality and being able to conveniently override the styles in the theme without bloatâ€”here&#8217;s a plugin for you. You have filters and actions available to you at every step of the process.</p>\n<p>See the installation section for more information on how to install. The FAQ section has important information on how to customize the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>Included in the package are complete translations for the following languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lithuanian (Thanks @batiufa)</li>\n<li>Swedish</li>\n<li>Occitan (Thanks Mejans)</li>\n<li>Norwegian</li>\n<li>Danish</li>\n<li>Hungarian</li>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n<li>Slovenian</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A complete <em>.pot</em> file is available in the <em>translations/</em> directory. If you use and translate this little plugin, please send us the translation so it can be included!</p>\n<p><strong>Even better</strong> is if you use Translate.WordPress.org for your translations. That way, they will be automatically distributed with the WordPress updater.<br />\nHowever, in some locales, the work with the Translate site is not up to speed. We will continue to support included translations for a while.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>We recommend using the built-in plugin installer in WordPress. If you wish to install the plugin manually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>ilmenite-cookie-consent</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Insert a link to your cookie policy in the &#8216;Settings &gt; Reading&#8217; page.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20the%20cookie%20policy%20link%3F'>\nHow do I set the cookie policy link?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can set the URL to the cookie policy page in the customizer under the &#8220;Cookie Banner&#8221; section, or use the filter <code>ilcc_policy_url</code> to return your own link.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20customize%20the%20style%20or%20disable%20it%20completely%3F'>\nHow do I customize the style or disable it completely?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Out of the box, the plugin includes a lightweight stylesheet with two placement options (top &amp; overlay). If you don&#8217;t want to use our default coloring, you can easily prevent us from including the styles.</p>\n<p>Just define the following filter somewhere in your code, such as the theme functions.php file:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'ilcc_load_stylesheet', '__return_false' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, for quick theming to your theme&#8217;s custom colors, we support a series of CSS variables set on <code>body.has-ilcc-banner</code> like so:</p>\n<pre><code>body.has-ilcc-banner {\n    --ilcc-background-color: #282b2d;\n    --ilcc-text-color: #ccc;\n    --ilcc-link-color: #ccc;\n    --ilcc-link-color-hover: #fff;\n    --ilcc-banner-spacing: 1.4rem 0;\n    --ilcc-close-button: #474d50;\n    --ilcc-close-button-hover: #666;\n    --ilcc-close-button-text: white;\n    --ilcc-close-button-hover-text: white;\n    --ilcc-button-radius: 4px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you would like to add your own style in addition to the two offered, you can override the style setting with the <code>ilcc_style</code> filter. This would let you style outside the two core positions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20texts%20and%2For%20button%20label%3F'>\nCan I change the texts and/or button label?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can change the the two lines of text and the button label from the customizer under the &#8220;Cookie Banner&#8221; section. Alternatively you can use a set of filters to return values before rendering.</p>\n<p>Modiyfing the title: <code>ilcc_consent_title</code><br />\nModiyfing the text info: <code>ilcc_consent_text</code><br />\nModiyfing the accept button label: <code>ilcc_accept_text</code></p>\n<p>Just set their value somewhere in your code, such as in the functions.php file of your theme:</p>\n<pre><code>function ilcc_modify_consent_text( $text ) {\n    $text = __( 'This is my custom text about how we use cookies.', 'YOURTEXTDOMAIN' );\n    return $text;\n}\n\nadd_filter( 'ilcc_consent_text', 'ilcc_modify_consent_text' );\n\nfunction ilcc_modify_accept_text( $text ) {\n    $text = __( 'I Accept', 'YOURTEXTDOMAIN' );\n    return $text;\n}\n\nadd_filter( 'ilcc_accept_text', 'ilcc_modify_accept_text' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20actions%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat actions are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ilcc_loaded &#8211; Runs on constructor.</p>\n<pre><code>before_ilcc_init - Runs before we have run any init actions.\n\nilcc_init - Runs when all init hooks have run.\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20filters%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat filters are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ilcc_has_user_consented &#8211; Specifiy if the user has accepted or not. True or false value. Has arguments $cookie_name and $cookie_value.</p>\n<pre><code>ilcc_cookie_active_value - Set which value is \"active\" for the cookie, ie. consented. Defaults to 1.\n\nilcc_cookie_name - Set the name of the cookie. Defaults to 'EUConsentCookie'.\n\nilcc_accept_text - Set the accept button text.\n\nilcc_consent_text - Set the consent text.

(#16)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 3.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Lithuanian translation (thanks @batiufa)</li>\n<li>Fixed an array offset warning (#14)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 3.0.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed an issue where we passed script tags to an wp_add_inline_script function callback, causing a doing_it_wrong notice.</p>\n<h4>Version 3.0.0</h4>\n<p>Major update with potentially breaking changes.</p>\n<p>We are now finally respecting not to set any tracking cookies unless the user has actually accepted all cookies. We keep a running list of trackers that we disable automatically. From analytics to marketing. You can modify the list of trackers via filters in the code or the settings screen.</p>\n<p>As a developer, you can disable the settings screens via filters.</p>\n<p>To support this, the plugin has been extended quite a bit. There are numerous new strings, filters and options.</p>\n<p>We have also added a new style, &#8220;take over&#8221;, if you&#8217;d prefer to force the user to make a choice before allowing them into your website. The &#8220;overlay&#8221; style has now been made the default one for new installs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the <code>ilcc_preferences_cookie_name</code> filter to replace the now removed <code>ilcc_cookie_name</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>ilcc_categories_cookie_name</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>ilcc_remember_duration</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>ilcc_tracker_settings_enabled</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Removed the <code>ilcc_has_user_consented</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Removed the <code>ilcc_cookie_active_value</code> filter.</li>\n<li>Replaced <code>ilcc_edit_text_capability</code>, <code>ilcc_edit_title_capability</code>, <code>ilcc_edit_button_capability</code> and <code>ilcc_edit_policy_url_capability</code> with a simpler <code>ilcc_edit_texts_capability</code> that takes the setting as an argument.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.0.5</h4>\n<p>When no policy URL is set in the customer, the default integrity policy URL from the WordPress settings will be loaded.</p>\n<p>For those translating via WPML and Polylang, we have added a configuration file that makes the strings you add in the customizer translatable.</p>\n<h4>Version 2.0.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed a bug where the consent duration wasn&#8217;t set properly, resulting in us asking the user to consent way more often. The plugin will now (correctly) remember the consent for 30 days, unless the user clears their cookies.</p>\n<h4>Version 2.0.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed compatibility issues with jQuery 3. Thanks Viktor.</p>\n<h4>Version 2.0.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed a small issue where our build script wasn&#8217;t processing fallbacks for the new CSS variables correctly.</p>\n<p>This could lead to the default style not loading properly in older browsers (such as IE 11). This update fixes<br />\nthis behavior.</p>\n<p>As a result, the variables are now defined on :root {}.</p>\n<h4>Version 2.0.1</h4>\n<p>Svn is svn. Contains nothing new apart from fixing the release archive.<br />\nIf you managed to update to 2.0.0 in the few minute window before this was<br />\naddressed, 2.0.1 takes care of things for you. If not, enjoy the 2.0.0 update.</p>\n<h4>Version 2.0.0</h4>\n<p>In this major release we&#8217;ve made many code improvements as well as improvements to class names<br />\nand the JavaScript that powers most of the features.
