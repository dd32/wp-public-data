With this plugin you can use the title of the post itself, and trim it as needed.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>limits the length of the previous and next post titles to the number of characters you want</li>\n<li>where necessary, truncates the title to the last space, adding three dots</li>\n<li>shows the entire title of the post in the tooltip (mysteriously wordpress never considers the tooltips of the links)</li>\n<li>sets the string that conditionally will appear before the link title, only if the link title itself is present (previously in wordpress you either had to add a string outside of the &#8216;next/previous post&#8217; tag, thus causing it to appear in the page even if the link was not present, or you had to add the string inside the link generated by wordpress, with ugly results: for example if the string was just a simple dividing character like &#8216;|&#8217;)</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Extract, upload to the plugins folder of your wordpress install, activate.</p>\n<p>How to use:</p>\n<p>This plugin adds two specific functions to your wordpress install: <code>my_prev_post_link</code> and <code>my_next_post_link</code>.<br />\nThese two functions are very similar to, and support the same variables of the original wordpress tags they are meant to replace (please refer to the relative wordpress codex pages for their use), <code>previous_post_link</code> and <code>next_post_link</code>.<br />\nMy replacement functions anyway come with two additional variables: <code>$string_lenght</code> and <code>$pre_link</code>. Not that you really needed to know how they were called.</p>\n<p>The first variable indicates the maximum length for the title (default is 22 characters). The second the string to be displayed before the link (only if the link itself is present).</p>\n<p>So, you&#8217;ll just have to replace <code>&lt;?php next_post_link(); ?&gt;</code> in your template with <code>&lt;?php my_next_post_link() ?&gt;</code>, obviously indicating between the brackets the variables you want to specify. Again, refer to the wordpress codex for usage of variables: only keep in mind that my two additional variables, <code>$string_lenght</code> and <code>$pre_link</code>, are the second last and last variable of the function.</p>\n",
