The whole process takes about 5 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I need my own Yelp API keys? Why can&#8217;t you just provide me with one?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This widget works with the Yelp API and each site developer must have their own. If I were to provide you with mine I&#8217;d be breaking Yelp&#8217;s API rules and terms.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can I only display up to 3 reviews? I want to display all of my reviews&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry that is not up to me. The API and YELP&#8217;s terms only allow the latest 3 exerpts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My reviews are not showing in full, It only displays exerpts</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Again Yelp will allow only exerpts not the full review, but don&#8217;t worry a link to the full review is posted right below it ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
