        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;WP Review Restaurant&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking <em>Install Now</em>.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it</li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n<p>Once installed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a page called &#8220;restaurants&#8221; and inside place the <code>[restaurants]</code> shortcode. This will list your restaurants. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note when using shortcodes</strong>, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the &#8216;text&#8217; tab. Then remove any &#8216;pre&#8217; or &#8216;code&#8217; tags wrapping your shortcode.</p>\n<h4>Template overrides</h4>\n<p>Within the plugin folder there is a ‘templates’ directory where frontend views are stored. This includes, for example, the form and form fields. These templates get loaded by plugin when it needs to display content.</p>\n<h4>Overriding templates via a theme</h4>\n<p>Template files can be overridden via your theme should you wish to customise them. To override a template, move it to yourtheme/review_restaurant/, keeping the path within ‘templates’ intact.</p>\n<p>For example, if I wanted to override pagination.php I would move it to mytheme/review_restaurant/pagination.php and edit my theme’s version.</p>\n<p>Please note, if these files are updated in the core plugin, you may need to update your custom version in the future to maintain compatibility. Therefore it is advised to only override the template files you need to customise.</p>\n<h4>Overriding templates through code</h4>\n<p>Plugin developers can also override templates by filtering the ‘review_restaurant_locate_template’ filter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nreturn apply_filters( &#8216;review_restaurant_locate_template&#8217;, $template, $template_name, $template_path );\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Returning your own template path will override all others.</p>\n",
