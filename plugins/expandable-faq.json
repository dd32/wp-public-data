        "description": "<p><strong>First</strong> &#8211; differently than any other similar plugin, this plugin is based on MIT license, which is a holly-grail for premium theme authors on i.e. ThemeForest or similar marketplaces.<br />\nDifferently to standard GPLv2 license you are not required to open-source your theme and you <strong>CAN</strong> include this plugin into your premium websites bundle packs.<br />\nI do say here <strong>bundle packs</strong>, because you should never have an F.A.Q. to be a part of your theme, because that would be a bad idea &#8211; you need to leave your customers a flexibility for the future scale:<br />\nWhat if your customers will decide later go with some kind of fancy <strong>knowledge base</strong> system like in Change.org <code>/help/</code> part or Envato.com <code>Support</code> part &#8211; if your customer will grow that big, he won&#8217;t need to have F.A.Q. plugin anymore on their website, he will want to replace it with that fancy <strong>knowledge base</strong> system.<br />\nSo my advise is to include this plugin in your bundle pack&#8217;s <code>/Optional Plugins/</code> folder, so that you can tell about in the installation instructions, but make it fully independent from your theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong> &#8211; this plugin is fully <strong>MVC + Templates</strong> based. This means that it&#8217;s code is not related at all to it&#8217;s UI, and that allows you easily to override it&#8217;s UI templates and Assets (CSS, JS, Images) by your theme very easily (and there is detailed step-by-step instructions given how to do that).<br />\nThis means that you making a theme to be what the theme has to be &#8211; a UI part of your website, nothing more.</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong> &#8211; it is much more secure than any other plugin&#8217;s on the market. It is based on top-end S.O.L.I.D. coding principle with input data validation with data-patterns, output escaping.</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong> &#8211; this plugin is scalable – it’s source code is fully object-oriented, clean &amp; logical, based on MVC architectural pattern with templates engine, compliant with strict PSR-2 coding standard and PSR-4 autoloaders, and easy to understand how to add new features on your own.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifth</strong> &#8211; this plugin works well with big databases &amp; high-traffic websites – it is created on optimal BCNF database structure and was tested on live website with 1M customers database and 500,000 active daily views.</p>\n<p><strong>Sixth</strong> &#8211; it does support official WordPress multisite as network-enabled plugin, as well as it does have support WPML string translation.<br />\nAt this point, if you need more than one language, I&#8217;d strongly advise to go with official WordPress multisite setup, because it is free, it is official (so you will never need to worry about the future support), and, most important &#8211; WordPress multisite is much more suitable for websites that needs to scale. You don&#8217;t want to have that additional translation bottle-neck code layer to be processed via database.</p>\n<p><strong>Seventh</strong> &#8211; it has nice user experience &#8211; it&#8217;s has a default design, it does allow you to have more than one F.A.Q. item open at the same time &#8211; so it don&#8217;t have that annoying <code>accordion</code> feature.</p>\n<p><strong>But the most important</strong> is that this plugin is and always be <strong>ads-free</strong>. I personally really hate these <strong>freemium</strong>, <strong>ads-full</strong> or <strong>tracking</strong> plugins which makes majority of the plugins on w.org plugins directory (and, actually, many of premium marketplaces). So this is the key features we always maintain:<br />\n1. Never track your data (nor even by putting some kind of GDPR-compliance agreement checkbox, like <code>Error Log Monitor</code> plugin),<br />\n2. Never make it pseudo-ads-full (even such a big plugins like <code>WooCommerce</code> or <code>Contact Form 7</code> has nearly 80% of their home screen or 20% of their main buttons about <code>how to install \\ buy other plugins</code><br />\n&#8211; this is a really ugly behavior of pushing-more and going to Facebook-like business, where you get like drug-addicted to company products).</p>\n<p>The goal of this plugin is to full-fill the needs of website-starter, that needs a great tool which can last him for many years until it will grow that big so he would grow-out current plugins and would need some kind of different plugins.</p>\n<p>And, I believe, that many other developers had the same issue when tried to create their first premium theme or set-up a website for their client. Starting with the issues with license type to the moment when F.A.Q. is <code>hardcoded</code> into theme code.</p>\n<p>So I wanted to help all these developers to save their time, and I&#8217;m releasing this plugin for you to simplify your work. And I&#8217;m releasing it under MIT license, which allows you to use this plugin your website bundle without any restrictions for both &#8211; free and commercial use.</p>\n<p>Plus &#8211; I&#8217;m giving a promise to you, that this plugin is and will always be 100% free, without any ads, &#8216;Subscribe&#8217;, &#8216;Follow us&#8217;, &#8216;Check our page&#8217;, &#8216;Get Pro Version&#8217; or similar links.</p>\n<p>Finally &#8211; the code is poetry &#8211; <strong>the better is the web, the happier is the world</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Live Demo</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://nativerental.com/cars/faq/\" title=\"Expandable FAQ (Live Demo)\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Expandable FAQ (Live Demo)</a></p>\n<h3>GitHub Repository (for those, who want to contribute via &#8220;Pull Requests&#8221;)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SolidMVC/ExpandableFAQ\" title=\"ExpandableFAQ @GitHub\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/SolidMVC/ExpandableFAQ</a></p>\n",

Also these functions may be valuable for developers, that wants to have their HTML templates (or PHP-enhanced templates) be fully based only on SolidMVC (MIT-licensed), and not WordPress (GPL-licensed), as in this case your templates would be intensively calling only the MIT-licensed SolidMVC micro-framework’s functions.
