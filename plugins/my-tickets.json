This may be turned off in your installation. There are two places to look to enable it. First, go to My Calendar &gt; Settings and go to the Input Settings section. If the &#8216;registration&#8217; option isn&#8217;t checked, check it and save settings. Second, go to the Add Event screen. If the registration options still aren&#8217;t visible, you may need to enable them in your personal Screen Options. Open the Screen Options panel and check the option there &#8211; these are settings that apply only to your account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20trying%20to%20sell%20tickets%20on%20a%20recurring%20event%20in%20my%20calendar%2C%20but%20all%20the%20dates%20are%20the%20same'>\nI&#8217;m trying to sell tickets on a recurring event in My Calendar, but all the dates are the same\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>My Tickets data is associated with post IDs, and My Calendar&#8217;s recurring events are all based off the same event post. As a result, My Tickets doesn&#8217;t work with recurring events in My Calendar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20visit%20the%20%27tickets%27%20or%20%27receipts%27%20pages%2C%20i%20end%20up%20on%20the%20purchase%20page.%20what%27s%20happening%3F'>\nIf I visit the &#8216;Tickets&#8217; or &#8216;Receipts&#8217; pages, I end up on the Purchase page.

My Tickets won&#8217;t sell an unlimited number of tickets for an event; in order for My Tickets to sell anything, you need to specify how many tickets it&#8217;s allowed to sell.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
