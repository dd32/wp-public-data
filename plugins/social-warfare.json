        "description": "<p>Get more social shares which can lead to more website traffic with the best WordPress social sharing plugin! Built by a group of social media marketing experts and world class developers who are obsessed with performance. Learn more at <a href=\"https://warfareplugins.com/?utm_medium=repository&amp;utm_campaign=description&amp;utm_source=wordpress_org&amp;utm_content=repo_description\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Warfare Plugins</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Sharing Plugin</h4>\n<p>Most WordPress social sharing plugins slow down your site, are not attractive, and don&#8217;t work the way you would hope. Social Warfare share buttons are both lightning fast and beautiful.</p>\n<p>Not only will it never slow down your website like other sharing plugins, we give you the most attractive share buttons available that look great no matter what screen size or resolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social Warfare has boosted social shares by <strong>300%</strong> without slowing down my blog.<br />\n  Eddie Gear &#8211; Professional Blogger</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can choose from the top social networks sharing buttons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Mix</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also choose where you want the share buttons to show up. Choose from the following placement options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Above the post content</li>\n<li>Below the post content</li>\n<li>Both above and below the post content</li>\n<li>None (or) Manual placement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also give you the ability to have <strong>floating share buttons</strong> follow your readers down the screen when static (non-floating) buttons are not in view. This way the reader will always have easy access to your share buttons, no matter where they scroll on your page.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;This is by far the best looking social sharing plugin I have seen on the net!&#8221;<br />\n  David Foster, Online Personality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Popular Posts Widget based on Social Share Counts</h4>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you love to show what your most popular posts are based on the number of social shares they&#8217;ve received? Social Warfare allows you to do just that.</p>\n<p>You can even choose to display most your popular posts based on which social network they were popular on!</p>\n<p>Social Warfare&#8217;s Popular Posts widget allows you to display and customize the look with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post thumbnail images</li>\n<li>Image and text size</li>\n<li>Custom visual themes</li>\n<li>Custom date range</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Click to Tweet Quotes</h4>\n<p>A simple and effective way to create tweetable quotes right inside your posts or pages. This has proven to increase the average number of tweets per article dramatically.</p>\n<h4>Use Shortcodes to Manually Place Social Share Buttons Anywhere</h4>\n<p>If you want to place buttons in the middle of an article, you can with our <code>[social_warfare]</code> shortcode.</p>\n<p>What if you wanted to add share buttons to a page but actually have them share out a different page altogether (like being able to share your Subscribe page from your Thank You)? Social Warfare allows you to do this!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re experienced with PHP, you can also hook Social Warfare into your theme templates for hyper customization.</p>\n<h4>Content Protection</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;ve built our highly demanded <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/frame-buster/\" rel=\"ugc\">Frame Buster</a> right into Social Warfare so that you are protected from content hijackers seeking to place their advertisements on top of your content without your permission.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social Warfare is by far the best social sharing plugin I&#8217;ve ever used. I recommend it to all of my clients.<br />\n  Andrew Wilder, Marketing Consultant</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Premium Social Sharing Options</h4>\n<p><em>Social Warfare &#8211; Pro</em> license holders also get access to the following social network share buttons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reddit</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Yummly</li>\n<li>WhatsApp</li>\n<li>Pocket</li>\n<li>Buffer</li>\n<li>Hacker News</li>\n<li>Flipboard</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the extra social networks, you can also reactivate, track and display <strong>Twitter tweet counts</strong>!</p>\n<h4>Pin All the Images</h4>\n<p>Enabling the Image Hover Pin Button will place a &#8220;Pin&#8221; button over top of every image inside of your content when a reader hovers their mouse over it. This makes every image on your page highly sharable to Pinterest!</p>\n<h4>Powerful Share Customization</h4>\n<p>Social Warfare is among the pioneers of customizing how your content is shared, particularly with Pinterest. The <em>Social Warfare &#8211; Pro</em> add-on allows you to decide exactly which image, title and description appears when your content is shared on sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. This also applies to any other networks that use Open Graph data for social shares.</p>\n<p>On top of that, you can upload a <strong>custom Pinterest image</strong> and write a custom description so that when someone clicks the pin button, the exact image you&#8217;ve chosen shows up with exactly the description you&#8217;ve written. No more hoping that your readers choose the best image and write an optimal description for you!</p>\n<p>In addition to that, you can also write a custom tweet for when someone clicks on the Twitter button. The exact tweet you wrote will be displayed in the Twitter share box and Social Warfare will automatically add the link to your content and your @username to the end of it.</p>\n<p>These capabilities are what professional social media marketers and bloggers have been waiting for.</p>\n<h4>Social Warfare &#8211; Pro Sharing Options, Custom Design and Placements</h4>\n<p>Customize which sharing networks you display, how your buttons look and where they show up.</p>\n<p>You can choose from 6 different button shapes, 8 different color themes <strong>plus</strong> the ability to choose custom colors for your buttons. The design combinations are <em>unlimited</em>.</p>\n<p>You will also get 6 different Click to Tweet styles and an option to create your own style via your theme&#8217;s CSS.</p>\n<h4>Minimum Social Proof</h4>\n<p>If you would prefer to only show counts after a certain minimum number of shares has been met (to avoid &#8220;negative social proof&#8221;), you can do that as well. Or if you&#8217;d rather just have no counts showing at all, just turn them off altogether.</p>\n<h4>Share Recovery: Your Lost Share Counts Returned!</h4>\n<p>Have you ever changed permalink structures, domain prefixes, connection protocols (http-https) or just flat out changed domains and ended up <strong>losing all your social share counts?</strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve built a tool right into Social Warfare called <a href=\"https://warfareplugins.com/support/recover-social-share-counts-after-changing-permalink-settings/?utm_medium=repository&amp;utm_campaign=description&amp;utm_source=wordpress_org&amp;utm_content=repo_description\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Share Recovery</a> which allows you to get back your lost share counts if you&#8217;ve ever had to modify your permalink settings.</p>\n<h4>Social Authorship, Twitter Cards, Rich Pins and More</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice to have your stuff shared on social media, it&#8217;s even nicer when you get mentioned in the social share! With Social Warfare you can ensure that your authorship is always in place, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook author and publisher attribution</li>\n<li>Facebook app link (advanced users)</li>\n<li>Twitter publisher and author attribution</li>\n<li>&#8220;via @username&#8221; added to the ends of tweets</li>\n<li>&#8220;via @username&#8221; added to the ends of pin descriptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also activate Twitter Cards (Large Image Cards) so that tweets sent from your site are always media rich and much more likely to get engagement.</p>\n<p>Our plugin also ensures that your site is Rich Pin ready so that your Pins look as good as possible.</p>\n<h4>Link Shortening, Analytics Campaign and Button-click Tracking</h4>\n<p>Shorten shared links automatically using your own Bitly credentials so you can track how many clicks are occurring on your links.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you&#8217;re a Google Analytics user, you can set up Analytics tracking so that each shared link contains a networks specific UTM tracking code. This way you can track all inbound links that come as a direct result of Social Warfare shares.</p>\n<p>You can also activate Event Tracking so that you can also see in Google Analytics exactly how many times your buttons are clicked.</p>\n<p>It is without question that Social Warfare is the most powerful social sharing plugin available for WordPress. You get all these premium features while still benefitting from a super-fast, light-weight code base.</p>\n<h4>Third-Party Services</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses APIs from the following third-party services for sharing content.

Normally the plugin ignores new share counts if the count is lower than the count that we previously fetched from the API&#8217;s. If you activate this feature, it will go with the new count even if it is lower than previously reported by the API&#8217;s.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue that was affecting share counts being fetched on some sites.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue that was affecting the open graph image on some sites when posts were scheduled.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue that was causing some sites not to generate Bitly links on new posts.</li>\n<li>Added some debugging tools to make it easier to diagnose any future issues with Bitly links.</li>\n<li>Added a conditional to catch an undefined index warning.</li>\n<li>Changed the link in the head html comment to be https.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.7 (15 JUN 2017)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a 500 internal server error.</li>\n<li>Fixed a CSS bug that would sometimes cut off the bottom pixel of the button&#8217;s border.</li>\n<li>Added HTML Entity Decode function to ensure foreign characters are populated correctly in open graph tags.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.6 (24 MAY 2017)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Event Tracking for Click-to-Tweets and Image Pins.</li>\n<li>Fixed the CSS for the total shares in non-English foreign languages.</li>\n<li>Fixed a notice that would sometimes appear on attachment pages.</li>\n<li>Fixed an error that caused share counts to not update for some users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.5 (10 MAY 2017)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a PHP warning that appeared on some user&#8217;s websites: &#8220;Warning: DOMDocument::loadHTML(): Empty string supplied as input&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.4 (09 MAY 2017)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a feature to set og:type values for all post types with individual post control via the swp_og_type custom field.</li>\n<li>Added information links for all options sets on the admin options page.</li>\n<li>Added a feature to add a Pinterest image that is picked up by the Pinterest browser extensions.</li>\n<li>Added better support for buttons being displayed on very tiny screens.</li>\n<li>Added system checks to ensure that the site is using a compatible version of PHP, WordPress, cURL, etc.</li>\n<li>Added a filter to remove script and style tags from meta descriptions.

You can now add a class of no_pin to an image to opt it out from having a Pinterest hover share button.</li>\n<li>Fixed a few random PHP warnings and errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.3 (22 FEB 2017)</h4>\n<p><em>Maintenance:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a misnamed function that was causing a &#8220;Call to undefined function&#8221; error when using the shortcode that specifically names which network buttons to show. For example, this was fine: [social_warfare], while this would throw the error: [social_warfare buttons=&#8221;Twitter,Facebook,Google Plus,Pinterest,Total&#8221;]. This update fixes it so that it no longer throws any errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.2 (21 FEB 2017)</h4>\n<p><em>Maintenance:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the widget titles from h3&#8217;s to h4&#8217;s to be more consistent with how other widgets work in WordPress plugins and themes.</li>\n<li>Removed the Pinterest character counter. Pinterest has now fixed the bug that was causing descriptions in shares to get truncated which means that once again we no longer need to count characters. In fact, longer descriptions are usually better over there so have fun!</li>\n<li>Add a &#8220;no_pin&#8221; class to the pin it hover button. If you add the class &#8220;no_pin&#8221; to an image, it will not get a pin hover button attached to it.</li>\n<li>Fixed the pin hover button. We refactored a couple of pieces of the javascript that control the hover button so it should work properly under most circumstances.</li>\n<li>Fixed the Really Simple SSL compatibility issue. You should now be able to use share recovery without Really Simple SSL forcing the recovery URL to be https when trying to recover from HTTP.</li>\n<li>Removed a description on the admin settings page that was written on there twice. Now it&#8217;s only written on there once.</li>\n<li>Updated the information returned by the Facebook share count function.</li>\n<li>Renamed recursive_array_search to swp_recursive_array_search to avoid conflicts with other plugins that may have a function with the same name.</li>\n<li>Renamed isMobile to swp_isMobil to avoid conflicts with other plugins that may have a function with the same name.</li>\n<li>Fixed the Pin it hover button on legacy cache mode.</li>\n<li>Fixed the missing share counts on the all posts admin screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1 (05 JAN 2017)</h4>\n<p><em>Maintenance:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the WhatsApp button.</li>\n<li>Fixed some invalid integer warnings that appeared in PHP 7.1</li>\n<li>Made it so the social shares columns only display on pages and posts admin pages.</li>\n<li>Fixed a conflict with Yoast open graph tags on the archives pages.</li>\n<li>Fixed a conflict with lazyload plugin and the pinterest image hover button.</li>\n<li>Fixed a padding issue on the button counts for mobile.</li>\n<li>Fixed the screen options tab from bumping into the header menu on our admin options page.</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue with button outlines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.0 (29 NOV 2016)</h4>\n<p><em>Important:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social Warfare has been developed into a core free plugin with the ability to install addons for additional functionality. If you are a a premium user, you&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"https://warfareplugins.com/updates/social-warfare-pro/social-warfare-pro.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">download</a> and install the Social Warfare &#8211; Pro addon to immediately regain access to all premium features. Additional addons are currently under development and will be released in the near future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Maintenance:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactored all of the Open Graph and Twitter Card output logic.</li>\n<li>Broke the meta tags into two filters. One creates the values. The second compiles them into HTML for output. This can allow people to hook in and change specific values on the fly via an add_filter() call.</li>\n<li>Refactored all of the cache functions.</li>\n<li>Added a function to clean out meta fields that are no longer used or needed.</li>\n<li>Added a check for invalid responses from Facebook&#8217;s API</li>\n<li>Adjusted the default logic and fallback color system for the side custom color option.</li>\n<li>Refactored the Pinterest image logic.</li>\n<li>Add an undefined check for swpPinit to avoid JS notices in the admin area.</li>\n<li>Fixed an undefined index notice.</li>\n<li>Removed all non-public post types from the display locations settings.</li>\n<li>Added a homepage specific location setting.</li>\n<li>Added a function to make the plugin not duplicate share counts when duplicating a post via the Duplicate Post plugin.</li>\n<li>Consolidated some functions and files for more consistent organization.</li>\n<li>Fixed Google Click/Event Tracking</li>\n<li>Modify the hover pin so it&#8217;s not created until after all images have finished loading.</li>\n<li>&hellip;</li>\n</ul>\n"

Social Warfare share buttons are both lightning fast and beautiful.</p>\n<p>Not only will it never slow down your website like other sharing plugins, we give you the most attractive share buttons available that look great no matter what screen size or resolution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social Warfare has boosted social shares by <strong>300%</strong> without slowing down my blog.<br />\n  Eddie Gear &#8211; Professional Blogger</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can choose from the top social networks sharing buttons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>LinkedIn</li>\n<li>Mix</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also choose where you want the share buttons to show up. Choose from the following placement options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Above the post content</li>\n<li>Below the post content</li>\n<li>Both above and below the post content</li>\n<li>None (or) Manual placement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also give you the ability to have <strong>floating share buttons</strong> follow your readers down the screen when static (non-floating) buttons are not in view. This way the reader will always have easy access to your share buttons, no matter where they scroll on your page.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;This is by far the best looking social sharing plugin I have seen on the net!&#8221;<br />\n  David Foster, Online Personality</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Popular Posts Widget based on Social Share Counts</h4>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you love to show what your most popular posts are based on the number of social shares they&#8217;ve received? Social Warfare allows you to do just that.</p>\n<p>You can even choose to display most your popular posts based on which social network they were popular on!</p>\n<p>Social Warfare&#8217;s Popular Posts widget allows you to display and customize the look with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post thumbnail images</li>\n<li>Image and text size</li>\n<li>Custom visual themes</li>\n<li>Custom date range</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Click to Tweet Quotes</h4>\n<p>A simple and effective way to create tweetable quotes right inside your posts or pages. This has proven to increase the average number of tweets per article dramatically.</p>\n<h4>Use Shortcodes to Manually Place Social Share Buttons Anywhere</h4>\n<p>If you want to place buttons in the middle of an article, you can with our <code>[social_warfare]</code> shortcode.</p>\n<p>What if you wanted to add share buttons to a page but actually have them share out a different page altogether (like being able to share your Subscribe page from your Thank You)? Social Warfare allows you to do this!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re experienced with PHP, you can also hook Social Warfare into your theme templates for hyper customization.</p>\n<h4>Content Protection</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;ve built our highly demanded <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/frame-buster/\" rel=\"ugc\">Frame Buster</a> right into Social Warfare so that you are protected from content hijackers seeking to place their advertisements on top of your content without your permission.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social Warfare is by far the best social sharing plugin I&#8217;ve ever used. I recommend it to all of my clients.<br />\n  Andrew Wilder, Marketing Consultant</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Premium Social Sharing Options</h4>\n<p><em>Social Warfare &#8211; Pro</em> license holders also get access to the following social network share buttons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reddit</li>\n<li>Tumblr</li>\n<li>Yummly</li>\n<li>WhatsApp</li>\n<li>Pocket</li>\n<li>Buffer</li>\n<li>Hacker News</li>\n<li>Flipboard</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the extra social networks, you can also reactivate, track and display <strong>Twitter tweet counts</strong>!</p>\n<h4>Pin All the Images</h4>\n<p>Enabling the Image Hover Pin Button will place a &#8220;Pin&#8221; button over top of every image inside of your content when a reader hovers their mouse over it. This makes every image on your page highly sharable to Pinterest!</p>\n<h4>Powerful Share Customization</h4>\n<p>Social Warfare is among the pioneers of customizing how your content is shared, particularly with Pinterest. The <em>Social Warfare &#8211; Pro</em> add-on allows you to decide exactly which image, title and description appears when your content is shared on sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. This also applies to any other networks that use Open Graph data for social shares.</p>\n<p>On top of that, you can upload a <strong>custom Pinterest image</strong> and write a custom description so that when someone clicks the pin button, the exact image you&#8217;ve chosen shows up with exactly the description you&#8217;ve written. No more hoping that your readers choose the best image and write an optimal description for you!</p>\n<p>In addition to that, you can also write a custom tweet for when someone clicks on the Twitter button. The exact tweet you wrote will be displayed in the Twitter share box and Social Warfare will automatically add the link to your content and your @username to the end of it.</p>\n<p>These capabilities are what professional social media marketers and bloggers have been waiting for.</p>\n<h4>Social Warfare &#8211; Pro Sharing Options, Custom Design and Placements</h4>\n<p>Customize which sharing networks you display, how your buttons look and where they show up.</p>\n<p>You can choose from 6 different button shapes, 8 different color themes <strong>plus</strong> the ability to choose custom colors for your buttons. The design combinations are <em>unlimited</em>.</p>\n<p>You will also get 6 different Click to Tweet styles and an option to create your own style via your theme&#8217;s CSS.</p>\n<h4>Minimum Social Proof</h4>\n<p>If you would prefer to only show counts after a certain minimum number of shares has been met (to avoid &#8220;negative social proof&#8221;), you can do that as well. Or if you&#8217;d rather just have no counts showing at all, just turn them off altogether.</p>\n<h4>Share Recovery: Your Lost Share Counts Returned!</h4>\n<p>Have you ever changed permalink structures, domain prefixes, connection protocols (http-https) or just flat out changed domains and ended up <strong>losing all your social share counts?</strong></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve built a tool right into Social Warfare called <a href=\"https://warfareplugins.com/support/recover-social-share-counts-after-changing-permalink-settings/?utm_medium=repository&amp;utm_campaign=description&amp;utm_source=wordpress_org&amp;utm_content=repo_description\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Share Recovery</a> which allows you to get back your lost share counts if you&#8217;ve ever had to modify your permalink settings.</p>\n<h4>Social Authorship, Twitter Cards, Rich Pins and More</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice to have your stuff shared on social media, it&#8217;s even nicer when you get mentioned in the social share! With Social Warfare you can ensure that your authorship is always in place, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook author and publisher attribution</li>\n<li>Facebook app link (advanced users)</li>\n<li>Twitter publisher and author attribution</li>\n<li>&#8220;via @username&#8221; added to the ends of tweets</li>\n<li>&#8220;via @username&#8221; added to the ends of pin descriptions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also activate Twitter Cards (Large Image Cards) so that tweets sent from your site are always media rich and much more likely to get engagement.</p>\n<p>Our plugin also ensures that your site is Rich Pin ready so that your Pins look as good as possible.</p>\n<h4>Link Shortening, Analytics Campaign and Button-click Tracking</h4>\n<p>Shorten shared links automatically using your own Bitly credentials so you can track how many clicks are occurring on your links.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you&#8217;re a Google Analytics user, you can set up Analytics tracking so that each shared link contains a networks specific UTM tracking code. This way you can track all inbound links that come as a direct result of Social Warfare shares.</p>\n<p>You can also activate Event Tracking so that you can also see in Google Analytics exactly how many times your buttons are clicked.</p>\n<p>It is without question that Social Warfare is the most powerful social sharing plugin available for WordPress. You get all these premium features while still benefitting from a super-fast, light-weight code base.</p>\n<h4>Third-Party Services</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses APIs from the following third-party services for sharing content.
