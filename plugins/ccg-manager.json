So a MtG card that costs 2 colorless and 2 white would be written out like this:</p>\n<p>2WW</p>\n<p>This is so, in a future add-on for that CCG, I can replace the letter for the cost with an icon image representing that color.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have ideas for future enhancements/I want to contribute to the development of the plugin.
