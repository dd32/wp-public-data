        "description": "<p>Easy Classes provide custom post types for teachers and classes, with a lots of custom categories used to automatically<br />\ngenerate a schedule with all the published classes. There can be up to 2 classes present at the same hours on the schedule.<br />\nYou create as you wish the classes, the days, the teachers, the times etc.</p>\n<h4>ABOUT THE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED SCHEDULE</h4>\n<p>USING IT :</p>\n<p>On the schedule page in the administration, all you have to do is choosing the colours for the different classes and save your changes.<br />\nThen generate the schedule code, copy it, and paste it into a page or post in the &#8220;text&#8221; editor (not the visual). Save the post/page and<br />\ndisplay it : the schedule appears (its look can differ depending on your theme).</p>\n<p>COLOURS :</p>\n<p>Any valid HTML colour will work ! You can now enter values like #FF6857, &#8216;MediumOrchid&#8217;, rgb(255,0,0), they will all work.<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t know HTML colours, no problem, 150 colours name are provided with the plugin in order for you to choose one.<br />\nYou can write the colours names provided with or without capital at the beginning. Without capital it will only ask you to confirm, click ok. It works.<br />\nBe careful of mistakes, any name not found in the 150 colours provided is allowed after a confirmation.<br />\nSo if a colour doesn&#8217;t appear, enter it again properly, it may be caused by a typo.</p>\n<p>ORDERING NON ENGLISH DAYS :</p>\n<p>Only a french translation for the plugin exists by now, so, if you enter non-english or non-french days, you may notice they don&#8217;t appear in the right order in the schedule.<br />\nYou can now order them just as you like under &#8220;Days&#8221; at the top of the schedule admin panel. Don&#8217;t use it if the days are already properly ordered.</p>\n<p>AVOIDING ERRORS / NOT DISPLAYING :</p>\n<p>The schedule will only use what you have created (title,day,hours,teacher,room), but to be correctly generated, your classes need<br />\nto have at least :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a title (doesn&#8217;t cause errors, but without the title the schedule won&#8217;t make any sense)</li>\n<li>a starting hour, smaller than the ending hour</li>\n<li>an ending hour, bigger than the starting hour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the starting hour is bigger than the ending hour, the class won&#8217;t be displayed.</p>\n<p>If the starting hour is equal to the ending hour, the class will display in the box with the starting hour you&#8217;ve checked.<br />\nFor e.g. you&#8217;ve checked &#8220;08:00&#8221; for both hours, the schedule will display the class at &#8220;08:00 / next hour registered &#8220;</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve checked an ending hour but not a starting one, the class will be displayed all through the day until the ending hour.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve checked a starting hour but no ending one, the class won&#8217;t be displayed.</p>\n<p>Neither will it be displayed if you have checked no hour at all.</p>\n<p>Thanks for using this plugin, I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy it and that it will help you managing better your site.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>easy-classes</code> folder with all its content  to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>If <code>easy-classes</code> is an archive (.zip for e.g.), you can automatically install through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress, &#8216;Add&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Send&#8217; &gt; find the file in your computer and send it.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that&#8217;s all folks !</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>WHY MULTIPLE VALUES WON&#8217;T DISPLAY ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because the schedule is meant to stay simple and readable.<br />\nThis is what happens if you use multiple values where the schedule only expects one :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple teachers or rooms :<br />\nOnly the last one of the selected will appear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple days :<br />\nOnly the last day will appear.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple hours :<br />\nOnly the highest hour will be used.<br />\nFor e.g. you checked 8:00 and 12:00 as a beginning hour &gt; 12:00 will be used, not 8:00</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>HOW TO DISPLAY THEM ALL IN THE SCHEDULE THEN ?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Teachers or rooms :<br />\nCreate a teacher/room category which title contains the multiple teachers (e.g. &#8220;Mrs. Peacock &amp; M.  Plum&#8221;) or rooms (e.g. &#8220;The Ballroom &amp; The Conservatory&#8221;).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Days :<br />\nCreate a different class for each day, you only have to copy/paste the title and the content (if not blank) check some boxes, the right day and here you go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hours :<br />\nSame problem as day, create a new class, copy/paste everything, check some boxes, choose the right hours, and here you go.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>I DON&#8217;T LIKE HOW IT LOOKS, CAN I CUSTOMIZE THE APPEARANCE ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin implements a presentation of posts &#8220;classes&#8221; and &#8220;teachers&#8221; using the content and a table containing all the infos.<br />\nThe classes and teachers pages will display depending fully on your theme, as there&#8217;s no style implemented, just the structure.</p>\n<p>About the schedule, its structure is a table with divs or tables inside, and it can totally be customized with css.<br />\nYou need to know CSS of course, and how to modify it in WordPress. Look into &#8220;themes&#8221; to learn more about it.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t recommand modifying the style directly in the schedule.css file of the plugin, so don&#8217;t do that unless you&#8217;re very familiar with CSS.<br />\nHere are the classes used by the plugin if you want to overwrite them :</p>\n<p>CSS : SCHEDULE</p>\n<pre><code>.easy-class-schedule\n</code></pre>\n<p>The schedule container (round corners and grey border)</p>\n<pre><code>.easy-class-schedule table\n</code></pre>\n<p>The schedule itself</p>\n<pre><code>.easy-class-schedule td, th\n</code></pre>\n<p>Schedule headers and lines<br />\nDefault border color is silver</p>\n<pre><code>.easy-class-schedule td\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default lines are 90px of height</p>\n<pre><code>.easy-class-schedule th\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just a little make-up for the headers to stand-out a bit</p>\n<pre><code>th.time\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hours headers</p>\n<pre><code>.classblock\n</code></pre>\n<p>Containers of classes (one class by classblock)</p>\n<pre><code>.double\n</code></pre>\n<p>A table created when two classes share an hour in the schedule<br />\nEach of the two classes is in one td</p>\n<p>CSS : CLASSES AND TEACHERS</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s absolutely no css coming with the plugin for those.<br />\nThe content is simply wrapped in a table, with tr and td.</p>\n<p>Classes are implemented for customization though :</p>\n<p>Classes :<br />\n    .eac-class</p>\n<p>Teachers :<br />\n    .eac-teacher</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WHY CAN&#8217;T I CONFIGURE THE SCHEDULE, CLASSES OR TEACHER STRUCTURE ? I&#8217;D LOVE TO ADD/REMOVE X THERE</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tell me that in your review, and I will consider updating the plugin ! ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
