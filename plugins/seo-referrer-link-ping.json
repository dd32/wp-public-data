By checking the referrer, the new webpage can see where the request originated. (source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer\" title=\"HTTP referer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there anything to configure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin works automatically behind the scenes and requires zero configuration.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I verify if it is working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Are you able to <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/refcontrol/\" title=\"RefControl Firefox plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fake the referrer</a>? If so you can supply a referrer and directly load any page on your site. If not, if you know of an external link from another website that links to your site you could click through from there. Once on your site right click and view the page source. Search for &#8220;pingomatic&#8221; and you should see an iframe containint HTML submitting the referrer to Pingomatic.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it ping internal links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is smart enough to disregard referrer links from internal referrers (links from within your site on the same domain).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it ping links from search engines?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is smart enough to disregard referrer links from a few major search engines.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
