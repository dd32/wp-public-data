Bounce accounts are totally free.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All external links are processed through the Bounce service. If the system detects a link that can be converted into a revenue sharing link it will. You can configure which services you are signed up for (Amazon Associates, etc) on the <a href=\"http://bounce.cc/\" title=\"Monetize your site with Bounce!\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bounce.cc</a> web site.</p>\n<p>The plugin works automatically so you don&#8217;t have to encode each link yourself, and also works for links posted in comments too, helping you monetize the contributions of your users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I go for support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"http://bounce.cc/\" title=\"Monetize your site with Bounce!\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bounce.cc</a> web site for more information and support options.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
