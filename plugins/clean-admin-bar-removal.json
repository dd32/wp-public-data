In these new versions, the top &#8220;admin bar&#8221; is shown on the public site by default for all users. This has been inconvenient on some of the sites we manage, where the WordPress admin area is otherwise &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; for some logged in users, or where the top admin bar is incompatible with the site’s layout. </p>\n<p>To solve this problem, Clean Admin Bar Removal disables the toolbar in existing users&#8217; preferences and changes the default setting for new users. Once a site administrator installs the plugin, they can choose which behavior to use on their site by user role. Users can restore the admin bar in their individual preferences by choosing &#8220;Show Toolbar when viewing site&#8221; if needed.</p>\n<p>I hope some of you find this plugin helpful. It is offered for free under the GPL-2 license with no support or warranty, but has already been put into production on several of our sites and is working well.
