HTTP Flood plugin running in software layer. So we could not detected and protection.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So, protect me against what kind of attack?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The attack sources arranged on the domain name, not on the server IP address, can be detected by the softwares. So we can detected and protected against them. These are: HTTP Flood, Land Flood, Form Spoofing, Brute Force and Remote Site Vulnerability Scanners.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How it&#8217;s work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin based on a detection algorithm, it&#8217;s writes the attack resources to the .htaccess file. This file is a system file and tells resource must be blocked in a firewall layer to the server. HTTP Flood plugin detects the attack resources and writes them in .htaccess file at the time of attack.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
