VVAMwp 1.0.0 is the current version of the plugin which supports VAM 2.6.2.</p>\n<p>VAMwp provides a set of widgets which can be included in any WordPress site using any theme to create a rich WordPress-Based<br />\nweb site for a virtual airline. The roadmap is to allow complete management of the VAM airline from within WordPress without<br />\nthe need for end-user visitors or pilots to access the VAM administration portal &#8212; which would only be needed for managing<br />\nthe airline itself by airline staff.</p>\n<p>At this time, the widgets provided allow the creation of a visitor-facing web site presenting a rich set of widgets to<br />\npresent pilot rosters, fleet details, hubs, and flights. These widgets can be combined in many different combinations in<br />\nmost WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>Future releases will provide widgets to allow pilots to book flights, file PIREPs and more.</p>\n<p>VAMwp was originally built for the launch of the new Finnair Virtual airline (http://www.finnairvirtual.fi/) but is now being<br />\npackaged and released to the wider VAM and WordPress community.</p>\n<p>The plugin is also available on GitHub for download as unpackaged source code at https://github.com/likeablegeek/vamwp.<br />\nDocumentation of VAMwp is available on GitHub in the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/likeablegeek/vamwp/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that VAMwp is a work-in-progress. As such it has some limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The current version presumes WordPress and VAM are installed on the same server in the same virtual host<br />\n(i.e. under the same base url such as http://www.mydomain.com/). The typical installation pattern is that the<br />\nVAM installation directory would be at /vam/ and the WordPress site would occupy the root directory of the<br />\nsite.</li>\n<li>To fully integrate the user experience with VAM currently requires the creation of a set of rewrite rules<br />\nfor mod_rewrite (if using Apache as an HTTP server) or equivalent for nginx or other HTTP servers. This is to<br />\nallow links from various widgets to redirect away from the back-end VAM portal (if desired). This is explained<br />\nwith an example in the documentation but is not required to use the plugin.</li>\n<li>There is an underlying assumption that users of the plugin fully understand how to use VAM and their VAM<br />\ninstallation. The plugin and its documentation in no way simplifies or supports the installation of VAM and<br />\nthe configuration of a virtual airline based on the VAM platform. Users needing support to install, configure<br />\nand manage VAM should refer to the VAM documentation and the <a href=\"http://virtualairlinesmanager.net/foro//index.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">VAM help and support forums</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n",

A full VAM insallation is needed &#8212; it must be configured and managed as with any<br />\nother VAM-based virtual airline.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the appearance of the VAMwp widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and no. In theory, VAMwp widgets can be deployed with any theme and will inherit many of the visual aspects<br />\nof those themes. However, the exact content of widgets cannot be changed or managed at this time. However,<br />\ninternationalisation of widgets labels, etc can be managed through the Polylang plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I internationalise the VAMwp widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. VAMwp has been built with internationalisation of widget labels, titles, etc in mind. However, no translations<br />\nare provided except for the default English. Additionally, you can use tools like Polylang or WPML to fully manage<br />\na multi-lingual site if you need.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
