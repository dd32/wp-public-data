        "description": "<p>Google Tag Manager (GTM) is Google&#8217;s free tool for everyone to manage and deploy analytics and marketing tags as well as other code snippets<br />\nusing an intuitive web UI. To learn more about this tool, visit the <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin places the GTM container code snippets onto your WordPress website so that you do not need to add it manually.<br />\nMultiple containers are also supported!</p>\n<p>The plugin complements your GTM setup by pushing page meta data and user information into the so called data layer.<br />\nGoogle&#8217;s official help pages includes <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer#datalayer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more details about the data layer</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>PHP 7.4 is required to use this plugin.</strong></p>\n<h4>GTM container code placement</h4>\n<p>The original GTM container code is divided into two parts:</p>\n<p>The first part is a javascript code snippet that is added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of every page of the website.<br />\nThis part is critical to enable all features of GTM, and this plugin helps to place this part<br />\ncorrectly on your site.</p>\n<p>The second part is an iframe snippet that acts as a failsafe/fallback should users&#8217; JavaScript be disabled.<br />\nGoogle recommends – for best performance – to place this code snippet directly after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag on each page.</p>\n<p>Albeit not ideal, it will work when placed lower in the code. This plugin provides a code placement option for the second code snippet.</p>\n<p>If your WordPress theme is compatible with the additions of WordPress 5.2 then this plugin will place this second code to the right place.<br />\nUsers of the Genisis theme, GeneratePress theme, Elementor, Oxygen Builder and Beaver Builder Theme will also have this placed correctly.<br />\nTo utilize this, set the compatibility mode in plugin options to off.</p>\n<p>All other users can place this second code snippet using a custom PHP code (&#8220;Manually coded&#8221; option) or select the so called &#8220;Footer&#8221; option to<br />\nadd the code lower in the code (it is not the recommended way but will work)</p>\n<h4>Basic data included</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>post/page titles</li>\n<li>post/page dates</li>\n<li>post/page category names</li>\n<li>post/page tag names</li>\n<li>post/page author ID and name</li>\n<li>post/page ID</li>\n<li>post types</li>\n<li>post format</li>\n<li>post count on the current page + in the current category/tag/taxonomy</li>\n<li>custom terms associated with any post type</li>\n<li>logged in status</li>\n<li>logged in user role</li>\n<li>logged in user ID (to track cross device behaviour in Google Analytics)</li>\n<li>logged in user email address (both unhashed and SHA256 hased values to be used with tracking)</li>\n<li>logger in user creation date</li>\n<li>site search data</li>\n<li>site name and id (for WordPress multisite instances)</li>\n<li>IP address of the visitor (please use the explicit consent of the visitor to utilize this)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Browser / OS / Device data</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>browser data (name, version, engine)</li>\n<li>OS data (name, version)</li>\n<li>device data (type, manufacturer, model)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data is provided using the WhichBrowser library: http://whichbrowser.net/</p>\n<h4>Weather data</h4>\n<p>(beta)</p>\n<p>Push data about users&#8217; current weather conditions into the dataLayer. This can be used to generate weather-related<br />\naudience/remarketing lists on ad platforms and allows for user segmentation in your web analytics solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>weather category (clouds, rain, snow, etc.)</li>\n<li>weather description: more detailed data</li>\n<li>temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit</li>\n<li>air pressure</li>\n<li>wind speed and degrees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weather data is queried from Open Weather Map. Depending on your websites traffic, additional fees may apply:<br />\nhttp://openweathermap.org/price</p>\n<p>An (free) API key from OpenWeatherMap is required for this feature to work.</p>\n<p>ipstack.com is used to determine the site visitor&#8217;s location. A (free) API key from IPStack.com is required for this feature to work:<br />\nhttps://ipstack.com/product</p>\n<h4>Media player events</h4>\n<p>(experimental)</p>\n<p>Track users&#8217; interaction with any embedded media:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>Vimeo</li>\n<li>Soundcloud</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DataLayer events can be chosen to fire upon media player load, media is being played, paused/stopped and optionally when<br />\nthe user reaches 10, 20, 30, &#8230;, 90, 100% of the media duration.</p>\n<p>Tracking is supported for embedded media using the built-in oEmbed feature of WordPress as well as most other media plugins<br />\nand copy/pasted codes. Players injected into the website after page load are not currently supported.</p>\n<h4>Scroll tracking</h4>\n<p>Fire tags based on how the visitor scrolls from the top to the bottom of a page.<br />\nAn example would be to separate &#8220;readers&#8221; (who spend a specified amount of time on a page) from &#8220;scrollers&#8221;<br />\n(who only scroll through within seconds). You can use these events to fire Analytics tags and/or remarketing/conversion tags<br />\n(for micro conversions).</p>\n<p>Scroll tracking is based on the solution originally created by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nick Mihailovski</li>\n<li>Thomas Baekdal</li>\n<li>Avinash Kaushik</li>\n<li>Joost de Valk</li>\n<li>Eivind Savio</li>\n<li>Justin Cutroni</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Original script:<br />\nhttp://cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/21/advanced-content-tracking-with-google-analytics-part-1/</p>\n<h4>Blacklist &amp; Whitelist Tag Manager tags, triggers and variables</h4>\n<p>To increase website security, you have the option to white- and blacklist tags/triggers/variables.<br />\nYou can prevent specific tags from firing or the use of certain variable types regardless of your GTM setup.</p>\n<p>If the Google account associated with your GTM account is being hacked, an attacker could easily<br />\nexecute malware on your website without accessing its code on your hosting server. By blacklisting custom HTML tags<br />\nand/or custom JavaScript variables you can secure the Tag Manager container.</p>\n<h4>Integration</h4>\n<p>Google Tag Manager for WordPress integrates with several popular plugins. More integration to come!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7: fire an event when a Contact Form 7 form was submitted with any result (mail sent, mail failed, spam detected, invalid input)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce:\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ecommerce-ga4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GA4 E-commerce</a></li>\n<li>Does not support promotions since WooCommerce does not have such a feature (yet)</li>\n<li>Does not support refunds</li>\n<li>Compatibility with High Performance Order Storage (HPOS)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AMP: load your AMP container on the AMP version of your pages</li>\n<li>Cookiebot: use automatic cookie blocking mode if needed</li>\n<li>Google Consent Mode v2: fire the &#8220;default&#8221; command with specific consent flags to integrat with non-certified Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Server side containers</h4>\n<p>If you are using a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/send-data#update_the_gtmjs_source_domain\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">server side container</a><br />\nyou can enter your custom domain name and custom path to load gtm.js from your there.</p>\n<h4>Exclude specific user roles from being tracked</h4>\n<p>You can set which user roles needs to be excluded from tracking when a user with that role visits the frontend. This will completely disable the container code for that user.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>duracelltomi-google-tag-manager-for-wordpress</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to Settings / Google Tag Manager and enter your Google Tag Manager container ID and set additional options</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20...'>\nHow can I &#8230;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tutorials for various Google Tag Manager settings and implementation are available on the plugin&#8217;s website:<br />\nhttps://gtm4wp.com/setup-gtm4wp-features</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='paypal%20%2F%203rd%20party%20payment%20gateway%20transactions%20in%20woocommerce%20are%20not%20being%20tracked%20in%20google%20analytics'>\nPayPal / 3rd party payment gateway transactions in WooCommerce are not being tracked in Google Analytics\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PayPal and some other 3rd party payment gateways do not redirect users back to your website upon successful transaction by default.<br />\nIt offers the route back for your customer but it can happen that users close the browser before arriving at your thankyou page<br />\n(aka. order received page). This means that neither Google Analytics tags or any other tags have the chance to fire.</p>\n<p>Enable auto-return in your payment gateway settings. This will instruct them to show a quick info page after payment<br />\nand redirect the user back to your site. This will improve the accuracy and frequency of tracked transactions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='purchase%20event%20is%20not%20tracked%20with%20woocommerce'>\nPurchase event is not tracked with WooCommerce\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using a 3rd party plugin that alters the default order received page in a way that does not utilize the integration hooks<br />\nof WooCommerce then this can happen. Either stop using this 3rd party plugin or ask them to better mimic the behavior of the<br />\ndefault order received page by supporting the woocommerce is_order_received_page and the woocommerce_thankyou actions and filters.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20there%20an%20option%20to%20blacklist%20tag%2Fvariable%20classes'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t there an option to blacklist tag/variable classes\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although Google recommends to blacklist tags and variables using classes, people struggle to know<br />\nwhich tags/variables gets affected. Therefore I opted for individual tags and variables rather than classes<br />\non the blacklist tabs.</p>\n<p>Regarding variables; ensure they are not part of any critical tags as blacklisting such variables will render said tags useless.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20track%20scroll%20events%20in%20google%20tag%20manager%3F'>\nHow can I track scroll events in Google Tag Manager?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google Tag Manager supports basic scroll depth tracking based on percentage or pixels natively. This plugin adds<br />\nadditional scroll tracking events, more focused on capturing the users&#8217; intent and/or engagement.</p>\n<p>There are five dataLayer events you can use in your rule definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gtm4wp.reading.articleLoaded: the content has been loaded</li>\n<li>gtm4wp.reading.startReading: the visitor started to scroll. The <code>timeToScroll</code> dataLayer variable stores duration since the article loaded (in seconds)</li>\n<li>gtm4wp.reading.contentBottom: the visitor reached the end of the content (not the page!). <code>timeToScroll</code> dataLayer variable updated</li>\n<li>gtm4wp.reading.pagebottom: the visitor reached the end of the page. <code>timeToScroll</code> dataLayer variable updated</li>\n<li>gtm4wp.reading.readerType: based on time spent since article loaded we determine whether the user is a &#8216;scanner&#8217; or &#8216;reader&#8217; and store this in the <code>readerType</code> dataLayer variable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example use cases: using these events as triggers, you can fire Google Universal Analytics and/or Google Ads remarketing/conversion tags<br />\nto report micro conversions and/or to serve ads only to visitors who spend more time reading your content.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Players injected into the website after page load are not currently supported.</p>\n<h4>Scroll tracking</h4>\n<p>Fire tags based on how the visitor scrolls from the top to the bottom of a page.<br />\nAn example would be to separate &#8220;readers&#8221; (who spend a specified amount of time on a page) from &#8220;scrollers&#8221;<br />\n(who only scroll through within seconds). You can use these events to fire Analytics tags and/or remarketing/conversion tags<br />\n(for micro conversions).</p>\n<p>Scroll tracking is based on the solution originally created by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nick Mihailovski</li>\n<li>Thomas Baekdal</li>\n<li>Avinash Kaushik</li>\n<li>Joost de Valk</li>\n<li>Eivind Savio</li>\n<li>Justin Cutroni</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Original script:<br />\nhttp://cutroni.com/blog/2012/02/21/advanced-content-tracking-with-google-analytics-part-1/</p>\n<h4>Blacklist &amp; Whitelist Tag Manager tags, triggers and variables</h4>\n<p>To increase website security, you have the option to white- and blacklist tags/triggers/variables.<br />\nYou can prevent specific tags from firing or the use of certain variable types regardless of your GTM setup.</p>\n<p>If the Google account associated with your GTM account is being hacked, an attacker could easily<br />\nexecute malware on your website without accessing its code on your hosting server. By blacklisting custom HTML tags<br />\nand/or custom JavaScript variables you can secure the Tag Manager container.</p>\n<h4>Integration</h4>\n<p>Google Tag Manager for WordPress integrates with several popular plugins. More integration to come!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7: fire an event when a Contact Form 7 form was submitted with any result (mail sent, mail failed, spam detected, invalid input)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce:\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ecommerce-ga4\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GA4 E-commerce</a></li>\n<li>Does not support promotions since WooCommerce does not have such a feature (yet)</li>\n<li>Does not support refunds</li>\n<li>Compatibility with High Performance Order Storage (HPOS)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>AMP: load your AMP container on the AMP version of your pages</li>\n<li>Cookiebot: use automatic cookie blocking mode if needed</li>\n<li>Google Consent Mode v2: fire the &#8220;default&#8221; command with specific consent flags to integrat with non-certified Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Server side containers</h4>\n<p>If you are using a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/send-data#update_the_gtmjs_source_domain\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">server side container</a><br />\nyou can enter your custom domain name and custom path to load gtm.js from your there.</p>\n<h4>Exclude specific user roles from being tracked</h4>\n<p>You can set which user roles needs to be excluded from tracking when a user with that role visits the frontend. This will completely disable the container code for that user.</p>\n",
