Great for debugging those long and complex scripts.</p>\n<p>Each error can have its own error message making it a lot easier to pin down specific issues in your code. You can also log notices for less serious issues.</p>\n<p>All your errors and notices can be viewed conveniently in the WordPress admin area.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy Errors:</strong> Create errors with a simple function.</li>\n<li><strong>Useful Errors:</strong> Define a custom error message for each error.</li>\n<li><strong>Log notices:</strong> Notices can be logged for less serious issues and viewed seperately in the admin area.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep Track:</strong> View and moderate all your errors in the WordPress admin area.</li>\n<li><strong>Toolbar icon:</strong> The admin toolbar displays how many new errors and notices have occurred on the current page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Getting Started:</h3>\n<p>Install and activate the plugin then in the admin menu go to <em>Tools &gt; Error Log</em>. This will eventually be the page that displays all your latest errors but if you&#8217;re just getting started it explains in detail how to start logging custom errors.</p>\n<p>In your theme use either of the two built in functions to log an error <code>log_error($message);</code> or a notice <code>log_notice($message);</code>.</p>\n<p>When these functions are executed they will log whatever error or notice you want.</p>\n<h3>Ongoing Development:</h3>\n<p>I have only just started with this plugin and plan on bringing great improvements to it. If you have any ideas please suggest them in the support section.</p>\n<h3>Translation:</h3>\n<p>The plugin is translation ready but as of yet contains only an English translation file. If you would like to contribute any translations I would be very grateful.</p>\n<h3>Please note:</h3>\n<p>This plugin is aimed at developers who have at least a basic understanding of PHP. If this isn&#8217;t you then you may not find much use from this plugin however if you are unsure how to use any of the functions explained you can post a topic in the support section of the plugin directory and I will do my best to help you.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>What&#8217;s the point?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As they say &#8216;Necessity is the mother of invention&#8217;&#8230; I was recently developing a WordPress site which imported data from a CRM in the background and used that data to create users, posts, taxonomies etc.</p>\n<p>I started using the standard PHP error log but quickly found that the errors didn&#8217;t have enough specific information to make them useful. I needed to know exactly what information wasn&#8217;t being imported properly and why so I created this plugin to allow me to customise the information stored in each error.</p>\n<p>There are other ways, like using full debugging tools but I think it&#8217;s easier to have a simple, WordPress native tool.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I log an error?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, you place the following function in your theme/plugin where you want to log an error&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>log_error( $message );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Replace $message with whatever error message you want to log for example if you&#8217;re adding a new user you could do this&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>$user_id = wp_create_user( $user_name, $password, $user_email );\n\nif( is_wp_error( $user_id ) ) {\n\n    $error_response = $user_id-&gt;get_error_message();\n\n    $mesage = \"Unable to create user with username: \" . $user_name;\n    $message .= \" password: \" . $password;\n    $message .= \" The following error occurred: \" . $error_response;\n\n    log_error( $message );\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added toolbar icon for displaying new errors/notices that occur on the current page.</li>\n<li>Added option to hide the new toolbar icon.</li>\n<li>Added ability to track which errors/notices have not yet been viewed in the error log.</li>\n<li>Added a nice animation to highlight which logs are new in the error log.</li>\n<li>updated some non-internationalized strings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hello world&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n"
