This can be helpful in managing your upsell and order bump operations together.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Pop-Up on Exit Intent</strong>: Using the WooCommerce Upsell Plugin you can enable the pop-up on exit intent feature, allowing you to show a pop-up on upsell offer pages when a customer tries to exit the browser, this can be an ultimate upselling hack for your business.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Unlimited Funnels with an Unlimited Number of Offers</strong>: With the WordPress Sales Funnel plugin, you can create unlimited sales funnels with any number of Upsell and Cross-Sell Offers.
