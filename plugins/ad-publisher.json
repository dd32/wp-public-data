Ad Publisher not only automatically inserts ad units before or after the content, but can add them after the certain number of paragraphs. And the number of ad units is limited by your imagination, rational sense and Google AdSense policy only. Ad Publisher helps to get rid of manual insertion of ad code to each article and greatly simplifies monetization of the blog. Ad Publisher is the easiest plugin to add Google AdSense ads or any other ad code. Our primary goal was to make WordPress as simple for beginners as possible. And we’ve succeeded!</strong></p>\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n<h4>Intuitive interface</h4>\n<p>The plugin has a very friendly and intuitive interface; all settings are limited by checking or unchecking the necessary options. When premium modules are activated, the user gets access to the feature management checkboxes.</p>\n<h4>Caching plugins support</h4>\n<p>Ad Publisher supports all popular caching plugins.</p>\n<h4>Automatic insertion of the Google AdSense code</h4>\n<p>Ad Publisher has been designed to add Google AdSense ads through the ad code. But it doesn’t mean that the plugin can’t work with other ad code. You can insert the ad code from any ad system or create a custom one.</p>\n<h4>Post type targeting</h4>\n<p>You can select where to show ads: on posts (articles), pages or exclude from CSS.</p>\n<h4>Insert the ad anywhere in the post.</h4>\n<p>It is you who decide where to add the advert – before/after the content, or after the certain number of paragraphs. The number of ad units per page is not limited.</p>\n<h4>Separated display for desktop and mobile</h4>\n<p>The share of mobile traffic has drastically increased lately. Knowing this, the plugin offers you separate ad units for desktop and mobile versions. Or you can go on with the traditional way and show the same modules for all devices.</p>\n<h4>Increases the ad unit CTR</h4>\n<p>Precisely! We wanted your blog to give you more money. That’s why we’ve created extra modules to attract attention to the ad units. Currently, you can install CTR Booster and Sticky Ads. Both of them will rocket your ad unit CTR in three times.</p>\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n<p>Modern plugins try to offer as many useful features as possible. Think about it: how many of them do you use on the regular basis? The answer is: less than the half! So why should you install additional modules in order to use only one feature? Our plugin doesn’t have anything redundant! It just inserts the ad code to the certain place in your blog.</p>\n<h3>1.1.0</h3>\n<p>Add smart shortcodes.<br />\nFix some bugs.</p>\n<h3>1.0.6</h3>\n",
