        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this safe to use in production?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We believe so. To put our money where our mouth is, we use it in production on our own <a href=\"https://demos.pixelgrade.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo multisite installation</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve strived to close off any endpoints that WordPress uses to save things (mainly the changeset logic specific to the Customizer experience).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Without changesets how is the experience consistent with a real scenario?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no point in showcasing a customization experience that is not consistent with the real one. We couldn&#8217;t agree more. That is why we&#8217;ve studied the Customizer JavaScript logic and found ways to maintain the same results without saving anything in the database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I navigate in the preview window, customizations don&#8217;t get applied?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes, WordPress themes will come with custom JavaScript that will bind to <em>click events</em> and stop their propagation. Due to this, the Customizer (not our&#8217;s) logic can&#8217;t catch that click and go the proper way of refreshing the preview window. We really have not way around that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I choose to hide certain Customizer sections or panels?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin doesn&#8217;t provide this functionality as it is quite difficult to map it to a set of configuration options. But it should be quite straight forward to code a function that &#8220;removes&#8221; panels, sections or controls when the special pseudo-guest user is logged in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am a developer. Can I easily change how things work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are also developers (and designers, and marketers, and support people&#8230;) just like you. We know how important it is that plugins get coded in an open, thoughtful manner that is friendly towards those that have custom requirements.</p>\n<p>The plugin provides <em>actions and filters</em> in all the right places allowing you to <em>introduce custom logic</em> just about anywhere, if the need arises.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
