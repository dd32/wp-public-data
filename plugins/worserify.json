        "faq": "<h4>How does this plugin fix all the errors?</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;ve written the code for this plugin in a completely PHP 5.3 compliant, Object Oriented, non-obfuscated way so that the detection of obstructed array methods will always pass through our normalize scripting processor. It is basically fool proof.</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve activated the plugin but my site doesn&#8217;t seem any better. Is something wrong?</h4>\n<p>Most likely no. Try taking the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reboot your computer</li>\n<li>Clear your browser&#8217;s cache</li>\n<li>Navigate to your site&#8217;s home page</li>\n<li>Double click on the header and then on the footer</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, try deactivating and then reactivating the plugin.</p>\n<h4>I kind of thought my site was betterified site was actually better? Should I just deactivate worserified?</h4>\n<p>No.  Your betterified website was too much better, leave worserified activated</p>\n<h4>How can I ever thank you?</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t thank me. Thank the person on the plugin review team who actually let this plugin on the repository.</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin actually a placebo?</h4>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n<li>Added filter to fix the betterified titles</li>\n<li>Included fix function to keep broken things broken!</li>\n<li>Implemented conflict resolution feature that leaves the conflict in its real state</li>\n<li>Created function for de-optimizing SEO</li>\n</ul>\n"
