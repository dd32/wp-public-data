        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I use multiple addresses?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can define custom addresses per widget or shortcode, this will allow you to track which code is attracting the most payments.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use multiple cryptocurrencies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, much wow, if you have dogecoin you can use this plugin to display that address and others too!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a 3rd Party account to use this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently this plugin does not integrate with other services directly.  You enter and manage the addresses you want to use.  Those addresses can be generated and kept on any device or web or paper wallet of your choice.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this a shopping cart?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this is just the ability to display your address as text or a QRCode as many times where ever you like on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I have 2 different QRCodes for 1 address, and 1 address with no QRCode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a good chance that the QRCodes have the same DIV ID, if you are using the widget, please check the last setting in the widget settings, and in the shortcode you can set &#8220;div_id&#8221;. Please check the &#8220;How To Use It&#8221; tab on the Settings page for more details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The address in the Widget is breaking my theme design</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try adding the following CSS to your theme Style Sheet, it will do it&#8217;s best to try and force those long addresses to break on to multiple lines.<br />\n    .btcpWAddress{<br />\n        word-wrap: break-word;<br />\n        word-break: break-all;<br />\n    }</p>\n<p>Or you could hide the address, please check the &#8220;How To Use It&#8221; tab on the Settings page for more details.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
