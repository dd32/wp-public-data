        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this work with my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The default template is extremely simple and should fit in with most any theme. You can also add a custom template to your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize the front door?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can copy the <code>login.php</code> file from the <code>&lt;plugin-directory&gt;/templates/</code> to your theme directory and customize it to your needs. Do not edit the <code>&lt;plugin-directory&gt;/templates/login.php</code> file directly, as it could be overwritten by later plugin updates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if I go directly to an admin URL?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Admin pages bypass the front door. For example, if you go to http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/ and you are not logged in, you will be redirected to http://yoursite.com/wp-login.php by the default WordPress behavior. This is to prevent the site admin from accidentally locking themselves out of their site by specifying a custom front door page with no login form.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
