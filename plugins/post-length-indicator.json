        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I need a plugin like this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a visitor comes to an article with a really long scrollbar that is caused by having lots of comments, they are often put off because it appears that the article is longer than it actually is. This plugin solves that problem by showing your readers how long your article is from the get go. It also allows people to scroll directly to the comments section of the post because they will know exactly how far down the page it is.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I hide the indicator for a specific post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use this snippet to hide the indicator for a specific post: https://gist.github.com/hlashbrooke/6f377182d89c2a640fd0 &#8211; just replace &#8216;123&#8217; with the ID of the post in question.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
