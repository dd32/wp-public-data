You can also select the &#8220;Custom Link&#8221; option if it links directly to an image file.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder wp-featherlight-disabled to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20the%20newest%20wp%20version%20and%20also%20older%20versions%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with the newest WP version and also older versions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin works perfect with the latest version of WordPress! It also works with older versions as well but you should always run the latest WordPress and PHP version for best security and performance. This plugin is used in my critical sites so you can be assured it works perfect.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this plugin slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s the most lightweight lightbox plugin possible. It does only the essential function and nothing more. No heavy PHP processing or database queries. I&#8217;m an absolute speed fanatic.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20plan%20to%20add%20more%20features%3F'>\nDo you plan to add more features?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. This was intended as a free community plugin and to be as lightweight as possible. You&#8217;re welcome to fork it and make your own. Or if you need a more full-featured image gallery, I love Jordy&#8217;s [Meow Gallery] plugin(https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/). That WP Featherlight and Meow Gallery are the 2 most lightweight and developer-grade image/gallery plugins IMO. I wouldn&#8217;t use anything else.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20have%20a%20display%20problem%3F'>\nWhat if I have a display problem?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Display problems can be related to your theme. You can open a support request or see more information on the official Featherlight script <a href=\"https://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20filters%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat filters are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin has no GUI options. Some handy filters are available to modify default behavior. All images using default WordPress captions will also include a caption when the image is lightboxed. To disable this behavior, filter <code>wp_featherlight_captions</code> to false.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<p>Plugin was tested in latest WP 6.4.2 and description was updated. More screenshots were added to help customers with the images configuration.</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>The official WP Featherlight plugin uses same meta value name for each post as our plugin. To avoid the same meta parameter name usage, we decided another meta name &#8220;zeroneit_featherlight_disable&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<p>.webp format is supported.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Starting fork off of the official WP Featherlight version 1.3.3. (Only thing changed was the default load behavior, and checkbox wording in post setting.)
