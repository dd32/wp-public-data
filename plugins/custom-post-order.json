The options provided with the plugin at this moment allow users to order the displayed posts by  post date, post title,<br />\npost author, last time modified and post slug, either ascending or descending.</p>\n<p>These post display options can be set by accessing the &#8220;Manage-&gt;Custom Post Order&#8221; link, for wp2.6, and &#8220;Tools-&gt;Custom Post Order&#8221; link, for wp2.7.</p>\n",

In other words, you have to visit the custom post order manangement page<br />\nfor the first time, in order for the plugin to initialize its variables. However, this problem was fixed in 1.1. Downloading the new version of the<br />\nplugin will fix this error.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin adds a filter to the &#8220;posts_orderby&#8221; event which is used whenever posts are being displayed on your blog. This means that to use it, all<br />\nyou have to do is save the custom post order options and you&#8217;ll be able to see a different order of the posts displayed anywhere in your blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the order not change for my page ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin was either not activated for your blog, or the page that you are on does not display posts.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
