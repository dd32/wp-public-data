As of WordPress 2.7 this page should be located at http://yourblog.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=geo-blogroll/geo_blogroll.php)</li>\n<li>Add your Google API key. (You can get one <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>)</li>\n<li>Add a width for your map. This can be in pixels or a percentage.</li>\n<li>Add a height to your map. This can be in pixels or a percentage.</li>\n<li>Add a center point to the map. This can be any address that Google geocoder can decode.</li>\n<li>Add a map zoom level. This can be a number from 1 to 10.</li>\n<li>Add a level of noise that you want to add to each of the mapped points. (You should almost always leave this at 0.) The reason this option is here is because when you have a number of blogs that geocode to the same location, the markers that represent these blogs lay directly on top of each other on the map, rendering some of the markers unclickable. Adding some random noise to the location of the markers fixes this overlap problem. This is the least elegant of all solutions but was the quickest to implement. In the future I hope to implement something a bit better than this.</li>\n</ol>\n",
