It doesn&#8217;t make changes to your physical media folders or affect your media file URLs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20unlimited%20folders%3F'>\nCan I create unlimited folders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, with CatFolders &#8211; WP Media Folders, you can add unlimited media folders and they are all accessible while you edit page/post using WordPress page builders.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20it%20remember%20my%20last%20opened%20folder%3F'>\nCan it remember my last opened folder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, please go to <strong>Settings</strong>, open <strong>Startup folder</strong>, select <strong>Previous folder</strong> to make sure it will automatically take you to the recently opened WordPress media library folder to pick up where you left off.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20any%20users%20create%20and%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20folders%3F'>\nCan any users create and make changes to the folders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is under the admin&#8217;s control. As an administrator, you can choose to have private folder structure for each user. Which means a user can view/edit those folders created by themselves, and cannot view/edit those folders created by other users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20created%20all%20the%20folders%20and%20put%20all%20the%20images%20in%20the%20right%20place%2C%20then%20realised%20this%20view%20is%20only%20available%20to%20me.%20when%20i%20turn%20user-based%20folders%20off%2C%20the%20folders%20disappear%2C%20even%20for%20me.%20is%20there%20a%20way%20to%20make%20the%20folders%20i%20created%20with%20user-based%20folders%20on%2C%20to%20be%20available%20to%20everyone%3F'>\nI created all the folders and put all the images in the right place, then realised this view is only available to me. When I turn User-based folders OFF, the folders disappear, even for me. Is there a way to make the folders I created with User-based folders on, to be available to everyone?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hi, as an admin user, you can merge your user-based folders into &#8220;common folders&#8221;. Here are the steps: <a href=\"https://wpmediafolders.com/docs/settings/backup-restore-folders/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Exporting the CSV</a>, changing the user number at the &#8220;created_by&#8221; column to zero, and uploading it again makes the folders available to everyone.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20lifetime%20license%20in%20the%20pro%20version%3F'>\nDo you offer lifetime license in the Pro version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https://wpmediafolders.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CatFolders &#8211; WP Media Folders Pro</a> comes with lifetime licenses for a single website or unlimited websites.
