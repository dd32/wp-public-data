        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20happened%20to%20the%20tag%20list%20widget%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat happened to the Tag List Widget plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since I first wrote the Tag Dropdown Widget plugin upon which this plugin is based (in November 2009), WordPress introduced custom taxonomies and, as more-fully discussed below, saw a new widgets API overtake its predecessor. As part of the widgets-API-related rewrite, I expanded the plugin to support non-hierarchical custom taxonomies, which necessitated a new name for the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20rewrite%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you rewrite the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When I first wrote the Tag Dropdown Widget plugin, which I later forked to create the Tag List Widget plugin, WordPress was amidst a change in how widgets were managed. I decided to utilize the old widget methods to ensure the greatest compatibility at the time. In the nearly two years since I released the first version of this plugin, the new widget system has been widely adopted, putting this plugin at a disadvantage. So, I rewrote the plugin to use the new widget API and added support for non-hierarchical taxonomies other than just post tags.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20upgraded%20to%20version%201.0%20and%20all%20of%20my%20widgets%20disappeared.%20what%20happened%3F'>\nI upgraded to version 1.0 and all of my widgets disappeared. What happened?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As discussed above, WordPress&#8217; widget system has changed drastically since I first released this plugin. To facilitate multiple uses of the same widget while allowing each to maintain its own set of options, the manner for storing widget options changed. As a result, there is no practical way to transition a widget&#8217;s options from version 0.3.1 to 1.0.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20my%20theme%20does%20not%20support%20widgets%2C%20or%20i%20would%20like%20to%20include%20the%20list%20outside%20of%20the%20sidebar%2C%20can%20i%20still%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nIf my theme does not support widgets, or I would like to include the list outside of the sidebar, can I still use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Insert the function <code>&lt;?php if( function_exists( 'taxonomy_list_widget' ) ) echo taxonomy_list_widget( $args, $id ); ?&gt;</code> where the list should appear, specifying <code>$args</code> as an array of arguments and, optionally, <code>$id</code> as a string uniquely identifying this list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>taxonomy &#8211; slug of taxonomy for list. Defaults to <code>post_tag</code>.</li>\n<li>select_name &#8211; name of first (default) option in the list. Defaults to <code>Select Tag</code>.</li>\n<li>max_name_length &#8211; integer representing maximum length of term name to display. Set to <code>0</code> to show full names. Defaults to <code>0</code>.</li>\n<li>cutoff &#8211; string indicating that a term name has been cutoff based on the <code>max_name_length</code> setting. Defaults to an ellipsis (<code>&amp;hellip;</code>).</li>\n<li>limit &#8211; integer specifying maximum number of terms to retrieve. Set to <code>0</code> for no limit. Defaults to <code>0</code>.</li>\n<li>orderby &#8211; either <code>name</code> to order by term name or <code>count</code> to order by the number of posts associated with the given term. Defaults to <code>name</code>.</li>\n<li>order &#8211; either <code>ASC</code> for ascending order or <code>DESC</code> for descending order. Defaults to <code>ASC</code>.</li>\n<li>threshold &#8211; integer specifying the minimum number of posts to which a term must be assigned to be included in the list. Set to <code>0</code> for now threshold. Defaults to <code>0</code>.</li>\n<li>incexc &#8211; <code>include</code> or <code>exclude</code> to either include or exclude the terms whose IDs are included in <code>incexc_ids</code>. By default, this restriction is not enabled.</li>\n<li>incexc_ids &#8211; comma-separated list of term IDs to either include or exclude based on the <code>incexc</code> setting.</li>\n<li>hide_empty &#8211; set to <code>false</code> to include in the list any terms that haven&#8217;t been assigned to any objects (i.e. unused tags). Defaults to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>post_counts &#8211; set to <code>true</code> to include post counts after term names. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</li>\n<li>delimiter &#8211; sets list style. Native options are <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, and <code>nl</code> for bulleted list, numbered list, and line breaks, respectively. By passing an array with keys <code>before_list</code>, <code>after_list</code>, <code>before_item</code>, and <code>after_item</code>, you can completely customize the list style.</li>\n<li>rel &#8211; either <code>dofollow</code> or <code>nofollow</code>. Can still use <code>taxonomy_list_widget_link_rel</code> filter to specify link relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20tlw_direct%28%29%20function%20deprecated%3F'>\nWhy is the TLW_direct() function deprecated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Version 1.0 represents a complete rewrite of the original Tag List Widget plugin. As part of the rewrite, all prior functions for generating tag lists were deprecated, or marked as obsolete, because they are unable to access the full complement of features introduced in version 1.0. While the functions still exist, their capabilities are extremely limited and they should not be replaced with <code>taxonomy_list_widget()</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20obtain%20a%20term%27s%20id%20for%20use%20with%20the%20inclusion%20or%20exclusion%20options%3F'>\nWhere do I obtain a term&#8217;s ID for use with the inclusion or exclusion options?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Term IDs can be obtained in a variety of ways. The easiest is to visit the taxonomy term editor (Post Tags, found under Posts, for example) and, while hovering over the term&#8217;s name, looking at your browser&#8217;s status bar. At the very end of the address shown in the status bar, the term ID will follow the text &#8220;tag_ID.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can also obtain the term ID by clicking the edit link below any term&#8217;s name in the Post Tags page. Next, look at your browser&#8217;s address bar. At the very end of the address, the term ID will follow the text &#8220;tag_ID.&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27d%20like%20more%20control%20over%20the%20tags%20shown%20in%20the%20list.%20is%20this%20possible%3F'>\nI&#8217;d like more control over the tags shown in the list. Is this possible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin relies on WordPress&#8217; <code>get_terms</code> function (https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_terms). To modify the arguments passed to this function, use the <code>taxonomy_list_widget_options</code> filter to specify any of the arguments discussed in the Codex page for <code>get_terms</code>.</p>\n<p>To make targeting a specific filter reference possible should you use multiple instances of the list (multiple widgets, use of the <code>taxonomy_list_widget</code> function, or some combination thereof), the filter provides a second argument, <code>$id</code>, that is either the numeric ID of the widget&#8217;s instance or the string provided as the second argument to <code>taxonomy_list_widget</code>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
