        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20cloudcache%20compatible%20with%20all%20wordpress%20plugins%20and%20themes%3F'>\nIs CloudCache compatible with all WordPress plugins and themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>CloudCache</strong> is designed to be compatible with most WordPress plugins and themes, including popular ones like <strong>WooCommerce</strong>, <strong>Elementor</strong>, <strong>LiteSpeed Cache</strong>, and many others. However, some less optimized plugins or themes may not fully support caching technologies. These cases are rare, but itâ€™s always a good idea to use well-maintained and optimized plugins to ensure the best performance and compatibility with high-performance systems like <strong>CloudCache</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20every%20page%20flush%20when%20i%20make%20a%20new%20post%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t every page flush when I make a new post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>CloudCache</strong> performs an intelligent cache purge, removing only the necessary pages to ensure updates are reflected without overloading the server. When you publish a new post, the pages purged include the homepage, the post itself, associated categories and tags, pagination pages, and <strong>sitemaps</strong>, among other relevant pages. This optimizes performance while ensuring that important updates are visible to your visitors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20my%20cache%20purge%20when%20i%20edit%20my%20theme%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t my cache purge when I edit my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>CloudCache</strong> automatically clears the cache when there are changes to your siteâ€™s <strong>content</strong>, such as editing pages, posts, or receiving comments. However, if you&#8217;re simply <strong>editing</strong> the theme (e.g., modifying CSS or adjusting visual settings), the cache is not automatically cleared because the content remains the same. To reflect these changes, you can manually purge the cache. If you <strong>switch</strong> to a new theme entirely, <strong>CloudCache</strong> will automatically flush the entire cache for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20manually%20purge%20the%20whole%20cache%3F'>\nHow do I manually purge the whole cache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can manually flush the entire cache by clicking the &#8220;Purge CloudCache&#8221; button on the WordPress dashboard or using the &#8220;Blizhost CloudCache &gt; Purge Entire Cache&#8221; option in the admin toolbar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20see%20a%20button%21'>\nI don&#8217;t see a button!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a Multisite Network and you&#8217;re on the primary site, only <strong>network</strong> admins can purge the cache for the main site. In subfolder networks, flushing the main site (<code>example.com</code>) also purges all subsites (like <code>example.com/site1</code>). This is done to prevent accidental cache flushes across the network.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20with%20a%20proxy%20service%20like%20cloudflare%3F'>\nCan I use this with a proxy service like Cloudflare?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! <strong>CloudCache</strong> is fully compatible with proxy or CDN services like <strong>Cloudflare</strong>, enhancing both the performance and security of your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20disable%20cloudcache%3F'>\nHow do I disable CloudCache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can request the removal of <strong>CloudCache</strong> by opening a support ticket in the client panel. However, keep in mind that <strong>CloudCache</strong> significantly boosts your site&#8217;s speed and traffic-handling capacity, making it up to 300x faster.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
