        "description": "<p><strong>Blizhost CloudCache Purge</strong> sends a request to the Blizhost servers clear the cache every time the content of your site is modified. This occurs when publishing, editing, commenting or deleting a page or post, and when changing themes.</p>\n<p>Our plugin will also make your WordPress site <strong>completely compatible with CloudCache</strong>!</p>\n<p>This plugin is <strong>exclusive</strong> to Blizhost customers, and will have no results if used outside of our hosting.</p>\n<h4>What is CloudCache?</h4>\n<p>CloudCache is an HTTP accelerator designed for <strong>high traffic</strong> websites. Your website is delivered directly from the RAM of the server, making loading <strong>300x more faster</strong> and dramatically <strong>increasing access capacity</strong> to the site.</p>\n<p>In contrast to other web accelerators, such as Squid, which began life as a client-side cache, or Apache and nginx, which are primarily origin servers, CloudCache was designed as an HTTP accelerator. CloudCache is focused exclusively on HTTP, unlike other proxy servers that often support FTP, SMTP and other network protocols.</p>\n<p>Technologies like CloudCache are used by <strong>high-profile, high-traffic websites</strong> including Wikipedia, online newspaper sites such as The New York Times, The Guardian, The Hindu, Corriere della Sera, social media and content sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, and Tumblr. Among the Top 10 thousand sites in the web, around a tenth use this technology.</p>\n<h4>Plugin details</h4>\n<p>Our plugin in addition to making your site compatible with our system will clean your site cache automatically whenever you publish/update a post or page.</p>\n<p>Not all pages are purged every time. When a post, page, or custom post type is edited, or a new comment is added, <em>only</em> the following pages will be purged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The front page</li>\n<li>The post/page edited</li>\n<li>Any categories or tags associated with the page</li>\n<li>The pagination pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, your entire cache will be purged on the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing permalinks</li>\n<li>Changing themes</li>\n<li>Press the &#8216;Purge CloudCache&#8217; button on the dashboard</li>\n<li>Press the &#8216;Blizhost CloudCache &gt; Purge Entire Cache&#8217; button on the toolbar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note: On a multisite network using subfolders, only the <strong>network admins</strong> can purge the main site.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>No WordPress configuration needed.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Pretty Permalinks enabled</li>\n<li>CloudCache enabled on your Blizhost account</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Languages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>Portuguese-BR</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20cloudcache%20compatible%20with%20all%20wordpress%20plugins%20and%20themes%3F'>\nIs CloudCache compatible with all WordPress plugins and themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CloudCache is designed to be compatible with most plugins and themes, it works with the same basic principle of other caching systems, and many developers are concerned with creating cache-compatible plugins.</p>\n<p>But unfortunately they are not all, a minority does not care about performance. Because most sites are small and do not get much traffic, this is not a concern for these developers.</p>\n<p>So we recommend that you always use well-known plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>After all, if you care about speed and performance, it&#8217;s not a good idea to have a plugin on your site that is not suited for high-traffic sites!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20every%20page%20flush%20when%20i%20make%20a%20new%20post%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t every page flush when I make a new post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The only pages that should purge are the post&#8217;s page, the front page, categories, and tags.</p>\n<p>When building out this plugin, there were a couple pathways on how best to handle purging caches and they boiled down to two: Decisions (the plugin purges what it purges when it purges) and Options (you decide what to purge, when and why). It&#8217;s entirely possible to make this plugin purge everything, every time a &#8216;trigger&#8217; happens, have it purge some things, or have it be so you can pick that purges.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20my%20cache%20purge%20when%20i%20edit%20my%20theme%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t my cache purge when I edit my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because the plugin only purges your <em>content</em> when you edit it. That means if you edit a page/post, or someone leaves a comment, it&#8217;ll change. Otherwise, you have to purge the whole cache. The plugin will do this for you if you &#8221;change&#8221; your theme, but not when you edit your theme.</p>\n<p>If you use Jetpack&#8217;s CSS editor, it will purge the whole cache for your site on save.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20manually%20purge%20the%20whole%20cache%3F'>\nHow do I manually purge the whole cache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the &#8216;Purge CloudCache&#8217; button on the &#8220;Right Now&#8221; Dashboard (see the screenshot if you can&#8217;t find it).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Blizhost CloudCache &gt; Purge Entire Cache&#8221; button on the admin toolbar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20see%20a%20button%21'>\nI don&#8217;t see a button!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on a Multisite Network and you&#8217;re on the primary site in the network, only the <em>network</em> admins can purge that site</p>\n<p>On a subfolder network if you flush the site at <code>example.com</code>, then everything under that (like <code>example.com/site1</code> and <code>example.com/siten</code> and everything else) would also get flushed. That means that a purge on the main site purges the entire network.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate the destructive nature of that power, only the network admins can purge everything on the main site of a subfolder network.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20with%20a%20proxy%20service%20like%20cloudflare%3F'>\nCan I use this with a proxy service like CloudFlare?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! Feel free to use with any proxy or CDN service.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20disable%20the%20cloudcache%3F'>\nHow do I disable the CloudCache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can open a support ticket on the client panel requesting the removal of CloudCache. But it&#8217;s important to note that this technology makes your site up to 300x faster and with support for high traffic.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
