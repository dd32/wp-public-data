How about spell check, or change the paragraph style without dropping back to the standard post edit mode?  Now you can get all the functionality of the standard mode tools in DFW!</p>\n<p>But maybe you think there are too many buttons in DFW, no problem you can get rid of pretty much all of them!</p>\n<p>Just Writing takes DFW from a great way to write to a great way of writing posts!</p>\n<h4>New Commands</h4>\n<p>This plugin adds the following optional commands to the toolbar in DFW:</p>\n<pre><code>* Address                   * Insert More Tag\n* Align Full                * Insert Custom Character\n* Align Left                * Outdent\n* Align Right               * Paragraph\n* Background Color          * Paste\n* Block Quotes              * Paste as Text\n* Copy                      * Paste from Word\n* Cut                       * Preformatted\n* Font                      * Preview\n* Font Color                * Redo\n* Font Size                 * Remove Formatting\n* H1                        * Spellcheck\n* H2                        * Strikethrough\n* H3                        * Subscript\n* H4                        * Superscript   \n* H5                        * Underline\n* H6                        * Undo\n* Indent                \n</code></pre>\n<h4>More Features</h4>\n<pre><code>* Option to remove the fade effect and keep the toolbar visible\n* Option to hide or lighten the border on the title/body areas\n* Option to hide the word count\n* Option to hide the editor mode bar\n* Option to center the toolbar on screen\n* Adds an optional Preview button to the right of the Save button\n* Moves the exit link to the right of the new Preview \n  button as a real button\n* Re-orders the button list to make more sense\n* Per-user preferences for enabling Just Writing\n* Per-user preferences for which buttons to display\n* Option to start in DFW for new posts\n* Option to start in DFW when editing posts\n* Option to add a DFW link to the pages/posts list to go directly to DFW\n* Adds spell check field to the post title so your browser will spell check it for you\n* Browser full screen mode now support\n</code></pre>\n<h4>WordPress 4.1+ Support</h4>\n<p>DFW in WP4.1 is a completely different than previous versions and Just Writing takes a completely different approach to it.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20browsers%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat browsers are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try it and find out, the JavaScript is pretty basic so it should work in just about any browser.  I&#8217;ve successfully run it on:</p>\n<pre><code>* IE 11\n* Opera 12.16\n* FireFox 24/25\n* Chrome 31\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20find%20the%20just%20writing%20options%2C%20where%20are%20they%3F'>\nI can&#8217;t find the Just Writing options, where are they?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For standard users (aka non-admin users), they can go to their WordPress settings page and select &#8220;Profile&#8221;, scroll down to the bottom and your see the Just Writing section.</p>\n<p>For admin users it can be found under &#8220;Users&#8221;-&gt;&#8221;Your Profile&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20disabled%20the%20fade%20effect%20and%20now%20the%20browser%20is%20running%20slowly%2C%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve disabled the fade effect and now the browser is running slowly, what&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The fade effect is triggered by WordPress when no mouse movement is executed for 2 seconds, the only (without changing some of the WordPress sources files at least) way to disable it is to execute a mousemove event every 1.5 seconds.  This shouldn&#8217;t be an issue in any modern browser, but if your having performance issues, simply re-enable the fade effect.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20disabled%20the%20fade%20effect%20but%20there%20is%20a%20%27flicker%27%20when%20dfw%20comes%20up%2C%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve disabled the fade effect but there is a &#8216;flicker&#8217; when DFW comes up, what&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you start DFW without moving the mouse you might hit right between when WordPress starts fading but before Just Writing fires off a mousemove event, this shouldn&#8217;t be an issue after the first start of DFW.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20added%20the%20spellcheck%20button%20to%20my%20toolbar%20but%20it%20doesn%27t%20do%20anything%20when%20i%20click%20it'>\nI&#8217;ve added the spellcheck button to my toolbar but it doesn&#8217;t do anything when I click it\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of WordPress 3.6, the spellchecker is no longer part of the core WordPress install, you need to add a plugin to get the functionality back.  I&#8217;d suggest <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-spellcheck/\" rel=\"ugc\">TinyMCE SpellChecker</a> as a good option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20%22paste%20as%20word%22%20button%20doesn%27t%20show%20up%20in%20wordpress%203.9%2C%20why%20not%3F'>\nThe &#8220;Paste as Word&#8221; button doesn&#8217;t show up in WordPress 3.9, why not?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress 3.9 removed the &#8220;Paste as Word&#8221; button as the functionality is built in to TinyMCE now.  Just paste your word content in to the visual editor and the formatting will be maintained.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='browser%20full%20screen%20mode%20isn%27t%20working...'>\nBrowser full screen mode isn&#8217;t working&#8230;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Browser full screen mode is highly dependent on the browser, it may not work for you.  For example Safari blocks keyboard input during full screen mode.</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s not working for you try another browser.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20the%20browser%20full%20screen%20mode%20be%20auto%20loaded%20like%20dfw'>\nWhy can&#8217;t the browser full screen mode be auto loaded like DFW\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Two words for you: Browser Security.</p>\n<p>Modern browsers support full screen mode but they only activate it when a user clicks on a button, there&#8217;s no way to fake it through JavaScript.  Thats so that a malicous web site doesn&#8217;t try and impersonate your OS and get you to enter a password that it steal.</p>\n<p>The other issue is that full screen mode is de-activated as soon as you leave the current page, so for example Just Writing could link full screen mode to the DFW &#8220;click&#8221; in the post list, but as soon as the browser leaves the post list to load the editor page full screen mode will be deactivated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20using%20the%20%22avia%20layout%20builder%22%20and%20when%20i%20use%20just%20writing%20my%20chnages%20don%27t%20get%20published%2C%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI&#8217;m using the &#8220;Avia Layout Builder&#8221; and when I use Just Writing my chnages don&#8217;t get published, what&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately the &#8220;Avia Layout Builder&#8221; is incompatible with Just Writing.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
