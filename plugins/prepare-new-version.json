You don‚Äôt need to handle permalinks, content replacement, or things that would usually be tedious and maybe not without risk. With Prepare New Versions, all of these are being taken care of!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I create a new version of a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>New versions are created from the post editing screen. It can be either an existing post or a pending version of one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I duplicate a post, what‚Äôs the status of the newly created copy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>New posts which are copied from existing posts are automatically created with a Draft status. They are independent of the original post and can be published whenever you like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I quickly see how many pending versions have been created for each post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you activate the Prepare New Versions plugin, a new column ‚ÄúPending versions‚Äù appears in last position, in the Posts list. You can then access these versions by editing the original post and scrolling to the ‚ÄúPending versions‚Äù box.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I prepare a new version, the permalink differs from the original post‚Äôs. What‚Äôs going to happen when I update the original post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you click the ‚ÄúUpdate original‚Äù button, the permalink is not going to be altered, and will remain the same. This means it won‚Äôt change anything for your blog visitors, except for the updated content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I remove pending versions I don‚Äôt use anymore?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you update an original post, previous pending versions are not deleted and will remain available. However, you have 2 ways to remove them:<br />\n* go to the pending version editing screen and click ‚ÄúMove to trash‚Äù in the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù box:<br />\n* go the the Posts list and click the ‚ÄúPending versions‚Äù link.You will now access a list of all pending versions and will be able to remove one or several at a time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
