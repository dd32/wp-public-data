Once ready, it\\&#8217;ll come with every WordPress installation (not as a plugin, but built-in as the default editor).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I installed this plugin but don\\&#8217;t see any additional blocks.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each block can be enabled/disabled from the “WPBlocks” panel under “Settings” menu item in WordPress Dashboard. Check if the blocks you want to use are enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the additional blocks added by this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, there are three additional blocks available: Info Box, Social Icons, and Blank Space. More blocks will be added with updates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is WPBlocks translation ready?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WPBlocks comes with full translation and localization support via the wpblocks textdomain. All .mo and .po translation files should go into the languages folder in the root folder of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
