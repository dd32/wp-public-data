        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the latest version and extract it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the plugin is activated, you can use it as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>First navigate to WooCommerce settings. Under the Discounts Plus tab, find the global<br />\nconfiguration for Discounts Plus. Make sure &#8220;Discounts Plus Enabled&#8221; is checked and optionally<br />\nfill information about discounts which will be visible on the cart page. You can include HTML<br />\nmarkup in the text &#8211; you can, for instance, include a link to your page with your discount<br />\npolicy. In case you need the plugin to work well with product variations, make sure that the<br />\n&#8220;Treat product variations separately&#8221; option is unchecked. Since version 2.0 you<br />\nmay choose to use a flat discount applied to the cart item subtotal. Optionally you may also<br />\nmodify the CSS styles for the old value and the new value which is displayed in the cart.<br />\nSave the settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to Products and choose a product for which you want to create a discount policy.<br />\nIn the Product Data panel, click Discounts Plus and optionally fill information about the discount<br />\nwhich will be visible in the product description.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click &#8220;Define discount criteria&#8221; button to create a policy. Quantity (min.) means minimal<br />\nnumber of ordered items so that the (second textbox) Discount applies. It is possible to<br />\nadd up to five discount lines to fine-tune the discount setting.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

Note that this discount policy only applies to the concrete product &#8212; other<br />\nproducts may have their own (possibly different) discount policies.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20provide%20an%20example%20of%20setting%20a%20flat%20discounts%20plus%3F'>\nCan you provide an example of setting a flat Discounts Plus?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Example for flat discount follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 10, Discount ($) = 10</li>\n<li>Quantity (min.) = 30, Discount ($) = 20</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the customer orders, say, 15 items of the product which costs $10 per item, the first discount<br />\nline will apply and the customer will pay (15 * 10) &#8211; 10 dollars. If the customers orders<br />\n50 items, the second discount line will apply and the final price will be (50 * 10) &#8211; 20 dollars.<br />\nSetting Discounts Plus couldn&#8217;t have been easier.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
