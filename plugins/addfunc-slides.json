        "description": "<p>AddFunc Slides&#8217; native and intuitive custom post type (called Slides) and taxonomy (called Slidesets) utilizes the powerful content management and editing features built into WordPress core. That is what makes it easy to grasp and manage. It includes administrative features such as quick edit, bulk edit, column sorting and a properly placed Slide Settings page (under Slides, not under the general Settings section).</p>\n<p>AddFunc Slides was made for CSS coders/themers, as well as for average WordPress users. It comes as a plug &amp; play package with it&#8217;s already active <a href=\"http://addfunc.com/slides/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">default stylesheet</a>, providing a basic but robust slideshow presentation interface. This stylesheet can be turned off in Slides-&gt;Settings, allowing a CSS coder full control over the entire look and feel of slideshows including transitions. The vanilla JavaScript slideshow script only changes classes and does not use the style attribute, meaning all state changes can be animated by CSS.</p>\n<p>One of the things that makes Slides so easy to manage is the Edit button displayed with each Slide on the front-end when you&#8217;re logged in with Editor privileges. When you see a Slide in your slider that you want to edit, simply click the Edit button and you&#8217;re now editing that very Slide. Slides can also be moved from one Slideset to another with a couple of clicks. No need to migrate Slides by copy &amp; paste.</p>\n<p>Slides are just like Posts or Pages, with the standard Visual/Text editor, revisions, publication settings, featured image (used for thumbnails), etc. The big difference is that they are made for slideshows. Additional specialized Slide options allow you to upload/select a main image using the Media Library (so you can keep that separate from the editor content), link the main image to any Page, Post or other URL/URI, select the nature of the Slide (Imagery or Content) and set the Slide&#8217;s priority (any numeric value). You can even upload/select a background image (also using the Media Library), so there is no need to use your stylesheet to do a CSS background-image for each Slide.</p>\n<p>Specialized buttons in the editor (TinyMCE) make it easy to add the CSS classes of a set, appropriate for slideshow objects and supported by the default stylesheet. These include four directional options (left, right, up and down), two rotational options (clockwise and counter-clockwise), an incremental option (with up to six increments) and a decremental option (with up to six decrements). These classes can also be styled or animated by CSS and can therefore be repurposed for any need a web developer deems them best suitable for. We gave these buttons generic names for that very purpose.</p>\n<p>The shortcode [slides] supports parameters for every feature the slideshow script has to offer, while not requiring any of them at all (except where customization is necessary, of course). These features include</p>\n<pre><code>*   slideset — Selects a specific Slideset by slug\n*   auto — Automates Slide transitioning\n*   speed — Duration each Slide is displayed\n*   prevnext — Adds \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons\n*   pause — Adds a Pause button\n*   tabs — Adds tabs/pager with optional labels and/or thumbnails\n*   tabsfirst — Outputs tabs before the slideshow instead of after\n*   stoppable — Stops automated transition upon user interaction\n*   pauseonhover — Pauses automated transition upon hover/mouseover\n*   fullscreen — Adds Fullscreen button (note limited browser support)[http://caniuse.com/#search=fullscreen]\n*   swipe — Adds touchscreen swipe capability. (By default, left = next Slide, right = previous Slide. Also includes up = next Slide, down = previous Slide, and a few other combinations thereof)\n*   class — Adds CSS class(es) to the slideset container\n*   order — The order in which Slides are displayed\n*   orderby — What the display order is based upon — date, priority (if set in Slide options), name, ID, random\n</code></pre>\n<p>A Help Tab is available (when editing any Post, Page, etc.) with simple but detailed instructions on how to write [slides] shortcodes, including all options available, as well as currently created Slidesets.</p>\n<p>The Slides Widget supports all of the same options as the shortcode, with a comprehensive set of on/off settings and multiple choice boxes. And of course for you themers, if you would like to do_shortcode in your theme files, that option is available as well.</p>\n<p>We have big plans for AddFunc Slides. We created it because we couldn&#8217;t find any other slideshow plugin that works anything like this one does. That&#8217;s really the basis by which we build all of our plugins — to fill a needed gap. We hope that you find this plugin to be as vastly useful as we do.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the Slides-&gt;Settings screen to configure the plugin as needed</li>\n<li>Create Slides as needed using the &#8216;Add new Slide&#8217; button/option</li>\n<li>Create slideshows as needed using the Slides Widget or [slides] shortcode</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I change the look of the slideshow?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AddFunc Slides was designed to be developer-firendly. As such, short of it&#8217;s optional default stylesheet for plug &amp; play purposes, Slides is free of the added clutter many other plugins have for styling purposes. If you (or your development person/team) can code in CSS, you can use the default stylesheet as a starting point or build your own from scratch. Just be sure to load your custom stylesheet from outside of the plugin, so that updates don&#8217;t overwrite your work. A great place to house your custom stylesheet would be in a child-theme folder.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I turn off the default stylesheet?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to Slides &gt; Settings. You&#8217;ll see the option there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there an easier way to give my slideshows a different look?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, but there will be. Stay tuned, because we plan to build an online store loaded with skins for this plugin and others not yet released.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are all the available parameters for the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All available parameters are defined in the Help tab, when editing a Page, Post or similar Post Type. You can also find the list of parameters in the main Description of this plugin profile or readme.txt.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t the `order` property working when I set it to DESC (descend)? What order are my Slides in if I didn&#8217;t set Priorities or the `order` property?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, Slides are output in ascending Priority order (lowest value to highest). Any Slides that have the same Priority value are effectively grouped together in sequence and appear in their &#8220;group&#8221; in the order they are found in the database (whichever order they were created in — oldest to newest). Therefore, if you want your slideshow in ascending date order and you created your Slides in that order, you can achieve that end without setting any Priorities or specifying the <code>order</code> or <code>orderby</code> properties. However, it is still technically sorting by Priority and not taking the date into consideration at all. So to change your slideshow to descending date order you will need to specify that you want it ordered by date. Please note also that an empty Priority value 0.0 and -0 are equal to 0 and are thusly grouped together as well.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Anything in-between would be confusing and hard work with</li>\n<li>The top-level parent would provide the most flexibility. In this way, we can have wrappers, sub-wrappers and control children of various types and in different ways</li>\n<li>Applying the class to the directly selected element would only give us control over that element. Also, the element would become unchangeable with the button, once you enclose all of its content with an inner wrapper — you then could only affect that inner wrapper with the buttons. This would be confusing and a nuisance if encountered</li>\n<li>For those who specifically wish to add classes to the children, they can with a little HTML know-how in Text view. The Visual editor buttons are for the broader convenience and for the less savvy website builder who would be less likely to understand the difference in CSS class placements in the DOM</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.22</h4>\n<p>7 Jun 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes TinyMCE buttons so they indicate with their active state that you have applied the class to the element (when clicking the button, not just after deselecting the element and selecting it again)</li>\n<li>Adds notices to the Slide metabox explaining the known issues with the text fields in this version of AddFunc Slides:\n<ul>\n<li>The [Choose Image] file uploader/selector buttons don&#8217;t provide the popup windows that they should, until the Slide is saved. The image-path fields do however accept and store any valid data that is manually entered</li>\n<li>The link selector highjacks the function used for adding links in the main editor. The adverse result is that <em>after</em> you save the Slide, the [link] Quicktag (in Text view) adds your chosen URL to the Slide metabox Link field instead of your highlighted text in the editor. Additionally, the [Choose Post] button doesn&#8217;t provide the popup window that it should until the Slide is saved. The Link field does however store any valid data that is entered</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.21</h4>\n<p>3 Jun 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds independent swipe capability to addfunc-slides.js</li>\n<li>Removes Hammer.js and the dependency for it</li>\n<li>Swipe parameters (Widget/&#8221;shortcode&#8221;):\n<ul>\n<li>Horizontal/&#8221;true&#8221;: (default) prevents scrolling while swiping left or right but not up or down, left decrements Slide, right increments Slide</li>\n<li>Vertical/&#8221;vertical&#8221;: prevents scrolling while swiping up or down but not left or right, up decrements Slide, down increments Slide</li>\n<li>Both/&#8221;both&#8221;: prevents scrolling while swiping up, down, left or right, up and left both decrements Slide, down and right both increments Slide</li>\n<li>Any/&#8221;any&#8221;: allows scrolling while swiping up, down, left or right, up and left both decrements Slide, down and right both increments Slide (note: in practice, it appears the devices scroll event overrides this touch event, therefore scrolling up and down do not work with this setting)</li>\n<li>OFF/&#8221;false&#8221;: removes swiping capability, scrolling is unaffected</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.20</h4>\n<p>1 Jun 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds labels option for tabs (shortcode &amp; widget) — outputs a label in each tab using the Slide&#8217;s titles</li>\n<li>Adds thumbnails option for tabs (shortcode &amp; widget) — outputs a thumbnail in each tab using the Slide&#8217;s featured images</li>\n<li>Adds option to place tabs before the slideshow</li>\n<li>Note: any of the above options will bypass addfunc-slides.js as the tabs will instead be output as HTML. addfunc-slides.js however still finds and controls the tabs all the same</li>\n<li>Changes the widget&#8217;s Tab checkbox/switch to a selectbox, which includes all supported options for tabs except placement</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.19</h4>\n<p>31 May 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds tabs to addfunc-slides.js — BOOM!\n<ul>\n<li>Widget Tabs button (checkbox/switch — Off by default)</li>\n<li>Shortcode Tabs parameter (true/false — false by default)</li>\n<li>Insert via JavaScript — empty ordered list items, which correspond and interact with the Slides</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Breaks swipe capability 🙁 — attempting to improve it</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.18.2</h4>\n<p>23 May 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes script to wait for page load to add .current to the first slide</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.18.1</h4>\n<p>12 Apr 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes a PHP error message due to an expected value not being defined</li>\n<li>Fixes breaking of other plugin&#8217;s TinyMCE button implementation by returning the needed arrays regardless of change.

    "description": "<p>AddFunc Slides&#8217; native and intuitive custom post type (called Slides) and taxonomy (called Slidesets) utilizes the powerful content management and editing features built into WordPress core. That is what makes it easy to grasp and manage. It includes administrative features such as quick edit, bulk edit, column sorting and a properly placed Slide Settings page (under Slides, not under the general Settings section).</p>\n<p>AddFunc Slides was made for CSS coders/themers, as well as for average WordPress users. It comes as a plug &amp; play package with it&#8217;s already active <a href=\"http://addfunc.com/slides/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">default stylesheet</a>, providing a basic but robust slideshow presentation interface. This stylesheet can be turned off in Slides-&gt;Settings, allowing a CSS coder full control over the entire look and feel of slideshows including transitions. The vanilla JavaScript slideshow script only changes classes and does not use the style attribute, meaning all state changes can be animated by CSS.</p>\n<p>One of the things that makes Slides so easy to manage is the Edit button displayed with each Slide on the front-end when you&#8217;re logged in with Editor privileges. When you see a Slide in your slider that you want to edit, simply click the Edit button and you&#8217;re now editing that very Slide. Slides can also be moved from one Slideset to another with a couple of clicks. No need to migrate Slides by copy &amp; paste.</p>\n<p>Slides are just like Posts or Pages, with the standard Visual/Text editor, revisions, publication settings, featured image (used for thumbnails), etc. The big difference is that they are made for slideshows. Additional specialized Slide options allow you to upload/select a main image using the Media Library (so you can keep that separate from the editor content), link the main image to any Page, Post or other URL/URI, select the nature of the Slide (Imagery or Content) and set the Slide&#8217;s priority (any numeric value). You can even upload/select a background image (also using the Media Library), so there is no need to use your stylesheet to do a CSS background-image for each Slide.</p>\n<p>Specialized buttons in the editor (TinyMCE) make it easy to add the CSS classes of a set, appropriate for slideshow objects and supported by the default stylesheet. These include four directional options (left, right, up and down), two rotational options (clockwise and counter-clockwise), an incremental option (with up to six increments) and a decremental option (with up to six decrements). These classes can also be styled or animated by CSS and can therefore be repurposed for any need a web developer deems them best suitable for. We gave these buttons generic names for that very purpose.</p>\n<p>The shortcode [slides] supports parameters for every feature the slideshow script has to offer, while not requiring any of them at all (except where customization is necessary, of course). These features include</p>\n<pre><code>*   slideset — Selects a specific Slideset by slug\n*   auto — Automates Slide transitioning\n*   speed — Duration each Slide is displayed\n*   prevnext — Adds \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons\n*   pause — Adds a Pause button\n*   tabs — Adds tabs/pager with optional labels and/or thumbnails\n*   tabsfirst — Outputs tabs before the slideshow instead of after\n*   stoppable — Stops automated transition upon user interaction\n*   pauseonhover — Pauses automated transition upon hover/mouseover\n*   fullscreen — Adds Fullscreen button (note limited browser support)[http://caniuse.com/#search=fullscreen]\n*   swipe — Adds touchscreen swipe capability. (By default, left = next Slide, right = previous Slide. Also includes up = next Slide, down = previous Slide, and a few other combinations thereof)\n*   class — Adds CSS class(es) to the slideset container\n*   order — The order in which Slides are displayed\n*   orderby — What the display order is based upon — date, priority (if set in Slide options), name, ID, random\n</code></pre>\n<p>A Help Tab is available (when editing any Post, Page, etc.) with simple but detailed instructions on how to write [slides] shortcodes, including all options available, as well as currently created Slidesets.</p>\n<p>The Slides Widget supports all of the same options as the shortcode, with a comprehensive set of on/off settings and multiple choice boxes. And of course for you themers, if you would like to do_shortcode in your theme files, that option is available as well.</p>\n<p>We have big plans for AddFunc Slides. We created it because we couldn&#8217;t find any other slideshow plugin that works anything like this one does. That&#8217;s really the basis by which we build all of our plugins — to fill a needed gap. We hope that you find this plugin to be as vastly useful as we do.</p>\n",
