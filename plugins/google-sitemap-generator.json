This can be made with a cron job for example.)</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other plugins (There should no longer be problems with other plugins now which checked for existence of a specified function to determine if you are in the control panel or not.)</li>\n<li>Recoded plugin architecture which is now fully OOP (The code is now cleaner and better to understand which makes it easier to modify. This should also avoid namespace problems.)</li>\n<li>Improved speed and optimized settings handling (Settings and pages are only loaded if the sitemap generation process starts and not every time a page loads. This saves one MySQL Query on every request.)</li>\n<li>Added Button to restore default configuration (Messed up the config? You’ll need just one click to restore all settings.)</li>\n<li>Added log file to check everything is running (In the new log window you can see when your sitemap was rebuilt or if there was any error.)</li>\n<li>Improved user-interface</li>\n<li>Added several links to homepage and support (This includes the Notify List about new releases and the WordPress support forum.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-11-25)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Polish Translation by <a href=\"http://kubazwolinski.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">kuba</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-11-01)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added French Translation by <a href=\"http://www.chezthierry.info/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Thierry Lanfranchi</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-07-21)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with incorrect date in additional pages (wrong format)</li>\n<li>Added Swedish Translation by <a href=\"http://tobiasbergius.se/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tobias Bergius</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6 (2005-07-16)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Included Chinese (Simplified) language files by <a href=\"http://www.june6.cn/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">june6</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6 (2005-07-04)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support to store the files at a custom location</li>\n<li>Changed the home URL to have a slash at the end</li>\n<li>Fixed errors with wp-mail</li>\n<li>Added support for other plugins to add content to the sitemap</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5 (2005-06-15)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can include now external pages which aren’t generated by WordPress or are not recognized by this plugin</li>\n<li>You can define a minimum post priority, which will overrride the calculated value if it’s too low</li>\n<li>The plugin will automatically ping Google whenever the sitemap gets regenerated</li>\n<li>Update 1: Included Spanish translations by <a href=\"http://www.cesargomez.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cesar Gomez Martin</a></li>\n<li>Update 2: Included Italian translations by <a href=\"http://wordpress-it.it/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stefano Aglietti</a></li>\n<li>Update 3: Included Traditional Chinese translations by <a href=\"http://kirin-lin.idv.tw/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Kirin Lin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2 (2005-06-08)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Language file support: <a href=\"http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Hiromasa</a> from <a href=\"http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp</a> sent me a japanese version of the user interface and modified the script to support it!
