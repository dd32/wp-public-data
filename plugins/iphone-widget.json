        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I upload an image?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The iPhone Widget does not provide a mechanism for uploading images or files. You can however upload an image in the &#8216;Write&#8217; section of WordPress. From there you can click on the &#8216;Add an Image&#8217; icon (next to &#8216;Add Media&#8217; label). After uploading an image, copy the &#8216;Link URL&#8217; for use in your iPhone Widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many images can be display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each instance of the widget can only display one image, but you can create as many instances as you need.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the alignment?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can be done with CSS.  Depending on your WordPress theme, one of these methods below will work, though you may have to experiment a little to find out which one.</p>\n<p>For the last one with margin top, right, bottom, and left, replace the 0&#8217;s with a number, for example 10px, where the px stands for pixels.  As you increase or decrease a side, the Ereader will shift position enabling you to get the perfect spacing in you sidebar.  Don&#8217;t forget that you can use negative numbers too, like -10px.  Experiment with the numbers and refresh your website to see what way the Ereader moves in your sidebar.  Keep doing this until its just right!) :</p>\n<pre><code>.iphone { text-align: center; }\n.iphone { margin:0 auto; }\n.iphone { margin:0 auto; text-align: center; }\n.iphone { margin:0 auto; text-align: left; }\n.iphone { margin-top:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; }\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n"
