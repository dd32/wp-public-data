As the Login-box is hidden, it doesn\u2019t draws attention of your readers to this part of the blog that doesn\u2019t interest them, but, for you (and the others editors of your blog), becomes quite practical to be opened with a simple combination of keys.</p>\n<p>The Login-box presents a visual identical to the default login page of WordPress, but it can be easily modified with themes.</p>\n<h3>Options</h3>\n<p>Login-box 2.0 has a practical and self-explanatory options panel where you can change your settings, it is accessible within the page &#8220;Design&#8221;, into the panel of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can edit the options directly into a PHP file, which eliminates the database queries and significantly improves the performance if your blog has a lot of access.

Login-box just don&#8217;t works&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Read steps 3 and 4 in the Installation section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can open/close the Login-box with a link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Just use the link syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"http://www.myblog.com/wp-login.php\" rel=\"loginbox-toggle\"&gt;Make the box!&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to make a theme for the Login-box. Do you have a good tutorial?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No \ud83d\ude41</p>\n<p>But if you eat HTML and CSS in breakfast, see the files of the default Login-box themes. It&#8217;s easy, I assure!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have another question was not answered here, what can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe the best way is go to my blog (http://danillonunes.net/en/tag/login-box/) and send your question as a comment from one of the posts about Login-box. Alternatively, you could send me a private message (http://danillonunes.net/en/contact/).</p>\n</p>\n\n"
