This works with both the classic WooCommerce shortcode based checkout experience as well as the newer Block based checkout experience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20go%20for%20help%20with%20any%20issues%3F'>\nWhere do I go for help with any issues?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To report bugs, please click the Support tab, search for any preexisting report, and add yourself to it by commenting or open a new issue.</p>\n<p>To request new compatibilities or features, please consider hiring the developer of this plugin or another developer who can provide us with code enhancements for review.</p>\n<p>Paid premium support is also available for those looking for one-on-one help with their specific WordPress installation. Visit our website in the link above and contact us from there.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20stripe%20billing%20portal%20work%3F'>\nHow does the Stripe Billing Portal work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See Stripe&#8217;s description here: <a href=\"https://stripe.com/blog/billing-customer-portal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Billing Portal</a></p>\n<p>This is a developer-level feature and needs interface development. We may build this out a little in a future version of the plugin.</p>\n<p>The link is <code>/ccom_stripe/v1/billing_portal?_wpnonce=</code> and will redirect users to their account. You will need to include the WP REST Nonce in order to authenticate the user with the WordPress REST API. Obtain that using a method provided in the WordPress RSST API documentation such as <code>wp_create_nonce( 'wp_rest' )</code>.</p>\n<p>At present we do not automatically set-up Stripe customer accounts and all transactions are in guest mode. In order to use the Stripe Customer Portal the Stripe Customer ID must be saved into user meta data as <code>_stripe_customer_id</code> either from another Stripe plugin paired with this one or using an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"ugc\">Advanced Custom Fields</a> field that you may set-up.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20currency%3F'>\nHow can I change the currency?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currency is set-up within your WooCommerce &gt; Settings area. Developers may logically switch currencies using the Woo core filter <code>woocommerce_currency</code>. It&#8217;s our expectation that the various Currency Switcher plugins are compatible with this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20support%20discounts%20%2F%20coupons%3F'>\nDoes this support discounts / coupons?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Stripe supports one coupon per order of percentage or fixed amount. This plugin will combine all coupons and negative fee line items into a Stripe coupon.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20this%20plugin%20funded%3F'>\nHow is this plugin funded?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is funded by clients of Coded Commerce, LLC funding feature requests for development. When we develop useful code under GPL licensing we share it on our site as Code Snippets and in some cases package great features like these into free plugins so everybody can benefit, including the originating client via bug fixes and others&#8217; funded feature requests.</p>\n<p>We also welcome donations via the &#8220;Donate to this plugin&#8221; button towards the bottom of the right sidebar on the WordPress.org plugin page.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
