You are done!</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Image sizes are weird or incorrect</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should waste a couple of minutes on planning your slider.<br />\nAll the images in the slide have the same size, so you don&#8217;t see weird effects.<br />\nAs well take in account windows sizes and pin only inside a safe area, so pins will be visible in all devices.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why I can&#8217;t see some pins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The slide image resizes to fit the screen. That&#8217;s 100% width OR 100% height, not both. Some parts of your image may be outside that area, so the pins are not visible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the pin image?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. You only need to click &#8216;change pin&#8217; on the box editing form and select whatever you want. Just a couple of things.<br />\nThe plugin will relocate the pin so it appears top and centered from the position you clicked.<br />\nTherefore, best practise is to make 50px by 50px pins, with the point in the bottom center position.<br />\nWe&#8217;ll be imporving this in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the info box style?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you may. To do so you should be overriding the styles in the CSS file of your theme.<br />\nWe don&#8217;t use important! tag, so if there&#8217;s something hard to override, just add the &#8216;body&#8217; tag before the class selector.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does the slider only work &#8216;vertically&#8217;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to some JS effects we&#8217;ve only managed it to work this way. We&#8217;ll work it out in the future if we get enought downloads.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I customize more options?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Full Window Interactive Slider it&#8217;s been just released. More features are incoming.<br />\nStay up to date and get a license to benefit from future developments.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
