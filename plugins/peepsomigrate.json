Go to Plugins &gt; Add New, and search for ‘PeepSo’.<br />\nPlease note that the Migrator only moves the data within the same WordPress installation. You won’t be able to use it to migrate BuddyPress from http://sampledomain1.com to http://sampledomain2.com.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20peepso%20migrate%20move%3F'>\nWhat does PeepSo Migrate move?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because BuddyPress and PeepSo do not share exactly the same sets of features, some of the data on BuddyPress cannot currently be moved.</p>\n<p>Depending on the BuddyPress components and PeepSo plugins installed, the migrator is able to transfer the following data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users</li>\n<li>Uploaded user profile avatars</li>\n<li>Uploaded user profile covers</li>\n<li>Posts</li>\n<li>Custom profile fields</li>\n<li>Comments</li>\n<li>Relevant notifications that crossover to PeepSo</li>\n<li>Custom Profile Fields (requires ProfileSo)</li>\n<li>User friends and friend requests (Requires FriendSo)</li>\n<li>Messages (Requires MsgSo)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20peepso%20migrate%20work%20with%20third%20party%20buddypress%20plugins%3F'>\nDoes PeepSo Migrate work with third party BuddyPress plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As much as we’d love to move all the data stored by every plugin, BuddyPress just has too many. We focused on core BuddyPress and its official extensions. Third party plugins are not supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20to%20migrate%20everything%3F'>\nHow long does it take to migrate everything?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The migration time depends on the size of your community and will vary according to:<br />\n* Number of users<br />\n* Number of posts<br />\n* Number of comments<br />\n* Number of messages<br />\n* Number of notifications<br />\n* Number of friend connections</p>\n<p>The move is also influenced by the speed of the server on which you’re hosting your site.</p>\n<p>We tested moving a few hundred users with over 15,000 activities on a shared hosting environment. It took about four minutes to migrate everything from BuddyPress to PeepSo.</p>\n<p>With a community with a 1000+ members, nearly 60,000 activities on a shared hosting environment the whole migration process took about 11 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20migration%20process%20look%20like%3F'>\nWhat does the migration process look like?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s really simple. You’ll need to install BuddyPress, PeepSo and PeepSo Migrate. Open PeepSo Migrate and click the ‘Start Migration’ button. That’s it!</p>\n<p>You can see the process in the Screenshots section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20already%20have%20data%20in%20peepso%3F'>\nWhat if I already have data in PeepSo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PeepSo Migrate can move a community from BuddyPress to PeepSo but it’s not able to merge a BuddyPress-based community into an existing PeepSo community. During the migration, all PeepSo data is removed and substituted with the data taken from BuddyPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20peepso%20migrate%20to%20move%20my%20community%20to%20a%20different%20website%3F'>\nCan I use PeepSo Migrate to move my community to a different website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. PeepSo Migrate will move a BuddyPress-based community to PeepSo within the same WordPress installation. It can’t move the data between websites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20report%20a%20bug%20or%20a%20problem%20with%20peepso%20migrate%3F'>\nHow do I report a bug or a problem with PeepSo Migrate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the support tab here on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/peepsomigrate\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
