I tried a few plugins in the past to do this, but it never really worked for me, so I decided to work on my own.

This plugin will then be able to call the Google Analytics API through the gtag function. If Google Analytics is not set, the plugin will log the events as warnings in the console.1. Upload the plugin to WordPress.<br />\n2. Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<br />\n3. Don&#8217;t forget to use a plugin to add the Analytics Tracking Code (like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-analytics/\" rel=\"ugc\">Meow Analytics</a>).</p>\n",
