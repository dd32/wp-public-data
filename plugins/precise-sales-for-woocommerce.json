This plugin adds a field for hour and minute, so that sales can be scheduled to start and end at a more precise time.</p>\n<p>This extension is especially helpful for shops that operate in a country with multiple timezones (like the United States) that want to offer a one day sale across timezones. For those shops, a sale can start at midnight in one timezone and end at midnight in another timezone- allowing a 27 hour sale (or other arbitrary period).</p>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>The majority of this code was contributed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/igorbenic\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Igor Benic</a> and developed for <a href=\"https://www.universalyums.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Universal Yums</a>.

If the plugin is ever disabled, any previously scheduled sales will still work and use the more precise time that was initially set unless the product is later updated, in which case it will revert to the default date functionality.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
