If the WordPress user is not &#8220;Connected to Facebook&#8221; they will see a warning message and not see the form. The plugin handles Facebook security properly. The first time someone uses this plugin on your WordPress site, Facebook may ask the WordPress user to authorize this plugin.</p>\n<p>SFCe can populate the event with data from the WordPress post &#8211; e.g. the post title etc, and SFCe can be configured with default values for many Facebook event parameters. WordPress site admins can configure SFCe to enforce default values or let users override them.</p>\n<p>Example: We use this plugin to automatically create public Facebook events for our fan page when certain types of post are published.

        "faq": "<p><strong>I can&#8217;t create events with this plugin.</strong> <br />You must install and configure Simple Facebook Connect (SFC), a separate WordPress plugin by Otto. For version 4.x of SFCe you need version v1.x of SFC.</p>\n<p><strong>I get an error message about no Access Token.</strong><br />You must configure Otto&#8217;s SFC plugin&#8217;s Publisher module to allow it to publish events to Facebook. Make sure you have granted SFC permission &#8220;Automatic Publishing&#8221; and &#8220;Extended Permissions&#8221; in the &#8220;Publish Settings&#8221; section of the SFC settings page.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Warning: include_once() [function.include]: Failed opening &#8216;[path]/wp-content/plugins/simple-facebook-connect/facebook-platform/facebook.php&#8217;</strong><br />You are using version 1.x of Otto&#8217;s SFC plugin with version 3.x of SFCe. Either downgrade SFC or upgrade SFCe.</p>\n<p><strong>I can&#8217;t add a photo to my events.</strong><br />The old Facebook API allowed you to upload a photo for your event, the new Graph API does not. Please contact Facebook and ask them to provide this feature and documentation. You could also downgrade to SFCe 3.x and SFC 0.x, which use the old Rest API.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to create an event using this plugin but without filling in the form on my Edit Post page. How do I create an array containing the event date/time etc?</strong><br />\nThere are several methods of doing this. We use the one below. Please note, in this example we pass some parameters as literal text (e.g. end_min). We pass other parameters as PHP variables (e.g. end_hour). And others we pass as data obtained from an HTML form (e.g. month):</p>\n<p>if (function_exists(&#8216;sfce_create_event&#8217;)) sfce_create_event( array(<br />\n                &#8216;name&#8217; =&gt; $name,<br />\n                &#8216;description&#8217; =&gt; $fbdescription,<br />\n                &#8216;host&#8217; =&gt; $host,<br />\n                &#8216;post_id&#8217; =&gt; $post_id,<br />\n                &#8216;tagline&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Let\\&#8217;s Skate Together!&#8217;,<br />\n                &#8216;is_fanpage&#8217; =&gt; TRUE,<br />\n                &#8216;privacy&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;OPEN&#8217;,<br />\n                &#8216;timezone&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Europe/London&#8217;,<br />\n                &#8216;day&#8217; =&gt; $_POST[&#8216;eday&#8217;],<br />\n                &#8216;month&#8217; =&gt; $_POST[&#8217;emonth&#8217;],<br />\n                &#8216;year&#8217; =&gt; $_POST[&#8216;eyear&#8217;],<br />\n                &#8216;start_hour&#8217; =&gt; $start_hour,<br />\n                &#8216;start_min&#8217; =&gt; &#8217;45&#8217;,<br />\n                &#8216;end_hour&#8217; =&gt; $end_hour,<br />\n                &#8216;end_min&#8217; =&gt; &#8217;00&#8217;)<br />\n                );</p>\n<p>Note: Many parameters are optional, see the Facebook documentation (below) for a list of the required parameters.</p>\n<p><strong>Where is the Facebook documentation for creating events in this way?</strong><br />\nhttp://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Events.create</p>\n",
