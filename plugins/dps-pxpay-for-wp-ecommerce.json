DPS Payment Express is one of Australasia&#8217;s leading online payments solutions providers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20normal%20and%20sandbox%20%28testing%29%20mode%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between Normal and Sandbox (testing) mode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can store two pairs of User ID and User Key credentials. When you first signup for a PxPay account with DPS you will likely be issued development or testing credentials. Later, when you want to go live with your site, you will need to request a new User ID and User Key from DPS. Sandbox mode enables you to switch between your live and test credentials. If you only have testing credentials, both your User ID and Test ID and User Key and Test Key should be identical. In this instance, Sandbox mode can be switched either On or Off.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20the%20dps%20pxpay%20transaction%20number%3F'>\nWhere do I find the DPS PxPay transaction number?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The transaction number and the bank authcode are shown under Billing Details when you view the sales log for a purchase in the WordPress admin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20do%20recurring%20payments%3F'>\nCan I do recurring payments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20dummy%20credit%20card%20details%20for%20testing%20purposes%3F'>\nWhere can I find dummy Credit Card details for testing purposes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paymentexpress.com/support-merchant-frequently-asked-questions-testing-details\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Visit the Payment Express FAQ page for test card numbers</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20an%20ssl%20error%20when%20my%20form%20attempts%20to%20connect%20with%20dps'>\nI get an SSL error when my form attempts to connect with DPS\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a common problem in local testing environments.
