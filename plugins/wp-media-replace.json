Depending on the aspect ratio of image we uplad the different thumbnail versions are created. If original image is having &#8220;large&#8221; size but new image have only &#8220;thumbnail&#8221;, &#8220;medium&#8221;, &#8220;medium_large&#8221; then &#8220;large&#8221; size for the new image will be created by plugin and it will use the fulll size of the image.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
