WordPressÂ® (by its very definition) is a database-driven publishing platform. That means you have all these great tools on the back-end of your site to work with, but it also means that every time a Post/Page/Category is accessed on your site, dozens of connections to the database have to be made, and literally thousands of PHP routines run in harmony behind-the-scenes to make everything jive. The problem is, for every request that a browser sends to your site, all of these routines and connections have to be made (yes, every single time). Geesh, what a waste of processing power, memory, and other system resources. After all, most of the content on your site remains the same for at least a few minutes at a time. If you&#8217;ve been using WordPressÂ® for very long, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that (on average) your site does not load up as fast as other sites on the web. Now you know why!</p>\n<h4>The Definition Of A Cached File (from the Wikipedia)</h4>\n<p>In computer science, a cache (pronounced /kash/) is a collection of data duplicating original values stored elsewhere or computed earlier, where the original data is expensive to fetch (owing to longer access time) or to compute, compared to the cost of reading the cache. In other words, a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access. Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data.</p>\n<h4>Prepare To Be Amazed / It&#8217;s Time To Speed Things Up</h4>\n<p>Comet Cache is extremely reliable, because it runs completely in PHP code, and does not hand important decisions off to the <code>mod_rewrite</code> engine or browser cache; also making Comet Cache MUCH easier to setup and configure.</p>\n<p>In addition, Comet Cache actually sends a no-cache header (yes, a no-cache header); which allows it to remain in control at all times. It might seem weird that a caching plugin would send a no-cache header :-). Well, no-cache headers are a key component in this plugin, and they will NOT affect performance negatively. On the contrary, this is how the system can accurately serve cache files to public users vs. users who are logged-in, commenters, etc.</p>\n<p>If you care about the speed of your site, Comet Cache is one of those plugins that you absolutely MUST have installed ðŸ™‚ Comet Cache takes a real-time snapshot (building a cache) of every Page, Post, Category, Link, etc. These snapshots are then stored (cached) intuitively, so they can be referenced later, in order to save all of that processing time that has been dragging your site down and costing you money.</p>\n<p>The Comet Cache plugin uses configuration options that you select from the options panel. See: <strong>Comet Cache -â€º Options</strong> in your Dashboard. Once a file has been cached, Comet Cache uses advanced techniques that allow it to recognize when it should and should not serve a cached version of the file. By default, Comet Cache does not serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.</p>\n<h4>Running Comet Cache On A WordPressÂ® Multisite Installation</h4>\n<p>WordPressÂ® Multisite Networking is a special consideration in WordPressÂ®. If Comet Cache is installed under a Multisite Network installation, it will be enabled for ALL blogs the same way. The centralized config options for Comet Cache, can only be modified by a Super Administrator operating on the main site. Comet Cache has internal processing routines that prevent configuration changes, including menu displays; for anyone other than a Super Administrator operating on the main site.</p>\n<h4>How To Enable GZIP Compression for Even Greater Speeds</h4>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to use an <code>.htaccess</code> file to enjoy the performance enhancements provided by this plugin; caching is handled by WordPressÂ®/PHP alone. That being said, if you want to take advantage of GZIP compression (and we do recommend this), then you WILL need an <code>.htaccess</code> file to accomplish that part. This plugin fully supports GZIP compression on its output. However, it does not handle GZIP compression directly. We purposely left GZIP compression out of this plugin, because GZIP compression is something that should really be enabled at the Apache level or inside your <code>php.ini</code> file. GZIP compression can be used for things like JavaScript and CSS files as well, so why bother turning it on for only WordPress-generated pages when you can enable GZIP at the server level and cover all the bases!</p>\n<p>If you want to enable GZIP and your site is running on the Apache web server, visit <strong>Dashboard -&gt; Comet Cache -&gt; Apache Optimizations -&gt; Enable GZIP Compression?</strong>; or to enable GZIP compression manually create an <code>.htaccess</code> file in your WordPressÂ® installation directory (or edit the one that&#8217;s already there) and put the following few lines in it. That is all there is to it. GZIP is now enabled!</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;IfModule deflate_module&gt;\n    &lt;IfModule filter_module&gt;\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml application/xml application/xhtml+xml application/xml-dtd\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rdf+xml application/rss+xml application/atom+xml image/svg+xml\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf font/opentype application/font-otf application/x-font-otf\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf font/truetype application/font-ttf application/x-font-ttf\n    &lt;/IfModule&gt;\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your installation of Apache does not have <code>mod_deflate</code> installed. You can also enable GZIP compression using PHP configuration alone. In your <code>php.ini</code> file, you can simply add the following line anywhere: <code>zlib.output_compression = on</code></p>\n<h4>EMERGENCY: If All Else Fails (How-To Remove Comet Cache)</h4>\n<p>Ordinarily you can just deactivate Comet Cache from the plugins menu in WordPress. However, if you&#8217;re having a more serious issue, please follow the instructions here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into your site via FTP; perhaps using <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joXUMhr8PhU\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FileZilla</a>.</li>\n<li>Delete this file: <code>/wp-content/advanced-cache.php</code></li>\n<li>Delete this directory: <code>/wp-content/plugins/comet-cache/</code></li>\n<li>Remove this line from your <code>/wp-config.php</code> file: <code>define('WP_CACHE', TRUE);</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Comet Cache is now completely uninstalled and you can start fresh ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h3>Pro Features</h3>\n<h4>Comet Cache Pro Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to cache logged-in users too!

        "installation": "<p><strong>Quick Tip:</strong> WordPressÂ® can only deal with one cache plugin being activated at a time. Please uninstall any existing cache plugins that you&#8217;ve tried in the past. In other words, if you&#8217;ve installed W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, DB Cache Reloaded, or any other caching plugin, uninstall them all before installing Comet Cache. One way to check, is to make sure this file: <code>wp-content/advanced-cache.php</code> and/or <code>wp-content/object-cache.php</code> are NOT present; and if they are, delete these files BEFORE installing Comet Cache. Those files will only be present if you have a caching plugin already installed. If you don&#8217;t see them, you&#8217;re ready to install Comet Cache :-).</p>\n<p><strong>A note for existing ZenCache users:</strong> Comet Cache is the successor to ZenCache and will automatically detect any existing ZenCache options and migrate that options over to Comet Cache.

Comet Cache is a MUST HAVE for every WordPressÂ® powered site. In fact, we really can&#8217;t think of any site running WordPressÂ® that would want to be without it. To put it another way, the WordPressÂ® software itself comes with a built in action reference for an <code>advanced-cache.php</code> file, because WordPressÂ® developers realize the importance of such as plugin. The <code>/wp-content/advanced-cache.php</code> file is named as such, because the WordPressÂ® developers expect it to be there when caching is enabled by a plugin. If you don&#8217;t have the <code>/wp-content/advanced-cache.php</code> file yet, it is because you have not enabled Comet Cache from the options panel yet.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='so%20why%20does%20wordpress%C2%AE%20need%20to%20be%20cached%3F'>\nSo why does WordPressÂ® need to be cached?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To understand how Comet Cache works, first you have to understand what a cached file is, and why it is absolutely necessary for your site and every visitor that comes to it.

This directory needs to remain writable, just like the <code>/wp-content/uploads</code> directory on many WordPressÂ® installations. The <code>/comet-cache/cache</code> directory is where cache files reside. These files are stored using an intutive directory structure that named based on the request URL (<code>HTTPS/HTTP_HOST/REQUEST_URI</code>). See also: <strong>Dashboard -â€º Comet Cache -â€º Cache Directory/Expiration Time</strong> for further details.</p>\n<p>Whenever a request comes in from someone on the web, Comet Cache checks to see if it can serve a cached file; e.g. it looks at the <code>HTTPS/HTTP_HOST/REQUEST_URI</code> environent variables, then it checks the <code>/comet-cache/cache</code> directory. If a cache file has been built already, and it matches an existing <code>HTTPS.HTTP_HOST.REQUEST_URI</code> combination; and it is not too old (see: <strong>Dashboard -â€º Comet Cache -â€º Cache Directory/Expiration Time</strong>), then it will serve that file instead of asking WordPressÂ® to regenerate it. This adds tremendous speed to your site and reduces server load.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20a%20user%20logs%20in%3F%20are%20cache%20files%20used%20then%3F'>\nWhat happens if a user logs in? Are cache files used then?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, Comet Cache does NOT serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes. That being said, the Pro version of Comet Cache DOES make it possible to cache pages even when users ARE logged-in; adding even more speed! This is particularly helpful on membership sites; e.g. sites that run plugins like s2Memberâ„¢ for instance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20comments%20and%20other%20dynamic%20parts%20of%20my%20blog%20update%20immediately%3F'>\nWill comments and other dynamic parts of my blog update immediately?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on your configuration of Comet Cache. There is an automatic expiration system (the garbage collector), which runs through WordPressÂ® behind-the-scene, according to your Expiration setting (see: <strong>Dashboard -â€º Comet Cache -â€º Cache Directory/Expiration Time</strong>). There is also a built-in expiration time on existing files that is checked before any cache file is served up, which also uses your Expiration setting. In addition; whenever you update a Post or a Page, Comet Cache can automatically prune that particular file from the cache so it instantly becomes fresh again. Otherwise, your visitors would need to wait for the previous cached version to expire.</p>\n<p>By default, Comet Cache does NOT serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20enable%20gzip%20compression%3F%20is%20gzip%20supported%3F'>\nHow do I enable GZIP compression? Is GZIP supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no need to use an <code>.htaccess</code> file with this plugin; caching is handled by WordPressÂ®/PHP alone. That being said, if you also want to take advantage of GZIP compression (and we do recommend this), then you WILL need an <code>.htaccess</code> file to accomplish that part. This plugin fully supports GZIP compression on its output. However, it does not handle GZIP compression directly. We purposely left GZIP compression out of this plugin, because GZIP compression is something that should really be enabled at the Apache level or inside your <code>php.ini</code> file. GZIP compression can be used for things like JavaScript and CSS files as well, so why bother turning it on for only WordPress-generated pages when you can enable GZIP at the server level and cover all the bases!</p>\n<p>If you want to enable GZIP and your site is running on the Apache web server, visit <strong>Dashboard -&gt; Comet Cache -&gt; Apache Optimizations -&gt; Enable GZIP Compression?</strong>; or to enable GZIP compression manually create an <code>.htaccess</code> file in your WordPressÂ® installation directory (or edit the one that&#8217;s already there) and put the following few lines in it. That is all there is to it. GZIP is now enabled!</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;IfModule deflate_module&gt;\n    &lt;IfModule filter_module&gt;\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml application/xml application/xhtml+xml application/xml-dtd\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rdf+xml application/rss+xml application/atom+xml image/svg+xml\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf font/opentype application/font-otf application/x-font-otf\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf font/truetype application/font-ttf application/x-font-ttf\n    &lt;/IfModule&gt;\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your installation of Apache does not have <code>mod_deflate</code> installed.

It does not matter where or when you define this Constant; e.g. <code>define('COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED', FALSE);</code> because Comet Cache is the last thing to run during execution. So as long as you define this Constant at some point in your routines, everything will be fine.</p>\n<p>Comet Cache also provides support for <code>define('DONOTCACHEPAGE', TRUE)</code>, which is used by the WP Super Cache plugin as well. Another option is: <code>$_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED'] = FALSE</code>. The <code>$_SERVER</code> array method is useful if you need to disable caching at the Apache level using <code>mod_rewrite</code>. The <code>$_SERVER</code> array is filled with all environment variables, so if you use <code>mod_rewrite</code> to set the <code>COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED</code> environment variable, that will end up in <code>$_SERVER['COMET_CACHE_ALLOWED']</code>. All of these methods have the same end result, so it&#8217;s up to you which one you&#8217;d like to use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20should%20my%20expiration%20setting%20be%3F'>\nWhat should my expiration setting be?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t update your site much, you could set this to <code>6 months</code>; optimizing everything even further. The longer the cache expiration time is, the greater your performance gain. Alternatively, the shorter the expiration time, the fresher everything will remain on your site. A default value of <code>7 days</code> (recommended expiration time), is a good conservative middle-ground.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that your expiration setting is only one part of the big picture. Comet Cache will also purge the cache automatically as changes are made to the site (i.e. you edit a post, someone comments on a post, you change your theme, you add a new navigation menu item, etc., etc.). Thus, your expiration time is really just a fallback; e.g. the maximum amount of time that a cache file could ever possibly live.</p>\n<p>That being said, you could set this to just <code>60 seconds</code> and you would still see huge differences in speed and performance. If you&#8217;re just starting out with Comet Cache (perhaps a bit nervous about old cache files being served to your visitors); you could set this to something like <code>30 minutes</code> and experiment with it while you build confidence in Comet Cache. It&#8217;s not necessary, but many site owners have reported this makes them feel like they&#8217;re more-in-control when the cache has a short expiration time.

So instead of using default WP core globals for server detection, Comet Cache now uses it&#8217;s own set of Apache/Nginx/IIS detection functions. And, this release enhances our Apache and Nginx detection routines; making them smart enough to catch additional edge cases; i.e., to further reduce the likelihood of there being a false-positive. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/748\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #748</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Some XML-RPC and REST API requests were being cached inadvertently.

See also: <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/471\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #471</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement: Auto-Clearing Author Page Cache.</strong> This release makes Comet Cache smart enough to detect when a user is deleted (or removed from a child blog in a Network), at which time the Author page for that user will be cleared from the cache so it can be regenerated automatically. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/304\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #304</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement: Multibyte Compatibility.</strong> This release improves support for WordPress Permalinks that contain UTF-8 symbols (or emojis) in them.

See: <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/611\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #611</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement: Widget Change Detection.</strong> Comet Cache can now detect when <strong>Appearance <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Widgets</strong> are added/edited/removed, and Comet Cache will automatically clear the cache so that your site remains up-to-date. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/411\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #411</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement (Pro): Static CDN Filters and <code>srcset</code>.</strong> This release enhances Static CDN Filters in Comet Cache Pro. Static CDN Filters are now smart enough to filter all image sources included in an <code>srcset=\"\"</code> attribute that is generated by WordPress. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/660\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #660</a>.

See also: <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/827\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #827</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement (Pro): HTML Compressor + Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).</strong> Updated to the latest available release of the HTML Compressor (v161208) with improved support for <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>. See: <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/695\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #695</a>. See also: <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/html-compressor/releases/tag/161208\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HTML Compressor v161208 changelog</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement (Pro): HTML Compressor / AMP Compatibility.</strong> Improved compatibility with <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>. There is a new HTML Compressor option that is enabled by default and it makes Comet Cache smart enough to auto-detect and selectively disable portions of the HTML Compressor that are incompatible with the AMP spec; i.e., routines that are not necessary when serving APMd pages. In short, if the URI being compressed ends with <code>/amp/</code>, or the document contains a top-level <code>&lt;html âš¡&gt;</code> tag (<code>&lt;html amp&gt;</code> is accepted as well), then features which are incompatible with <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> will be disabled accordingly.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Avoid deprecated <code>wp_get_sites()</code> and use <code>get_sites()</code> instead. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/848\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #848</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Added Watered-Down Regex documentation notes to the inline documentation (in the software) about the use of <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> in some places where these special characters are not fully supported. Also adding the same notes to the <a href=\"https://cometcache.com/r/watered-down-regex-syntax/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Watered-Down Regex KB Article</a>.

See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/832\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #832</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Fixed a broken link to the <a href=\"http://cometcache.com/r/static-cdn-filters-maxcdn/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Static CDN Filters tutorial for MaxCDN integration</a>. Props @kristineds. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/842\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #842</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Multisite installations inside a subdirectory were broken by Apache Optimizations via <code>.htaccess</code> in some scenarios. Fixed in this release. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/798\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #798</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Don&#8217;t enqueue <code>Chart.js</code> unnecessarily in lite version of the software. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/830\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #830</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Enhancing WooCommerce integration by listening to the <code>woocommerce_product_set_stock_status</code> hook in addition to the <code>woocommerce_product_set_stock</code> hook. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/674\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #674</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong> (Pro): Automatically dismiss any persistent update notifications whenever a new version of the software is recompiled; i.e., don&#8217;t continue to show an upgrade notice whenever the software has just been updated by a site owner. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/806\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #806</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This version enhances the HTML comments left in the source code (HTML Debug Notes). When debug notes are enabled (i.e., HTML comments) they are now broken down into key/value pairs and tabulated for a cleaner display and easier debugging. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/790\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #790</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance Enhancement:</strong> For sites configured to allow query string variables into the cache, those variables are now sorted by key name internally to avoid duplicate cache files; i.e., whenever the order of query string variables changes from request to another, but with the same exact values. In short, Comet Cache now knows how to serve the same underlying cache file; i.e., from a previous request that may have had the same query string, just in a slightly different order. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/639\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #639</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement:</strong> The Comet Cache UI is now fully Responsive with an improved UI on laptop and mobile devices. Props @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/699\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #699</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement:</strong> This release improves the toggle link that allows you to see additional details whenever Comet Cache automatically clears more than one facet of the cache. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/837\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #837</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/831\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #831</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement</strong> (Pro): Following improvements to the update API in a previous release of Comet Cache that made it possible to update both the lite and pro versions of the software through normal WordPress update mechanisms, this release removes some clutter from the menu pages for Comet Cache. In short, now that we have a tighter integration with WordPress core, it&#8217;s no longer necessary for Comet Cache to display update notifications in a custom way. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/829\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #829</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement</strong> (Pro): On pro version activation, display a notice that reminds site owners to configure their Pro Update Credentials so they&#8217;ll be notified by WordPress about new versions of the pro software. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/477\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #477</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>New Pro Feature:</strong> In the pro version it is now possible to define a list of GET request variable names that should be ignored entirely by Comet Cache. See: <strong>Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Comet Cache <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Plugin Options <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> GET Requests <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> List of GET Variable Names to Ignore</strong>. As an example, this new feature makes it possible for site owners to pass query string variables associated with Google Analytics (i.e., <code>utm_*</code> variable names) without incurring a cache performance hit. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/639\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #639</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Nonce Support</strong> (Pro): In the pro version, when logged-in user caching is enabled, Comet Cache is now capable of intelligently caching pages that contain Nonce values (<a href=\"https://cometcache.com/r/numbers-used-once-nonce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">numbers used once</a>). This allows for pages containing the WordPress Admin Bar to be cached without issue. It also improves compatibility with plugins like bbPress and BuddyPress, resulting in better performance and faster speeds for logged-in users. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/793\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #793</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>RevSlider Compat.:</strong> This release includes a built-in exclusion rule for the HTML Compressor to allow for improved compatibility with the popular RevSlider plugin for WordPress. The new built-in exclusion rule looks for and automatically bypasses an important style tag that must be preserved for the RevSlider plugin to work in all scenarios; i.e., <code>&lt;style id='rs-plugin-settings-inline-css'</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/614\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #614</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>i18n Compat.</strong> (Lite): This release makes all pro preview labels translatable by moving the labels that were previously defined in CSS only into HTML attribute values. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/808\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #808</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v160917</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Feature</strong> (Lite): The Clear Cache button is now available in the Admin Toolbar for the Lite version of Comet Cache.</li>\n<li><strong>New Feature</strong> (Pro): Comet Cache Pro is now fully compatible with <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates#Plugin_.26_Theme_Updates_via_Filter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Automatic Background Updates</a>. If you enable automatic background updates for plugins, and you save valid Comet Cache Pro License Credentials in the <em>Comet Cache Pro <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Plugin Options <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Update Credentials</em> panel, you will automatically receive Pro plugin updates. Props @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/289\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #289</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: In some scenarios Comet Cache might produce a false-positive &#8220;Warning: mkdir(): File exists&#8221; message when checking if the cache directory exists. Comet Cache now calls <code>clearstatcache()</code> and uses <code>file_exists()</code> instead of <code>is_dir()</code> to help make this check more robust. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/786\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #786</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Fixed a bug where the Comet Cache PHP requirements check would fail and produce a fatal error when upgrading from a version of Comet Cache that did not require an extension that is now required by newer releases. This would occur when, for example, the required PHP <code>mbstring</code> extension was missing. Props @jaswsinc for finding the bug. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/817\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #817</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: Fixed a bug where upgrading from v160521 would result in the Client-Side Cache option being reset to the default (disabled). If you enabled the Client-Side Cache at some point, now is a good time to double-check that it&#8217;s still enabled. This bug fix also improves the reliability of all version upgrade routines that Comet Cache runs during upgrades. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/807\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #807</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility / Bug Fix</strong>: The automatic Clear Cache routines that cleared the entire cache automatically whenever <em>WordPress Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Settings <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> General</em> was updated, were being too aggressive and not taking into consideration other plugins that might also be using the same <code>options-general.php</code> URL. As a result, the entire cache was being unnecessarily cleared when the settings for those other plugins were saved. Props to @futtta from Autoptimize for reporting. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/825\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #825</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement</strong>: Adjusted option page font styles for WordPress v4.6 to better match existing style. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache-pro/pull/271\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #271</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>ManageWP Compatibility</strong> (Pro): Comet Cache Pro is now compatible with ManageWP, a service that allows remote management of multiple WordPress sites. Comet Cache Pro Plugin Updates will now appear in the ManageWP dashboard and, assuming you have saved valid license credentials in <em>Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Comet Cache Pro <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Plugin Options <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Update Credentials</em>, you will be able to upgrade Comet Cache Pro remotely from the ManageWP Dashboard. Props @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/465\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #465</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>InfiniteWP Compatibility</strong> (Pro): Comet Cache Pro is now compatible with InfiniteWP, an application that allows you to manage multiple WordPress sites from a single location. Comet Cache Pro Plugin Updates will now appear in the InfiniteWP dashboard and, assuming you have saved valid license credentials in <em>Dashboard <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Comet Cache Pro <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Plugin Options <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Update Credentials</em>, you will be able to upgrade Comet Cache Pro remotely from the InfiniteWP Dashboard. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/394\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #394</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Rewritten Pro Plugin Updater</strong>: The Comet Cache Pro Plugin Updater has been redesigned to use the built-in WordPress plugin updater system. When a Comet Cache Pro update is available, it now appears in the WordPress Updates section and in the Plugins list, like other WordPress plugins and can be updated normally like other WordPress plugins, as long as you have saved valid Comet Cache Pro license details in the new &#8220;Update Credentials&#8221; options panel. Props @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache-pro/issues/272\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #272</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Code Style</strong>: The <code>WP_CACHE</code> line that gets inserted into the <code>wp-config.php</code> file to enable caching now follows the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress PHP Code Standards</a>. Props @szepeviktor. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/pull/799\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #799</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility</strong> (Pro): When the Autoptimize plugin is active, the Comet Cache Pro HTML Compressor panel now shows a friendly notice explaining that both the HTML Compressor and Autoptimize should not be enabled at the same time because they both address the same performance improvements. The rest of Comet Cache works great alongside Autoptimize and whether you use the HTML Compressor or Autoptimize is a matter of preference. Props to @futtta from Autoptimize for the continued collaboration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v160709</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong> (Pro): Fixed a bug in the Auto-Cache Engine that was introduced by the previous release (v160706). The bug produced an error whenever the Auto-Cache Engine ran: &#8220;PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined method applyWpFilters()&#8221;. This had no visible affect on the front-end of the site or in the WordPress Dashboard, but it prevented the Auto-Cache Engine from working behind the scenes. Props @Peter-FB for reporting. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/795\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #795</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v160706</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Feature! Apache Optimizations.</strong> This release includes a completely new option panel for Apache Performance Tuning. Current options for Apache tuning include GZIP Compression, Leverage Browser Caching, Enforce Canonical URLs, and Send Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header (for Static CDN Filters). These options automatically add or remove from your <code>.htaccess</code> file the appropriate configuration based on the options you enable or disable (all options are disabled by default, so your <code>.htaccess</code> file is not modified unless you say so). If you prefer to update your <code>.htaccess</code> file manually, the necessary configuration can be viewed beneath each option. Props @jaswsinc, @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/789\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #789</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>New Feature!</strong> A new &#8220;Enable GZIP Compression&#8221; option has been added to the new Apache Optimizations panel. This option will automatically add the appropriate configuration to your <code>.htaccess</code> file to enable GZIP compression. This option is disabled by default. The old &#8220;GZIP Compression&#8221; panel has been removed in favor of the new option inside Apache Optimizations. Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/764\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #764</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>New Feature!</strong> Multisite Host Exclusion Patterns. It&#8217;s now possible to exclude entire sites from the cache in a Multisite Network environment. Domain mapping is also supported! See <em>Comet Cache <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Plugin Options <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Host Exclusion Patterns</em>. If you&#8217;re running a Multisite Network with Sub-Directories, you can exclude sites using the existing URI Exclusion Patterns feature. Props @kristineds. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/754\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #754</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>New Feature (Pro)!</strong> A new &#8220;Leverage Browser Caching&#8221; option has been added to the new Apache Optimizations panel. This option will automatically add the appropriate configuration to your <code>.htaccess</code> file to enable Browser Caching. This option is disabled by default. Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/764\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #764</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>New Feature (Pro)!</strong> A new &#8220;Enforce Canonical URLs&#8221; option has been added to the new Apache Optimizations panel. This options adds the appropriate <code>.htaccess</code> code to enforce the correct canonical URLs according to your WordPress Permalink settings (Comet Cache detects if the Permalink Structure ends with a trailing slash, or without a trailing slash). Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/554\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #554</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: In some scenarios the Cron Event that cleans up expired cache files (<code>_cron_comet_cache_cleanup</code>) would never run, or the Next Run time would constantly reset to 1 minute away from running every time a page was reloaded. We suspect this is a race condition and in attempt to work around this issue we now skip all of our Cron-related checks if Cron is currently in the middle of running a process. Props @xberg and @lkraav for help reporting. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/653\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #653</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong>: If your site uses aliased domains, Comet Cache now properly considers all possible domain variations when it clears the cache on WP Standard installations. Props @kristineds, @jaswsinc, @yoffe, and @VR51. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/608\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #608</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix</strong> (Pro): Fixed a bug where Comet Cache would appear to prevent WordPress from redirecting Permalinks that don&#8217;t include a trailing slash, to the URL that does include a trailing slash. This was due to the fact that Comet Cache loads very early on (for caching purposes) and as a result the WordPress <code>redirect_canonical()</code> function never gets run. This was fixed by adding an option to the new Apache Optimizations panel that allows you to Enforce Canonical URLs. Props @renzms, @jaswsinc. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/554\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #554</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UX Bug Fix</strong> (Pro): If you had your WordPress Dashboard login details saved by your browser, the browser autofill would automatically fill in the Pro Plugin Updater fields with those details, which then needed to be replaced with your actual Pro license details. The browser autofill has been disabled for those fields (tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Props @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/741\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #741</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement</strong>: Added links the Options Page for the Comet Cache <a href=\"http://twitter.com/cometcache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://facebook.com/cometcache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook</a> accounts. Props @renzms. <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/771\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #771</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Added full support for UTF-8 (multibyte strings). This release adds full support for UTF-8 throughout the Comet Cache codebase, greatly enhancing Comet Cache&#8217;s ability to deal with file paths and URLs that may contain UTF-8 characters. Props @jaswsinc. <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/703\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #703</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancements</strong>: Improved the Logged-In Users and the Client-Side Caching options panels to dim additional options when the feature is disabled. Additionally, the &#8220;Enable HTML Compression for Logged-In Users?&#8221; option has been relocated from the HTML Compressor option panel to the more appropriate Logged-In Users option panel. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/768\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #768</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UX Enhancement</strong>: Improved the inline docs for Auto-Clear List of Custom URLs to clarify that full URLs must be provided. Props @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/781\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #781</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement</strong> (Pro): The Pro Plugin Updater has been improved to allow for better compatibility with hosting platforms that use Apache&#8217;s ModSecurity. In some cases, site owners were seeing a 404 error when attempting to update the Pro version using the Pro Plugin updater because certain ModSecurity rules were blocking the Pro Updater requests. The Pro Plugin Updater now uses WP Transients to store the necessary metadata, which works around the issue with ModSecurity. Props to @seozones for reporting and @jaswsinc for help fixing this. <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/416\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #416</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement</strong> (Pro): When Static CDN Filters are enabled, it&#8217;s now possible to disable the automatic insertion of rules into your <code>.htaccess</code> file that are designed to prevent issues with <a href=\"https://cometcache.com/kb-article/what-are-cross-origin-request-blocked-errors/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CORS</a>. See <em>Apache Optimizations <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Send Access-Control-Allow-Origin Header?</em> See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/787\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #787</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement</strong> (Pro): The HTML Notes added to the bottom of a cached page now specify if the page was cached as the result of an HTTP Request or if it was cached by the Auto-Cache Engine. Props @kristineds. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/292\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #292</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement</strong> (Pro): The Auto-Cache Engine now supports a fallback to cURL using the WP HTTP API. If your PHP configuration has <code>allow_fopen_url=0</code>, the Auto-Cache Engine will use the fallback to download the XML Sitemap and parse it from a temporary file. If you want to force the use of this fallback even when <code>allow_fopen_url=1</code>, you can use <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/440#issuecomment-228338371\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">a filter</a>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/440\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #440</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement</strong> (Pro): A second button has been added to the bottom of the Pro Plugin Updater page that allows you to &#8220;Save and Update Comet Cache Pro&#8221; in one step. Props @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/741\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #741</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>UI Enhancement</strong> (Pro): The &#8220;Cache Stats&#8221; button in Admin Bar is now linked to the Cache Stats page. Instead of hovering over the button and then clicking &#8220;More Info&#8221; inside the popup panel, you can now just click the &#8220;Cache Stats&#8221; button to go directly to the Cache Stats page. Props @Presskopp, @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/780\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #780</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Comment Mail Compatibility:</strong> Improved compatibility with the Comment Mail plugin by automatically clearing the cache whenever Comment Mail options are changed. Many of the Comment Mail options affect front-end portions of the site, so it&#8217;s important that the cache is cleared whenever Comment Mail options change. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comment-mail/issues/278#issuecomment-225994050\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Comment Mail Issue #278</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>PHP Compatibility:</strong> Improved compatibility back to PHP 5.2 (the lowest version allowed by WordPress). Comet Cache still requires PHP 5.4+, but if you install Comet Cache on a site running PHP 5.2, it will now fail gracefully with a Dashboard notice indicating PHP 5.4+ is required, instead of producing a fatal error. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/784\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #784</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>WP-CLI Compatibility</strong>: Fixed a bug with deactivating Comet Cache using WP-CLI. Doing so was producing a &#8220;Invalid argument; host token empty!&#8221; error message. This has been resolved. Props @MarioKnight @jaswsinc @renzms. See <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/issues/728\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issue #728</a>.</li>\n<li>Renamed <code>COMET_CACHE_ALLOW_BROWSER_CACHE</code> constant to <code>COMET_CACHE_ALLOW_CLIENT_SIDE_CACHE</code>. Backwards compatibility has been maintained.</li>\n<li>Renamed <code>allow_browser_cache</code> plugin option to <code>allow_client_side_cache</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For older changelog history going back more than 7 years, please see <a href=\"https://github.com/websharks/comet-cache/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CHANGELOG.md</a>.</p>\n"

WordPressÂ® (by its very definition) is a database-driven publishing platform. That means you have all these great tools on the back-end of your site to work with, but it also means that every time a Post/Page/Category is accessed on your site, dozens of connections to the database have to be made, and literally thousands of PHP routines run in harmony behind-the-scenes to make everything jive. The problem is, for every request that a browser sends to your site, all of these routines and connections have to be made (yes, every single time). Geesh, what a waste of processing power, memory, and other system resources. After all, most of the content on your site remains the same for at least a few minutes at a time. If you&#8217;ve been using WordPressÂ® for very long, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that (on average) your site does not load up as fast as other sites on the web. Now you know why!</p>\n<h4>The Definition Of A Cached File (from the Wikipedia)</h4>\n<p>In computer science, a cache (pronounced /kash/) is a collection of data duplicating original values stored elsewhere or computed earlier, where the original data is expensive to fetch (owing to longer access time) or to compute, compared to the cost of reading the cache. In other words, a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access. Once the data is stored in the cache, it can be used in the future by accessing the cached copy rather than re-fetching or recomputing the original data.</p>\n<h4>Prepare To Be Amazed / It&#8217;s Time To Speed Things Up</h4>\n<p>Comet Cache is extremely reliable, because it runs completely in PHP code, and does not hand important decisions off to the <code>mod_rewrite</code> engine or browser cache; also making Comet Cache MUCH easier to setup and configure.</p>\n<p>In addition, Comet Cache actually sends a no-cache header (yes, a no-cache header); which allows it to remain in control at all times. It might seem weird that a caching plugin would send a no-cache header :-). Well, no-cache headers are a key component in this plugin, and they will NOT affect performance negatively. On the contrary, this is how the system can accurately serve cache files to public users vs. users who are logged-in, commenters, etc.</p>\n<p>If you care about the speed of your site, Comet Cache is one of those plugins that you absolutely MUST have installed ðŸ™‚ Comet Cache takes a real-time snapshot (building a cache) of every Page, Post, Category, Link, etc. These snapshots are then stored (cached) intuitively, so they can be referenced later, in order to save all of that processing time that has been dragging your site down and costing you money.</p>\n<p>The Comet Cache plugin uses configuration options that you select from the options panel. See: <strong>Comet Cache -â€º Options</strong> in your Dashboard. Once a file has been cached, Comet Cache uses advanced techniques that allow it to recognize when it should and should not serve a cached version of the file. By default, Comet Cache does not serve cached pages to users who are logged in, or to users who have left comments recently. Comet Cache also excludes administrative pages, login pages, POST/PUT/DELETE/GET(w/ query string) requests and/or CLI processes.</p>\n<h4>Running Comet Cache On A WordPressÂ® Multisite Installation</h4>\n<p>WordPressÂ® Multisite Networking is a special consideration in WordPressÂ®. If Comet Cache is installed under a Multisite Network installation, it will be enabled for ALL blogs the same way. The centralized config options for Comet Cache, can only be modified by a Super Administrator operating on the main site. Comet Cache has internal processing routines that prevent configuration changes, including menu displays; for anyone other than a Super Administrator operating on the main site.</p>\n<h4>How To Enable GZIP Compression for Even Greater Speeds</h4>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to use an <code>.htaccess</code> file to enjoy the performance enhancements provided by this plugin; caching is handled by WordPressÂ®/PHP alone. That being said, if you want to take advantage of GZIP compression (and we do recommend this), then you WILL need an <code>.htaccess</code> file to accomplish that part. This plugin fully supports GZIP compression on its output. However, it does not handle GZIP compression directly. We purposely left GZIP compression out of this plugin, because GZIP compression is something that should really be enabled at the Apache level or inside your <code>php.ini</code> file. GZIP compression can be used for things like JavaScript and CSS files as well, so why bother turning it on for only WordPress-generated pages when you can enable GZIP at the server level and cover all the bases!</p>\n<p>If you want to enable GZIP and your site is running on the Apache web server, visit <strong>Dashboard -&gt; Comet Cache -&gt; Apache Optimizations -&gt; Enable GZIP Compression?</strong>; or to enable GZIP compression manually create an <code>.htaccess</code> file in your WordPressÂ® installation directory (or edit the one that&#8217;s already there) and put the following few lines in it. That is all there is to it. GZIP is now enabled!</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;IfModule deflate_module&gt;\n    &lt;IfModule filter_module&gt;\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain text/html\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml application/xml application/xhtml+xml application/xml-dtd\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rdf+xml application/rss+xml application/atom+xml image/svg+xml\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css text/javascript application/javascript application/x-javascript\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf font/opentype application/font-otf application/x-font-otf\n        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf font/truetype application/font-ttf application/x-font-ttf\n    &lt;/IfModule&gt;\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your installation of Apache does not have <code>mod_deflate</code> installed. You can also enable GZIP compression using PHP configuration alone. In your <code>php.ini</code> file, you can simply add the following line anywhere: <code>zlib.output_compression = on</code></p>\n<h4>EMERGENCY: If All Else Fails (How-To Remove Comet Cache)</h4>\n<p>Ordinarily you can just deactivate Comet Cache from the plugins menu in WordPress.
