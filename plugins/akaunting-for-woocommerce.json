To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Akaunting for WooCommerce&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your site. To do a manual install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu, click Add New, click Upload (top links) and finally select the downloaded file.</p>\n<p>We do not collect information about you or your server.</p>\n"
