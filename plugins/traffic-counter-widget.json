I cannot access the root directory of your blog through WordPress install API, so you will have to do the following things by yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a robots.php file on the root directory of your blog: ie public_html/your-blog/<br />\nPaste the following code in it:</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Open .htaccess file in the same directory and paste this in it:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>RewriteRule robots&#046;txt robots.php</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure you have the &#8216;RewriteEngine On&#8217; clause in place&#8230;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure you have a robots.txt file, even an empty one, on the root directory</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Done! Most of the robots will be filtered out by TCW.</p>\n<p>Traffic Counter Widget does not have a settings section on Admin page.
