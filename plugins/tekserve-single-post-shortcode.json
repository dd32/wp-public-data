        "description": "<p>There are plenty of plugins to show lists of posts, but if you only want to display a condensed preview of a post on any wp page, this is the plugin for you! The shortcode accepts the numeric id of any post as an attribute, and will display a preview that links to that post. This preview is generated with easily styled html. To show or hide the featured image for your single post preview, pass the attribute <code>showimage</code> with either <code>hide</code> or <code>show</code>. It&#8217;s pretty easy!</p>\n<p>For fun, I decided to also build a widget that does the same thing; it&#8217;s included and can be used like any other widget. Why not?!</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why would I want to use this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You want to display a link to a single post with a brief content preview. Plenty of plugins will create this type of object in a list, or as part of popular or related posts, but sometimes you want to manually feature a post somewhere and not mess around with sticky posts or the loop. This simple shortcode does it for you without modifying your theme&#8217;s functions.php.</p>\n<p>You also get a widget, so there&#8217;s that!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I style the output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy; just add css for the output classes and ids in your style.css for your theme, or enqueue a separate .css file in your theme to handle it.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a listing of targets to style the output:</p>\n<p><em>Output to Style</em>       <em>CSS target</em></p>\n<p>Single Post Container       .tekserve-single-post -or- #single-post-$$ ( $$ is numerical post id)</p>\n<p>Featured Image          .tekserve-single-post a img</p>\n<p>Title               .tekserve-single-post .tekserve-single-post-title</p>\n<p>Date and Author         .tekserve-single-post .tekserve-single-post-meta</p>\n<p>Post Content            .tekserve-single-post .tekserve-single-post-excerpt</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where does the plugin get its output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From the post, of course! Here are the specifics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image &#8211; Post Featured Image / Thumbnail</li>\n<li>Title &#8211; Post Title</li>\n<li>Meta &#8211; Post Date and Post Author</li>\n<li>Excerpt &#8211; Post excerpt, if it exists.
