Their membership number is the unique user ID that every user is assigned in the database. Optionally administrators can assign a prefix to the membership number (eg for my sports league <a href=\"https://princesparktouch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">princesparktouch.com</a> it is PPT).

It simply allows a user to logon using the users user ID (in place of the username). The ID is not the username, it is the WordPress users table primary key. Optionally this number can be prefixed by an alpha numeric of your choosing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20could%20you%20use%20this%20for%3F'>\nWhat could you use this for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Membership organisations often have membership cards with membership numbers. This plugin could allow the member to log in with that number.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20display%20the%20users%20membership%20number%20in%20the%20frontend%3F'>\nHow do I display the users Membership number in the frontend?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply paste the shortcode [lh_membership_numbers_display_number] into a post, page, or CPT. Note this will display the logged in users membership number. If the visitor is not logged in an error message is displayed, as WordPress cannot identify the user.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20see%20the%20users%20membership%20number%20in%20the%20backend%3F'>\nHow do I see the users Membership number in the backend?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The membership number is displayed in a column in the backend.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
