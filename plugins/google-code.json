WordPress processes the messages in the order they are received.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Any particular system requirements I should know about?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You need PHP 5.2+. Sorry, I don&#8217;t do PHP 4.3, which is the minimum requirement for WordPress. Tell your host you want PHP 5. If they won&#8217;t give it to you, find another host.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you help me expand this plugin to a different use case?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not for free, but I&#8217;d certainly be willing to talk to you about professional services related to this and other WordPress-specific work. <a href=\"mailto:&#x61;&#x61;&#114;&#111;&#x6e;&#x40;&#116;&#101;&#x63;&#x68;&#110;o&#x73;&#097;&#105;l&#x6f;&#114;&#046;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Email me</a> at and reference this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I apply special CSS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, all posts of the special post type have an &#8216;svn&#8217; CSS class for the post div.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use this in my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Custom Loop.
