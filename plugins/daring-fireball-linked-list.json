        "description": "<p>This plugin makes your RSS feed behave like Daring Fireball&#8217;s linked list posts, and has some extra features to make posting linked lists easier. Also supports Twitter Tools.</p>\n<p><em>Part One</em></p>\n<p>Makes your RSS feed for linked-list posts (indicated using a custom field) behave like <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Daring Fireball</a>.</p>\n<p>To use, set the custom field &#8220;linked_list_url&#8221; to the desired location on a link post. In your RSS feed, the following will happen:</p>\n<p>(i) the item&#8217;s RSS permalink becomes the link destination;<br />\n(ii) the actual permalink to your post is inserted as a star glyph at the end of your post; and<br />\n(iii) a star glyph is added in front of your non-linked-list post titles. Behaviour is customisable in options.</p>\n<p>All three parts are customizable, and you can use different glyphs or text if you&#8217;d like. For theme designers, the plugin also provides functions (get_the_permalink_glyph(), the_permalink_glyph(), get_the_linked_list_link(), the_linked_list_link(), get_glyph() and is_linked_list()) to customise your design by checking if the item is a linked list item, getting a permalink with glyph, etc.</p>\n<p>Adapted from Jonathan Penn&#8217;s <a href=\"http://github.com/jonathanpenn/wordpress-linked-list-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Linked List plugin</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Part Two</em></p>\n<p>Add link from post content. This feature allows you to set the custom field &#8220;linked_list_url&#8221; from within the post content. This is especially handy for using with the &#8216;Press This&#8217; bookmarklet.</p>\n<p>When you activate this feature, the DFLL plugin will look at the first line of your post content for a link anchor, and it&#8217;ll set that link as the linked_list_url for your post. For example, the following post content:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lt;a href=&#8217;http://google.com&#8217;&gt;Google!!!&lt;/a&gt;.<br />\n  This is a link post to Google.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#8230; will have its first line removed, the URL http://google.com passed into the custom field linked_list_url, and will have its first line removed to just end up with the text &#8216;This is a link post to Google&#8217;. The text in the anchor (&#8216;Google!!!&#8217;) will be ignored.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s very important to note three requirements: (i) the anchor tag must be in the first line of the post, (ii) the tag must be the only element on that line, and (iii) the line must end in a period. This is the syntax that the &#8216;Press This&#8217; bookmarklet uses, so you can just hit &#8216;Press This&#8217; and enter to go to the next line and stop typing.</p>\n<p>Any text in the anchor will be ignored, and the entire first line will be discarded. This also means that if, for whatever, reason, you like posting link anchors that end in periods as the first line of your blog, you shouldn&#8217;t activate this checkbox, or you&#8217;ll end up with linked list posts by accident!</p>\n<p>This was adapted from <a href=\"http://hypertext.net/projects/cfsetter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CF Setter by Justin Blanton</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Twitter Tools support</em></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/plugins/twitter-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter Tools</a>, you can customise your tweets to have your custom glyph or text appear before either your &#8220;regular&#8221; or linked-list posts.</p>\n<p>Questions or suggestions? Look me up on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yjsoon\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When adding a link, create a normal blog post, but add a custom field &#8220;linked_list_url&#8221; with the desired link URL. The RSS feed item will automatically point to that URL.</li>\n<li>When posting, to insert a link without setting the custom field manually, put your URL wrapped in an anchor tag in the first line, ending with a period. For example: &lt;a href=&#8221;http://yjsoon.com&#8221;&gt;Doesn&#8217;t matter what&#8217;s in here&lt;/a&gt;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>Copyright (c) 2010-2011 YJ Soon</p>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br />\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the<br />\n&#8220;Software&#8221;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including<br />\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,<br />\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to<br />\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to<br />\nthe following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be<br />\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,<br />\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND<br />\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
