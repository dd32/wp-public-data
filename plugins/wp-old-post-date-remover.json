Single posts only.</p>\n<p>You spent the time creating great content, and now readers and potential customers are getting sidetracked by the fact that it&#8217;s 13 months old.</p>\n<p>Install the WP Old Post Date Remover plugin, activate it, and pick the number of days you&#8217;d like to show the dates on your posts.</p>\n<p>NOTE: if your theme does not place the date within its own span class or div class, (or does that annoying thing where they put the word &#8220;on&#8221; outside of the date&#8217;s span or div) this plugin will not work, out of the box. But with a few extra lines of code, we can get you working in no time. Message me in the forums.</p>\n<p>This plugin requires special setup for use alongside some caching setups. I&#8217;m happy to help get that set up for you. Message me by starting a thread in the forums.</p>\n<p>Please rate the plugin, and don&#8217;t be afraid of the donate button!

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download and unzip wp-old-post-date-remover.zip, producing a <code>wp-old-post-date-remover</code> folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload the <code>wp-old-post-date-remover</code>folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory of your web server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins</code> menu in your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the WP Old Post Date Remover settings page at <code>/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp_old_post_date_remover</code> and select the length (in days) of time you&#8217;d like to show the date on new posts.</li>\n<li>Done!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I hide the date on the blog home page, or archive pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is no. For a longer explanation, see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-love-the-simplicity-of-this-plugin?replies=2#post-7489264\" rel=\"ugc\">this response</a> to a kind review asking for that functionality.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do if I install the plugin and it&#8217;s not working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am active in patching the plugin to work for as many themes as possible. Please check out <a href=\"http://benandjacq.com/wordpress-plugin-wp-old-post-date-remover/\" title=\"WP Old Post Date Remover home\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the plugin site</a> for some troubleshooting, and contact me on the support forums (where I will actively answer).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the length of time the date shows?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! as of version 2.0 you can now customize the length of time (in days) in the WP Old Post Date Remover settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I do other cool things to older posts using this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can make any css style changes to older posts that you would like. Modify the OPDRstyle.css file with anything you&#8217;d like to show up on those older posts. Keep in mind, though, that any updates to the plugin will overwrite your changes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin affect Google ranking?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, because it simply hides the date from readers using CSS, it has no effect whatsoever on Google or other Search engines. Loading the extra TINY stylesheet on older posts should not affect page load time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
