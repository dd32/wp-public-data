How much galleries I can create?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, you can use this plugin for many pages, because it uses shortcodes. You can create infinity amount of galleries. Using shortcode you can define any gallery for any page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I have no picture for video?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s OK. Thumbnail would be generated automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the sense to use Popup Box = None option?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no huge sense. No one popup box isn&#8217;t set because we don&#8217;t want to make any default popup box and make decision for our users.<br />\nAlso you may want to use video gallery type, but without loading additional libraries in face of popup box.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the sense to use Load From = Do not load option?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you already using on chosed library for popups, you don&#8217;t need to load it anymore. So, you should chose &#8220;Do not load&#8221; option.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
