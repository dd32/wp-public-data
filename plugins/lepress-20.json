Enrolled students can follow the announcements of new assignments with help of LePress sidebar widget, submit their assignments as blog posts and receive feedback from the teacher in the form of comment. Assignment-related blog posts are tagged with dedicated category, allowing easy filtering. Both teacher and students can use the same blog for participating in several blog-based courses simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The teachers can track, review and grade the submissions of the students conveniently using an aggregated summary page, just the same ways as they do it in a traditional grade book.</p>\n<p>This is next release of LePress Teacher 1.0 and LePress Student 1.0 combined all in one solution.

You can Activate LePress widget right after plugin installation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In dashboard menu: LePress &gt;&gt; Courses create new course or mark existing category as a course. Do not forget to fill in information about teacher, in other case course will not work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose LePress &gt;&gt; Subscriptions menu and invite students to the specific course/s. You can import a list of students&#8221; email addresses from a file or fill it manually. You can accompany the invite with an individual or group security key. In such way you can filter the course from unwanted subscribers because the subscription cannot be implemented without key.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Write new assignment menu you can prepare assignment-post. Choose a corresponding course, start date, and deadline for assignment. Deadline dates will be shown in calendars of LePress widget both in the teacher&#8217;s and student&#8217;s blogs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Manage assignments page is your class-book. Here you can see a list of all the implemented assignments, graduate them and write the feedbacks. You can access this page right from widget as well. Your feedback will appear as a standard WordPress comment in blog of the student.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
