        "installation": "<p>1) Add the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n<p>2) When prompted, activate the plugin</p>\n<p>3) Go to <em>Settings &gt; CJ Tracking Code</em></p>\n<p>4) Enter in your account info</p>\n<p>5) The tracking data will then be sent for WooCommerce customers, and on successful Gravity Form submissions.<br />\nSupports <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/#installation\" rel=\"ugc\">WooCommerce 3.0+</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gravityforms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravity Forms 2.4+</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Extending the Plugin</strong></p>\n<p>The following filter is available for extending the plugin</p>\n<pre><code>cj_settings\n</code></pre>\n<p>This filter allows you to conditionally determine what the CID, type, and tag ID should be. This is useful when you have want to use multiple tag IDs and types.</p>\n<p>Basic Example:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cj_settings', function($account_data, $submission_method, $order){\n\n    // make changes to $account_data here\n\n    return $account_data;\n}, 10, 3);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('cj_settings', function($settings, $submission_method, $order_or_form_data, $order_or_form_id){\n\n    // make changes to the settings here\n    // Note: return false if you don't want to send any data to CJ for this transaction\n\n    return $settings;\n}, 10, 4);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first parameter is an array containing all of the settings to filter.<br />\nMore settings may be added later, but the array currently holds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8216;enterprise_id&#8217; &#8211; the enterprise ID</li>\n<li>&#8216;action_tracker_id&#8217; &#8211; the action tracker id</li>\n<li>&#8216;tag_id&#8217; &#8211; no longer used</li>\n<li>&#8216;cid&#8217; &#8211; no longer used</li>\n<li>&#8216;type&#8217; &#8211; no longer used</li>\n<li>&#8216;notate_urls&#8217; &#8211; no longer used</li>\n<li>&#8216;notate_order_data&#8217; &#8211; should we add additional info to order notes (on supported integrations)</li>\n<li>&#8216;other_params&#8217; &#8211; Not currently used. If ever used again it will contain additional items to submit to CJ. These will appear in the CJ dashboard.</li>\n<li>&#8216;storage_mechanism&#8217; &#8211; Either &#8216;woo_session&#8217; or &#8216;cookies&#8217;. Both options work. There is normally no need to change this.<br />\n<!--* 'limit_gravity_forms' - When true enables the next setting\n* 'enabled_gravity_forms' - when limit_gravity_forms is true, CJ will only be active for forms IDs in this array. Otherwise it is active on all payment forms.\n* 'blank_field_handling' - can be set to either 'ignore_blank_fields', 'ignore_0_dollar_items', or 'report_all_fields' to determine if those type of fields should be reported to CJ. The default is to report all items.--></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second parameter will be either &#8220;woocommerce&#8221; or &#8220;gravity_forms&#8221; depending on which one initiated everything (more integrations will be added later as they&#8217;re requested).</p>\n<p>Based on the above parameter the next 2 will either be the form data and form id or the order data and order id.</p>\n<p>If you need me to add additional filters, please open up a new issue at https://github.com/Hosting-Utilities/cj.com-wordpress-plugin/issues.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>version 3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add server side cookie implementation</li>\n<li>Allow you to choose which implementation you would like to use. See the settings page for more info on the different implementations.</li>\n<li>Fix bug where in certain circumstances it was trying to set the cookie based on the value of the cje GET parameter instead of the cjevent parameter</li>\n<li>Added the cj_cookie_duration filter</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t return the amount to CJ as it is no longer required, thanks @brittonk for the fix</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t add notes to WooCommerce orders saying an order came from a CJ referral when it didn&#8217;t</li>\n<li>The &#8220;Turn on all available integrations&#8221; toggle switch can be disabled now</li>\n<li>Added an expiremntal option for better compatability with Gravity Forms. When selected an alternate method will be used to send data to CJ that won&#8217;t require breaking the ability for Gravity Forms to redirect users after a form is submitted</li>\n<li>WordPress 6 compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>version 3.2</h4>\n<p>Add tag ID</p>\n<h4>version 3.1</h4>\n<p>Fix a problem in 3.0 that was breaking all Ajax requests until the cj settings were saved</p>\n<h4>version 3.0</h4>\n<p>THIS CHANGE BREAKS BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.<br />\nCJ has new documentation they have been handing out that is completely different from what they have online.<br />\nThis update follows the new documentation, introduces new fields that will need to be filled out on the settings page, and is an all around overhaul of how the tracking code is implemented. This version has been verified with the lead client integration engineer at CJ to be in compliance with their systems. All users will need to recertify themselves with the new system.</p>\n<h4>version 2.12</h4>\n<p>Allow Google Tag Manager and other scripts to read the cjevent cookie (HttpOnly=false)<br />\nAlways use non-www version of domain in cookies<br />\nRemove extraneous CSS in the settings page<br />\nRemove &#8220;Did not recieve a PublisherID&#8221; notice from WooCommerce notes. CJ no longer seems to use a publisher ID (but if you do still have a setup that uses them, they will still be recorded).<br />\nOn the settings page add inline CSS to make sure the summary elements dropdowns arrows always appear.<br />\nAdd method=IMG to the conversion tag URL. Let me know if CJ is asking you to use a different tracking method and I can add support for it.</p>\n<h4>version 2.11</h4>\n<p>Make the cookie storage mechanism work with caching plugins<br />\nAnd make it the default storage mechanism<br />\nAdd a setting to change the duration of the cjevent cookie<br />\nAdd a settings link on the plugin page<br />\nThe contact form now outputs some of the debug info into a nice table instead of using var_dumps<br />\nDisplay a warning when WPFC_CACHE_QUERYSTRING is true (from the fastest cache plugin), and makes it easier to add compatibility features/warnings in the future<br />\nMinor textual changes to the settings page</p>\n<h4>version 2.10</h4>\n<p>Puts the plugin in conformance with CJ&#8217;s new rules on what characters are allowed in item names<br />\nIn WordPress 5.5+ the plugin will only send data to CJ in production environments (the environment is determined by the wp_get_environment_type function)<br />\nGravity Form Integration fixes:<br />\n * The setting to limit which forms are used wasn&#8217;t saving<br />\n * It was sending a CJ Event of 1 instead of the actual CJ Event<br />\n * Decimal numbers were being ignored when calculating the coupon discount<br />\n * It wasn&#8217;t telling you which checkbox/radio button were selected before</p>\n<h4>version 2.9</h4>\n<p>More bug fixes for the Gravity Forms integration<br />\nThe gravity Forms integration should no longer be using the form ID for the item name. Previously it was used on unfilled out fields and radio fields.</p>\n<h4>version 2.8</h4>\n<p>Gravity Forms integration changes:<br />\n* Stop reporting fields that were not filled in<br />\n* Add support for the Gravity Forms coupon add-on<br />\n* Fixes some items that were not getting reported correctly<br />\n* Add a note to form entries of the CJ URL used</p>\n<p>WooCommerce Integration changes:<br />\n* Compatibility with WooCommerce product bundles plugin</p>\n<p>Settings page changes:<br />\n * Hide WooCommerce or Gravity Form options when the plugin is not enabled<br />\n * Send additional information when submitting a ticket (plugin versions, multisite info)<br />\n * Replace some checkboxes with toggle switches<br />\n * Add &#8220;Remove Plugin Data&#8221; button<br />\n * Other misc improvements</p>\n<h4>version 2.7</h4>\n<p>Add fix to trigger WooCommerce Sessions on non-WooCommerce pages (for storing the publisherCID and cjevent).<br />\nChange the duration of cookies in the Gravity Forms integration to 120 days.<br />\nWhen the cookie storage mechanism was used, the publishercid was not getting retreived.</p>\n<h4>version 2.6</h4>\n<p>Add cj_account_info filter, for cases where the account info needs to change depending on what is being purchased</p>\n<h4>version 2.5</h4>\n<p>Add contact us form and add mention of Hosting Utilities (my new suite of tools for managing WordPress sites).</p>\n<h4>version 2.4</h4>\n<p>Makes cookies last for 120 days when using cookie storage instead of the default storage mechanism (CJ requires the cookies to last for 120 days).</p>\n<h4>version 2.3</h4>\n<p>Fixes a security issue where the cjevent was not being properly escaped.<br />\nAlso, this update adds an alternate storage mechanism to aid in debugging problems.</p>\n<h4>version 2.2</h4>\n<p>Allow CJ tracking codes to be turned off for gravity forms or WooCommerce. Previously the tracking code was always added if the associated plugin was enabled.<br />\nAlso fixes sending additional query parameter to CJ. I don&#8217;t think that feature was ever actually working.<br />\nFixing unit tests</p>\n<h4>version 2.1</h4>\n<p>Fixing a fatal bug. The endswith function was never defined causing issues.</p>\n<h4>version 2.0</h4>\n<p>Adding Gravity Forms support</p>\n<h4>version 1.4.0</h4>\n<p>The item name is now set to SKU code if present, otherwise, the product title is used<br />\nGrabbing the cjevent is now a case-insensitive process</p>\n<h4>version 1.3.0</h4>\n<p>Added support for additional currencies. Thanks to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/kennyhunter16/\" rel=\"ugc\">kennyhunter16</a>, the currency is now detected from the order that was placed.</p>\n<h4>version 1.2.0</h4>\n<p>cj.com added some new required fields. This update brings the plugin into conformation with their documentation at https://developers.cj.com/docs/tracking-integration/advanced-integration</p>\n<h4>version 1.1.0</h4>\n<p>Orders that originated from cj.com are now marked as such in the order notes</p>\n<h4>version 1.0.0</h4>\n<p>Initial commit</p>\n"
