The .SVG format allows you to scale the resulting QR code without losing quality<br />\nfor any size.</p>\n<p>The generated QR codes are available for placing anywhere &#8211; both digitally and in printed form.<br />\nThey can be scanned using a mobile phone to use immediately or saved for future use. While scanning, these codes lead<br />\nto the page or post for which they were created.</p>\n<p>QR codes created by our plugin are dynamic. Accordingly, if the content of the page changes, you will not need to<br />\nchange the appearance of the code.</p>\n<p>The codes come in default appearance (black and white squares). Closer integration with our ME-QR QR code creation<br />\nservice with the ability to design each created QR code (change the color, form of the elements, add a logo) and<br />\ncollect detailed analytics on code scanning will be added in the near future. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>\n<h3>KEY FEATURES:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy to install;</li>\n<li>Easy to configure;</li>\n<li>Dynamic QR codes;</li>\n<li>Vector-formatted QR codes;</li>\n<li>Shortcode creation;</li>\n<li>Expansion of functionality in the near future;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any suggestions or feedback are welcome, thanks for using our plugin.
