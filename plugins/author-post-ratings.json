The plugin will automatically add the post rating (using stars, and an optional label) to the top or bottom of the post. If you wish, you can disable that functionality altogether and use a shortcode to insert the post rating anywhere in the post you choose. The plugin supports ratings for posts, pages, and custom post types, all of which can be individually enabled or disabled in the plugin settings. It is also fully internationalized, with Spanish language translation files included.</p>\n<h3>Translating the Plugin</h3>\n<p>The post rating label text can be changed in the plugin settings, so no translation is required for the frontend (public side) of the site. However, if you wish to translate the backend settings interface, the plugin is fully internationalized and ready for translation.
