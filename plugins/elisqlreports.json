You can save multiple reports and they will be listed on the Admin Menu so you can quickly run them again anytime with just one click.

You can also put a report on a Page or Post using a shortcode like [SQLREPORT name=&#8221;My Report&#8221; style=&#8221;padding: 6px;&#8221; /]</p>\n<p>There is also an shortcode for the wpdb::get_var function that you can use to display a single value from your database. For example, this will display the number of users on your site:<br />\n[sqlgetvar]SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_users[/sqlgetvar]<br />\nNote: because of a known exploit in the WordPress shortcode functionality it is required that an admin user create an SQL Report with the exact query that will be used in the sqlgetvar shotcode, otherwise any subscriber could white their own shortcode query.</p>\n<p>If you want to include an &#8220;Export to CSV&#8221; button on your page or post then use the additional shortcode [SQLEXPORTCSV] once on any page or post that contains a report you want visitors to be able to download. Thanks to @loristictok and @rob66bnu for posting the suggestion with the JavaScript that I used to make this new Shortcode.<br />\nNote: Adding this shortcode to the just one time will insert the &#8220;Export to CSV&#8221; button at the top of every HTML Table on the page.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Database Backups</h4>\n<p>Your database can be automatically saved and archived every hour and/or every day, and backups can be emailed to the address you specify.
