This allows for multiple instances of the same form to be submitted without having the issue of submitting form B when submitting form A.</p>\n<p>If a form has already been submitted, the submitted random ID will be preserved and used for the next submissions as well, otherwise a new unique ID is generated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='customization%20%28actions%20%26%20filters%29'>\nCustomization (actions &amp; filters)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses the default gform_get_form_filter Gravity Forms filter for performing the replacement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the plugin offers the following actions &amp; filters:</p>\n<p>gform_multiple_instances_strings<br />\n$strings (array). An array of find =&gt; replace pairs. Occurences of &#8220;key&#8221; will be replaced with the corresponding &#8220;value&#8221;.</p>\n<p>$form_id (int). The original form id.</p>\n<p>$random_id (int). The new, randomly generated form id.</p>\n<p>This filter allows you to modify the default strings that will be replaced. The keys are the original strings, and the corresponding values are the strings that keys will be replaced with.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
