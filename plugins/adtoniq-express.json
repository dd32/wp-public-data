This release moves that JS inline. Support for older plugins with out-of-line JS is also provided.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug in readme.txt which was hopefully due to an invalid character. Oddly, the earlier readme passed the WordPress readme validator. Maybe that needs to be upgraded?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Also took CSS inline so it won&#8217;t get blocked</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.1.3</h4>\n<p>Tested plugin on WordPress versions up to WordPress version 5.2.1</p>\n<h4>5.0.1.4</h4>\n<p>Remove iframe used for ad block detection as that is no longer used</p>\n<h4>5.0.1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WordPress version 5.6.1</li>\n<li>Removed old code no longer needed</li>\n<li>Add debug capability to set Adtoniq integration server (default disabled)</li>\n</ul>\n"
