        "faq": "<h4>Is this cross-browser compatible?</h4>\n<p>The result has been tested in Chrome, IE and Firefox (Windows). It uses very primitive CSS and HTML, though (not even any Javascript) so most browsers shouldn&#8217;t have trouble rendering it.</p>\n<h4>How often does it update?</h4>\n<p>Every time the widget is rendered it gets the total from the WordPress database from scratch.</p>\n<h4>What if I only want to list posts with a particular category, or tag?</h4>\n<p>The code for the plugin itself can be edited. There is only one <code>$wpdb</code> call in the <code>wordbar_render</code> function, and it can be edited to bring back posts in any combination.</p>\n",
