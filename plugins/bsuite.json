I leave it up to blog administrators to decide if the mechanism bSuite uses to get that data is sufficient to the purpose, though I will add that I run a number of stats applications in addition to bStat (Google Analytics and AWstats).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my stats different than with the old version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Previous versions of bSuite and bStat counted hits using a different mechanism than bSuite 4. The old mechanism simply counted the number of times WordPress generated a page, reporting falsely high results because of search crawlers, or falsely low results because of caching. bSuite 4 uses a javascript to report back that your pages were actually rendered in a browser. This should lead to more accurate counting of your readership, rather than reporting on which of your posts is getting most indexed by web crawlers.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I&#8230;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Full documentation and usage examples are available at <a href=\"http://maisonbisson.com/bsuite/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MaisonBisson.com</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
