See the above referenced handbook pages for more information.</li>\n<li>You might be loading your translations selectively (lean loading), only on the pages they are needed. If so, make sure you are viewing such a page to see your translation listed.</li>\n<li>You might be loading your translations too early or too late. Translations are best loaded on the <code>(admin_)init</code> hook. For more information see <a href=\"http://geertdedeckere.be/article/loading-wordpress-language-files-the-right-way\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In particular take note of the following:<br />\nIf your textdomain is loaded before this plugin is loaded, <em>i.e. if you load your textdomain on the PHP file load from a must-use plugin</em>, <em>or</em> if your textdomain is loaded very late, <em>i.e. after the admin bar has loaded</em>, this plugin can not pick up on the <code>load_..._textdomain()</code> call.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t the plugin activate ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have you read what it says in the beautifully red bar at the top of your plugins page ? As it says there, the Debug Bar plugin needs to be active for this plugin to work. If the Debug Bar plugin is not active, this plugin will automatically de-activate itself.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
