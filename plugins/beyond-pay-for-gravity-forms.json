Beyond Pay Gateway secures card data by hosting the actual payment fields and presenting them in an iframe so that the fields only <em>appear</em> to be part of Gravity Forms.</p>\n<p>Once card data is collected, then the information is further secured by <em>tokenization</em>: a process in which the sensitive card data is exchanged for a non-sensitive representation, or &#8220;token.&#8221; This ensures that cardholder data is not sent from the consumer&#8217;s browser to the merchant&#8217;s web server, and only the surrogate token value comes into contact with the merchant&#8217;s systems.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20have%20an%20ssl%2Ftls%20certificate%3F'>\nDo I have to have an SSL/TLS certificate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. All submission of sensitive payment data by the Beyond Pay is made via a secure HTTPS connection from the cardholder&#8217;s browser. However, to protect yourself from man-in-the-middle attacks and to prevent your users from experiencing mixed content warnings in their browser, you MUST serve the page with your payment form over HTTPS.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20gateway%20plugin%20support%20a%20sandbox%20or%20test%20option%3F'>\nDoes this gateway plugin support a sandbox or test option?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
