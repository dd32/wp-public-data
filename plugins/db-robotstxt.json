The file should contain the rules for crawler robots of search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Yandex, etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin works perfectly both if the file robots.txt has never been created or if it already exists. Once installed the plugin makes an optimized robots.txt file that includes special rules common for WordPress websites. After that you can proceed further customization specific for your own website if needed.</p>\n<p>If the plugin detects one or several Sitemap XML files it will include them into robots.txt file.</p>\n<p>No FTP access, manual coding or file editing is required that makes managing settings easy and convenient!</p>\n",
