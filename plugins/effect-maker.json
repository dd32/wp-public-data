        "faq": "\n<h4>Where can I get support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have any problems with the software, whether it is the basic or pro version or you just want to give feedback, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"http://www.mandomartis.com/contact.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mandomartis support</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I see strange behaviour when inserting the same configuration name into a page several times</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only a single configuration name is supported per page. This happens because the function names and variables are named the same in the scripts, thus conflicting with each other. However as a workaround, you can open the configuration in Effect Maker, save it under another name and insert it together with the first configuration, even if you didn&#8217;t do any changes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My images appear strange and too big for the effect</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that the images you upload are of roughly the same size like the effect area (width and height fields).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My image based effect doesn&#8217;t work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that the images you have specified really exist in your upload folder or image gallery. Some effects (like Image Scroller) crashes if the images don&#8217;t exist. This could happen if you delete images from your upload folder or image gallery and you have effects that depend on those images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get more effects in my Effect Maker library?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have the basic edition which is the free, upgrade to the <a href=\"http://www.mandomartis.com/products.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro edition</a> which has many more effects!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have other questions!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click on the help button in Effect Maker and check the online FAQ. It will answer more questions than this readme file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
