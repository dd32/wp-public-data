        "description": "<p>Ever found your theme doesn&#8217;t support threaded comments?  Would you like it to<br />\nbe able to have P2 style live commenting on your site?  Spectacu.la Discussion<br />\nis a plugin that replaces the commenting code in your theme with a fully Ajaxed<br />\ncomments engine.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses memory tables for fast caching within the database (no pesky<br />\npermission setting for you to worry about here) and adjustible polling times to<br />\nsuit a wide range of server performance.</p>\n<p>The plugin is also developer friendly, meaning that you can easily add styles to<br />\nyour theme so that should a user implement the plugin your meticulous design can<br />\nbe carried through.  By default there are two styles that should work in most<br />\ncases.  Read below for further instructions.</p>\n<p>Once installed this plug-in will replace your theme&#8217;s comments template with its<br />\nown fully Ajax comment template. This allows both submission and update of<br />\ncomments without a page refres letting your visitors use it more as a chat room<br />\nthan the more traditional comment system. You can also roll up replied which can<br />\nbe told to trigger at any depth you feel is best using the settings page. Also<br />\navailable on the plug-ins admin page is the option to use another or no<br />\nstylesheet, toggle the live updating of comments and change the refresh period<br />\nfor live update.</p>\n<p>As of version 2 you can now easily add new stylesheets to the available list by<br />\neither copying them into the plug-in&#8217;s style folder with a comment at the top of<br />\nthe sheet that looks like this /* comment style: Stylesheet name */ or adding a<br />\ncommenting.css to your theme or child theme. Once added they will then be listed<br />\nin the dropdown menu that shows on the admin page.</p>\n<p>The plugin is also, of course, Multisites compatible.</p>\n<p>=The filters=</p>\n<p>There are a few filters available for developers to intercept the javascript,<br />\nparamerers passed to the javascript and the CSS file location</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>spec_comment_css</strong><br />\nPasses the URL of the stylesheet through to your function to replace<br />\nwith your own file.</li>\n<li><strong>spec_comment_js</strong><br />\nPasses the URL to the jQuery file that controls the roll up and a few<br />\nother elements.</li>\n<li><strong>spec_comment_local_js</strong><br />\nPasses in an array of localisation strings that are passed to the<br />\njQuery code.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To replace the CSS file you could add something like the following to your<br />\nfunctions.php that would point to a comments.css file in the folder of your<br />\ncurrent theme. This will then override any choice made by the user on the admin<br />\npage.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    add_filter('spec_comment_css', 'my_css_file');\n\n    function my_css_file() {\n        return get_bloginfo('template_directory') . '/comments.css';\n    }\n\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Warning</h4>\n<p>Every effort has been made to make this work with as wide a variety of themes as<br />\npossible but we can&#8217;t cover every eventuality so some themes out there will<br />\ncause problems with this plugin without you doing something to either the<br />\nplug-in or the theme first. The most likely cause of problems is that some of<br />\nthe CSS in the theme conflicts with the CSS in the comments. There are various<br />\nother areas where problems could arise, such as if the theme doesn&#8217;t call the<br />\ncomments.php using the <code>comments_template();</code> template tag or if your theme<br />\ndeals with comments in an unusual way, such as placing them in a sidebar or<br />\ncalling them in using Ajax that conflicts with our own. A missing or unusual<br />\nDOCTYPE could cause problems too, in fact there are lots of things that could<br />\ncause strangeness. However with most of the themes I&#8217;ve tested this with it has<br />\nworked without issue straight out of the gate and even if it doesn&#8217;t look right<br />\nyou need only disable the plug-in to go back to how things were, so nothing&#8217;s<br />\nlost.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>The install</h4>\n<p>You can either install the plugin using the WordPress auto-installer, or<br />\nmanually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>commenting.php</code> and all sub folders to<br />\n    /wp-content/plugins/spec-comments/ or <code>/wp-content/mu-plugins/</code> directory.<br />\nIf the directory doesn&#8217;t exist then create it.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>You should now see an extra menu show up under the settings menu in the main<br />\nadmin sidebar.</li>\n<li>Check a page on your site with comments and see that everything is as you&#8217;d<br />\nhope. If it&#8217;s not then proceed to the config menu and see if what you want<br />\ncan be set from there.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>The config</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>The first option with this plug-in is the option to define at which point<br />\nthe comments roll up. Default is set so that all replies are hidden behind a<br />\nclick but with the drop down you could specify that replies to replies are<br />\nhidden or replies to replies of replies and so on&#8230;</li>\n<li>The next block is for controlling the titles that show above the comment<br />\nblock and the trackback block if your theme separates them out.</li>\n<li>Choose the stylesheet you want to use with your theme. At the moment there<br />\nare two, the default style for use with light coloured themes and the dark<br />\nstyle for use with dark themes. You can also disable the CSS here if you&#8217;d<br />\nrather roll it into your theme&#8217;s stylesheet. If you add more CSS files with<br />\nthe special CSS comment to the style folder in the plug-in or add a<br />\ncommenting.css to your theme&#8217;s folder then that&#8217;ll show up in this list too.</li>\n<li>The comment update block lets you control the frequency of comment update<br />\nand whether they&#8217;re enabled or not. The default status for &#8220;Auto update&#8221; is<br />\noff, if you want to enable live commenting then check this box and set a<br />\ntime interval in the box below that is appropriate to your server/traffic<br />\nlevels. The minimum amount of time you can set for the auto update is 10<br />\nseconds any attempt to get it quicker than that will result in it returning<br />\nto the default value of 30 seconds.</li>\n<li>The final option is to hide our credit link and is one we&#8217;d rather you<br />\ndidn&#8217;t do anything with but we&#8217;ve given you it anyway as we&#8217;re nice like<br />\nthat. We do understand that sometimes clients want things like that gone<br />\nwe&#8217;d just like to ask in return for that is that you think about signing up<br />\nwith us</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20it%20quite%20look%2Fwork%20right%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t it quite look/work right?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s not possible for us to check this code against every theme<br />\nout there so from time to time you may run into some incompatibilities. It&#8217;s<br />\npossible that some CSS in your theme&#8217;s style.css is causing issues. You could<br />\ntry stripping out all commenting related CSS from it and see if that makes any<br />\ndifference. If it&#8217;s not that then it might be that your theme isn&#8217;t calling<br />\ncomments_template() to add the comments code, if that&#8217;s the case then you&#8217;re out<br />\nof luck unless you know where to look in the theme code or you can get your<br />\ntheme developer to change their theme.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.3.2</h4>\n<pre><code>For the few still using this I've just fixed a bug/error that stopped all\ncomments from being posted by complaining that all fields were empty even\nwhen they weren't. This plug in should probably not be being used but for\nthose that are I'll fix critical bugs when then show up.\n</code></pre>\n<h4>2.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: During the find process the action_id was always zero and not the ID<br />\nof the last action that was retrieved. This meant that you would grab all<br />\nrows since your last page load time. Not a huge problem but it did mean<br />\nsomethings were being done more than once which caused problems from the<br />\nfront end moderation and deletes.</li>\n<li>Changed: The link on the admin page pointed to something that no longer<br />\nexists and hasn&#8217;t existed in a long time.</li>\n<li>Fixed: Typo in function name, it was consistent throughout the code so<br />\nwasn&#8217;t a problem but it was ugly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed problems with SSL URLs.</li>\n<li>Added caching to the Ajax update requests if you a caching plug-in installed.</li>\n<li>Added front end moderation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with approve/delete/spam buttons on recently loaded comments.</li>\n<li>Minified the JS again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug on some sites with certain versions of jQuery that prevented the comment ID being sent correctly</li>\n<li>Added further validation checks</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added frontend moderation tools for Live Discussion</li>\n<li>Added a Comment Moderator role, same privilledges as a subscriber, but with the additional ability to approve/spam/trash comments</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The default options are now passed through a filter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a check to see if the current post_type supports comments and that<br />\ncomments are open before adding the JS.<br />\nFixed JS issue with the disabled attribute on the submit button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new version of the Japanese translation which covers the three missing<br />\nstring.<br />\nFixed issue with the stylesheet selection dropdown not remembering your<br />\nchoice if you picked &#8220;disabled&#8221;.<br />\nFixed issue with CSS in latest Opera.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added two filters to control the avatar size for those that want or need to<br />\nroll their own layout. The filters are spec_avatar_size_large and<br />\nspec_avatar_size_small.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding Japanese translation provided by &#8211; Chestnut http://staff.blog.bng.net<br />\nFixed some missing translation domains from 2 elements of code and added<br />\ntranslation wrapper around the credit link.<br />\nAdded a few actions to the comment form area to allow easier insertion of<br />\ncode via plug-ins. Actions are as follows: &#8216;before_comment_respond&#8217;,<br />\n&#8216;after_comment_respond&#8217;, &#8216;before_comment_form&#8217;, &#8216;comment_form_start&#8217; and<br />\n&#8216;after_comment_form&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for the autogrow text jQuery to cope with textareas that area hidden at<br />\nstart up. Previously they would have a width of 0px that would result in<br />\nendless newlines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to override the global option for auto comment update on a post<br />\nby post basis.<br />\nAdded option to remove the link button from each comment.<br />\nAdded a new quote button to each comment that lets you quickly cite another<br />\ncomment in the discussion. There is also the option to disable it should you<br />\nnot want it.<br />\nAdded a new floating quote thingy that should, if set up right, pop up a<br />\nfloating button next to any text selection in the post body. You&#8217;ll need to<br />\nknow the class or ID of your post content to set this up.<br />\nNumerous fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Development release</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added an option to remove the avatar in the comment form.<br />\nAdded an option to set a title for the comment form.<br />\nAdded some script to allow highlight of new comments as they arrive and also<br />\nstyled up the two default styles to make use of the new class and icon.<br />\nChanged the exclamation icon to a GPL compatible one from<br />\nhttp://19eighty7.com/icons</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>There is now a completely new theme for the comments which has been updated<br />\nfor both the dark an light versions and should work with more themes.<br />\nComments are now ajaxed for both submit and update. You have control over<br />\nupdate frequency and the code will respect your choices for comment order<br />\ndepth and all the other settings in the discussion area of the settings.<br />\nMade sure it works with all versions of WP from 2.7 up, including WP 3.0.<br />\nNew stylesheet handling code that allows us to add more styles quickly. You<br />\ncan now add stylesheet to your theme/child theme directory and that&#8217;ll be<br />\npicked up by the plug-in and offered as an option on the plug-in&#8217;s admin<br />\npage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved the javascript to the footer and removed an unneeded script.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the reply link text to the translation fields for this plug-in rather<br />\nthan use WP&#8217;s own reply to make it a little easier for people to translate<br />\nevery element.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Very minor fix for ie6. Seems I was a little over zealous trying to fix a<br />\nhasLayout bug. Should be good now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Internal version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
