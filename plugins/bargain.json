It is an easy to use, Native, No coding required, AI ChatBot to provide Automated Live Chat Support.

The Bargaining Bot lets you capture more sales because the price is negotiated based on what the customer is willing to pay and the minimum price at which you are willing to sell.</p>\n<p>Here is why the Bargain Bot will earn you higher revenue and profit margins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher Engagement – the Bot creates a new engagement point for shoppers to interact with your products instead of leaving</li>\n<li>Capture the WooCommerce shoppers while they have a high intent to purchase. This addon helps keep them on your site to finalize a price deal</li>\n<li>Higher conversions – shoppers love to feel like they are getting a great deal – this addon allows them to pay less than the listed price and therefore convert to a sale</li>\n<li>All offers are responded to in seconds based on a minimum price point that you set</li>\n<li>Super easy to install – no coding necessary</li>\n<li>Super easy to configure – apply the addon in seconds</li>\n<li>Bargain bot automatically pops up if a user wants to close the browser window from your product single page.</li>\n<li>Offers do NOT require shoppers to enter their email address to make an offer so you get many more offers made, more offers accepted, and more sales</li>\n<li>Once shoppers buy one thing using this method, they want to buy more items the same way</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS FOR THE SHOPPERS?</strong><br />\nIn addition to your Add to Cart button, the Bargaining Bot enables a Make Your Offer Now button. After clicking this button, shoppers can enter an Offer Price. If their Offer Price is at or above your Minimum Acceptable price, then the Bargaining Bot accepts the offer and gives the shopper a dynamically generated discount price for the product.</p>\n<p>If the Offer Price is below your minimum acceptable price, the Bot will automatically ask the shopper for a better price. If the price is too low, the Bot will make the last offer at your Minimum Acceptable price. If the shopper accepts it then the Bot will apply a product-specific discount that can only be applied to that product.</p>\n<p>If the shopper denies the offer, Bot will ask for the shopper’s email that will be sent to the shop admin with details about the product and the last offer by the shopper. Admin can then negotiate pricing over email if she wants to.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS FOR MERCHANTS</strong><br />\nOnce you install the Bot, you may apply the Make Your Offer Now button to any or all products in your store. You can set up the Minimum Acceptable price for an individual product or set a Global discount percentage from the Bot settings. When you set a Minimum Acceptable price for the individual product the individual pricing will override the global setting.</p>\n<h3>Bargain Bot Lite Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable/Disable Bargaining Bot (hide the make your offer button on the product single page)</li>\n<li>Enable for specific product/s by adding Minimum Acceptable Prices or enable globally</li>\n<li>Options to change all languages from the plugin settings (bargaining bot can be used with any language)</li>\n<li>Supports both woocommerce Simple Products and Variable products.<br />\n(Product variations set by 3rd party plugins may not work)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bargain Bot Pro Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enable/Disable</strong> Bargaining Bot (hide the make your offer button on the product single page)<br />\n<strong>Exclude sale items</strong> (If enabled Bargaining button will not display for products that are already on sale)</li>\n<li><strong>Enable for specific product</strong>/s by adding Minimum Acceptable Prices or <strong>enable globally</strong></li>\n<li>Enable <strong>global maximum acceptable discount</strong> for all products (<strong>one click set up</strong>)</li>\n<li>Enable on <strong>Shop page</strong></li>\n<li>Exclude categories from Global discount</li>\n<li>Exclude products on sale</li>\n<li>Maximum Allowed Bargaining</li>\n<li>Minimum product quantity required for bargaining</li>\n<li><strong>Exit Intent Detection</strong> to activate bargain bot.
