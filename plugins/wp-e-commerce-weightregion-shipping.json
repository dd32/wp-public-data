The best way to get in touch is through my <a href=\"http://plugins.leewillis.co.uk/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact form</a>. I can&#8217;t guarantee any timelines for a fix though as all work on this plugin is undertaken in my spare time. Please note &#8211; <strong>I do not monitor the support forms on wordpress.org</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I do xxxxxxxx?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately I can&#8217;t provide support or consultancy on how to use my free plugins unless it&#8217;s on a paid for basis. If you need support &#8211; please <a href=\"http://plugins.leewillis.co.uk/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get in touch</a> and I&#8217;ll be happy to provide a quote.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The weight rates aren&#8217;t getting calculated / don&#8217;t change when I add more products?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you have a weight rate for &#8220;0 and above&#8221;. Also ensure that you&#8217;ve entered shipping weights in pounds (lbs), regardless of what units you&#8217;ve set your products up in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the difference between the various charging methods?<br />\nThe plugin offers three different ways of mapping a customers order onto your weight bands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Single quote for total cart weight</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The weight of the entire cart is calculated, and this weight is used to check against the configured weight bands for the customer&#8217;s selected destination</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Sum of quotes for individual items</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Assumes that each item will be shipped individually. For each item in the cart, the weight is calculated for that product, and used to check against your configured weight bands. This shipping cost is multiplied by the quantity of that item that the user is buying. All of the prices are summed up to give the final customer cost.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Sum of quotes for consolidated items</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Assumes that each item will be shipped in bundles. For each item in the cart, the consolidated weight is calculated for that product (According to the quantity being purchased), and that consolidated weight is used to check against your configured weight bands. All of the prices are summed up to give the final customer cost.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
