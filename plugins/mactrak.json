A specific Google API key is required (available free from Google &#8211; follow link on setup page) and is stored within you WordPress site. This key is sent to the Google servers to allow access to the Map object that is rendered in the users browser overlaid with your route and marker data as desired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spot (Find Me Spot) servers for download of GPS tracking and message data via the API interface provided by Spot LLC (http://www.findmespot.com).
