There is no restriction on the number of sets you can have, nor the number of icons you may add to a single set. Each icon can have its separate link, making it possible to use the same icon for unlimited number of users.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Use The Plugin</strong></p>\n<p>It is very straightforward, just click the + icon in a &#8220;Icon Set&#8221; box (the gray box); this will automatically create an &#8220;Icon Set&#8221; shortcode that can be used in any shortcode enabled area, like pages and posts for example. Each time a new set is created an empty one will appear, so more sets can be built if needed.</p>\n<p>To remove icons just drag &amp; drop icons from within the set into the trash box. If a set has its icons removed, it will be deleted.</p>\n<p>Every newly created set has its unique ID but it may be changed to any other ID that does not contain special characters or spaces. In order to change a set ID, just double click on the generated shortcode next to the &#8220;size selector&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Setting a custom ID is recommended, this will prevent issues with removed sets and unused shortcodes. If a set is removed, but the shortcode is still in use, the set will be rendered empty. By having the custom set ID in the shortcode you may restore it anythime without going though all the places the shortcode was used, in order to change it to a new one.</p>\n<p>None of the icons have their links set when they are used to create new sets. These icons are marked with an * (asterisk) to indicate the lack of a link. To set a link, just double click on the icon and type in or past a link in the input box of the popup window. Click &#8220;Done&#8221; or hit ENTER on your keyboard, to save the changes.</p>\n<p>The above information is also included in the Help tab of the plugin admin screen.</p>\n",
