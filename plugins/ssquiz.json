Add questions/quizzes, rearrange questions, edit answers, insert multimedia in questions &#8211; all of this can be done on single page within several seconds. Also one can edit welcome/finish/email templates using html if it&#8217;s needed. Quiz automatically determines what type of test user creates (choose-correct, fill-blank or question with several correct answers). Once quiz is over, user can walk through their answers and see correct answers.</p>\n<p>Features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy and fast quiz creation</li>\n<li>Multimedia in questions</li>\n<li>Multiple types of questions</li>\n<li>Timer</li>\n<li>Email sending to user or teacher</li>\n<li>Plugin API (See FAQ)</li>\n<li>Localization ready (Currently added Russian and Persian translation)</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>SSQuiz 2.0 is rethought and rewritten compared to previous versions.<br />\nIf you were using previous version, then your SSQuiz data will be converted to a new format on activation.</p>\n<p>If you have problems with updating to 2.0 version you can downgrade it to 1.12.c</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re uninstalling plugin, quizzes will stay on database. To delete them, Delete tables with names like &#8216;ssquiz&#8217; in WordPress database.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What should I know about front end</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When answering to questions, user must be connected to internet, as every answer is sent to server and checked there, making cheating harder.<br />\nQuiz accepts empty answers from users.<br />\nAPI and email sending trigger only if user went through all questions, however quiz saves every attempt to the statistics page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What shortcodes can I use</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use following arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all &#8211; to show all questions on once</li>\n<li>not_correct &#8211; not showing correct answers after quiz is finished</li>\n<li>show_correct &#8211; to show weather user ansered correctly after each answer</li>\n<li>qrandom &#8211; to randomize order of questions</li>\n<li>arandom &#8211; to randomize order of  answers</li>\n<li>name &#8211; to request user name at quiz start. For logged in users this field will be pre-filled</li>\n<li>email &#8211; to request user email at quiz start and to send him email when quiz is done. For logged in users this field will be pre-filled</li>\n<li>timer &#8211; set timer in seconds. For example: timer=12</li>\n<li>one_chance &#8211; for registered users sets only one attempt to pass test. To start again you should delete their attempt from quiz&#8217;s history</li>\n<li>total &#8211; number of questions to display. It is useful with &#8216;qrandom&#8217; to change questions each time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example: [ssquiz id=1 qrandom timer=20] means insert on page quiz with id = 1, with shuffled questions. In 20 seconds after user clicks &#8216;Start&#8217; exit will be triggered.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What should I know about back end</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Quiz uses ajax requests for all operations on admin side. So the pages will not reload on each update, making working with quiz more convenient. Max number of questions on page is 20.</p>\n<p>On &#8216;Manage quizzes&#8217; page selected quiz and page is saved, so when you leaved and then went back it would show the questions you recently had been working with.</p>\n<p>For questions type &#8216;choise&#8217;: if you write many answers, but only one of those is correct, then it will be &#8220;multiple choice&#8221; test, and user will be able to choose only one answer.</p>\n<p>If you checks more than one correct answer to question, then it would be possible, to choose several answers at once.</p>\n<p>While working with quizzes you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave answers blank to delete them</li>\n<li>Drag question within quiz to change order of questions</li>\n<li>Delete quizzes or questions while editing them. There will be button &#8216;delete&#8217; on the buttom</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
