        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20point-of-sale%20invitation%3F'>\nCan I customize the point-of-sale invitation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several standard (free) versions of the point-of-sale invitation available. If a retailer prefers that the invitation have its own look and feel, or one that is merely different from what Bizrate offers, then retailers can create their own graphic for the invitation if it conforms to the size specifications of 500 x 455 pixels, functionally indicates an acceptance of the invitation with a click, and is approved by Bizrate Insights. (Fee applies.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20popup%20blockers%20prevent%20the%20survey%20invitation%20from%20rendering%3F'>\nDo popup blockers prevent the survey invitation from rendering?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a pop-up blocker is present on a consumers&#8217; computer, then Bizrate&#8217;s buyer survey invitation will render in a DHTML format (a pop-in). No change to the code needs to be made by retailers for this functionality; it is already built into Bizrate&#8217;s code.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20bizrate%27s%20code%3F'>\nCan I customize Bizrate&#8217;s code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Bizrate® Insights does not condone nor support customization of the buyers&#8217; survey code beyond what is provided by Bizrate. Requests for customization should be submitted to Bizrate through a Bizrate Insights account manager or bizrateinsights@bizrate.com.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20survey%3F'>\nCan I customize the survey?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>YES! Custom questions and custom formatting can be added to the standard survey as paid services.

The subject line for this email is “Thanks for your MerchantName Purchase! How&#8217;d it go?”. If the consumer does not respond to this invitation, then 5 days later, Bizrate issues one reminder email.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20bizrate%20insights%20lead%20the%20industry%20in%20survey%20response%20rate%3F'>\nHow does Bizrate Insights lead the industry in survey response rate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After completing each survey, respondents are offered a reward worth up to $100 for their submission.
