If there are frequently asked question I will sum them up here.</p>\n\n<dt id='can%20i%20have%20feature%20x%3F'>\nCan I have feature X?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since <strong>Minimal Contact Form</strong> is designed for ease of use, I choose new features very carefully. Also, updates should always take into account existing web pages and should not include breaking changes. Nevertheless, you are welcome to submit requests for new features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20styling%20options%3F'>\nWhere are the styling options?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Minimal Contact Form</strong> is configured in such a way that you can use it without much configuration. The look of the form is kept very neutral. However, if you want to customize it, you can use the Custom CSS field in the settings. Since version <code>0.10.0</code> you can also use predefined CSS variables. You can find an overview of them in the help of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20minimal%20contact%20form%20in%20gutenberg%20or%20a%20builder%20theme%3F'>\nHow do I use Minimal Contact Form in Gutenberg or a builder theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently you can only embed <strong>Minimal Contact Form</strong> with a shortcode. However, I am working on making the plugin available as a module in Gutenberg, Divi and Breakdance in version <code>1.0</code>. Help is welcome for these builders as well as for others.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
