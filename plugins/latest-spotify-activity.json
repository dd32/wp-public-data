Powered by Spotify&#8217;s built-in &#8216;Last.fm Scrobble&#8217; functionality.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<p>Once setup, the songs you play on your Spotify app are instantly viewable on your site for your users to see! Each line displays the song&#8217;s artist, song title &amp; how long it&#8217;s been since you started listening to it. If a song is still playing it will display &#8220;Currently Playing&#8221; instead of displaying the time since it was played.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Easy to Setup</h4>\n<p>This plugin requires no extra software to be installed on the device you&#8217;re playing music from. Once you activate it on WordPress and enter your Last.fm username, anything you play will be displayed via the widget.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s Lightweight!</h4>\n<p>Although this plugin is ~5kb in size, only ~2kb is used on the front-end to display your recent activity. The remaining code is used to register the plugin &amp; create/process the widget options. Translation? This is a very small script and won&#8217;t even dent your load time.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>This plugin uses Spotify&#8217;s &#8216;Last.fm Scrobbling&#8217;</h4>\n<p>Because Spotify does not currently have an API to see your latest activity, this plugin uses Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Last.fm Scrobbling&#8221; feature as a workaround. This means a Last.fm account is required for it to work. If you don&#8217;t have a Last.fm account, have no fear, as creating one takes approx. 15 seconds and it&#8217;s free!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Demo</h4>\n<p>See a demo of what the widget look&#8217;s like to users, <a href=\"http://www.justindocanto.com/blog/using-the-golden-ratio-in-website-typography\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> or on the &#8216;Screenshots&#8217; tab.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I style the widget output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! The widget area will have an id of &#8220;latest-spotify-activity&#8221;. You can style the inner html by adding styles specific to the ID like &#8216;#latest-spotify-activity h3&#8217;, &#8216;#latest-spotify-activity p&#8217; &amp; &#8216;#latest-spotify-activity abbr&#8217;. This plugin will inherit your previously existing widget styling if you don&#8217;t specify any specific to the widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it auto-scroll line in facebook?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. There is no javascript called or integrated with this plugin whatsoever, in order to keep resource usage as low as possible. This means it does not auto-populate new data like facebook does. This widget is intended to simply allow somebody to view your latest activity at the time of opening your page/post. Each time you switch/open/reload pages, the widget shows your most recent Spotify activity.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it display new song data even if my pages having caching turned on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This depends on how in-depth your caching is. If you&#8217;re caching everything, even HTML, it&#8217;s failing approx 1:10 times. No page caching = 100% success rate. I will work on a solution for people who are caching their html, in a future version.</p>\n<p>Questions? Bugs? Suggestions?
