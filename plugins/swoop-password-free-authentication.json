Imagine a world where your users are free to securely come and go from anywhere on your website without a password. We are passionate about the freedom that comes with eliminating passwords—and we believe you will be, too, once you download and install 1-Click Login: Passwordless Authentication.</p>\n<p><strong>What is 1-Click Login?</strong></p>\n<p>1-Click Login is the easiest way for your users to access your content.<br />\nWe’ve eliminated the hassle of the password so more people will use your app.</p>\n<p><strong>Who Is 1-Click Login For?</strong></p>\n<p>1-Click Login is for anyone who wants to simply and securely eliminate passwords from their website. If you’re reading this description, you should install the 1-Click Login plugin to secure the administration of your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>But why stop there? 1-Click Login is perfect for eliminating passwords from your user registration and login process entirely. Here are a few of the ways we’ve seen others find success with 1-Click Login.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WordPress Website Developers:</strong> Make your life easier by installing 1-Click Login on each of your websites so you can securely access each web property with one click.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Digital Marketers:</strong> Sales is going to love you after installing 1-Click Login. Provide verified emails that you know work with every registration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Conversion Rate Optimizers:</strong> Reduce registration form abandonment rates by eliminating a “required” password field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Product Designers:</strong> Incorporate 1-Click Login into your registration and login process for a friction-free experience. Less steps. More secure. More access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bloggers:</strong> Register your visitors with ease and provide a frictionless paywall for your gated content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CISO:</strong> Passwords are insecure. That’s why our technology is being used by some of the most well-known technology companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customer Success &amp; Support Managers:</strong> Never reset a password again. Eliminate low-value/high-cost call center calls, emails and chats, and enable the resources you have to focus on high-value activities that can really help your customers succeed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why 1-Click Login?</strong></p>\n<p>Passwords are antiquated and insecure. At this point, we’ve all had our passwords hijacked by hackers. So what are we left with? Continue to recycle a series of passwords we can easily remember? Use a password vault to store unique passwords for each website? Or, we can eliminate the password problem entirely with 1-Click Login.</p>\n<p>1-Click Login also helps you:</p>\n<p><strong>Convert.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing customer acquisition can be challenging.
