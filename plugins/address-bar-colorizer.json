        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20put%20extra%20load%20on%20my%20server%3F'>\nDoes the plugin put extra load on my server?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple answer is no. More technical answer is, since the plugin does indeed execute some code and has some if/else to go through, there&#8217;s mathematically some time taken. However, the time take is almost negligible. You can use any profiler plugin (P3 Profiler, for example) and how this plugin is performing. In tests performed on my personal websites, the plugin took approximately 0.0018 seconds.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='color%20codes%20aren%27t%20being%20updated%21%3F%21'>\nColor codes aren&#8217;t being updated!?!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This could be primarily be caused by old cache or invalid hex values. For starters, try clearing the cache (from whichever plugin you are using). The mobile browser cache might also have a role to play in it, so try clearing the Google Chrome mobile browser cache also. Additionally, those using Cloudflare, might need to &#8216;Purge&#8217; files to get it working. Lastly, ensure that you are indeed entering valid hex color codes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20cannot%20see%20it%20on%20desktop%2C%20windows%20phone%2C%20ios%2C%20etc.%21'>\nI cannot see it on desktop, windows phone, iOS, etc.!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how it works. The plugin ONLY applies colorization to Google Chrome mobile web browser running on Android devices. Well, it is tested to work on android devices particularly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
