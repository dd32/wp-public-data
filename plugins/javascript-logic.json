But, if they&#8217;re being loaded on every page of the site, things were running pretty slow.  So, I decided I needed an easy way to only load JavaScript when it was needed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does this plugin do, exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It gives you a central control panel to load JavaScript on the pages of your choosing using WordPress <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags\" title=\"Conditional Tags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">conditional tags</a>.  Plus, on the <em>Write Post/Page</em> screen, there&#8217;s an additional meta box that allows you to use JavaScript on a per-post/page basis.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
