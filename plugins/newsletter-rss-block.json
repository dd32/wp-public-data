Just install, activate and inside the Newsletter composer you&#8217;ll find that new RSS block.</p>\n<p>Drag it in your newsletter and select a feed URL and hope for the best.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20works%20with%20all%20feeds%3F'>\nDoes it works with all feeds?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there are feeds which are not compliant with specification, other without the media or a decent description part and so on. Just<br />\nexperiment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20get%20an%20rss%20feed%20for%20instagram%2C%20facebook%2C%20youtube%3F'>\nCan I get an RSS feed for Instagram, Facebook, Youtube?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you can&#8217;t. Or, at least, not officially. Those services are no more exporting their feeds. But you can search the net for<br />\n&#8220;RSS for Instagram&#8221; (just an example) to find services which provide that feature or other nice solution, for example<br />\nwith Zapier.</p>\n<p>What you need, at the end, is an RSS feed URL.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20block%20content%20is%20updated%20when%20i%20send%20the%20newsletter%3F'>\nThe block content is updated when I send the newsletter?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the block content is created when you add it to your newsletter or when you refresh it and the made static.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='images%20are%20imported%20in%20my%20blog%3F'>\nImages are imported in my blog?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>No, image references are untouched so they&#8217;re loaded from the original domain which hosts them.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
