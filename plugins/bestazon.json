        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20it%20really%20free%3F'>\nIs it really free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The BestAzon wordpress plugin is free, and will always remain free. This plugin enables redirection of all your Amazon URLs to BestAzon Link Globalization service, provides other useful features that are actively being developed, and is supported very well.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses BestAzon service, web&#8217;s most popular Amazon link globalization service. The service offers two commercial models &#8211; a) Amazon Tag Non-Profit Donation where a certain % of your clicks will use tags from , and will show an intermediate page with advertisement or b) A fixed flat fee. You can switch between these models at will, and by default the Amazon Tag Non-Profit Donation model is used, unless you subscribe to fixed monthly fee. The detailed Terms of Usage for this service can be found <a href=\"http://bestazon.io/#Terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20non-profits%20do%20you%20donate%20to%3F'>\nWhat non-profits do you donate to?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In case you chose Amazon Tag Non-Profit Donation model (default), a certain % of clicks will use tags from one of the non-profits. As of now, we donate to foundation which further distributes the Amazon commission earned to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>, one of the top non-profits rated by Givewell.org. We may, at our sole discretion, donate to other non profit organization as well.</p>\n<p>So, by using this plugin, you are making more money AND making world a better place! Talk about win-win ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20ever%20use%20your%20own%20tags%3F'>\nDo you ever use your own Tags?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In one word &#8211; no. BestAzon localization service always uses your Amazon tags, or tags from one of the non-profit we support. The scenarios in which we use a non-profit tag are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The visitor is from a location that you have not provided your tag for.</li>\n<li>You are not subscribed to fixed fee model &#8211; in this case, a small proportion of your clicks will use the non-profit tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in any event &#8211; your visitor clicks go to a good cause: your wallet, or good karma by donating to a non-profit! If you want to keep 100% of your commission to yourself, you can easily subscribe to flat fixed fee model.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kind%20of%20links%20this%20plugin%20works%20or%20not-work%20with%3F'>\nWhat kind of links this plugin works or not-work with?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In short, the plugin works on any Amazon, Amzn.to and other short URLs that utlimately redirect to any of Amazon stores in the world. For this to work, the link should be on your website (and not in an iframe).</p>\n<p>This pluing will not (yet) work on anything which is loaded in an iframe. Such links include Amazon Native Ads, aStore amd Banners that you load using Amazon HTML code.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20with%20short%20urls%20as%20well%20%28amzn.to%29%20or%20just%20with%20long%20url%3F'>\nDoes it work with short URLs as well (amzn.to) or just with long URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From Version 1.8.0 onwards, we have added support for shrot URLs too. So both &#8211; long URLs with full Amazon link, as well as short URLs (amzn.to) will get converted to a global/localized Amazon store link.</p>\n<p>Infact, this service even works with Amazon links that are redirected from other non-amazon URLs (e.g. bitly links, or links using Prettylink plugin). As long as you enter the URL slugs in the setting, those URLs will be followed to find out if they are Amazon links and if yes, they will be converted to a globalized link.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20bestazon%20provide%20reporting%3F'>\nDoes BestAzon provide reporting?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You bet! From version 3.5 onwards, we provide integration with Google Analytics. You can access virtually everything to know about the visitors localized through BestAzon using the free Google Analytics service. <a href=\"http://support.bestazon.io/knowledge-base/bestazon-reporting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See more details</a></p>\n<p>As always, no seperate login required, and your information is safe with Google!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20check%20if%20what%20commercial%20model%20is%20being%20used%20for%20my%20domain%3F'>\nHow can I check if what commercial model is being used for my domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bestazon.io/CheckSubscriptionStatus.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Please go to this page and enter your domain name</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20bestazon%20compare%20with%20other%20amazon%20plugins%3F'>\nHow does BestAzon compare with other Amazon plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Really, you should find it out for yourself!</p>\n<p>In short, this is the only wordpress plugin that allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>localize all your Amazon links out of the box &#8211; without needing any signup. </li>\n<li>Uses the BestAzon.Io service which is the fastest Amazon redirect available leveraging global delivery network of Amazon Web Services &#8211; guaranteeing 100% uptime, and less than half a second latency. </li>\n<li>Unlike most similar plugins, we <strong>DO NOT use our tags</strong> on your visitor clicks. </li>\n<li>Finally, our algorithm is the most advanced in order to detect the right link to forward the visitor to.</li>\n<li>And ofcourse its free to use!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Try it &#8211; worse that can happen is that you don&#8217;t like earning extra money, or giving your visitors better experience. Unintiall it then! ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20help%20with%20bestazon%20plugin%20%E2%80%93%20where%20can%20i%20find%20that%3F'>\nI need help with BestAzon Plugin â€“ where can I find that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Glad you asked!</p>\n<p>We provide full support for this plugin.
