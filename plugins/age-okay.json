        "faq": "<p>Q. How does Age Okay stand out from other age verification plugins?</p>\n<p>A. Age Okay is highly customisable, allowing you to choose whatever background, colours and text content you want. Some plugins do not allow such flexibility and provide the user simply with templates that they can choose from. However, there are some plugins that have a similar level of customisablilty, but not in such a user friendly way, or not free. Age Okay requires no coding experience for a user to change almost everything about the look of the age verification screen. It also provides a live view so you can see how it will work before enabling it, and a preview option so you can see how changes will look without having to save them. Age Okay also provides a huge amount of control over where to display the verification screen. And if you need more control or more features, you can purchase the PRO version.</p>\n<p>Q. What is different in the PRO version?</p>\n<p>Age Okay Pro adds some additional features that other age verification plugins do not have or are not common and not all found in just one plugin:<br />\n1. Display by ID/URL &#8211; On the settings page, you will be able to use the ID of a page/post/CPT to choose where to display the verification screen, to accurately pinpoint specific pages or posts. You can also use URL matching for a huge amount of control, for example, if you have a shop, and you wanted to target any pages where women&#8217;s handbags were sold, you could use &#8216;/women/handbags/&#8217; to target all pages and posts that match this.<br />\n2. Shortcodes &#8211; Age Okay has a settings page which allows the admin to decide which pages to show the age verification screen on. However, Age Okay also provides 2 shortcodes that can be added to a page, post, or CPT that will force the age verification screen to be shown, or to never show. <code>[age_okay]</code> <code>[age_okay hide=true]</code><br />\n3. Filter &#8211; Similary to the shortcodes, Age Okay provides a filter that allows the admin to overwrite the internal logic of the Age Okay plugin on where the age verification screen should be shown. If the admin has additional checks they want to use before allowing Age Okay to use its own logic, then they can do so through the filter: <code>add_filter( 'age_okay_filter', function(){ return null;} );</code><br />\nreturn values: true to show, false to hide, null to use Age Okay settings<br />\n4. Multilingual &#8211; Age Okay provides an interface where the admin can set other language versions of the text content of the age verification screen. If the website has multilingual functionality added, for example, through a plugin like Polylang, then it is very easy to create a multilingual version of the age verification screen. So if you have an English website, but a French page with the url http://example.com/fr/my-page, then Age Okay will check the locale of your page and display the appropriate text content.<br />\n5. 3 Load Types &#8211; Some age verification plugins suffer from a delay in showing the age verification screen because they rely on AJAX to load it after the page content has finished loading. This is needed because of cache plugins that would display the wrong content if AJAX was not used. However, this means that websites without a cache plugin suffer needlessly. It also means that websites using a cache plugin but that have explicit content may show that explicit content to underage visitors. Age Okay provides 3 load types to fix this problem: a cache version as standard, a non cache version, and a cache version that blurs the page content until the age verification is loaded or the user has been verified.</p>\n",
