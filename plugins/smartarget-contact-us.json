With a single click on the messsenger</p>\n<p>Small TIP from us: While chatting with customers on Facebook Messanger, use icons and gifs. It makes your customers like you more 🙂</p>\n<h3>Why you should not use Instant messaging over Chat on your website</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Always available &#8211; When customers contact you via instant messaging chat you can always get back to them and be sure that they will get your reply. This is not the case with regular chat plugins because if you didn&#8217;t answer a customer almost right away &#8211; you lost a customer.</li>\n<li>Better personalization &#8211; For using instant messaging chats, your customers must have an online profile which can already tell you their name, it’s a nice advantage over a chat because you can approach them personally. If you provide services to countries around the world, you can already know the customers’ country when they contact you via Whatsapp chat, Viber, Facebook Mesenger, Telegra, Line, Skype and more.</li>\n<li>No signup, No blockers &#8211; Chatt plugins ask your customer for their email and name because they know that you’re not always available so the cha apps wants to allow you to get back to your customers. But very often the customers don’t want to leave their email address and name, they just want to chat with you and ask their questions. The outcome of it is that they don’t leave their email and leave your website. With instant messaging they don’t need to leave any information, they simply click on the relevant instant messaging platform they prefer and start chatting with you. That simple!!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design your chat button to fit your website style</h3>\n<p>Smartarget offers different types of chat buttons: Whatsapp chat button, WeChat button, telegam button, click to call button, Facebook Messenger button, Viber chat button and many more.</p>\n<p>All our buttons are fully customized so you can fit the button color and style to your website branding.

This is not the case with regular chat plugins because if you didn&#8217;t answer a customer almost right away &#8211; you lost a customer.</li>\n<li>Better personalization &#8211; For using instant messaging chats, your customers must have an online profile which can already tell you their name, it’s a nice advantage over a chat because you can approach them personally. If you provide services to countries around the world, you can already know the customers’ country when they contact you via Whatsapp chat, Viber, Facebook Mesenger, Telegra, Line, Skype and more.</li>\n<li>No signup, No blockers &#8211; Chatt plugins ask your customer for their email and name because they know that you’re not always available so the cha apps wants to allow you to get back to your customers. But very often the customers don’t want to leave their email address and name, they just want to chat with you and ask their questions. The outcome of it is that they don’t leave their email and leave your website. With instant messaging they don’t need to leave any information, they simply click on the relevant instant messaging platform they prefer and start chatting with you. That simple!!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Design your chat button to fit your website style</h3>\n<p>Smartarget offers different types of chat buttons: Whatsapp chat button, WeChat button, telegam button, click to call button, Facebook Messenger button, Viber chat button and many more.</p>\n<p>All our buttons are fully customized so you can fit the button color and style to your website branding.
