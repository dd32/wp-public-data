It just makes use of their public API within their Terms and Conditions policy: <a href=\"https://openexchangerates.org/terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://openexchangerates.org/terms</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you guarantee that the currency exchange rates provided will be accurate?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>No.</strong> As Open Exchange Rates itself says: &#8220;Exchange rates are provided for informational purposes only, and do not constitute financial advice of any kind. Although every attempt is made to ensure quality, NO guarantees are given whatsoever of accuracy, validity, availability, or fitness for any purpose &#8211; please use at your own risk.&#8221;<br />\nIt is not recommended to use this plugin in critical business scenarios. The plugin author(s) nor the currency exchange rates provider(s) will not be responsible for financial loss or damage caused by data inaccuracies. Please refer to the GPL license and Open Exchange Rates terms and conditions for further information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I exceed my Open Exchange Rates API request quota?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin will be unable to update the database and older, may throw a warning when it tries to do so (as if it would with an invalid API key) and less accurate currency rates will be used (those recorded in the database at the time of the last update).<br />\nYou can monitor your quota usage according to your subscription plan by logging into your Open Exchange Rates account at <a href=\"https://openexchangerates.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://openexchangerates.org/</a>.<br />\nFrom the plugin settings, you can specify a less frequent interval of database updates to make less API requests. Please note that if you make use of the API elsewhere and perform more requests, they will be counted by Open Exchange Rates and summed up with the ones triggered by this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WP Currencies runs but the currencies aren&#8217;t refreshed at the intervals I&#8217;ve set &#8211; why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This could be related to <code>cron</code> not working properly in your host.
