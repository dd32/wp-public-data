        "description": "<p>Socialized adds social media sharing buttons to your posts, pages, and custom post types that are automatically integrated with Google Analytics using campaign parameters. When a user shares your post using these buttons, they can share a vanity URL that is either automatically generated or customized by you and is specific to that button. When another user on social media then clicks on that shared link, the vanity URL redirects them to your page with analytics tracking automatically.</p>\n<p>By adding campaign parameters to the destination URLs, you can collect information about the overall efficacy of these campaigns, and also understand where the campaigns are more effective. For example, your “Summer Sale” campaign might be generating lots of revenue, but if you’re running the campaign on several social media platforms, you’ll want to know which of them is sending you the customers who generate the most revenue. Or if you’re running different versions of the campaign via email, video ads, and in-app ads, you can compare the results to see where your marketing is most effective.</p>\n<p>The campaign parameters that are automatically added are sent to Google Analytics when a user clicks on one of the shared links, and the related data is available in the campaigns reports. Below is a list of the campaign parameters that are added and their possible values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>utm_source</code>. Possible value(s): <code>facebook</code> | <code>twitter</code> | <code>linkedin</code> | <code>pinterest</code> | <code>email</code> | <code>vanity-url</code></li>\n<li><code>utm_medium</code>. Possible value(s): <code>social</code> | <code>email</code> | <code>vanity-url</code></li>\n<li><code>utm_content</code>. Possible value(s): <code>socialized-share-link</code></li>\n<li><code>utm_campaign</code>: Possible value(s): <code>socialized</code> | or define in <em>Settings</em></li>\n<li><code>utm_term</code>:  Possible value(s):  Defined by typing in the text box in the metabox on the post or page | or the “Focus keyphrase” by Yoast SEO</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your permalink struture will not be affected.

        "installation": "<p>There are three (3) ways to install my plugin: automatically, upload, or manually.</p>\n<h4>Install Method 1: Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li>\n<li>Where it says &#8220;Keyword&#8221; in a dropdown, change it to &#8220;Author&#8221;</li>\n<li>In the search form, type <code>TessaWatkinsLLC</code> (results may begin populating as you type but my plugins will only show when the full name is there)</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve found my plugin in the search results that appear, click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and wait for the installation process to complete.</li>\n<li>Once the installation process is completed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to activate my plugin.</li>\n<li>After this plugin is activated, see below for additional instructions for setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Install Method 2: Upload via WordPress Admin</h4>\n<p>This method involves is a little more involved. You don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser, but you&#8217;ll need to download and then upload the files yourself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/socialized/\" rel=\"ugc\">Download my plugin</a> from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.</li>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Add New</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Upload Plugin</strong> button at the top of the screen.</li>\n<li>Select the zip file from your local file system that was downloaded in step 1.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button and wait for the installation process to complete.</li>\n<li>Once the installation process is completed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button to activate it.</li>\n<li>After this plugin is activated, see below for additional instructions for setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Install Method 3: Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>This method is the most involved as it requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/socialized/\" rel=\"ugc\">Download my plugin</a> from WordPress.org; it will be in the form of a zip file.</li>\n<li>Unzip the contents; you should have a single folder named <code>socialized</code>.</li>\n<li>Connect to your WordPress server with your favorite SFTP client.</li>\n<li>Copy the folder from step 2 to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> folder in your WordPress directory. Once the folder and all of its files are there, installation is complete.</li>\n<li>Now log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong>. You should now see my plugin in your list.</li>\n<li>Click the <strong>Activate</strong> button under my plugin to activate it.</li>\n<li>After this plugin is installed and activated, see below for additional instructions for setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>After Plugin Activation</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Tools &gt; Socialized</strong> to change any <em>global settings</em> to fit your needs.</li>\n<li>When creating new posts or editing existing ones, use the meta box to configure settings specific to that post.</li>\n<li>Publish your post to see the buttons on the page.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20platforms%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat platforms are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, Pinterest, email, and copying to clipboard (for sites with SSL enabled) are supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20name%20of%20the%20campaign%3F'>\nCan I change the name of the campaign?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can change the name of the campaign, or the value of <code>utm_campaign</code>, from the plugin settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20vanity%20url%3F'>\nCan I change the vanity URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! When a new post is created, a random string will be generated for that post, but you can edit it to be whatever you want. However, it will be suffixed with a dash and a character to recognize the platform and map it to the correct campaign parameters.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20affect%20my%20page%27s%20url%2C%20permalink%2C%20or%20canonical%20url%3F'>\nDoes this affect my page&#8217;s URL, permalink, or canonical URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This won&#8217;t have any effect on your page&#8217;s URL, permalink, permalink settings, or canonical URL. The vanity URL is simply another way of getting to your page but with the added Google campaign parameters automatically added. This plugin does not create any new pages, only redirects, so there won&#8217;t be any duplicate content issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20affect%20my%20page%27s%20seo%20or%20%E2%80%9Cpage%20rank%E2%80%9D%3F'>\nDoes this affect my page&#8217;s SEO or “page rank”?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It will not harm your page&#8217;s SEO. Since the vanity URLs redirect using 301 permanent redirects, the “page rank” is transferred to your original page, preserving your SEO value.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20affect%20my%20domain%20authority%3F'>\nDoes this affect my domain authority?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but in a good way! Using a URL shortener service like bit.ly or TinyURL gets a miniscule amount of “domain authority” when pages are redirected through their domains since it is ultimately their URL that gets shared on other websites. You actually gain this bonus back when it is your domain that gets shared instead.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20choose%20an%20image%20to%20share%20on%20pinterest%3F'>\nHow does it choose an image to share on Pinterest?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If there is an image in the content of your article, it will find the first one and use that. Otherwise, it will fall back to using the featured image. If no image is associated with the article, then Pinterest will display all of the images found on the page, allowing the user to select which they want to use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20icons%20do%20you%20have%3F'>\nWhat icons do you have?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose between lossless PNG images, <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/?ref=socialized-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome 5</a> icons, or English text. The HTML is simple so you can easily change the appearance with CSS.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20compatible%20with%20the%20yoast%20seo%20plugin%3F'>\nIs this compatible with the Yoast SEO plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! If you leave the &#8220;Campaign Term&#8221; blank in the metabox on your page, the <code>utm_term</code> value will default to your page&#8217;s &#8220;focus keyphrase&#8221; in Yoast SEO&#8217;s metabox.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
