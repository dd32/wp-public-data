        "faq": "\n<h4>The stats caching notice seems stuck</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your version is older than 4.3, try upgrading.</li>\n<li>Sometimes WP Cron doesn&#8217;t start a scheduled work right away. Wait a minute and load any page.</li>\n<li>Check that WP Cron isn&#8217;t disabled.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>The word count/readability calculation isn&#8217;t accurate</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Word Stats uses simple algorithms (but more elaborate than the PHP word counter). For fairly ordinary English texts they will closely match human counting. The margin of error will be greater for short pieces, text with complex punctuation or in other languages, but they should be still good indicators.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some HTML/shortcode words are being counted as keywords</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some cases are still not filtered out. Report them in the plugin support forum or via email.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin makes my site slow</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some of the plugin&#8217;s tasks can be a bit intensive, specially on large blogs. Try disabling counting for unpublished posts, and live stats when you don&#8217;t need them. Our resources are limited, for now we are working on features rather than optimization.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some common words show as keywords, even though the setting to exclude common words is activated</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The built in lists only exclude some of the most common words. Performing many matches with regular expressions can be very slow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why the live counters seem to lag?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The calculations are refreshed every few seconds.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are the ignored keywords counted in the total words?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. They are ignored only for keyword counts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do the indexes really reflect how easy is the text?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They try to reflect how easy the text is to read. You can write an article about relativity in simple English and it will be rated as low level.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do the readability number mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For ARI and CLI, they are the U.S. grade level of the text. Roughly, grade level 1 corresponds to ages 6-8, grade 8 to 14 years old, grade 12 to 17 years old.</p>\n<p>For LIX:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>below 25: Children&#8217;s Books</li>\n<li>25 &#8211; 30: Simple texts</li>\n<li>30 &#8211; 40: Normal Text / Fiction</li>\n<li>40 &#8211; 50: Factual information, such as Wikipedia</li>\n<li>50 &#8211; 60: Technical texts</li>\n<li>over 60: Specialist texts / research / dissertations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each index uses a different algorithm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ARI is based on word length and words per sentence.</li>\n<li>CLI is based on characters per 100 words, excluding non-word characters, and sentences per 100 words</li>\n<li>LIX is based on average words between pauses (periods, colons, semicolons, etc.) and average words longer than 6 characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_test</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why other common tests aren&#8217;t included?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These three indexes don&#8217;t rely on syllable counting, which is a bit more complicated and language dependent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The stats page timed out.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try selecting a shorter period, disabling the setting to count drafts and pending posts, disabling the setting to ignore common words or shortening your list of ignored keywords.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
