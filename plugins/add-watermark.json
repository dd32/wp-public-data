        "installation": "<p>You need an apache Server with mod_rewrite installed and a recent php version with gd enabled. ~90% of the web hosting providers out there provide this by default.</p>\n<p>Install and activate this plugin.</p>\n<p>Then go to Settings-&gt;Add watermark. You can upload or chose your watermark image there. For a first test, you can leave the position settings as they are.</p>\n<h4>Manual uninstall</h4>\n<p>Mind that the plugin adds a .htaccess file for processing the images.</p>\n<p>If you deactivate / uninstall it, the hooks will automatically be deleted.</p>\n<p>If that fails (or you want to uninstall manually), delete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin directory (as you would with every other plugin)</li>\n<li>Delete wp-content/uploads/.htaccess</li>\n<li>Delete wp-content/uploads/watermark-cache/</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this plugin need extra space</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. since all images are cached with a watermark, you need twice the space for images on your server.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin reduce performance</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not much. You might experience a longer loading time on the first access to the image (normally when you upload it or on your first view of the post). But afterwards there will be no speed impact, since all logic is encoded in a htaccess-File and not in PHP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I remove a watermark</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the media library, switch to list view (not gallery). Select the checkbox next to the image and then chose &#8220;Remove watermark&#8221; from the dropdown on the top of the page.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
