        "faq": "\n<h4>What are the system requirements for using FatCloud?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FatCloud has been successfully tested with WordPress 2.7.1 on PHP5.2+. We have not tested it on 5.1.x. There is no support for PHP4 (sorry!). If you have problems on these (or other) configurations, feel free to <a href=\"http://netlife.com.au/2009/06/28/wordle-your-wordpress-flash-based-tag-cloud-plugin/#comments\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">submit a comment</a> on Netlife.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I get an error after activating version 0.1?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our initial release did not allow for a different plugin folder name. If you downloaded version 0.1, parse errors are expected after activation i.e. &#8216;parse error, unexpected =,&#8217;. To resolve this temporary issue, FTP into your website and rename the plugin directory from<br />\n&#8216;wp-content/plugins/netlifes-tag-cloud-fatcloud&#8217; to &#8216;wp-content/plugins/wp&#095;fat&#095;cloud&#8217;. We have since pushed up revision 0.2 to resolve this issue.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does my browser freeze after I add new tags?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FatCloud is doing some pretty hard-core rendering back there. Once it renders, it caches<br />\nthe render data on the server, but it needs to re-render whenever its data changes. A<br />\n45 second render time is pretty normal. It will happen only once after a new tag is added to wordpress.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release. Hooray!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed plug-in directory name to be consistent with SVN path</li>\n<li>Added PHP 5.2+ to system requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Some users reported a MySQL invalid resource warning when installing FatCloud. The code in question has been re-written with extra care, so future installations should be error-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for user defined wordpress table prefix&#8217;s. We had previously assumed the options table would always be called wp_options.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a javascript bug in Internet Explorer browsers that was causing FatCloud tag cloud to appear blank</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin now includes a widget, thanks to Roel S.F. Abspoel</li>\n</ul>\n"
