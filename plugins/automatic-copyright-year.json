And when we see other people&#8217;s sites that, in the footer, say, &#8220;(c) 1998&#8221; then suddenly it&#8217;s revealed how out-of-date the site is.</p>\n<p>With Automatic Copyright Year, this problem will never happen to you!</p>\n<p>Instead of going through every site you have each year on the 1st of January and change the year manually, now it will all be done seamlessly for you. Just install the Automatic Copyright Year plugin and voila: your sites will always have an up-to-date copyright.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>The installation and use is very straightforward. You should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the folder <code>automatic-copyright-year</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Add &#8216;&lt;span&gt;[wpsos_year]&lt;/span&gt;&#8217; ([wpsos_year], surrounded by span tags) to a widget or to anywhere inside the html footer element. You can also use [wpsos_year] as a shortcode!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Which options do you modify?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0, there is no need to modify any options. The plugin will go through the content of your widgets and the html footer tag and replace [wpsos_year] with the current year number.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get some support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Let us know via the support forum.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have some suggestions for other options I want edited</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Let us know via the support forum.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow using [wpsos_year] as shortcode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
