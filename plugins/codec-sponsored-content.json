You thus lose the hard-earned traffic. With CODEC, users don’t need to leave your site for you to earn. We pay CPM, which means every time a user sees the CODEC content on your site, you earn money.</p>\n<p><strong>As Easy as 1-2-3</strong></p>\n<p>It takes about 2 min to install and set up the plugin.

Ad banners are not paying you every time a user with ad blockers enjoys content on your site. It&#8217;s usually about 40% of traffic. CODEC content is not blocked by any current ad blockers.</p>\n<p>You can use CODEC 1) in addition to your current source of monetization or 2) as a fallback where CODEC ads will be shown instead of banners or native ads when they are ad blocked.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20best%20location%20to%20place%20the%20codec%20widget%3F'>\nWhat is the best location to place the CODEC widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For maximum monetization and the best user experience, place the widget right after the article (preset by default for you). It&#8217;s not invasive to the reader, you get to keep your site’s premium placements at the top of the page for any existing sponsorship or banners while still earning a great deal with the CODEC Sponsored Content plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
