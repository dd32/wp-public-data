As per the Google Ad terms, Google doesn&#8217;t take any responsibility towards these invalid click activities or click bombings and always point the finger towards the Ad publisher, giving him/her all the blames. Now it is time to end this problem, once and for all.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> This plugin uses 3rd party systems <a href=\"http://ip-api.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ip-api.com</a> to get the location details for the server IP.

But unfortunately it is not humanly possible for me to check every single plugin of such out there or contact each plugin developer. Here I&#8217;m showing you how to incorporate the <strong>Ad Invalid Click Protector (AICP)</strong> plugin with your website&#8217;s ad code, so that both other plugin developers and normal users who use custom codes to show up their ads can take advantage of this.</p>\n<p>To use the Ad Invalid Click Protector plugin with your ad code you basically have to do 2 simple things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Put a <code>if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { /* return your ad code here */ }</code> block before returning your ad code to the front end</li>\n<li>Wrap your ad code within a simple <code>div</code> tag like this <code>&lt;div class=\"aicp\"&gt;...your ad code goes here...&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Personally I create various WordPress shortcodes for various ad units that I use on my personal website. It is extremely easy to create shortcodes for your ad units while taking the advantage of Ad Invalid Click Protector Plugin. Let me show you how to create a WordPress shortcode very easily.</p>\n<p>To create a shortcode the first thing you need to do is, go to the <code>functions.php</code> file of your theme or your child theme and at the end of your file put any of the following code.</p>\n<p>If you are using a PHP version &lt; 5.3, you can create a shortcode in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>add_shortcode( 'your_shortcode_name', 'your_shortcode_function_name' );\nfunction your_shortcode_function_name() {\n    if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { // This part will show ads to your non-banned visitors\n        $adCode = '&lt;div class=\"aicp\"&gt;&lt;!-- Don\\'t forget to add this div with aicp class --&gt;\n        &lt;script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Responsive Ad Code --&gt;\n        &lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n             style=\"display:block\"\n             data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1234567890\"\n             data-ad-slot=\"0987654321\"\n             data-ad-format=\"auto\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end of the aicp div --&gt;';\n        return $adCode;\n    } else { // Anything within this part will be shown to your banned visitors or to the blocked country visitors\n        return '&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;You have been blocked from seeing ads.&lt;/div&gt;';\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you are using PHP version &gt;= 5.3, you don&#8217;t need to give a function name, instead you can take advantage of of anonymous function like this way:</p>\n<pre><code>add_shortcode( 'your_shortcode_name', function() {\n    if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { // This part will show ads to your non-banned visitors\n        $adCode = '&lt;div class=\"aicp\"&gt;&lt;!-- Don\\'t forget to add this div with aicp class --&gt;\n        &lt;script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Responsive Ad Code --&gt;\n        &lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n             style=\"display:block\"\n             data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1234567890\"\n             data-ad-slot=\"0987654321\"\n             data-ad-format=\"auto\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end of the aicp div --&gt;';\n        return $adCode;\n    } else { // Anything within this part will be shown to your banned visitors or to the blocked country visitors\n        return '&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;You have been blocked from seeing ads.&lt;/div&gt;';\n    }\n} );\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> if you want, you can completely ignore the <code>else {}</code> block above in case you don&#8217;t wanna show anything special to the blocked visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I know what PHP version I am using?</strong></p>\n<p>You can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-server-stats/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Server Stats</a> plugin in your website which will show you many important information about your hosting environment including what PHP version you are currently using.</p>\n<p><strong>Can this plugin be used with other ad medias?</strong></p>\n<p>No It is not. This plugin will only work with Ad ads or any ad media that shows iframe based ads. Recently Google has tweaked there ad code which makes merely impossible to support both iframe based ads like Ad and non-iframe based ads, like affiliate ads.<br />\nIn case of affiliate ads, there is generally no click bombing issue, that is why from v1.1.0, AICP will only support iframe based ads and not general affiliate ads. Sorry guys! In case you want to use AICP just for affiliate ads, I will recommend you to download v1.0.6 of the plugin from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ad-invalid-click-protector/developers/\" rel=\"ugc\">old archive</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it help me from stop clicking on my own ads?</strong></p>\n<p>No, you are not supposed to click on your own ads. If you want you can use adblock in your browser to save yourself from accidental clicking on your own ads.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>\n<p>Ad Invalid Click Protector plugin is 100% translation ready. Right now it only has the English translation in it but over time with the community help I hope this plugin will have many language in it&#8217;s language directory.</p>\n<p><strong>Support the Plugin</strong></p>\n<p>If you like this plugin please don&#8217;t forget to write a review and if possible please <a href=\"https://paypal.me/acnamhq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Donate some amount</a> to keep the plugin and it&#8217;s development alive.</p>\n",

But unfortunately it is not humanly possible for me to check every single plugin of such out there or contact each plugin developer. Here I&#8217;m showing you how to incorporate the <strong>Ad Invalid Click Protector (AICP)</strong> plugin with your website&#8217;s ad code, so that both other plugin developers and normal users who use custom codes to show up their ads can take advantage of this.</p>\n<p>To use the Ad Invalid Click Protector plugin with your ad code you basically have to do 2 simple things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Put a <code>if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { /* return your ad code here */ }</code> block before returning your ad code to the front end</li>\n<li>Wrap your ad code within a simple <code>div</code> tag like this <code>&lt;div class=\"aicp\"&gt;...your ad code goes here...&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Personally I create various WordPress shortcodes for various ad units that I use on my personal website. It is extremely easy to create shortcodes for your ad units while taking the advantage of Ad Invalid Click Protector Plugin. Let me show you how to create a WordPress shortcode very easily.</p>\n<p>To create a shortcode the first thing you need to do is, go to the <code>functions.php</code> file of your theme or your child theme and at the end of your file put any of the following code.</p>\n<p>If you are using a PHP version &lt; 5.3, you can create a shortcode in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>add_shortcode( 'your_shortcode_name', 'your_shortcode_function_name' );\nfunction your_shortcode_function_name() {\n    if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { // This part will show ads to your non-banned visitors\n        $adCode = '&lt;div class=\"aicp\"&gt;&lt;!-- Don\\'t forget to add this div with aicp class --&gt;\n        &lt;script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Responsive Ad Code --&gt;\n        &lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n             style=\"display:block\"\n             data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1234567890\"\n             data-ad-slot=\"0987654321\"\n             data-ad-format=\"auto\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end of the aicp div --&gt;';\n        return $adCode;\n    } else { // Anything within this part will be shown to your banned visitors or to the blocked country visitors\n        return '&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;You have been blocked from seeing ads.&lt;/div&gt;';\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you are using PHP version &gt;= 5.3, you don&#8217;t need to give a function name, instead you can take advantage of of anonymous function like this way:</p>\n<pre><code>add_shortcode( 'your_shortcode_name', function() {\n    if( aicp_can_see_ads() ) { // This part will show ads to your non-banned visitors\n        $adCode = '&lt;div class=\"aicp\"&gt;&lt;!-- Don\\'t forget to add this div with aicp class --&gt;\n        &lt;script async src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;!-- Responsive Ad Code --&gt;\n        &lt;ins class=\"adsbygoogle\"\n             style=\"display:block\"\n             data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1234567890\"\n             data-ad-slot=\"0987654321\"\n             data-ad-format=\"auto\"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end of the aicp div --&gt;';\n        return $adCode;\n    } else { // Anything within this part will be shown to your banned visitors or to the blocked country visitors\n        return '&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;You have been blocked from seeing ads.&lt;/div&gt;';\n    }\n} );\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> if you want, you can completely ignore the <code>else {}</code> block above in case you don&#8217;t wanna show anything special to the blocked visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I know what PHP version I am using?</strong></p>\n<p>You can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-server-stats/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Server Stats</a> plugin in your website which will show you many important information about your hosting environment including what PHP version you are currently using.</p>\n<p><strong>Can this plugin be used with other ad medias?</strong></p>\n<p>No It is not. This plugin will only work with Ad ads or any ad media that shows iframe based ads. Recently Google has tweaked there ad code which makes merely impossible to support both iframe based ads like Ad and non-iframe based ads, like affiliate ads.<br />\nIn case of affiliate ads, there is generally no click bombing issue, that is why from v1.1.0, AICP will only support iframe based ads and not general affiliate ads. Sorry guys! In case you want to use AICP just for affiliate ads, I will recommend you to download v1.0.6 of the plugin from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ad-invalid-click-protector/developers/\" rel=\"ugc\">old archive</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Will it help me from stop clicking on my own ads?</strong></p>\n<p>No, you are not supposed to click on your own ads. If you want you can use adblock in your browser to save yourself from accidental clicking on your own ads.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong></p>\n<p>Ad Invalid Click Protector plugin is 100% translation ready. Right now it only has the English translation in it but over time with the community help I hope this plugin will have many language in it&#8217;s language directory.</p>\n<p><strong>Support the Plugin</strong></p>\n<p>If you like this plugin please don&#8217;t forget to write a review and if possible please <a href=\"https://paypal.me/acnamhq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Donate some amount</a> to keep the plugin and it&#8217;s development alive.</p>\n",
