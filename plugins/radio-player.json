You can do this by navigating to the Radio Player page on your WordPress dashboard and clicking the Add New button. Here, you can enter the player details, such as the name, audio source, and player skin.</p>\n<p><strong>💻 Display the Player</strong><br />\nAfter adding a new player, you can display it on your website in various ways. The simplest way is to use the [radio_player id=&#8221;player_id&#8221;] shortcode, where player_id is the ID of the player you want to display. You can also display the player on any page or post by using the Radio Player Gutenberg block or Elementor widget.</p>\n<p><strong>📌 Display the Sticky Player</strong><br />\nTo display the sticky player, you first need to select the player that you want to use as the sticky player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; Sticky Player Settings page. Here, you can also choose to display the sticky player only on specific pages by excluding them from the settings.</p>\n<p><strong>🌐 Play HTTP Streams</strong><br />\nIf you want to play HTTP streams on your website, you need to enable the HTTP player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; HTTP Player Settings page. Here, you can also specify the HTTP player buffer size and other settings.</p>\n<p>By following these simple steps, you can easily add and display a radio player on your WordPress website using the Radio Player plugin.</p>\n<h3>🔀  Radio Player Proxy Add-on</h3>\n<p>Recent updates in modern browsers have introduced stringent rules against mixed content.<br />\nAs a result, if a stream link isn&#8217;t SSL-encrypted but your website is, it won&#8217;t play. Therefore, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure your stream links are SSL-secured.</p>\n<p><strong>Play HTTP Streams</strong> &#8211; HTTP Stream Player &#8211; Addon facilitates the playback of HTTP (non-SSL) radio streams on HTTPS-enabled websites. Serving as a bridge, it retrieves the radio stream and delivers it to the player as an HTTPS stream.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix Metadata Display</strong> &#8211; If your website server struggles to retrieve stream data including current track title, artist, artwork and recent play history, the plugin can display the current song title for you.</p>\n<p>🚀 <a href=\"https://softlabbd.com/radio-player-proxy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Radio Player Proxy &#8211; Addon</a></p>\n<h3>📻  Radio Players Ads Add-on</h3>\n<p>The Radio Player Ads Addon offers you the ability to monetize your radio player by allowing you to play audio advertisements and other promotional content while your users listen to the radio.</p>\n<p><strong>🎙️ Customizable Ad Formats</strong> &#8211; Play Various Ad Formats and Promos with Radio Player Ads Addon.</p>\n<p><strong>💰 Boost Your Revenue</strong> &#8211; Monetize Your Radio Player with Radio Player Ads.</p>\n<p><strong>📈 Simplify Ad Management</strong> &#8211; Manage Your Radio Player Ads with Ease using Radio Player Ads Add-on.</p>\n<p><strong>📊 Analytics Reporting</strong> &#8211; Get Detailed Analytics and Reports for Your Radio Player Ads with Radio Player Ads Add-on</p>\n<p>🚀 <a href=\"https://softlabbd.com/radio-player-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Ads Player &#8211; Addon</a></p>\n<h3>✅  Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The Radio Player plugin is a versatile and standalone solution for your WordPress website.

These include ShoutCast, IceCast, Radionomy, Airtime, Live365, and radio.co, among others.</p>\n<h3>📝 Notes:</h3>\n<p>🚫 Autoplay Disabled<br />\nKindly be aware that browsers have disabled the autoplay feature, making it impossible to control. Consequently, the radio player will not commence playback automatically upon the user&#8217;s visit to the webpage.

Why isn&#8217;t the stream metadata  (like current track title, artist, and artwork)  appearing in the player?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the stream metadata isn&#8217;t appearing in the player, several factors might be responsible. Below are potential causes and troubleshooting steps:</p>\n<p><strong>Presence of Metadata:</strong> First, ascertain if the stream even has metadata. If it doesn&#8217;t, the player can&#8217;t display details like the current song title.</p>\n<p><strong>Player Configuration:</strong> Ensure the &#8220;Show Track Title&#8221; option is activated within the player controls settings. This ensures that any available metadata gets displayed.</p>\n<p><strong>Server Configuration &#8211; allow_url_fopen:</strong> The allow_url_fopen setting on the server must be enabled for the player to fetch the metadata from the stream. If you&#8217;re unsure about this setting, contact your web hosting provider. If you possess server access rights, you might be able to modify this setting yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Metadata Proxy Settings:</strong> If after the above steps the metadata remains undisplayed, consider activating the Metadata Proxy settings. This can typically be found under the HTTP player settings tab within the plugin settings page.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Assistance:</strong> Have you followed all the provided steps but still encounter issues?

You can do this by navigating to the Radio Player page on your WordPress dashboard and clicking the Add New button. Here, you can enter the player details, such as the name, audio source, and player skin.</p>\n<p><strong>💻 Display the Player</strong><br />\nAfter adding a new player, you can display it on your website in various ways. The simplest way is to use the [radio_player id=&#8221;player_id&#8221;] shortcode, where player_id is the ID of the player you want to display. You can also display the player on any page or post by using the Radio Player Gutenberg block or Elementor widget.</p>\n<p><strong>📌 Display the Sticky Player</strong><br />\nTo display the sticky player, you first need to select the player that you want to use as the sticky player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; Sticky Player Settings page. Here, you can also choose to display the sticky player only on specific pages by excluding them from the settings.</p>\n<p><strong>🌐 Play HTTP Streams</strong><br />\nIf you want to play HTTP streams on your website, you need to enable the HTTP player from the Radio Player &gt; Settings &gt; HTTP Player Settings page. Here, you can also specify the HTTP player buffer size and other settings.</p>\n<p>By following these simple steps, you can easily add and display a radio player on your WordPress website using the Radio Player plugin.</p>\n<h3>🔀  Radio Player Proxy Add-on</h3>\n<p>Recent updates in modern browsers have introduced stringent rules against mixed content.<br />\nAs a result, if a stream link isn&#8217;t SSL-encrypted but your website is, it won&#8217;t play. Therefore, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure your stream links are SSL-secured.</p>\n<p><strong>Play HTTP Streams</strong> &#8211; HTTP Stream Player &#8211; Addon facilitates the playback of HTTP (non-SSL) radio streams on HTTPS-enabled websites. Serving as a bridge, it retrieves the radio stream and delivers it to the player as an HTTPS stream.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix Metadata Display</strong> &#8211; If your website server struggles to retrieve stream data including current track title, artist, artwork and recent play history, the plugin can display the current song title for you.</p>\n<p>🚀 <a href=\"https://softlabbd.com/radio-player-proxy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Radio Player Proxy &#8211; Addon</a></p>\n<h3>📻  Radio Players Ads Add-on</h3>\n<p>The Radio Player Ads Addon offers you the ability to monetize your radio player by allowing you to play audio advertisements and other promotional content while your users listen to the radio.</p>\n<p><strong>🎙️ Customizable Ad Formats</strong> &#8211; Play Various Ad Formats and Promos with Radio Player Ads Addon.</p>\n<p><strong>💰 Boost Your Revenue</strong> &#8211; Monetize Your Radio Player with Radio Player Ads.</p>\n<p><strong>📈 Simplify Ad Management</strong> &#8211; Manage Your Radio Player Ads with Ease using Radio Player Ads Add-on.</p>\n<p><strong>📊 Analytics Reporting</strong> &#8211; Get Detailed Analytics and Reports for Your Radio Player Ads with Radio Player Ads Add-on</p>\n<p>🚀 <a href=\"https://softlabbd.com/radio-player-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Ads Player &#8211; Addon</a></p>\n<h3>✅  Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The Radio Player plugin is a versatile and standalone solution for your WordPress website.

These include ShoutCast, IceCast, Radionomy, Airtime, Live365, and radio.co, among others.</p>\n<h3>📝 Notes:</h3>\n<p>🚫 Autoplay Disabled<br />\nKindly be aware that browsers have disabled the autoplay feature, making it impossible to control. Consequently, the radio player will not commence playback automatically upon the user&#8217;s visit to the webpage.
