I&#8217;ve decided to write my own one&#8230; as usual.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much the plugins&#8217; cost ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s as you whish. That&#8217;s a donationware. So If you want to give only 1$<br />\nor event nothing you can. But don&#8217;t impose any limits on yourself, if you<br />\nwant to give me a lot of money, just do it ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the limitation of the free version</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no free version so there&#8217;s no limitation. Perhaps I&#8217;ll change that<br />\nin the future. But for the moment, I can&#8217;t maintain seriously this plugins. But<br />\nif you like the plugins and think I deserver to be paid for it, you have a<br />\ndonate button on the plugin&#8217;s mainpage.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
