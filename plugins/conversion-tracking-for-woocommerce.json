        "installation": "<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from Plugins page.</p>\n<p>There is currently no configuration of this plugin, but to confirm it&#8217;s working you can view the source of the cart, checkout, and order confirmation page and look for a global variable called WCPAYLOAD on the page. If you find it, it&#8217;s working.</p>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce 2.0</li>\n<li>PHP version 5.3 or greater</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Does it work with WooCommerce 2 and WooCommerce 3?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there are compatibility code written which detects what&#8217;s available and then does the right thing. Testing with WooCommerce 2 has not been extensive so if you find issues, please contact us and report any bugs. We like to be responsive.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I installed it but it doesn&#8217;t seem to do anything?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t do anything on its own; it simply updates your page state so that a global variable <code>WCPAYLOAD</code> is set to the current cart state, or order confirmation state. You need to then connect this to your preferred analytics package to add the events as you wish.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Would you add a feature which does X?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, probably. If you don&#8217;t ask you don&#8217;t get.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I notice you don&#8217;t have any advertising or anything, what&#8217;s that about?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No one actually asks this question, but I found the other plugins out there which have advertising and &#8220;Pro&#8221; upgrade plans to be annoying. So I wrote this. Enjoy.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
