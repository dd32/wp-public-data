There is no options, settings at all, just activate it and it just works! There is no need to install any app on your smartphone, because it is using your email address as the &#8220;two factor authentication&#8221; process.</p>\n<p>When this plugin is activated, every user will get a new email at the login process, which will have a secure token, that needs to be added as a second layer of your secure login. The email will be sent to the user, who wants to log in. This is that easy.</p>\n<p>The email is the second factor and you don&#8217;t need any authenticator app for your phone.
