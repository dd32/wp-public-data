If so, save them again and click the &#8216;authenticate with Fitbit&#8217; link again. They should appear soon after.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='feedback%20and%20bugs'>\nFeedback and bugs\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please either contact me via albinofruit.com/contact if you have any questions and wish to get in touch ASAP.
