        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20carbon%20offsetting%3F'>\nWhat is carbon offsetting?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Carbon offsetting involves calculating the amount of carbon emissions generated by a particular activity (such as manufacturing a pair of shoes) and then purchasing carbon credits that pay for avoiding or removing the same amount of carbon elsewhere in the environment. Because emissions move through the atmosphere, removing an equivalent amount of emissions elsewhere in the environment has the same net impact as if your emissions didn`t occur. Buying carbon credits that reduce or eliminate greenhouse gases also creates a market that stimulates the creation of additional carbon-removal projects.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20carbon%20credit%3F'>\nWhat is a carbon credit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A carbon credit is an instrument representing the reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions. Also referred to as carbon offsets, these instruments are used to compensate for an equal amount of carbon emissions elsewhere. Carbon offset projects are verified by third parties to ensure that they reduce, avoid, or sequester the amount of carbon that they claim.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20it%20mean%20for%20a%20product%20to%20be%20carbon%20neutral%3F'>\nWhat does it mean for a product to be carbon neutral?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A product becomes carbon neutral when the emissions of the product`s manufacturing and distribution are calculated and compensated for via carbon offsetting projects. Offsetting carbon emissions, in addition to avoidance and reduction, is an important step in climate action.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20calculate%20product%20emissions%3F'>\nHow does the plugin calculate product emissions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By harnessing the data and insight developed by leading research institutions, CURBON is able to calculate the emissions generated by the products and services of over 1000 product categories. CURBON calculates carbon emissions and corresponding offsets on a per-store basis, using inputs tailored to the type of activity the merchant undertakes. For complex use cases, CURBON’s carbon emissions team can work with you to determine the best approach.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%20for%20merchants%20and%20for%20customers%3F'>\nHow much does it cost for merchants and for customers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CURBON’s e-commerce offsetting service is free to use for merchants. The cost to your customers is between 1.8% and 6% of their cart total, depending on the products being purchased.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20currencies%20does%20climate%20friendly%20cart%20support%3F'>\nWhat currencies does Climate Friendly Cart Support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We currently support charging in ZAR</p>\n</p>\n\n",
