This token is required before any security scans can be performed.  Once you have your token, it can be added to the Plugin Security Scanner settings page.</p>\n<p>You can also register a webhook for notifications.

However, any commercial usage will require that you purchase a commercial license from WPScan. If you are using the API for your own site then you will not need a commercial license. However, if you are a hosting company and install the plugin systematically across all of your clients sites, then you will need to purchase a commercial license. If you are making heavy use of the API, it is likely that you will need to purchase a commercial license.
