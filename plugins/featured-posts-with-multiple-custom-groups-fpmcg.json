So one single plugin will help you create multiple featured posts sections with different posts which can be completely configured by the admin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I place one post under several featured post groups?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. A single post can be defined under as many featured posts groups as the admin wants.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow many featured posts groups can be displayed in a single widget\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As many featured posts groups can be placed in a single widget. Hence a widget can display posts under a single featured posts group or multiple groups.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nAre there any configurable options for the widgets\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The widgets are highly customizable. From the title of the widget to adding HTML tags before and after every posts and each of its details, you can completely control the look of the widgets. Also you can add custom widget specific CSS.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
