This page will show you latest errors for IMAP/POP3 connection for each group and also any email sending errors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20my%20own%20customised%20messages%20to%20send%20to%20prospective%20subscribers%3F'>\nCan I create my own customised messages to send to prospective subscribers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can: go to Mailing Group Manager &gt; General Settings, and select the Custom Messages tab. There you can input your custom message (using the listed variables, if you are technical!).<br />\nYou can also go to Mailing Group Manager &gt; Subscription Requests, and click the message icon next to a subscription request. This opens up a popup window where you can type in a custom message, and check the box at the bottom that allows you to save it for repeated use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20do%20not%20have%20access%20to%20cron%20scripts%20on%20my%20shared%20server.%20can%20i%20still%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nI do not have access to cron scripts on my shared server. Can I still use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not have cron access, then you will have to rely on visitors to your site to trigger the in-built WP-cron, which checks for new messages and distributes them to the list of subscribers. For example, if you have a visitor on average every 10 minutes, then the Mailing Group messages will be received and sent every 10 minutes. If you have Cron access, you can set a higher frequency of 2 minutes to keep the Mailing Group updated more often (see Installation instructions above), but without cron access, it may just run more slowly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='in%20my%20plain%20text%20emails%2C%20there%20are%20not%20line%20breaks%2C%20all%20text%20is%20on%20one%20line%2C%20what%20to%20do%3F'>\nIn my plain text emails, there are not line breaks, all text is on one line, what to do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When some subscribers use HTML email format and some use plain text email format, the line breaks in emails do not appear correctly, to fix this you can install a plugin which converts all emails to HTML format, Read the instructions at https://www.wpmailinggroup.com/faq/strange-characters-in-emails/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20getting%20strange%20characters%20and%20html%20tags%20in%20emails%2C%20sometimes%20no%20line%20breaks%20how%20to%20fix%20that%3F'>\nI am getting strange characters and HTML tags in emails, sometimes no line breaks how to fix that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Read the instructions at https://www.wpmailinggroup.com/faq/strange-characters-in-emails/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
