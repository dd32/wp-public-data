Guest and anonymous users will still be able to pay using other payment methods such as credit card.</p>\n<h4>Understanding the Fake COD Problem in E-Commerce</h4>\n<p>Cash on Delivery (COD) is a popular payment method for online shoppers who prefer to pay for their purchases upon delivery. While COD offers convenience and builds trust with customers, it also presents a significant challenge for e-commerce businesses: fake COD orders.</p>\n<h4>What Are Fake COD Orders?</h4>\n<p>Fake COD orders are placed with the intent to harm the business rather than to acquire goods. These orders are often submitted using fictitious addresses and details. The aim is to create logistical challenges, disrupt operations, or waste resources. Such orders can lead to significant losses for e-commerce businesses due to incurred shipping costs, handling expenses, and operational inefficiencies.</p>\n<h4>Why Is This a Problem?</h4>\n<p>Financial Loss: Businesses bear the cost of shipping and handling, which can be significant, especially if the order is large or involves high-value items.</p>\n<p>Operational Disruption: Processing fake COD orders wastes time and resources, as staff must handle cancellations, returns, and customer service issues related to these fraudulent transactions.</p>\n<p>Inventory Management: Fake orders can disrupt inventory levels, leading to stock discrepancies and potential delays in fulfilling genuine customer orders.</p>\n<p>Customer Experience: Handling fake COD orders can slow down the overall order processing, negatively affecting the experience of legitimate customers.</p>\n<p>By requiring users to log in before selecting COD, you reduce the risk of fraudulent orders and improve overall transaction reliability. Easy to install and requires no configuration, this plugin provides a straightforward solution for managing COD payment options in your WooCommerce store.</p>\n<h4>Privacy notices</h4>\n<p>This plugin, in itself, does not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>track users;</li>\n<li>write any user personal data to the database;</li>\n<li>send any data to external servers;</li>\n<li>make use of cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n",
