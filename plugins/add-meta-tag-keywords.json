        "faq": "<p>1.What is SEO?</p>\n<p>Answer: SEO, or search engine optimization, is the process of optimizing websites so that they rank well on search engines through organic (non-paid) searches.</p>\n<p>2.Is this a complete SEO solution plugin?</p>\n<p>Answer: No, this plugin does not give you all the options for extensive SEO of your posts or pages. the main purpose of this plugin is to be used in addition to those plugins which do not give the option to add &#8216;meta name=&#8221;keywords&#8221;&#8216; option to be added in the head tag.For example: Yoast SEO plugin doesn&#8217;t give the option for meta keywords, so this plugin can be installed along side Yoast and you can then add keywords as well.</p>\n<p>3.What are keywords for SEO?</p>\n<p>Answer: Keywords are ideas and topics that define what your content is about. In terms of SEO, they&#8217;re the words and phrases that searchers enter into search engines, also called &#8220;search queries&#8221;, and get relevant results.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are Metadata Keywords required for SEO?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Answer: Adding Metadata Keywords is good and standard practice. Although some may argue that it is irrelevant, it definitely isn&#8217;t something that is totally ignored by search engines. A good Search Engine Optimization service will always include the metadata keywords in the head tag.</p>\n"
