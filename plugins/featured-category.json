I imagined that there would be at minimum a plugin for posting news items that I could modify. I settled with using The_Loop. At the time I made a mental note &#8220;I need to turn this into a plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Which brings us to Featured Category, my first WordPress Plugin. (Be gentle!)</p>\n<p>I tried to follow the WordPress API as closely as possible.</p>\n<p>Once you activate the plugin, simply load its settings page and choose the category, the title or &#8220;heading&#8221; and the number of posts you wish to display.</p>\n<p>If the style is not to your liking, the CSS in the plugin admin page.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t my changes showing up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably browser or plugin caching. If you have a caching plugin enabled, ensure you delete the cached version and refresh again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize the style?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Modify style sheet in admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can feature x be added?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe!
