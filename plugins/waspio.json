Error details include a full stacktrace (the functions and files through which the error was generated), the code surrounding the file and line where the error was generated, information on the browser, operating system, and other information relating to the visitor generating the error.  If the &#8220;track users&#8221; option is enabled in the Wasp settings page, the user ID, user name, and email of currently logged in users generating the error will also be sent to the Wasp API.</p>\n<p>If the option to track javascript or ajax errors is enabled, this plugin automatically includes wasp.js and wasp.ajax.js from Wasp servers on your website.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Where do I get a Wasp API key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have a Wasp.io account, and have created a project, navigate to the project settings, and your API key will be shown there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I use Wasp?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Errors slow down, and can take down your websites, and often the only notification you get is from a panicking client, or a visitor nice enough to let you know; Wasp.io automatically overrides the default error handling of your WordPress (or other) sites, and sends those errors (including fatal errors) to the WaspAPI for grouping, filtering, and notification in realtime.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where does the data go?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Error details are sent to the Wasp API (all things Waspside are SSL only for security) for filtering, notification, and management through your user account.  Since debugging is already a task, Wasp sends as much information as possible including full stacktrace information, browser information, the code where an error was generated, and user email, user name, and user ID of logged in users (if the option to track users is enabled from the settings page).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens after the 14 day trial period expires?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If after using Wasp, if you aren&#8217;t inclined to pay for a subscription after the 14 day trial period expires, you&#8217;ll still have full access to your Wasp account and any projects you&#8217;ve been added to by owners of other accounts.  API requests for projects associated with expired accounts are just rejected.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
