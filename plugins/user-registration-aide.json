Click on the register link to see the registration form and your new extra fields.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Any Known Installation Issues?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, with W3 Total Cache activated there will be errors thrown when creating the new template pages. It will say post_permalink is deprecated if you have error reporting on, and apparently will prevent activation on some sites from my understanding. I have no idea when they will fix that and there is nothing we can do at this point in time, others have addressed this issue on their support page but they are still using deprecated code and generating errors. What you can do to work around this is before activating User Registration Aide, deactivate W3 Total Cache and activate USer Registration Aide and then reactivate W3 Total Cache.</p>\n<p>For the Email Verification and other functions to work properly you must have the Permalink Structure set to Post Name, otherwise you will get Error 404 Page Not Found Errors!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
