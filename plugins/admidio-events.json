The number of upcoming events shown is configurable. Also the Widget provides a collapsed (event name, optional: date) or expanded (all event data) view which can be toggled between. The data from Admidio to WordPress is transferred via RSS.</p>\n<p>Please note that the free icon font <a href=\"http://genericons.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Genericons</a> has to be available with your WordPress installation.

But there is a strange box showing up in the upper right of the Widget. What&#8217;s that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Very likely this is because the free icon font <a href=\"http://genericons.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Genericons</a> is missing. This font has to be available with your WordPress installation. Either by using a theme that includes <em>Genericons</em> out of the box (for example <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen/\" rel=\"ugc\">Twenty Thirteen</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen/\" rel=\"ugc\">Twenty Fourteen</a>) or by using a Plugin that adds <em>Genericons</em> to your theme (for example <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/genericond/\" rel=\"ugc\">Genericon&#8217;d</a>).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I cannot toggle between views. If I click on the Widget title, nothing happens.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is because some themes use css class names that are different from WordPress standard. Unfortunately it cannot get fixed easily. Instead please try one of the most popular themes that have been tested with <em>Admidio Events</em>: Customizr 3.1.17, Twenty Thirteen 1.2, Twenty Fourteen 1.1 worked out of the box. Eighties 1.1.0, Los 1.1.0, Oxygen 0.5.4, Twenty Ten 1.6, Twenty Eleven 1.8, Twenty Twelve 1.4 worked after installation of Plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/genericond/\" rel=\"ugc\">Genericon&#8217;d</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I need a membership management system for my club. Where can I find more information about Admidio?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find an English page about <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/admidio/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Admidio on SourceForge</a>. Or use the <a href=\"http://admidio.de/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">German home page of Admidio</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a possibility to play around with Admidio without installing it before?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are Admidio demo servers available. Here you can check, if Admidio&#8217;s features fit to your needs. You can choose between an <a href=\"http://www.admidio.org/demo_en/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">English Admidio demo server</a> or a <a href=\"http://demo.admidio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">German Admidio demo server</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The Widget doesn&#8217;t display event data but a message. What does it mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Error when fetching event data.</strong><br />\nThis message shows up if the URL to the file <code>rss_dates.php</code> doesn&#8217;t work. Perhaps caused by a typo, because the Admidio server is down or simply because you are offline.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No event data available.</strong><br />\nEverything is fine, just Admidio doesn&#8217;t provide any event data. Most likely because no events have been scheduled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Invalid event data.</strong><br />\nThe Widget wasn&#8217;t able to detect the event date. Typically caused by different settings for date format in Admidio and Admidio Events. Or by an RSS feed with wrong content.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>What will happen if I don&#8217;t set the time format in Admidio as suggested (H:i or h:i)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The worst thing that could happen if you choose a different time format, is a wrong order for events on the same day. Normally the Widget shows the upcoming events in chronological order. The next event will be on top of the list. For most of the events only the event date is important for sorting. But if there is more than one event on the same day, the event time is used to put the events in correct order. If the time cannot be detected due to an unknown time format, Admidio uses <em>00:00</em> as the event time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I see Admidio Events in action?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Widget is used on the <a href=\"http://fechten-in-waldkirch.de/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">homepage of my sports club</a>. This page is in German but I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find the Widget anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which languages are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Admidio can be installed in five different languages: Danish, Dutch, English, French, German and Italian. Admidio Events is currently available in English and German. If you like to help with the translation to another language, please <a href=\"http://fechten-in-waldkirch.de/kontakt/webmaster-english/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">send me a note</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
