See the FAQ for more information on usage.</li>\n<li>Note that some of the icons in the packs were created and added for this widget by myself. Not all of the requested social media sites were included so I attempted to create icons that mimicked the original artist icons. These are unattributed to myself.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20include%20localization%3F'>\nHow can I include Localization?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to include translating the Social Media widget is to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/\" rel=\"ugc\">qTranslate</a> Plugin then using the following (example) code in the &#8220;Widget Title&#8221; and &#8220;Image Caption&#8221; text fields:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!--:nl--&gt;Volg ons&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;!--:en--&gt;Follow us&lt;!--:--&gt;&lt;!--:fr--&gt;Suivre nous&lt;!--:--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use the README.txt for that plugin for more usage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20my%20own%20custom%20icon%20pack%3F'>\nHow can I use my own custom icon pack?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a folder on the filesystem that is publicly accessible via the interwebs. I suggest putting it in your wp-content folder and name it &#8216;icons&#8217;<br />\n1.1. Your icons MUST be named the same as mine (facebook.png, twitter.png, pinterest.png, etc&#8230;) for this functionality to work! Navigate to the social-media-widget directory and view the files if you&#8217;re not sure how they&#8217;re named.</li>\n<li>Upload your icons into that folder. It&#8217;ll probably be a good idea if they are all the same size.</li>\n<li>Go to the Widget Control Panel (Admin -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Widgets)</li>\n<li>Select &#8220;Custom Icons&#8221; as the Icon Pack</li>\n<li>Enter the URL to the icon pack folder (http://www.yoursite.com/blog/wp-content/icons)</li>\n<li>Enter the FULL PATH to the icon pack folder (/var/www/html/yoursite/blog/wp-content/icons)</li>\n<li>Click Save</li>\n<li>Check out your site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your custom icon pack should be there and should be safe from upgrades.</p>\n<p>NOTE: IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE SAFE FROM UPGRADES, DO NOT UPLOAD THE ICONS INTO THE SOCIAL-MEDIA-WIDGET FOLDER! During upgrades, this folder is completely deleted, thus, you lose all of the icons.</p>\n<p>You can also upload the icons individually through WordPress. These will be uploaded to your /wp-content/uploads/year/month/ folder by default. Use this as a starting point for your custom icon pack URL and Path</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t understand what it means to create a folder and upload to that folder on the filesystem, or if you don&#8217;t know what a path to a folder is, I would suggest sticking with one of the four default icon packs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20add%20%5Binsert%20social%20media%20service%5D%20support'>\nCan you add [insert social media service] support\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes I can. Please leave a comment in the WordPress.org forums tagging my plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20the%20animations%20working%20in%20internet%20explorer%206%2B'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t the animations working in Internet Explorer 6+\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The only animation supported by Internet Explorer is Scale, and that only works reliably with Internet Explorer 8. Scale is also included in Combo. No other animations will work. This is because I do not want to use Javascript to animate my icons. All of these animations are using CSS3 styles. The animations work the best with Webkit based browsers such as Chrome and Safari, or Firefox 4. Firefox 3.x is fully supported, without CSS3 transition animations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20my%20icons%20aligning%3F'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t my icons aligning?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check your style.css file. I&#8217;m sure you have something in there that is forcing alignment of your widgets. You&#8217;ll have to modify that. If you don&#8217;t know how to do CSS&#8230; Learn.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20find%20my%20%7Binsert%20social%20media%20service%7D%20profile%20link%21%20what%20is%20it%3F'>\nI can&#8217;t find my {insert social media service} profile link! What is it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While I attempt to provide you with the most logical guide to start with as default values in the control panel (e.g. http://www.twitter.com/yourname where you just replace yourname), not all of these services follow the same profile links that I provided. In some cases, you need to customize your &#8220;public link&#8221; such as in Yelp, and LinkedIn to use the default urls that I provide. If you don&#8217;t know your public profile, I will have a very hard time figuring it out for you. The easiest way to figure it out is to log in to your social media site, and find a button that says, &#8220;View Profile.&#8221; This is more often than not the profile URL you should input. This is the method I used in adding the default URLs. Also note that I don&#8217;t use all of these social media sites. I just created accounts quickly to find a likely default URL. They could be wrong.</p>\n<p>Getting your iTunes Ping account information is slightly more difficult. You need to load up your Ping profile within iTunes then right click on your name and select &#8220;Copy Link.&#8221; Input this into the iTunes Ping option in the Social Media Widget. When the user clicks it, it will prompt the user to open up iTunes. This will then take them directly to your iTunes Ping account in iTunes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20icons%20aren%27t%20showing%20up%20-%20they%20are%20just%20showing%20the%20alt%20text%21'>\nThe icons aren&#8217;t showing up &#8211; They are just showing the alt text!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is probably a compatibility issue with another plugin. These things happen. Because there are thousands of plugins from thousands of developers, all who develop in completely different ways, there are going to be issues that arise from time-to-time. These are more prevalent, however, from plugins that make system-wide changes (such as SEO Packs). Try disabling, one at a time, the other plugins until you find that one that is breaking my widget. Then e-mail me and tell me which plugin it was. I will then try to fix it. Unless I know what plugin is breaking it, I won&#8217;t be able to fix it, ya see? There have also been issues with moved wp-content folders or custom WP_CONTENT_URL&#8217;s that caused the images to break. This issue has been resolved since 2.3.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='something%20else%20isn%27t%20right%21'>\nSomething else isn&#8217;t right!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First &#8211; calm down. I&#8217;m happy to help you, and, if you ask those I&#8217;ve helped already, I don&#8217;t mind providing individual service to people to get my widget working and looking right with your theme. If your theme is especially jacked up, I do do freelance work and would be happy to fix your entire theme for a fee. But back to the point, if something isn&#8217;t working quite right on your site, INCLUDE A LINK. I can&#8217;t help you with your site unless there is a link so I can see what&#8217;s going on. Make sure my widget is enabled too. It gets old getting asked, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t it look right on my site&#8221; and then finding that the comment-leaver left no link and if they did, my widget isn&#8217;t even enabled on their site anymore.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Didn&#8217;t delete this code and it borked the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed filter: alpha(opacity=x); from both the CSS and inline style (create initial transparency and hover to 100% opacity). This stops Internet Explorer from using opacity, but it also doesn&#8217;t make the icons look terrible. If you have a problem with this, take it up with Microsoft. I&#8217;m not paid enough to hack around a crappy browser that can easily support png transparencies with little-to-no effort by the developers. All other browsers are unaffected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ability to add rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; to icon links</li>\n<li>Added a Donate button due to the massive time commitment of this plugin. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated readme.txt to improve visibility and adding screenshots</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Trying something else to fix the issues with 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As expected, changes in 1.2.2 broke some peoples&#8217; stuff. Made a couple CSS changes to see if this fixes it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of you were complaining about it breaking your theme because I wasn&#8217;t using the default arguments to wrap the widget. I decided to give it a try. I&#8217;m sure this is going to break more than it&#8217;s going to fix, but I&#8217;m doing it &#8220;properly&#8221; now. Note: You&#8217;re going to have to do a lot more CSS hacks to get it to look right in some themes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with Orkut icon staying on even if the field is blank. Fixed an issue with 32 pixel default icons appearing as 64 pixels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with RSS URL being reset after save in the widget control panel (did not affect functionality, but caused confusion)</li>\n<li>Added support for Orkut</li>\n<li>Added Cutout icon pack</li>\n<li>Changed default image alt and title tags to Widget title (i.e. if widget title is Follow Me, Facebook alt/title tags are &#8220;Follow Me on Facebook.&#8221; If it is Follow Us, alt/title is &#8220;Follow Us on Facebook)</li>\n<li>Cleaned up image location code from the WP_CONTENT_URL to the WP_PLUGIN_URL function to attempt to correct some file location issues with Windows servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with LinkedIn icons not appearing</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with some users plugin.php breaking at line 339.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for LinkedIn</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for varying sizes, added 2 new icon packages, added support for varying opacities.</li>\n</ul>\n"
