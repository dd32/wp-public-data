        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this plugin actively maintained?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is. Nothing new is added, but bugs will be fixed. All new functionality goes into <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tietools-automatic-maintenance-kit/\" title=\"TIEtools\" rel=\"ugc\">TIEtools</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it find duplicated post content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it just checks titles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work on multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Apparently not, according to someone who tried it. It was never designed for that, so I&#8217;m not surprised.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I switch off the scheduled job?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Either deactivate the plugin or use the power setting on the options page. The power button doesn&#8217;t actually remove the scheduled job, but it makes the plugin skip all the checking functionality.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How often does the wp_cron job run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At most once per hour. You can change this in the do_TIEdupedeleter_activation function: switch the value &#8216;hourly&#8217; to whatever suits you (and will work with wp_cron).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin determine the oldest and newest copies of a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since dates can be changed through the WordPress interface, the plugin uses the post ID in the database, not the published date or anything else. Whichever copy was created first/last, that&#8217;s the oldest/newest (respectively). In SQL terms, it does a min(ID) or max(ID) check.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I include or exclude specific categories for checking?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Only duplicates where both (or all) copies are in the categories being searched will be affected. i.e. If a post in an included category has a copy in an excluded category, it won&#8217;t be removed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I chose one of the category options and now I can&#8217;t switch it off&#8230; help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The include/exclude option is a radio button, so it can&#8217;t be set to &#8220;neither&#8221;. However, you can switch off the category filter for each expiration method. Setting the categories to include (or exclude) to &#8220;0&#8221; and clicking the radio button efffectively stops all category filtering as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I enter a category number which has sub-categories, what happens?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The parent category will be taken into account and all sub-categories will be ignored. Yes, this makes entering a dozen sub-cats a long process, but it gives you much finer control over precisely what is included or excluded in the expiry process.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I get category numbers for my lists?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can go to Posts -&gt; Categories, click a category name and look at the URL, which includes a &#8220;tag_ID=xxx&#8221; part, showing the category number (xxx). Or you could install and activate the Reveal IDs plugin, which adds a column on the categories page to show the ID number of each one. Much easier. The plugin URL is https://wordpress.org/plugins/reveal-ids-for-wp-admin-25</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I include or exclude specific posts or tags?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin only handles categories at the moment.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I tell the pluging to keep specific posts and delete any other copies, rather than oldest or newest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. That&#8217;s just way too complex to do without a load of post lists and manual clicking. The plugin is designed to be easy and simple.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin cause major slowdowns when it runs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The very first time the queries run, it might. This is especially true if you have a <em>lot</em> of posts. In testing, it caused a delay of a few seconds in page serving the first time it ran. After that, I never noticed a delay again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there any documentation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;re reading it. The plugin code is also heavily commented to help you find your way and there&#8217;s the plugin&#8217;s homepage at http://www.setupmyvps.com/tiedupedeleter</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What plans do you have for the next version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a few tests which are really easy to add, the most obvious of which is duplicate post content. That would be an additional option, to allow for either/both checks. I guess the plugin could also offer the option of determining the newest and oldest post by publication date. After that, the only additions I can think of go into the area of fuzzy logic matching for similar posts rather than exact matches, which is really beyond the scope of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
