        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need to place the favicon file in the site root?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The site root directory is the best place for the favicon file.</p>\n<p>Some older browsers and most feed readers have no way of specifying<br />\nthe favicon file location in the document or feed markup. They always<br />\nattempt to retrieve it from the site&#8217;s root directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My browser finds the favicon automatically even without this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most browsers look up the favicon file in the default location<br />\nautomatically, but some do not. They need to be told where it is<br />\nlocated and this is what this plugin does.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier just to edit my theme&#8217;s header.php and add the favicon link there?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Up to you. Choose whatever way is easiest for you.</p>\n<p>If you edit the theme&#8217;s <code>header.php</code> you will need to make the same<br />\nchanges again if you later on update or change your theme. With this plugin<br />\nyou do not need to remember to do that and upgrading becomes simple.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My theme already specifies the location of the favicon?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this case you probably do not need this plugin. It might be still<br />\nbest to put the <code>favicon.ico</code> file in your site&#8217;s root directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am unsure how to create the favicon.ico file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is well documented elsewhere. A good place to start is<br />\nto understand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon\" title=\"Wikipedia article on favicon\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia article on favicon</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
