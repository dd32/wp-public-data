Such as orphan options, orphan tables, and orphan cron tasks. As you may know, not all plugins/themes care about the housekeeping of your WordPress database. As long as you are removing plugins/themes, leftovers will be accumulated in your database and will influence your website performance. The Pro version of Advanced Database Cleaner will help you remove all those leftovers and perform a deep database clean up. In the pro version you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classify options according to their &#8220;creator&#8221;. They can be either: plugins options, themes options or WP core options</li>\n<li>Detect and delete orphan options. Your &#8216;wp_options&#8217; table may be full of orphaned options and therefore can impact the performance of loading data from it, which may lead to a slow website. Clean up orphaned options is then important</li>\n<li>Classify tables according to their &#8220;creator&#8221;. They can be either: plugins tables, themes tables or WP core tables</li>\n<li>Detect and delete orphan tables. As for options, you may also have some orphaned tables that were created by plugins/themes you are not using anymore. Clean up orphaned tables will decrease the size of your database</li>\n<li>Classify all cron tasks (cron jobs) according to their &#8220;creator&#8221;. They can be either: plugins cron tasks, themes cron tasks or WP core tasks</li>\n<li>Detect and delete orphan cron jobs. After you uninstall a plugin/theme, some of its cron tasks may still be active making WordPress calling unknown functions. using the pro version, you can detect and clean orphaned tasks</li>\n<li>Search &amp; filter options, filter tables and filter cron tasks based on several criteria such as the &#8220;name&#8221;, &#8220;creator&#8221;, &#8220;value&#8221;, etc.</li>\n<li>Get premium support: we will provide quick support as well as any technical answers to help you clean up your database efficiently</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>You are welcome to contribute to the plugin translation via the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/advanced-database-cleaner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress translation website</a>.</p>\n<h4>Thanks To</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fabiofava\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Fabio Fava</a> for translating the plugin to pt_BR</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/juliobox\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Julio Potier</a> for the security remarks</li>\n</ul>\n",

We do not run any code that can break down your site or delete your posts, pages, comments, etc. However, make sure to always back up your database before any cleanup. This is not optional; it is required! It is always better to be safe than sorry!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22optimize%20my%20database%22%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;Optimize my database&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Optimizing your database will reclaim unused space in your tables, which will reduce storage space and improve efficiency when accessing tables. Optimizing the database can sometimes significantly improve performance, particularly on sites that receive a lot of traffic or have a large amount of content. Optimizing your database is absolutely safe.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20safe%20to%20clean%20the%20cron%20%28scheduled%20tasks%29%3F'>\nIs it safe to clean the cron (scheduled tasks)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A scheduled task enables plugins to execute some actions at specified times, without having to manually execute code at that time. WordPress itself uses some scheduled tasks to perform some regular actions. However, some scheduled tasks may not be removed even if the responsible plugins are deleted from your WordPress installation. As you know, not all plugins care about the housekeeping of your WordPress. Hence, deleting these unnecessary tasks may help in cleaning your site. It should be noted that cleaning scheduled tasks is safe as long as you know what tasks to clean. If you are not sure, it is better to not clean any task.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22revision%22%3F%20what%20sql%20code%20is%20used%20to%20clean%20it%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;Revision&#8221;? What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress stores a record (called &#8220;revision&#8221;) of each saved draft or published update. This system allows you to see what changes were made in each post and page over time. However, this can lead to a lot of unnecessary overhead in your WordPress database, which consumes a lot of space. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all revisions is:<br />\n    DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_type = &#8216;revision&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22auto-draft%22%3F%20what%20sql%20code%20is%20used%20to%20clean%20it%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;Auto-draft&#8221;? What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress automatically saves your post/page while you are editing it. This is called an auto-draft. If you don&#8217;t hit the publish/update button, then the post/page will be saved as auto-draft and any modification to your post/page will not be visible in your public site. Over time, you could have multiple auto-drafts that you will never publish and hence you can clean them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all auto-drafts is:<br />\n    DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_status = &#8216;auto-draft&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22pending%20comment%22%3F%20what%20sql%20code%20is%20used%20to%20clean%20it%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;Pending comment&#8221;? What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pending comments are comments published by users and which are waiting for your approval before appearing in your site. In some cases, you will have to clean all these comments.

What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is a comment that you (or a plugin) have marked as spam.

What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Trackbacks allows you to notify other websites owners that you have linked to their article on your website. These trackbacks can be used to send huge amounts of spam. Spammers use them to get their links posted on as many sites as possible. That is why they should be deactivated/cleaned if you do not use them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean trackbacks is:<br />\n    DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = &#8216;trackback&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22pingback%22%3F%20what%20sql%20code%20is%20used%20to%20clean%20it%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;pingback&#8221;? What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pingbacks allow you to notify other websites owners that you have linked to their article on your website. Pingbacks were designed to solve some of the problems that people saw with trackbacks. Although there are some minor technical differences, a trackback is basically the same things as a pingback. These pingbacks can be used to send huge amounts of spam. Spammers use them to get their links posted on as many sites as possible. That is why they should be deactivated/cleaned if you do not use them.

What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The post meta data is the information you provide to viewers about each post. This information usually includes the author of the post, when it was written (or posted), and how the author categorized that particular post. In some cases, some post meta data information becomes orphan and does not belong to any post. They are then called &#8220;orphan postmeta&#8221; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan postmeta is:<br />\n    DELETE pm FROM postmeta pm LEFT JOIN posts wp ON wp.ID = pm.post_id WHERE wp.ID IS NULL</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22orphan%20comment%20meta%22%3F%20what%20sql%20code%20is%20used%20to%20clean%20it%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;Orphan comment meta&#8221;?

This information usually includes additional data that is not stored in the users table of WordPress. In some cases, some user meta data information becomes orphaned and does not belong to any user. They are then called &#8220;orphaned usermeta&#8221; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:<br />\n    DELETE FROM usermeta WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM users)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22orphan%20term%20meta%22%3F%20what%20sql%20code%20is%20used%20to%20clean%20it%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;Orphan term meta&#8221;? What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The term meta data is the information that is provided for each taxonomy term. This information usually includes additional data that is not stored in the terms table of WordPress. In some cases, some term meta data information becomes orphaned and does not belong to any taxonomy term. They are then called &#8220;orphaned termmeta&#8221; and should be cleaned since they are not useful.

What sql code is used to clean it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes the wp_term_relationships table becomes bloated with many orphaned relationships. This happens particularly often if you’re using your site not as a blog but as some other type of content site where posts are deleted periodically. Over time, you could get thousands of term relationships for posts that no longer exist which consumes a lot of database space. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan relationships is:<br />\n    DELETE FROM term_relationships WHERE term_taxonomy_id=1 AND object_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM posts)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22expired%20transient%22%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;expired transient&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Transients are a way of storing cached data in the WordPress DB temporarily by giving it a name and a time frame after which it will expire and be deleted. This helps improve WordPress performance and speed up your website while reducing the overall server load. Expired transients are transients that are expired and still exist in the database. These ones can be safely cleaned. Transients housekeeping is now part of WordPress core, as of version 4.9, so no need to clean up them manually unless you have specific needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20multisite%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is compatible with multisite.

This is because we have renamed the pro plugin folder name from &#8220;advanced-db-cleaner&#8221; to &#8220;advanced-database-cleaner-pro&#8221;, causing the WordPress to not being able to find the old one and therefore deactivating the plugin. Just activate it again. It doesn’t break anything. Once you activate the plugin again it will continue working normally without any issues. You will also probably lose the pro version after this upgrade (This is due to a conflict between the free and pro versions which is now solved).

Indeed, your database may be full of garbage that makes your site sluggish and bloated such as old revisions, orphaned post meta, spam comments, etc. You should clean-up this unnecessary data to reduce your database size and improve website speed and performance. In addition, you will have quicker database backup since the file of your backup will be smaller.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Advanced Database Cleaner&#8217; is a must-have plugin that allows you to clean database, optimize database and more.</p>\n<h4>Main Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete old revisions of posts and pages</li>\n<li>Delete old auto drafts</li>\n<li>Delete trash posts</li>\n<li>Delete pending comments</li>\n<li>Delete spam comments</li>\n<li>Delete trash comments</li>\n<li>Delete pingbacks</li>\n<li>Delete trackbacks</li>\n<li>Delete orphan post metadata</li>\n<li>Delete orphan comment metadata</li>\n<li>Delete orphan user metadata</li>\n<li>Delete orphan term metadata</li>\n<li>Delete orphan relationships</li>\n<li>Delete expired transients</li>\n<li>Display and view orphaned information before making a database clean-up so you can be sure about what you are going to clean-up</li>\n<li>Search &amp; filter all items based on their names or values</li>\n<li>Keep last x days&#8217; data from being cleaned: clean only data older than the number of days you have specified</li>\n<li>Schedule database clean up to run automatically</li>\n<li>Create as many scheduled cleanup tasks as you need and specify what items should be cleaned by the scheduled task</li>\n<li>Scheduled tasks can be executed based on several frequencies: Once, hourly, twice a day, daily, weekly or monthly</li>\n<li>Display database tables information such as the number of rows, table size, etc.</li>\n<li>Optimize database tables (The plugin will notify you if any tables require optimization)</li>\n<li>Repair corrupted database tables or damaged ones (The plugin will notify you if any tables are corrupted or damaged)</li>\n<li>Schedule database optimization and/or reparation to run automatically and specify what tables should be optimized and/or repaired</li>\n<li>Empty database tables rows</li>\n<li>Clean and delete database tables</li>\n<li>Display options list</li>\n<li>Display options information such as option name, option value, option size, option autoload</li>\n<li>Clean and delete options</li>\n<li>Set options autoload to no / yes</li>\n<li>Display active cron tasks list (scheduled tasks) with their information such as arguments, next run, etc.</li>\n<li>Clean and delete scheduled tasks</li>\n<li>User-friendly and simple to use</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Multisite Support</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin is compatible with Multisite installations</li>\n<li>Only the main site can view, clean and optimize the whole network.

You can also specify specific sites you want to cleanup</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>By using the ADC plugin, you will</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Get an overview:</strong> The plugin will help you get an overview of what is happening in your database.

Such as orphan options, orphan tables, and orphan cron tasks. As you may know, not all plugins/themes care about the housekeeping of your WordPress database. As long as you are removing plugins/themes, leftovers will be accumulated in your database and will influence your website performance. The Pro version of Advanced Database Cleaner will help you remove all those leftovers and perform a deep database clean up. In the pro version you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classify options according to their &#8220;creator&#8221;. They can be either: plugins options, themes options or WP core options</li>\n<li>Detect and delete orphan options. Your &#8216;wp_options&#8217; table may be full of orphaned options and therefore can impact the performance of loading data from it, which may lead to a slow website. Clean up orphaned options is then important</li>\n<li>Classify tables according to their &#8220;creator&#8221;. They can be either: plugins tables, themes tables or WP core tables</li>\n<li>Detect and delete orphan tables. As for options, you may also have some orphaned tables that were created by plugins/themes you are not using anymore. Clean up orphaned tables will decrease the size of your database</li>\n<li>Classify all cron tasks (cron jobs) according to their &#8220;creator&#8221;. They can be either: plugins cron tasks, themes cron tasks or WP core tasks</li>\n<li>Detect and delete orphan cron jobs. After you uninstall a plugin/theme, some of its cron tasks may still be active making WordPress calling unknown functions. using the pro version, you can detect and clean orphaned tasks</li>\n<li>Search &amp; filter options, filter tables and filter cron tasks based on several criteria such as the &#8220;name&#8221;, &#8220;creator&#8221;, &#8220;value&#8221;, etc.</li>\n<li>Get premium support: we will provide quick support as well as any technical answers to help you clean up your database efficiently</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>You are welcome to contribute to the plugin translation via the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/advanced-database-cleaner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress translation website</a>.</p>\n<h4>Thanks To</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fabiofava\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Fabio Fava</a> for translating the plugin to pt_BR</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/juliobox\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Julio Potier</a> for the security remarks</li>\n</ul>\n",
