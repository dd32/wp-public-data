        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20upgrading%20to%20pro%20mandatory%3F'>\nIs upgrading to Pro mandatory?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at all. However, it took our company around 8 years to build the <em>Pro</em> version and we are willing to spend a lot more years of work on this software. We encourage you to evaluate the free version first, and then upgrade to Pro to unlock its potential.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20some%20functions%20are%20not%20available%20in%20the%20free%20version%3F'>\nWhy some functions are not available in the free version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are a software development company that constantly works to deliver professional tools to build up websites. We make money by selling licenses of the Pro version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20worth%20upgrading%20to%20pro%3F'>\nIs it worth upgrading to Pro?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>VikRentItems is not a one-page plugin. You can build websites worth a lot of money with this plugin. You don&#8217;t need anything else to deliver a complete website, if not a Theme and some experience with WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20vikrentitems%20with%20my%20preferred%20theme%3F'>\nCan I use VikRentItems with my preferred Theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, of course. You are free to install Vik Rent Items on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20main%20difference%20with%20vik%20rent%20car%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the main difference with Vik Rent Car?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many functions of Vik Rent Items and Vik Rent Car are pretty similar. However, the biggest difference is that with Vik Rent Items you can allow your clients to rent multiple items (for the same dates) with the same order, as well as items with multiple units. Vik Rent Car instead was mainly designed for vehicles, where, for example, only one car per order could be rented. If you need to allow a family to book multiple bycycle with one single order, maybe 2 &#8220;Mountain Bikes&#8221; and 3 &#8220;Bikes for Kids&#8221;, then Vik Rent Items will work perfectly. This is also a plugin designed for generic items, not specifically for vehicles, and so it can adjust to literally any kind of items, things or objects for rent.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
