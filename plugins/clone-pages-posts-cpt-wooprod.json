        "faq": "<p>\nQ: How do I clone a page or post?<br />\nA: In the WordPress admin interface, navigate to the list of pages, posts, or custom post types. Hover over the item you want to clone, and you&#8217;ll see a &#8220;Clone&#8221; link in the row actions. Click on this link to create a draft copy of the selected item.\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: Can I clone WooCommerce products with this plugin?<br />\nA: Yes, this plugin supports cloning of WooCommerce products. You can clone products in the same way as pages or posts.\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: What happens to the original item after cloning?<br />\nA: The original item remains unchanged. A draft copy with &#8220;(Cloned)&#8221; appended to the title is created for you to edit separately.\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: Can I customize the cloned item before saving it?<br />\nA: Yes, the cloned item is created as a draft, allowing you to make any desired modifications before publishing.\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: Are taxonomies associated with the original item copied to the cloned item?<br />\nA: Yes, taxonomies (such as categories or tags) associated with the original item will also be copied to the cloned item.\n</p>\n<p>\nQ: Is there a limit to the number of items I can clone?<br />\nA: There&#8217;s no inherent limit imposed by the plugin. However, server resources and WordPress settings may impose practical limits.</p>\n",
