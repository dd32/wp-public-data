You need an account. Follow the instructions in Settings to create an account, then copy and paste your API key in to Settings.</p>\n<p>Google Cloud currently provides up to 5,000 monthly API calls for free. That means you can tidy 5,000 WordPress taxonomy terms per month for free. Higher usage than this may incur billing.</p>\n<h4>Source taxonomy</h4>\n<p>Select the taxonomy you want to examine and tidy up in the dropdown.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Re-assign terms</h4>\n<p>Select a target taxonomy to which terms to be of a particular entity type (UNKNOWN, PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, EVENT, WORK_OF_ART, CONSUMER_GOOD or OTHER) will be moved</p>\n"
