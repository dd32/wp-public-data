You will see a higher cost for month with 30 and 31 days.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why I am getting 3-weeks stay cost heigher than 4-weeks stay cost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) It is possible based on how you defined your weekly and monthly rates.The 3-weeks stay cost is calculated based on weekly rates whereas 4-weeks stay cost is based on monthly rates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I do not define monthly rate?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) The calculator will use weekly rate for all stays 7-days and longer. Hence a month stay will cost as stay of 4-weeks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Additional question or Comments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) Please send us email with your question on tech@pp-code.com</p>\n</p>\n\n"
