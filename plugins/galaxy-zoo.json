If<br />\nyou would like to stay informed and be notified when the plugin becomes<br />\navailable to the general public, sign-up at Galaxy Zoo Forums<br />\n(http://www.galaxyzooforum.org/).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the background on the AJAX preloader</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The preloader can be changed via the plugin&#8217;s CSS: On you WordPress Dashboard<br />\nselect &#8220;Plugins&#8221; then &#8220;Editor&#8221;, then select &#8220;Galaxy Zoo&#8221; in the<br />\n&#8220;Select plugin to edit&#8221;. Finally, select the &#8220;galaxy-zoo/css/galaxy-zoo.css&#8221;.<br />\nNow you can edit the plugins global CSS (change made here will be made to both<br />\nwidgets)&#8230; Look for the &#8216;.widget-galaxy-zoo-loader&#8217; class declaration and<br />\nchange the value inside the &#8216;url&#8217; brackets, e.g. from url(../img/loader-dark.gif)<br />\nto url(../img/loader-pink.gif).</p>\n<p>This plugin comes with 2 preloaders, one dark with background color</p>\n</p>\n<h4>222222, and one white, with background color #FFFFFF (loader-white.gif).</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you would like to have a preloader with a different background color<br />\nuse the online preloader generator at http://www.ajaxload.info/</p>\n<p>Select &#8220;Big Roller&#8221; as the &#8220;Indicator type&#8221;, the background color you wish<br />\nto have and #FF5D05 for the &#8220;Foreground color&#8221; (although you may change<br />\nthis value as well if you wish). Finally, click on &#8220;Download it!&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Once you have the new preloader image saved on your machine, you will need to<br />\nupload it to the plugin directory at /wp-content/plugins/galaxy-zoo/img</p>\n</p>\n\n",
