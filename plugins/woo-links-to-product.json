Just write the shortcode on the text widget content; for example <em>[wclinks2product]</em></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I add retailers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please, go to the options page, to add retailer / anchors.<br />\nNote that this plugin is not only for link to a retailer; you can also link to any external webpage, as well as show a modal containing information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I get the modal content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The url that you write on the field &#8216;Link to the product&#8217; decides the behaviour when you click on the button. For example:</p>\n<p>amazon.es<br />\nThis is an external link; so it will open the corresponding page on a new window.</p>\n<p>&#035;extra-info<br />\nIn this case, a modal will pop up, showing the inner content on the inline element width id &#8216;extra-info&#8217;. Of course, you can use here a class name instead of an id. For example:</p>\n<p>.info.extra<br />\nThe plugin will try to hide those inline elements that will appears in the modal, in case you forgot to do that.</p>\n<p>&#035;<br />\nIf this is the case, the plugin popup a modal containing an html note that you wrote. Previously, you should go to the plugin options and add the extra field of &#8220;Note&#8221;, and of course write some note; otherwise, the button does not appear.</p>\n<p>http://samedomain.com/otherpage.php #info<br />\nIn this case, the content of a modal is taking from the element with id &#8216;info&#8217; which is inside other webpage (on the same domain). Please, note the space before &#8216;#info&#8217;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the look of the modal, buttons, etc.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please, feel free of change the styles on the css files of the plugin, until you reach what you want. Remember to write your style on your theme (for example) or elsewhere, or it will be erased when updating the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
