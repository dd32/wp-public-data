A standard WordPress page has about 80 files to load. http/2 loads all the files as once. On average http/2 saves 90%-95% loading the files on a page.</p>\n<p>The files are the images, js and css on a page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How come it can enable http/2 on a http page, even when my hosting company doesn&#8217;t have http/2</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I am glad you asked.<br />\nGenerally you need https to enable http/2. And your hosting company has to upgrade their server to http/2.<br />\nThis plugin changes the URL for web files/assets on page to the CDN, and the URL has https, and the CDN has http/2.<br />\nSo we&#8217;re able to bypass your hosting for the assets/files on your web page, loading them from the CDN with http/2.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>will it effect my SEO ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unlinkely that this plugin will effect your SEO either positively or negatively</p>\n</p>\n<h4>how many locations does the CDN have ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>16 globally dispersed. We use bunnycdn currently.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>where is my data stored ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>wpdone keeps in in RAM copy of any hot objects, this saves load and transfer on yours hosting and ours.</p>\n<p>plus bunnycdn keeps the main copy.</p>\n<p>during a cached hit only bunnycdn is involved.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>is it better than xyz CDN ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>yes. but only in terms of ease and cost. most other CDNs need lots of settings and payment, this one doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>what if I already have caching and speedup plugins ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>then is is unlikely to give you much raw speedup. This plugin is aimed at those with less skills or time or budget to invest in other solutions.</p>\n<p>it will still however help with a geo dispersed audience, or an audience far from the hosting server.</p>\n<p>it will also help if your site is image heavy, or has loads of css/js files.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
