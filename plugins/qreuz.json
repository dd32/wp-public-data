Nevertheless, our high-performing monitoring and data collection service can&#8217;t be provided without a backend connection to our servers. We don&#8217;t want to bloat your database to tremendous levels and the computational load for our data science algorithms would require a server that may be much stronger than your current web-server.<br />\nAll collected data is still 100% owned by you. There is raw data access (see transparently every single row in the database), CSV exports, and data retention rules. You can ask us to delete all collected data anytime. We don&#8217;t sell your data and we don&#8217;t sell any ads.<br />\nWe&#8217;re providing a Data Processing Agreement that you can sign (find it in your Qreuz account).<br />\nQreuz is made in Germany and all data is exclusively processed and stored on servers and databases within the EU. We&#8217;re combining cloud providers and our own server infrastructure for fast and reliable service provisioning.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20an%20idea%20for%20a%20new%20feature.%20where%20can%20i%20get%20in%20contact%20with%20you%3F'>\nI have an idea for a new feature. Where can I get in contact with you?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thank you for your interest in supporting the development of Qreuz! Please get in contact at hello@qreuz.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20track%20pageviews%3F'>\nDoes this plugin track pageviews?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin can monitor pageviews and engagements.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20forward%20data%20to%20my%20google%20analytics%20account%20or%20will%20i%20need%20another%20plugin%20for%20that%3F'>\nCan I forward data to my Google Analytics account or will I need another plugin for that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With Qreuz, you can forward specified, privacy-safe portions of your monitoring data to Google Analytics. By doing so, you won&#8217;t need any other implementation of Google Analytics on your website for traffic analysis. For most websites and blogs this will be an effective way of integration. Nevertheless, integrating your website with Google Analytics via Qreuz monitoring will not allow access to all features of Google Analytics. There will be no transmission of visitor ids or ad click ids. No cookies or other markers to identify recurring visitors will be applied.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20use%20cookies%20to%20track%20user%20behavior%3F'>\nDoes this plugin use cookies to track user behavior?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Qreuz plugin does not utilize tracking cookies. We do not store any marker in cookies or similar browser based technologies to identify your visitors. There is also no fingerprinting. The way how Qreuz monitoring works does not rely on visitor profiles but on statistical and technical data from your website activity. If you want to track customer profile-centric data or do paid ad conversion tracking, you still need a consent-based tracking solution.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20pay%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I have to pay to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Qreuz plugin is free and open source. Unlimited traffic can be tracked free of charge. This plugin acts as an interface to Qreuz. Therefore, monitoring will only work if you login/register to our service and connect your website. Registration is free and we also offer a free tier for your website. However, there may be features that are restricted to the users of paid plans. You can find our pricing and plans overview at <a href=\"https://qreuz.com/plans\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://qreuz.com/plans</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
