        "description": "<p><em>This is a feature plugin intended to implement <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#34923</a>: Introduce basic content authorship in the Customizer.</em></p>\n<p>The goal for this plugin is to be able to expose the editing of posts and pages in the Customizer, allowing you to edit post data and postmeta for any number of posts, and preview the changes before saving them for others to see. This plugin was birthed out of the Widget Customizer feature-as-plugin project which was merged into WordPress Core: as widgets (in 3.9) and nav menus (4.3) can now be managed in the Customizer, so too should posts and pages be editable in the Customizer as well.</p>\n<p>Did you know that <strong>changing the featured image actually makes the change live even before you save the post</strong>? This is very surprising/unexpected behavior. The only way to truly preview a change to a featured image is to use something like Customize Posts.</p>\n<p>Likewise, did you know that <strong>changing a page template cannot be previewed from the post editor?</strong> When you change the selected page template, the change will not show up when you preview the page (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11049\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#11049</a>). However, in Customize Posts you <em>can</em> preview changes to the page template just by changing the dropdown selection, and then you can see what your page would look like with the new template after the preview refreshes.</p>\n<p>Most other changes to metaboxes containing data that gets saved to custom fields (postmeta) also get written when clicking the Preview button. The Customize Posts plugin provides a framework to edit postmeta in the Customizer with a live preview of the changes. (Fixing this underlying issue of incorrectly persisting postmeta when doing a preview is captured in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20299\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#20299</a>.)</p>\n<p>As much as possible, the previewing of changes in Customize Posts utilizes the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">selective refresh</a> capabilities introduced in WordPress 4.5. Not only does this mean it is faster to preview changes to posts and postmeta, but it also allows you to shift-click on an element to focus on the corresponding control in the Customizer pane. For example you can shift-click on the post title in the preview to focus on the post title control&#8217;s input field, or shift-click on a featured image to focus on the control&#8217;s button to open the media library.</p>\n<p><strong>Development of this plugin is done <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>. Pull requests welcome. Please see <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issues</a> reported there before going to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customize-posts\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin forum</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>(This <strong>Customize Posts</strong> plugin is not to be confused with 10up&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Post Customizer</strong></a>.)</p>\n<h4>Demo Videos</h4>\n<p>The following are listed in reverse chronological order.

Post content can be edited in the Customizer and previewed in multiple contexts. For example, this allows you to preview how a Read More tag will appear when the post appears on a post list page, and you can navigate to the single post to continue previewing subsequent paragraphs. You can expand the editor into a full-screen mode to focus on writing and then quickly preview the changes on the site by toggling the editor. You can make changes to as many posts as you want, but none of the changes will go live until you hit Save &amp; Publish: everything is previewed so there is no “save and surprise”.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJsEl0gd7dk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>[2016-03-03] Demonstration of integration with <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-setting-validation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Customize Setting Validation</a> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34893\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#34893</a>) to gracefully handle failures to save due to post locking and concurrent user editing:</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUwwTt6FtlQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>[2016-03-01] Demonstration of hooking into edit post links so that they actually work in the Customizer and expand the section to edit the given post (as opposed to the link doing nothing at all when clicked), as well as shift-clicking on the title and content (needs better discovery UI, see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#27403</a>):</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYfph3NbNCc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n",

See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/271\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#271</a> and PRs <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/272\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#272</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/284\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#284</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/285\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#285</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow page/post stubs created via nav menus in 4.7-alpha to also be edited like any other page. See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/253\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#253</a> and PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/287\" title=\"Insert full posts instead of stubs via nav menus\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#287</a>.</li>\n<li>For nav menu items linking to a post/page, add a edit button that appears in the nav menu item control next to the original link. Clicking edit will expand the section for that post/page, and collapsing the section will return focus to the button in the nav menu item control. See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/147\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#147</a> and PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/288\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#288</a>.</li>\n<li>Sync post/page changes to available nav menu items and nav menu item controls, ensuring titles are consistent in available item lists and in the nav menu item control&#8217;s title, label placeholder, and original link, and in the nav menu item setting&#8217;s <code>original_title</code> property. If a nav menu item lacks its own <code>title</code> and inherits from <code>original_title</code>, post/page changes will now trigger nav menu selective refresh updates. See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/156\" title=\"Ensure that newly-added posts/pages appear among list of available nav menu items\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#156</a> and PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/288\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#288</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/289\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#289</a>.</li>\n<li>Sync pages additions, changes, and removals to all <code>dropdown-pages</code> controls, in particular to the page on front and page for posts controls in the static front page section. See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/153\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#153</a>.

PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/256\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#256</a>.</li>\n<li>Implement support for all of the <code>WP_Query</code> query vars, including post meta queries, ensuring results have posts&#8217; customized state applied as expected. This is a big improvement to ensure customized posts and postmeta will appear the same before or after saving the customized state. Previously, previewing <code>WP_Query</code> results was very limited and often not accurate. As part of this, <code>get_posts()</code> and any queries made with <code>suppress_filters</code> on will be overridden to force filters to apply. See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/246\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#246</a> and PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/248\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#248</a>.</li>\n<li>Add support to <code>WP_Customize_Postmeta_Setting</code> for representing non-single postmeta. Such settings are instantiated with a true <code>single</code> arg and they require an array value. The <code>customize_sanitize_{$setting_id}</code> filter will apply to each array item separately, as will the <code>sanitize_meta()</code> call. PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/248\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#248</a>.</li>\n<li>Ensure that static front page constructs get registered even without any pages yet created. Add active callback to the static front page section so that it will appear as soon as a published page exists (either via adding a new page from the Pages panel or via a nav menu item page stub in WP 4.7-alpha). See <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues/252\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#252</a> and PR <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/pull/254\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#254</a>.</li>\n<li>Refactor editor control to be reusable for not just post content but also custom fields (postmeta).

Selecting a post adds its section to the Customizer and expands it while also navigating to the post&#8217;s URL in the preview. Trashed posts are also listed, and selecting a trashed post will load its post data into the Customizer in its untrashed state (restoring its original status and slug) so that upon save it will be be untrashed.

    "description": "<p><em>This is a feature plugin intended to implement <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#34923</a>: Introduce basic content authorship in the Customizer.</em></p>\n<p>The goal for this plugin is to be able to expose the editing of posts and pages in the Customizer, allowing you to edit post data and postmeta for any number of posts, and preview the changes before saving them for others to see. This plugin was birthed out of the Widget Customizer feature-as-plugin project which was merged into WordPress Core: as widgets (in 3.9) and nav menus (4.3) can now be managed in the Customizer, so too should posts and pages be editable in the Customizer as well.</p>\n<p>Did you know that <strong>changing the featured image actually makes the change live even before you save the post</strong>? This is very surprising/unexpected behavior. The only way to truly preview a change to a featured image is to use something like Customize Posts.</p>\n<p>Likewise, did you know that <strong>changing a page template cannot be previewed from the post editor?</strong> When you change the selected page template, the change will not show up when you preview the page (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11049\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#11049</a>). However, in Customize Posts you <em>can</em> preview changes to the page template just by changing the dropdown selection, and then you can see what your page would look like with the new template after the preview refreshes.</p>\n<p>Most other changes to metaboxes containing data that gets saved to custom fields (postmeta) also get written when clicking the Preview button. The Customize Posts plugin provides a framework to edit postmeta in the Customizer with a live preview of the changes. (Fixing this underlying issue of incorrectly persisting postmeta when doing a preview is captured in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20299\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#20299</a>.)</p>\n<p>As much as possible, the previewing of changes in Customize Posts utilizes the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/16/selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">selective refresh</a> capabilities introduced in WordPress 4.5. Not only does this mean it is faster to preview changes to posts and postmeta, but it also allows you to shift-click on an element to focus on the corresponding control in the Customizer pane. For example you can shift-click on the post title in the preview to focus on the post title control&#8217;s input field, or shift-click on a featured image to focus on the control&#8217;s button to open the media library.</p>\n<p><strong>Development of this plugin is done <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>. Pull requests welcome. Please see <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-posts/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">issues</a> reported there before going to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/customize-posts\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin forum</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>(This <strong>Customize Posts</strong> plugin is not to be confused with 10up&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/Post-Customizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Post Customizer</strong></a>.)</p>\n<h4>Demo Videos</h4>\n<p>The following are listed in reverse chronological order.

Post content can be edited in the Customizer and previewed in multiple contexts. For example, this allows you to preview how a Read More tag will appear when the post appears on a post list page, and you can navigate to the single post to continue previewing subsequent paragraphs. You can expand the editor into a full-screen mode to focus on writing and then quickly preview the changes on the site by toggling the editor. You can make changes to as many posts as you want, but none of the changes will go live until you hit Save &amp; Publish: everything is previewed so there is no “save and surprise”.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJsEl0gd7dk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>[2016-03-03] Demonstration of integration with <a href=\"https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-setting-validation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Customize Setting Validation</a> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34893\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#34893</a>) to gracefully handle failures to save due to post locking and concurrent user editing:</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUwwTt6FtlQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>[2016-03-01] Demonstration of hooking into edit post links so that they actually work in the Customizer and expand the section to edit the given post (as opposed to the link doing nothing at all when clicked), as well as shift-clicking on the title and content (needs better discovery UI, see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27403\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">#27403</a>):</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYfph3NbNCc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n",
