HTTP requests and download size will be reduced, so improving website performance for the visitor.</p>\n<p>For example, you probably use your contact form plugin only on your Contact Us page. SPS allows you to deactivate it when the page request is for one of your other pages to avoid downloading your contact form style sheets and scripts unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>The plugin has a user-friendly interface, so the administrator can see easily which plugins are running on each page.</p>\n<p>Not for newbies! The administrator must have a clear grasp of which plugins are required for each page, otherwise some pages will have errors because a required plugin is not loaded.</p>\n<h3>Deactivating</h3>\n<p>Deactivating SPS in the normal plugins list will deactivate plugin filtering and remove SPS files from mu-plugins.</p>\n<p>Removing the SPS plugin using FTP will leave unwanted SPS files in mu-plugins, but plugin filtering will be disabled.</p>\n<p>SPS settings are not deleted by deactivation or deletion. Reactivating should pickup filtering where it left off.</p>\n<h3>Settings</h3>\n<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Simple Plugin Selector to set which plugins are required on a page by page basis. If the site has cache or optimize plugins, they should be cleared after changing any SPS settings.</p>\n<p>If a new page, post or product is created, all plugins will be activated for that by default until set otherwise in SPS settings.</p>\n<p>If a new plugin is activated, it will be loaded for all pages by default until set otherwise in SPS settings.</p>\n",

Users with slow connections are likely to see a big improvement. Mobile users in particular should see quicker load times.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='a%20page%20doesn%27t%20work%20properly%20or%20look%20as%20it%20should%3F'>\nA page doesn&#8217;t work properly or look as it should?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the plugin settings for that page.

If there is a plugin which is set to not load on the front-side page, then it won&#8217;t be available to the admin-side customizer either. In case of issues, temporarily deactivate SPS at Dashboard &gt; Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins while using the customizer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20woocommerce'>\nWill it work with WooCommerce\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20polylang'>\nWill it work with Polylang\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, from SPS v1.0.4<br />\nNot tested with the premium plugin: Polylang for WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20with%20wpml%20%28wordpress%20multilingual%20plugin%29'>\nWill it work with WPML (WordPress Multilingual Plugin)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not tested with the premium plugin WPML.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20work%20on%20multi-site%20installations%3F'>\nWill it work on multi-site installations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not tested on multi-site installations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%20works%20on%20some%20pages%20but%20not%20others'>\nIt works on some pages but not others\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you create a new page, post or product, SPS does not make assumptions about which plugins are needed for it, so SPS will load all plugins.
