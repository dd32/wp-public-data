On some server setups, http://hello.com/wordpress.jpg is a different file to http://hello.com/WordPress.jpg &#8211; be sure you test this out before using the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t it catch everything?</h4>\n<p>In all honesty, because it&#8217;s a work in progress. Rather than fill in every filter possible, I&#8217;m trying to add them as I come across them. Let me know where I&#8217;ve missed it on your site &amp; I&#8217;ll add it next release.</p>\n<h4>Does it have to be so thorough?</h4>\n<p>No. If you hook onto the <code>wpccz_added_filters</code> filter hook you will have access to the array of filter hooks to which we are applying the string replace. Remove any that you don&#8217;t wish to use. Similarly, you can add any that are missing.</p>\n",
