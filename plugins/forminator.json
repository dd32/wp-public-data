You can also choose to set specific file types, limit the number of files that can be uploaded, as well as the individual file size. The upload field’s drag and drop interface also makes it a breeze for users to upload files.</p>\n<h3>Group And Repeat Form Fields</h3>\n<p>The Field Group feature allows you to group any number of fields together in one form. You can also enable users to add as many additional field groups as needed when filling out your form. Great for repeatable data entry such as employment history, event attendees, lists, etc.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Date Field Restrictions</h3>\n<p>Perfect for appointment and hotel bookings &#8211; Forminator’s Date Picker Limits feature allows you to restrict the available dates shown on your date field calendar. For example, you might show future dates only, a selected number of dates from today, dates between a specific date range, specific days of the week, and more!</p>\n<h3>Add An E-Signature Form Field (Pro Only)*</h3>\n<p>Have an online application that requires a signature, or a contract you need your customers to sign? Forminator’s E-signature feature allows visitors to use their mouse, trackpad, or finger (on touch devices) to leave a signature upon submitting the form. Just insert the “E-Signature” field and voila!</p>\n<h3>Receive Subscriptions and Recurring Payments on Stripe (Pro Only)*</h3>\n<p>Create fully-customized subscription forms with Forminator Pro’s Stripe Subscription add-on. Allow your customers to choose plans/pricing, billing cycle, custom upsells, a free trial option, and of course, make secure card payments. Forminator also saves you time by instantly and automatically syncing all subscription form data straight to your Stripe account.</p>\n<p>*<strong>Note:</strong> These features are only available with <a href=\"https://wpmudev.com/project/forminator-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=forminator-readme&amp;utm_content=forminator_pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Forminator Pro</a>.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20choose%20forminator%20over%20wpforms%3F'>\nWhy choose Forminator over WPForms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Forminator offers more features and functionalities compared to WPForms, especially in its free version. While WPForms Lite has limited access to essential tools, Forminator offers over 20 form fields, conditional logic, and comprehensive spam protection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Forminator provides payment integrations with both Stripe and Paypal, whereas WPForms Lite only integrates with Stripe. Forminator also supports a wider range of integrations, as well as quizzing and polling tools, advanced customization and styling options, and robust submission management. These features are available only in the pro version of WPForms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20forminator%20include%20a%20gutenberg%20block%3F'>\nDoes Forminator include a Gutenberg block?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It sure does. Forminator is built to work in both the Gutenberg and ClassicPress editors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20forminator%20gdpr%20ready%3F'>\nIs Forminator GDPR Ready?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Forminator makes it easy for you to comply with the GDPR and other local privacy regulations&#8230;all the tools are included but ultimately it is up to you to implement healthy privacy and data protection on your site. Do the right thing y&#8217;all.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20take%20payments%20with%20forminator%3F'>\nCan you take payments with Forminator?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Forminator currently includes integration with the Stripe payment gateway and PayPal&#8230;both included completely free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20forminator%20payment%20options%20sca%20compliant%3F'>\nAre Forminator payment options SCA compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Forminator is not managing the payment processing. We worked with Stripe and PayPal to ensure the built-in integrations follow the EU&#8217;s Strong Customer Authentication regulations (PSD2).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20contact%20form%20in%20wordpress%20with%20forminator%3F'>\nHow do I create a contact form in WordPress with Forminator?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve put together a simple guide to Forminator contact forms on our blog.

You can also choose to set specific file types, limit the number of files that can be uploaded, as well as the individual file size. The upload field’s drag and drop interface also makes it a breeze for users to upload files.</p>\n<h3>Group And Repeat Form Fields</h3>\n<p>The Field Group feature allows you to group any number of fields together in one form. You can also enable users to add as many additional field groups as needed when filling out your form. Great for repeatable data entry such as employment history, event attendees, lists, etc.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Date Field Restrictions</h3>\n<p>Perfect for appointment and hotel bookings &#8211; Forminator’s Date Picker Limits feature allows you to restrict the available dates shown on your date field calendar. For example, you might show future dates only, a selected number of dates from today, dates between a specific date range, specific days of the week, and more!</p>\n<h3>Add An E-Signature Form Field (Pro Only)*</h3>\n<p>Have an online application that requires a signature, or a contract you need your customers to sign?

Just insert the “E-Signature” field and voila!</p>\n<h3>Receive Subscriptions and Recurring Payments on Stripe (Pro Only)*</h3>\n<p>Create fully-customized subscription forms with Forminator Pro’s Stripe Subscription add-on.
