Additional trial time can be arranged if needed.

        "installation": "<p>Install the plugin from the WordPress store as you would do with a plugin.</p>\n<p>You will find all settings under the tab Zettle that can be found at WooCommerce-&gt;Settings-&gt;Zettle.</p>\n<p><strong>Connection</strong></p>\n<p>Enter your e-mail adress in the the <em>User e-mail</em> field. The e-mail is used for sending the Access Token required when purchasing a subscription.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press <em>Authorize</em> to connect the plugin with your Zettle account, popup windows must be allowed in the browser for this to work.</li>\n<li>You will be asked to agree with our <a href=\"https://www.bjorntech.com/privacy-policy?utm_source=wp-izettle&amp;utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_campaign=product\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">privacy policy</a>.</li>\n<li>You are then redirected to Zettle, enter your account details and authorize the plugin (your account user-id and password remains safe with Zettle and cannot be reached by the plugin).</li>\n<li>When the authorization is complete, close the window</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Products to Zettle</strong></p>\n<p>Select how often you want to <em>Sync products to Zettle</em>.</p>\n<p>The plugin can create a set of products in Zettle out of the products you have in WooCommerce. Products that you already have in Zettle will remain unchanged.</p>\n<p><em>When syncing products</em> the plugin can be configured to update stock levels on the products in Zettle created by the plugin.</p>\n<p>The plugin can be configured to <em>Use the price</em> from the Zettle standard price field or the sales price field. If the sales price field is chosen and the field is blank on a product, the plugin will use the standard price on that product.</p>\n<p><em>Include products with status</em> selects if only products being published or if all products regardless status should be synced. This is useful for products sold in Zettle but not in the web shop.</p>\n<p>In <em>Product categories to sync</em> you can select the product categories that will be synced to Zettle, leave blank if you want all products to be synced.</p>\n<p>Some things to remember about product synchronization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you use the selection <em>When changed in WooCommerce</em> it can take a minute or two before you see the change in Zettle.</li>\n<li>If you have large number of products, the sync will take a long time. Do not start it several times.</li>\n<li>You can always start a manual sync by pressing the <em>Start</em> button</li>\n<li>If you want to prevent a single product or variation from being synced to Zettle, use the &#8220;Do not sync to Zettle&#8221; checkbox. You find it at the Inventory tab of simple products or at each variation of variable products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Products from Zettle</strong></p>\n<p>The recommended way of working is to administer your products in WooCommerce and let them sync automatically to Zettle.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure what fields you do want to be able to change in Zettle and get automatically updated in WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>The plugin can also be configured to create new WooCommerce product based on new products created in Zettle</p>\n<p><strong>Purchases from Zettle</strong></p>\n<p>You can select how often you want to <em>Download purchases</em>.</p>\n<p><em>When downloading</em> purchases the plugin is creating a local copy of your purchases. You can view and perform actions on downloaded purchases in the Zettle tab, found in the main WordPress menu.</p>\n<p>The plugin can create an order or just change the stock level for products being sold when a purchase is arriving to WooCommerce. These functions can also be manually performed at the Zettle tab in the main menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Barcodes</strong></p>\n<p>The plugin is adding a <em>Barcode</em> field at the Inventory tab on each simple product. On variable products a <em>Barcode</em> field is added on each variation of the product.</p>\n<p>You can enter information manually on each product or let the plugin populate the Zettle barcode field in a number of different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate an EAN-13: If the barcode-field in WooCommerce is empty an EAN-13 barcode will be generated and saved on both the Zettle and WooCommerce products.</li>\n<li>Use the barcode field in WooCommerce described above and copy the data in the field to Zettle.</li>\n<li>Use the SKU field on the product or variation and copy the data in the field to Zettle.</li>\n<li>Use the barcode field in Zettle and copy the data to the WooCommerce barcode field (useful if you want to handle the admin of barcodes in the Zettle app)</li>\n<li>Clean the barcode field (useful if you want the plugin to generate new barcodes automatically later.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Advanced</strong></p>\n<p>CAUTION: Use the advanced settings carefully and only if you fully understand the implications.</p>\n<p><em>Enable logging</em> if you experience problems with the plugin and need to troubleshoot.</p>\n<p>Contact hello@bjorntech.com for more information about the advanced settings.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: What can I sync if I do not purchase a subscription?<br />\nA: All syncing is open during the trial period.</p>\n<p>Q: I believe that I have configured everything correct and done manual sync, still nothing happens. No products being synced to Zettle and no purchases downloaded.<br />\nA: Your system probably has CRON disabled. Go to the settings page, check the box \\&#8221;CRON disabled on server\\&#8221; and save. While you are there, also check the \\&#8221;Enable logging\\&#8221;. Check the logs at \\&#8221;WooCommerce-&gt;Status-&gt;Logs\\&#8221; after a couple of minutes and you will see how the updates started. If not, send us the logfiles to hello@bjorntech.com and we will look into the problem.</p>\n<p>Q: Some variable products are created without variations in Zettle, is this a bug?<br />\nA: Zettle has a limit of max 99 variations on a product. To handle this, we are removing all variations on a product with more than 99 variations.</p>\n<p>Q: When I sync products from Woo to Zettle, it seems that all products are uploaded to the “root” on Zettle. Will the sync still work both ways if I move the products to different folders in the Zettle admin (with browser) after the Woo -&gt; Zettle sync?<br />\nA: The sync will always work both ways regardless of how you organize the products into folders from the browser or app.</p>\n<p>Q: If I rename products (shorten names) on the Zettle website, will this have any affect on syncing? It will not change the product names in Woo store, right? What name will be shown in the customers receipt (I would prefer the longer name from Woo)?<br />\nA: Do not rename products in Zettle. The name change will be overwritten next time the product is synced from WooCommerce. Instead use the field “Product name” at the Zettle tab on your products. Just enter the name you want on the product in Zettle in the field.</p>\n<p>Q: Do you support syncing of WEBP product images?<br />\nA: Yes</p>\n<p>Q: Is the plugin compatible with the Zettle Inventory API change set to occur on the 31st of May 2023 (see https://developer.zettle.com/docs/api/inventory-v3/inventory-api-migration-guide)?<br />\nA: Yes</p>\n<p>Q: Is the plugin compatible with HPOS (High performance order storage)?<br />\nA: Yes</p>\n",
