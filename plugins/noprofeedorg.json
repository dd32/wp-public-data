Last year I tought it might be useful to have the myeasy common images and code loaded from a CDN to avoid having to update all the plugins in the series each time an image changes and to load pages faster; so I moved all the common items to a CDN. Today I received a kind email from wordpress.org letting me know that &#8220;there a potential malicious intent issue here as you {me} could change the files to embed malicious code and nobody would be the wiser&#8221; and asking me to change the code. I promptly reacted to show everyone that I am 101% in bona fide and here is a new version.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1 (13 July 2011)</h4>\n<p>Limiting the number of words to 20 in the widget feed content &#8211; even when the &#8220;The title and the entire feed content&#8221; option is selected. Minor fixes in the code.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<p>This is the first release.</p>\n"
