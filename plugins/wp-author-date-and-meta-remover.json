The CMS is so easy and convenient and the themes are becoming more spectacular with every new generation. That is to say, WordPress is just not a blog anymore. Many posts in business are not time sensitive. Rather they contain information that is pertinent for many months or even a novelty that can be relevant for many years such as in evergreen businesses. A time stamp and author information stands out as unnatural and irrelevant is such posts. Now it is as simple as installing a plugin and the author meta data is gone. It&#8217;s as easy as that.</p>\n<p>WP Author, Date and Meta Remover is based on the CSS model for removing author meta data from standard WordPress themes, i.e. 2011-2016. The plugin is simple; it uses a CSS file linked into the header of your pages with very simple code to remove the author meta data. There is no need to write a child theme, the plugin will do the work for you. The plugin is so simple; there is no load on runtime.</p>\n<p>Please understand that the plugin is based on the standard WordPress themes 2011-2014 CSS code for removing the author meta data. It will remove the meta data for a majority of themes on the market. However, it may not work on themes produced by some theme foundries.
