It also automatically adds a couple of custom classes. And there&#8217;s a shortcode that enables you to include the widget&#8217;s output in your content.</p>\n<p><strong>Important!</strong> This plugin provides <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> &#8211; <em>zip, zilch, nada, bupkis</em> &#8211; in the way of frontend styling!

I have therefore grouped most of the options into<br />\ncollapsible logical sections (with remembered state once saved).</p>\n<p>The associated <strong>SHORTCODE ATTRIBUTES</strong> are documented<br />\nunder <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/installation/\" rel=\"ugc\">Installation</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Always Visible</strong></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> <em>(textbox)</em></p>\n<p>Set the title for your widget.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hide</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>Prevents the entered <code>Title</code> being displayed in the front-end widget output.</p>\n<p>In the Widgets admin page, I find it useful to still be able to see the <code>Title</code> in the sidebar when the widget is closed, but I<br />\ndon&#8217;t necessarily want that <code>Title</code> to actually be output when the widget is displayed at the front-end. Hence this checkbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Select Menu</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Choose the appropriate menu from the dropdown list of Custom Menus currently defined in your WordPress application. The<br />\nfirst one available (alphabetically) is already selected for you by default.</p>\n<h3>Filters Section</h3>\n<p>Filters are applied in the order they are presented.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Primary Filter</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong> <em>(radio, default On, &amp; select)</em></p>\n<p>Filters by level within the selected menu, starting at the level selected here. This is the default setting<br />\nfor a new widget instance, which, if left alone and with all other options at their default, will show the entire selected menu.</p>\n<p>Example : If you wanted to show all the options that were at level 3 or below, you could check this radio and set the select to &#8220;3&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Branch</strong> <em>(radio &amp; select)</em></p>\n<p>Filters by branch, with the head item of the branch being selected from the dropdown. The dropdown presents all the<br />\nitems from the selected menu, plus a &#8220;Current Item&#8221; option (the default). Selecting &#8220;Current Item&#8221; means that the head item of the<br />\nbranch is the current menu item (as indicated by WordPress), provided, of course, that the current menu item actually corresponds to<br />\na menu item from the currently selected menu!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> <em>(radio &amp; textbox)</em></p>\n<p>Filters by the menu items that you specifically pick (by menu item id, as a comma-separated list). The simplest way<br />\nto get your list of ids is to use the &#8220;assist&#8221;, and [un]check the green tick box at the right hand side of each depicted menu item that<br />\nyou want. Alternatively, just type your list of ids into the box.</p>\n<p>If the id is appended with a &#8216;+&#8217;, eg. &#8217;23+&#8217;, then all the item&#8217;s descendants will also be included.</p>\n<p>Example : If you only wanted to show, say, 5 of your many available menu items, and those 5 items are not in one handy branch of the menu,<br />\nthen you might want to use this option.</p>\n<p>Example : If your menu has 6 root branches &#8211; &#8220;A&#8221; thru to &#8220;F&#8221; &#8211; and you were only interested in branches &#8220;B&#8221; (id of, say, 11) and<br />\n&#8220;E&#8221; (id of, say, 19), you could set <code>Items</code> to be &#8220;11+,19+&#8221;, which would include &#8220;B&#8221; with all its descendants, and &#8220;E&#8221; with all its<br />\ndescendants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Secondary Filter</em></strong> <em>(not applicable to an <code>Items</code> filter)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Starting at</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This is only applicable to a <code>Branch</code> filter and it allows you to shift the starting point of your output within the confines<br />\nof the selected branch. By default it is set to the selected branch item itself, but it can be changed to a relative of the branch item (eg.<br />\nparent, grandparent, children, etc) or to an absolute, fixed level within the branch containing the selected branch item (eg. the root<br />\nlevel item for the branch, or one level below the branch&#8217;s root item, etc).</p>\n<p>Example : If you wanted the entire &#8220;current&#8221; branch then, with <code>Branch</code> set to &#8220;Current Item&#8221;, you might set <code>Starting at</code> to &#8220;1 (root)&#8221;.<br />\nAlternatively, if you wanted the children of the current menu item then <code>Starting at</code> could be set to &#8220;+1 (children)&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Item, if possible</strong> <em>(radio, default On)</em></p>\n<p>This is the default filter mechanism whereby, if <code>Starting at</code> can only result in a single item (ie. it is the branch item itself, or<br />\nan ancestor thereof) then only that item and its descendants are considered for filtering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong> <em>(radio)</em></p>\n<p>Changes the default filter mechanism such that if <code>Starting at</code> results in the selection of the branch item or one of its ancestors,<br />\nthen all siblings of that resultant item are also included in the secondary filtering process.</p>\n<p>Example : If Joe and Fred are siblings (ie. they have a common parent) and Joe is the selected branch item &#8211; with <code>Starting at</code> set<br />\nto Joe &#8211; then the secondary filter would normally only consider Joe and its descendants. However, if <code>Level</code> was enabled instead of<br />\n    Item, then both Joe and Fred, <em>and all their descendants</em>, would be considered for filtering.</p>\n<p>Note that there is one exception, and that is that if <code>Starting at</code> results in a root-level item, then <code>Allow all Root Items</code> must<br />\nbe enabled in order to allow the other sibling root items to be added into the filter process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Allow all Root Items</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>In the right conditions &#8211; see <code>Level</code> above &#8211; this allows sibling root items to be considered for secondary filtering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For Depth</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This the number of levels of the menu structure that will be considered for inclusion in the final output (in complete<br />\nignorance of any subsequent Inclusions or Exclusions).</p>\n<p>The first level of output is the starting level, regardless of<br />\nhow that starting level is determined (see <code>Starting at</code> and <code>Relative to Current Item</code> options). So if you ask<br />\nfor a Depth of 1 level, you get just the starting level; if you ask for a Depth of 2, you get the starting level and<br />\nthe one below it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Relative to Current Item</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>By default, <code>For Depth</code> (above) is relative to the first item found, but this may be overridden to be relative to the<br />\ncurrent menu item <strong><em>if</em></strong>  <code>For Depth</code> is not unlimited <strong>and</strong> the current menu item can found within the selected menu.<br />\nIf the current menu item is not within the selected menu then it falls back to being relative to the first item found.</p>\n<p>Please note that the current item must also be within the constraints set by the <code>Starting at</code> option. In other words, if<br />\ncurrent item is <em>above</em> the <code>Starting at</code> level in the menu structure then it will <strong>not</strong> be used to alter the determination of<br />\nDepth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Inclusions</em></strong></p>\n<p>These allow certain other items to be added to the output from the secondary filters.</p>\n<p>The first 3 are only applicable to a <code>Branch</code> filter. Please note that they only come into effect when the <code>Branch</code> filter item is at<br />\nor below the <code>Starting at</code> level, and do not include any items that would break the depth limit set in the Secondary Filter options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Branch Ancestors</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Include any ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc) of the items selected as the <code>Branch</code> filter.<br />\nAncestors can be set to go up to an absolute level, or to go up a certain number of levels relative to the <code>Branch</code> filter item.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8230; with Siblings</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>In conjunction with <code>Branch Ancestors</code>, also include all siblings of those ancestors.<br />\nAs with Ancestors, their siblings can be set to go up to an absolute level, or to go up a certain number of levels relative<br />\nto the <code>Branch</code> filter item. Note that while it is possibe to set a larger range for siblings than ancestors, the final output<br />\nis limited by <code>Branch Ancestors</code> setting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Branch Siblings</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>Include any siblings of the item selected as the <code>Branch</code> filter (ie. any items at the same level and within<br />\nthe same branch as the <code>Branch</code> item).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This allows an entire level of items to be included, optionally also including all levels either above or below it.<br />\nThis replaces the <code>All Root Items</code> checkbox (pre v3.0.4), which only allowed for the inclusion of the root level items.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Exclusions</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Item Ids</strong> <em>(textbox)</em></p>\n<p>This is a comma-separated list of the ids of menu items that you do <em>not</em> want to appear in the final output.<br />\nThe simplest way to get your list of ids is to use the &#8220;assist&#8221;, and [un]check<br />\nthe red cross box at the left hand side of each depicted menu item. Alternatively, just type your list of ids into the box.</p>\n<p>If the id is appended with a &#8216;+&#8217;, eg. &#8217;23+&#8217;, then all the item&#8217;s descendants will also be excluded.</p>\n<p>Example : If you wanted to show the entire &#8220;A&#8221; branch, with the sole exception of one grandchild of &#8220;A&#8221;, say &#8220;ABC&#8221;, then you could<br />\nset <code>Branch</code> to &#8220;A&#8221;, and <code>Exclusions</code> to the id of the &#8220;ABC&#8221; item.</p>\n<p>Example : If you have a menu with 4 root items &#8211; &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;C&#8221; &amp; &#8220;D&#8221; &#8211; and you wanted to show all items, with descendants, for all bar<br />\nthe &#8220;C&#8221; branch, then you could set <code>Level</code> to &#8220;1 (root)&#8221; and <code>Exclusions</code> to, say, &#8220;12+&#8221;, where &#8220;12&#8221; is the menu item id for &#8220;C&#8221; and<br />\nthe &#8220;+&#8221; indicates that all the descendants of &#8220;C&#8221; should also be excluded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This allows an entire level of items to be excluded, optionally also excluding all levels either above or below it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Qualifier</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Current Item is in</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This allows you to specify that there only be any output shown when/if the current menu item is one of the menu items selected<br />\nfor output at a particular stage in the filter processing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>&#8220;Menu&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be somewhere within the selected menu.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Primary Filter&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be within the scope of the selected primary filter. So if you selected, say, a child<br />\nof &#8220;A&#8221; as the <code>Branch</code> item, then if &#8220;A&#8221; was the current menu item there would be no output with this qualifier.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Secondary Filter&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be within the items as restricted by the secondary filters. So if you<br />\nselected <code>Branch</code> as &#8220;A&#8221;, with <code>Starting at</code> set to &#8220;+1 (children)&#8221;, then if &#8220;A&#8221; was the current menu item there would be no output with this qualifier.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Inclusions&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be in within the items as set by the primary and secondary filters, and the inclusions.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Final Output&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be in the final output.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fallbacks Section</h3>\n<p><strong><em>If Current Item has no children</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gets applied at the Secondary Filter stage, and its eligibility and<br />\napplication are therefore determined and governed by the other Secondary Filter settings.</p>\n<p>It only comes into play (possibly) when a <code>Branch</code> filter is set as &#8220;Current Item&#8221;, and the <code>Starting at</code><br />\nand <code>For Depth</code> settings are such that the output should start at or below the current item,<br />\nand would normally include some of the current item&#8217;s descendants<br />\n(eg. <code>Starting at</code> &#8220;the Branch&#8221;, <code>For Depth</code> &#8220;1 level&#8221; does <em>not</em> invoke the fallback).<br />\nThe fallback allows for the occasion when the current menu item <em>does not have</em> any immediate children.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unlabelled Select</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Enable the fallback by selecting one of</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Start at : -1 (parent)</em> : overrides the <code>Starting at</code> option to be the immediate parent of the Current Item</li>\n<li><em>Start at : the Current Item</em> : overrides the <code>Starting at</code> option to be the Current Item</li>\n<li><em>No output!</em> : self-explanatory</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8230;and Include its Siblings</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>This will add in the siblings of the item selected above (excluding the &#8220;No output!&#8221; setting!).</p>\n<p>Note : This <em>only</em> adds the siblings, not the siblings&#8217; descendants! However, if the <code>Level</code> radio (in Secondary Filter stage above) is<br />\nset, then all the item&#8217;s siblings <em>and their descendants</em> will automatically be included, and [un]setting this option will have no effect.<br />\nAlso note that if the fallback results in a root-level item being selected as the new <code>Starting at</code> item, then the inclusion of siblings<br />\noutside the current branch depends on the setting of the <code>Allow all Root Items</code> checkbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For Depth</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Override the current <code>For Depth</code> setting. Note that any depth value set here will be relative to the current item, regardless<br />\nof the current setting of <code>...Relative to</code>!</p>\n<p>As an example, this option may be useful in the following scenario : item A has 2 children, B and C; B is the current menu item but has<br />\nno children, whereas C has loads of children/grandchildren. If you fallback to B&#8217;s parent &#8211; A &#8211; with Unlimited depth set, then you will<br />\nget A, B, C, and <em>all</em> C&#8217;s dependents! You may well want to override depth to limit the output to, say, just A, B and C, by setting this<br />\nfallback option to &#8220;1&#8221;? Or maybe A, B, C, and C&#8217;s immediate children, by setting &#8220;2&#8221;?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>If no Current Item can be found</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Try items marked Parent of Current</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>This gets applied right at the start of processing, when determining<br />\nwhich of the menu items (if any) should be regarded as the unique &#8220;Current Item&#8221; by this widget.<br />\nUnder certain conditions, WordPress will mark an item as being the parent of a current item &#8230;<br />\nbut there won&#8217;t actually be a current item marked! This occurs, for example, when displaying a full post for which there is<br />\nno specific related menu item, yet there <em>is</em> a menu item for a Category that the displayed post belongs to :<br />\nWordPress will then mark the related Category as being the parent of the current item (the post) even though<br />\nit can&#8217;t mark the post as being the current item (because there&#8217;s no specific item for it within the menu).</p>\n<p>Enabling this fallback will make the widget look for these situations &#8211; only as a last resort! &#8211;<br />\nand set (one of) the found &#8220;parent&#8221; item(s) as the Current Item.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>If more than 1 possible Current Item</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use the last one found</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>Occasionally it is possible for CMW to have more than one possible candidate for Current Item. Since there can only be one<br />\nCurrent Item, CMW picks the <em>first one</em> encountered. However, this may cause a problem where, for example, a root level item <strong>and</strong><br />\none of its sub-menu items are <em>both</em> set to list items from Category A, and the page being displayed is a full post that belongs<br />\nto category A : CMW will more than likely determine that the root level item is the Current Item, whereas you really need the<br />\nsub-menu item to be the Current Item (probably to maintain consistency with what is produced when other sub-menu items are &#8220;current&#8221;).</p>\n<p>Enabling this fallback will make CMW use the last-found (instead of first-found) candidate for Current item, ie. when<br />\nthe choice is between a submenu item or its parent item, the submenu item will be used.</p>\n<p>Note that this option is most likely to only have any effect when the <code>If no Current Item can be found</code> fallback (above) is<br />\nenabled, but given that any other plugin/theme could affect the menu item structure that gets passed thru to CMW it is not<br />\nimpossible for other configurations to also be affected.</p>\n<h3>Output Section</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical</strong> <em>(radio, default On)</em></p>\n<p>Output in the standard nested list format.

For example, let&#8217;s say you<br />\nwant to show the Current Item and its immediate children, <em>but</em> if there isn&#8217;t a Current Item then you want to show the top 2 levels<br />\nof the menu : previously this was not possible solely with CMW, but now you can configure the main widget settings for the &#8220;current item&#8221;<br />\nscenario, and add an Alternative setting for when no Current Item can be determined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On condition</strong> <em>(2 selects)</em></p>\n<p>Select the appropriate condition for when your Alternative configuration should be used, and also the stage within the<br />\nFilter processing when this condition should be tested for (similar to the Qualifier, <code>Current Item is in</code>). You need<br />\nvalues in both selects for the Alternative to be considered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Then switch settings to</strong> <em>(textarea)</em></p>\n<p>This should contain a CMW-generated shortcode equivalent of the configuration that you want to switch to. Please note that leaving<br />\nthis empty will <strong>not</strong> prevent the Alternative kicking in if the conditions are set and met! An empty <code>switch to</code> will merely default<br />\nto the CMW&#8217;s base settings (Level 1, unlimited Depth). Also note that Alternatives cannot be nested : a primary configuration is<br />\nallowed one chance to switch and that&#8217;s it, so providing an Alternative-that-has-an-Alternative will not work.</p>\n<p>The Assist <em>will work</em> with an Alternative &#8211; in that it displays the appropriate output &#8211; but it can get confusing as to which<br />\nconfiguration set is being used. There is a message displayed whenever the Alternative kicks in (green if successful, red if it<br />\nshould have kicked in but couldn&#8217;t due to an error in the alternative settings) so please take note of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A bit more information about the <strong>Alternative</strong> is available<br />\nin <a href=\"http://www.wizzud.com/2014/10/03/custom-menu-wizard-wordpress-plugin-version-3-1/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a>.</p>\n",

The widget itself need not be assigned to a widget area, so you can construct your<br />\nshortcode using a widget in the Inactive Widgets area if you have no need for an active one.</p>\n<p>Note that as long as you are <strong>not</strong> using the <code>widget=N</code> attribute, then you don&#8217;t need to save the widget itself :<br />\njust copy-paste the shortcode when you are happy with it.</p>\n<h4>widget</h4>\n<p><em>integer</em> : <strong>!NEW!</strong> <em>from v3.1.5</em>, the shortcode will accept a <code>widget=N</code> attribute which will load an<br />\nexisting widget instance.</p>\n<p>The shortcode &#8211; resembling <strong><code>[cmwizard widget=N/]</code></strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is an integer &#8211; is provided at the base<br />\nof each widget, below the widget&#8217;s &#8220;equivalent&#8221; shortcode.</p>\n<p>It will look for the instance in all active sidebars, <em>and</em> the Inactive Widgets area.<br />\nYou can prevent inspection of the Inactive Widgets area by adding an <code>inactive=0</code> attribute.<br />\nIt will <strong><em>not</em></strong> look in any other <em>Inactive Sidebar&#8230;</em> area unless you specifically tell it to do so by<br />\nadding an <code>orphaned=1</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>Using this attribute reduces the shortcode length, and may cut down on maintenance where<br />\nyou have the same shortcode in a number of places &#8230; as long as you are prepared to keep the widget instance (even if it&#8217;s in the<br />\nInactive Widgets area). You can override the widget instance&#8217;s settings by supplying any of the other standard shortcode attributes.</p>\n<p>Note that you can&#8217;t use this attribute as part of an Alternative setting (it is simply ignored).</p>\n<h4>title</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : The output&#8217;s <code>Title</code>, which may be overridden by <strong>title_from</strong>. Note that there is no shortcode equivalent of the widget&#8217;s <code>Hide</code> option for the title.</p>\n<h4>menu</h4>\n<p><em>string or integer</em> : Accepts a menu name or id. If not provided, the shortcode will attempt to find the first menu (alphabetically)<br />\nthat has menu items attached to it, and use that.</p>\n<h4>level</h4>\n<p><em>integer</em> : Sets the <code>Level</code> filter to the specified (greater than zero) value. Defaults to 1, and is ignored if either <strong>branch</strong> or <strong>items</strong> is specified.</p>\n<h4>branch</h4>\n<p><em>string or integer</em> : If not empty then <code>Branch</code> is set as the primary filter, with the branch item being set from the assigned value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If numeric, it is taken as being the id of a menu item.</li>\n<li>If set to either <em>&#8220;current&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;current-item&#8221;</em> then the <code>Branch</code> item is set to &#8220;Current Item&#8221;.</li>\n<li>If any other string, it is taken to be the title of a menu item (within the selected menu). The widget will look for the first <em>caseless</em> title match, so specifying <code>branch=\"my menu item\"</code> will match against a menu item with the title &#8220;My Menu Item&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>items</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : Comma-separated list of meu item ids, where an id can optionally be followed by a &#8216;+&#8217; to include all its descendants (eg. &#8220;23+&#8221;). Takes priority over <strong>branch</strong>.</p>\n<h4>start_at</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : This is only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter, and consists of a signed or unsigned integer that indicates either a relative<br />\n(to the selected branch item) or absolute level to start your output at (ref. the widget&#8217;s <code>Starting at</code> option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>).<br />\nBy default the starting level for output is the branch item&#8217;s level. A relative level is indicated by a signed (ie. preceded by<br />\na &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8220;) integer, eg. <code>start_at=\"+1\"</code>, while an absolute level is unsigned, eg. <code>start_at=\"1\"</code>. Some examples :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>start_at=\"+1\"</code> : (relative) start at the branch item&#8217;s level + 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=\"children\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"-1\"</code> : (relative) start at the branch item&#8217;s level &#8211; 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=\"parent\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"-2\"</code> : (relative) would be the &#8220;grandparent&#8221; level</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"1\"</code> : (absolute) start at the root item of the selected branch (also accepts <code>start_at=\"root\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"2\"</code> : (absolute) start at one level below root (still within the selected branch)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>start_mode</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : This has only one accepted value &#8211; &#8220;level&#8221; &#8211; and is only applicable for a <code>Branch</code> filter whose <strong>start_at</strong> setting returns<br />\nin an item that is at or above the selected branch item (relatively or absolutely).<br />\nSetting <code>start_mode=\"level\"</code> forces the widget to use not only the resultant starting item<br />\nand its relevant descendants, but also all that item&#8217;s siblings <em>and their descendants</em><br />\n(ref. the widget&#8217;s <code>Level</code> radio option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>).</p>\n<h4>allow_all_root</h4>\n<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget&#8217;s <code>Allow all Root Items</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>.</p>\n<h4>depth</h4>\n<p><em>integer, default 0 (unlimited)</em> : See widget&#8217;s <code>For Depth</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>.</p>\n<h4>depth_rel_current</h4>\n<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget&#8217;s <code>Relative to Current Item</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>.</p>\n<h4>ancestors</h4>\n<p><em>integer, default 0 (off)</em> : Sets an absolute level (positive integer), or a relative number of levels (negative integer), for which<br />\nthe ancestors of the <code>Branch</code> filter item should be included.

The widget itself need not be assigned to a widget area, so you can construct your<br />\nshortcode using a widget in the Inactive Widgets area if you have no need for an active one.</p>\n<p>Note that as long as you are <strong>not</strong> using the <code>widget=N</code> attribute, then you don&#8217;t need to save the widget itself :<br />\njust copy-paste the shortcode when you are happy with it.</p>\n<h4>widget</h4>\n<p><em>integer</em> : <strong>!NEW!</strong> <em>from v3.1.5</em>, the shortcode will accept a <code>widget=N</code> attribute which will load an<br />\nexisting widget instance.</p>\n<p>The shortcode &#8211; resembling <strong><code>[cmwizard widget=N/]</code></strong>, where <strong>N</strong> is an integer &#8211; is provided at the base<br />\nof each widget, below the widget&#8217;s &#8220;equivalent&#8221; shortcode.</p>\n<p>It will look for the instance in all active sidebars, <em>and</em> the Inactive Widgets area.<br />\nYou can prevent inspection of the Inactive Widgets area by adding an <code>inactive=0</code> attribute.<br />\nIt will <strong><em>not</em></strong> look in any other <em>Inactive Sidebar&#8230;</em> area unless you specifically tell it to do so by<br />\nadding an <code>orphaned=1</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>Using this attribute reduces the shortcode length, and may cut down on maintenance where<br />\nyou have the same shortcode in a number of places &#8230; as long as you are prepared to keep the widget instance (even if it&#8217;s in the<br />\nInactive Widgets area). You can override the widget instance&#8217;s settings by supplying any of the other standard shortcode attributes.</p>\n<p>Note that you can&#8217;t use this attribute as part of an Alternative setting (it is simply ignored).</p>\n<h4>title</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : The output&#8217;s <code>Title</code>, which may be overridden by <strong>title_from</strong>. Note that there is no shortcode equivalent of the widget&#8217;s <code>Hide</code> option for the title.</p>\n<h4>menu</h4>\n<p><em>string or integer</em> : Accepts a menu name or id. If not provided, the shortcode will attempt to find the first menu (alphabetically)<br />\nthat has menu items attached to it, and use that.</p>\n<h4>level</h4>\n<p><em>integer</em> : Sets the <code>Level</code> filter to the specified (greater than zero) value. Defaults to 1, and is ignored if either <strong>branch</strong> or <strong>items</strong> is specified.</p>\n<h4>branch</h4>\n<p><em>string or integer</em> : If not empty then <code>Branch</code> is set as the primary filter, with the branch item being set from the assigned value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If numeric, it is taken as being the id of a menu item.</li>\n<li>If set to either <em>&#8220;current&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;current-item&#8221;</em> then the <code>Branch</code> item is set to &#8220;Current Item&#8221;.</li>\n<li>If any other string, it is taken to be the title of a menu item (within the selected menu). The widget will look for the first <em>caseless</em> title match, so specifying <code>branch=\"my menu item\"</code> will match against a menu item with the title &#8220;My Menu Item&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>items</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : Comma-separated list of meu item ids, where an id can optionally be followed by a &#8216;+&#8217; to include all its descendants (eg. &#8220;23+&#8221;). Takes priority over <strong>branch</strong>.</p>\n<h4>start_at</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : This is only relevant to a <code>Branch</code> filter, and consists of a signed or unsigned integer that indicates either a relative<br />\n(to the selected branch item) or absolute level to start your output at (ref. the widget&#8217;s <code>Starting at</code> option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>).<br />\nBy default the starting level for output is the branch item&#8217;s level. A relative level is indicated by a signed (ie. preceded by<br />\na &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8220;) integer, eg. <code>start_at=\"+1\"</code>, while an absolute level is unsigned, eg. <code>start_at=\"1\"</code>. Some examples :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>start_at=\"+1\"</code> : (relative) start at the branch item&#8217;s level + 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=\"children\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"-1\"</code> : (relative) start at the branch item&#8217;s level &#8211; 1 (also accepts <code>start_at=\"parent\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"-2\"</code> : (relative) would be the &#8220;grandparent&#8221; level</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"1\"</code> : (absolute) start at the root item of the selected branch (also accepts <code>start_at=\"root\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>start_at=\"2\"</code> : (absolute) start at one level below root (still within the selected branch)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>start_mode</h4>\n<p><em>string</em> : This has only one accepted value &#8211; &#8220;level&#8221; &#8211; and is only applicable for a <code>Branch</code> filter whose <strong>start_at</strong> setting returns<br />\nin an item that is at or above the selected branch item (relatively or absolutely).<br />\nSetting <code>start_mode=\"level\"</code> forces the widget to use not only the resultant starting item<br />\nand its relevant descendants, but also all that item&#8217;s siblings <em>and their descendants</em><br />\n(ref. the widget&#8217;s <code>Level</code> radio option under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>).</p>\n<h4>allow_all_root</h4>\n<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget&#8217;s <code>Allow all Root Items</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>.</p>\n<h4>depth</h4>\n<p><em>integer, default 0 (unlimited)</em> : See widget&#8217;s <code>For Depth</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>.</p>\n<h4>depth_rel_current</h4>\n<p><em>switch, off by default, 1 to enable</em> : See widget&#8217;s <code>Relative to Current Item</code> option, under <em>Secondary Filter</em>,<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/other_notes/#Filters-Section\" rel=\"ugc\">Filters Section</a>.</p>\n<h4>ancestors</h4>\n<p><em>integer, default 0 (off)</em> : Sets an absolute level (positive integer), or a relative number of levels (negative integer), for which<br />\nthe ancestors of the <code>Branch</code> filter item should be included.

It is perfectly possible to have more than one menu item marked as &#8220;current&#8221;, but if CMW has been configured to filter on anything related to a &#8220;current menu item&#8221; it can only choose one. The simplest example of multiple &#8220;current&#8221; items is if you add the same page to a menu more than once, but any other plugin that adds and/or manipulates menu items could potentially cause problems for CMW.</li>\n<li>The widget&#8217;s &#8220;assist&#8221; uses jQuery UI&#8217;s Dialog, which unfortunately (in versions 1.10.3/4) has a <em>really</em> annoying bug in its handling of a draggable (ie. when you drag the Dialog&#8217;s title bar to reposition it on the page) when the page has been scrolled. It is due to be fixed in UI v1.11.0, but meantime I have defaulted the Dialog to fixed position, with an option to toggle back to absolute : it&#8217;s not perfect but it&#8217;s the best compromise I can come up with to maintain some sort of useability.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t it working? Why is there no output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. With all due respect (and a certain amount of confidence in the widget) I would venture to suggest that it is probably due to<br />\nthe option settings on the widget/shortcode. The quickest way to resolve any such issues is to use the widget&#8217;s interactive &#8220;assist&#8221;, and<br />\nensure that you set the current menu item correctly for the page(s) that you are having problems with. However, I am well aware that I not<br />\ninfallible (and it&#8217;s been proven a fair few times!), so if you still have problems then please let me have as much information as possible<br />\n(the shortcode equivalent of your settings is a good start?) and I will endeavour to help.</p>\n<p>Please note that simply reporting &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; is not<br />\nthe most useful of feedbacks, and is unlikely to get a response other than, possibly, a request for more details.</p>\n<p>I should also point out that any other plugin can change any menu, at any time, either before or after this widget does it stuff (even<br />\nprevent it running at all!), so it&#8217;s possible that the problem lies somewhere other than CMW.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the styling of the output coming from, and how do I change it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widget does not supply any output styling (at all!). This is because I have absolutely no idea where you are going to place either the<br />\nwidget (sidebar, footer, header, ad-hoc, etc?) or the shortcode (page content, post content, widget content, custom field, etc?) and everyone&#8217;s<br />\nrequirements for styling are likely to be different &#8230; possibly even within the same web page&#8217;s output. So, all styling is down to your theme,<br />\nand if you wish to modify it you will need to add to (or modify) your theme&#8217;s stylesheet.</p>\n<p>The safest way to do this is via a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">child theme</a>, so that any<br />\nchanges you make will not be lost if/when the main theme gets updated.<br />\nThe best way to test your changes is by utilising the developer capabilities that are available in most<br />\nmodern browsers (personally, I could not do without Firefox and the Firebug extension!) and dynamically<br />\napplying/modifying styles, possibly utilising the custom classes that the<br />\nwidget applies to its output, or the Container options for a user-defined id or class.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is there no (or, How do I get&#8230;) indentation on my hierarchical menu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Firstly, see the answer above, re: styling of the output.</p>\n<p>Any output styling comes from your theme (or possibly some other plugin, but definitely <em>not</em> CMW).</p>\n<p>If other nested lists are displayed with indentation then it is likely (but not guaranteed) that there is a<br />\nclass that can be applied to the CMW output that may result in the desired effect. It is always worth<br />\nchecking out WordPress&#8217;s own Nav Menu widget, on a menu that has sub-menus : if that has indentation then<br />\ncheck the classes <em>it</em> has and try them on CMW (assuming that they&#8217;re not already there!). If it doesn&#8217;t<br />\nhave indentation then you&#8217;re probably going to have to add your own styled class(es) to your theme, and<br />\nthen apply them to CMW.</p>\n<p>Note that quite a few themes &#8220;reset/standardise the CSS&#8221;, by removing all<br />\npadding and margins from lists : trouble is, some of them don&#8217;t then provide any means for indenting<br />\nnested lists.<br />\nAlso, please be aware that any CSS rules that <em>are</em> provided <em>may</em> be location-specific.<br />\nSo, for example, a class may indent nested lists when they are in a sidebar widget area, but not when<br />\nthey&#8217;re in a footer widget area or inserted within content (using a shortcode).</p>\n<p>Purely as an example, [re-]applying indentation to nested unorder lists (ULs) could be as fundamental as &#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>ul ul { margin-left: 1em; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>&#8230;however, I have found that things are generally never that straightforward, particularly when menus with<br />\nlinks in them are involved, so I&#8217;m afraid you might have to experiment a bit.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I create a horizontal menu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Firstly, see the answer above, re: styling of the output.</p>\n<p>Any output styling comes from your theme (or possibly some other plugin, but definitely <em>not</em> CMW).</p>\n<p>If you simply want all the menu items to flow horizontally across the page then you could start with<br />\nsomething along the lines of&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>.menu-widget {\n    list-style-type: none;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n}\n.menu-widget li {\n    display: inline-block;\n    margin: 0 2em 0 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is purely an <em>example</em>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used a class : you may want to change/add to the class, or swap it for an id.<br />\nThere are a number of other ways to do it &#8211; especially if you have multiple levels, or you want vertical<br />\nsub-menus, and/or any sort of interaction. You may want to bring in a jQuery script, or another WordPress<br />\nplugin, to handle it for you, assuming that your theme doesn&#8217;t already provide the functionality you need.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the &#8220;assist&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widget&#8217;s interactive &#8220;assist&#8221; is specific to each widget instance. It is a javascript-driven <em>emulator</em> that uses the widget instance&#8217;s<br />\noption settings &#8211; including the menu selected &#8211; to build a pictorial representation of the menu and show you, in blue, which menu items will<br />\nbe output according to the current option settings. It also shows a very basic output list of those menu items, although it will not apply<br />\nsome of the more advanced HTML-modifying options such as can be found under the Container, Classes or Links sections.<br />\nAny of the displayed menu items can be designated as the &#8220;current menu item&#8221; simply by clicking on it (click again to deselect, or another<br />\nitem to change). The &#8220;current menu item&#8221; is shaded red, with its parent shaded orange and ancestors shaded yellow. All changes in the<br />\n&#8220;current menu item&#8221; and the widget options are immediately reflected by the &#8220;assist&#8221; (text fields in the widget options simply need to lose<br />\nfocus).</p>\n<p>The red cross to the left of each menu item toggles the Exclusions setting for the item and/or its descendants. The button has 3 settings :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Off (dimmed)</li>\n<li>Just this item (white on red)</li>\n<li>This item <em>plus</em> all its descendants (white on red, with a small yellow plus sign)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just click through the toggle states. When the Primary Filter is set to &#8220;Items&#8221;, the green tick buttons to the right of each menu item<br />\nwork in the same way.</p>\n<p>Note that if a green &#8220;Alternate settings&#8221; message is showing then the ticks and crosses buttons will show the approriate Alternative<br />\nsettings but they will be slightly opaque and they will <em>not</em> be clickable!</p>\n<p>Once you are happy with the results, having tested all possible settings of &#8220;current menu item&#8221; (if it applies), then simply Save the widget.<br />\nIf you are using a shortcode implementation, then copy-paste the shortcode text &#8211; at the base of either the &#8220;assist&#8221; or the widget form &#8211; straight into your post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there an easy way to construct the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, use a widget form. The shortcode for all the selected/specified options is show at the base of the widget (v3+) and the base of the<br />\n&#8220;assist&#8221;. The widget does not have to be placed within a widget area, it can also be used from the Inactive Widgets area.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to Save the widget if I am using a shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only if (as of v3.1.5) you are using the <code>widget=N</code> attribute, which refers back to an existing widget instance<br />\nfor its settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get the menu item ids for the &#8216;Items&#8217; option?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the widget&#8217;s interactive &#8220;assist&#8221; (see above). Within the representative menu structure, each menu item&#8217;s id is set in its title<br />\nattribute, so should be seen when the cursor is moved over the item. A simpler way is to check the <code>Items</code> option : the &#8220;assist&#8221; will<br />\nthen show a green tick &#8220;checkbox&#8221; to the right of each menu item and you simply [un]check the items as required. Each selection will be reflected back into the<br />\nwidget&#8217;s <code>Items</code> settings, and also in the shortcode texts.</p>\n<p>The more painstaking way is to go to Appearance, Menus and select the relevant menu; hover over one of the <em>edit</em>, <em>Remove</em>, or <em>Cancel</em> links for an item and look in<br />\nthe URL (the link&#8217;s href) for <code>menu-item=NNN</code> &#8230; the NNN is the menu item id.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get the menu item ids for the &#8216;Exclude Ids&#8217; option?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;assist&#8221; shows a red cross &#8220;checkbox&#8221; to the left of each menu item, and [un]checking the items will reflect back into the options and<br />\nshortcode texts. Otherwise, it&#8217;s the same principle as outlined above for <code>Items</code> ids.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the difference between including Branch Siblings (or Branch Ancestors + Siblings), and switching to &#8216;Level&#8217; instead of &#8216;Item&#8217; in the Secondary Filter section?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you elect to include Branch [Ancestor] Siblings, you will <em>only</em> get the siblings, <strong>not</strong> their descendants (assuming they have any).<br />\nOn the other hand, if you make <code>Starting at</code> use &#8216;Level&#8217; instead of &#8216;Item&#8217; then siblings <em>and their descendants</em> will be added to the filter.</p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that Bravo and Charlie are sibling items immediately below Alpha, and that Bravo is the selected Branch Item,<br />\nwith <code>Starting at</code> set to &#8220;the Branch&#8221; (ie. Bravo). If you switch from &#8220;Item&#8221; to &#8220;Level&#8221; then both Bravo, Charlie, <em>and all their descendants</em>,<br />\nwill become eligible for filtering. If you left &#8220;Item&#8221; enabled, and switched on the inclusion of Branch Siblings, then Bravo and Charlie<br />\nwould both still be eligible, but only <em>Bravo&#8217;s descendants</em> would be; not Charlie&#8217;s!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can CMW handle menus that have items dynamically added by other plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ummm &#8230; Maybe.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t answer this with a definitive Yes or No. By definition, if something is &#8220;dynamic&#8221; then<br />\nit is likely to change. If the plugin that creates those dynamic items does its job correctly then the items<br />\nadded should have unique ids, <em>at least within the context of the menu being manipulated</em>. Also, those items<br />\nwill probably have been set up with a menu_order property that places them appropriately within the menu<br />\nstructure, and the existing menu items will have been modified accordingly. If that is the case then CMW will<br />\nbe able to process them in the right order &amp; structure.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, there is a big caveat here : CMW stores item ids wherever a specific item is targeted &#8211; such<br />\nas <code>Branch=Page One</code>, or <code>Items=1,3,5</code>, or <code>Exclusions=2,4,6+</code>, etc. If any one of those ids relates<br />\nto a dynamically-generated item at the time the widget (or shortcode) is configured, then it is possible that<br />\nthe id may get assigned to a different item, or may not even exist, when it comes to displaying the<br />\nmenu.</p>\n<p>As a contrived example, let&#8217;s say that posts Alpha, Charlie and Echo are dynamically added to a menu, and you<br />\ncan see them when you configure the CMW widget. You decide to Exclude post Charlie, so you configure and save the widget accordingly.<br />\nThen someone adds or changes post Beta such that <em>it</em> now qualifies for dynamic inclusion into the menu &#8211; so, the<br />\nmenu should now contain posts Alpha, Beta, Charlie and Echo. Unfortunately, the ids get re-assigned by the<br />\nplugin doing the dynamic insertion, and Beta now has the id that Charlie was given when you configured CMW, so<br />\nBeta gets filtered out and Alpha, Charlie and Echo get shown!</p>\n<p>So, my advice would be : If you use CMW with a menu that you <em>know</em> contains dynamically-degenerated items,<br />\ntry to avoid specifically targeting any of those items in the configuration. For example,<br />\nsetting <code>Branch=Current Item</code> is fine, but don&#8217;t set <code>Branch=A Dynamic Item</code>; and avoid including or excluding<br />\nspecific dynamic items, use a parent item that exists in the menu instead. If you can do that then there<br />\nshould be no problem.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What classes does CMW automatically assign?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every menu item :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cmw-level-N</code> : every menu item gets this class, with <code>N</code> being the hierarchical level of the item within the menu<br />\nshown (starting at 1). Note that selecting the <em>flat</em> output option does <strong>not</strong> affect the hierarchical level of<br />\nany item.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain menu items :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cmw-current-item</code> : assigned to the menu item that CMW has decided to use as the &#8220;current menu item&#8221;.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-has-submenu</code> : assigned to any menu item that has child items in the output menu.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-menu-item-had-children</code> : assigned to any menu item that had child items in the original base<br />\nmenu, <em>regardless</em> of whether it still has child items in the final output menu.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-an-included-ancestor</code> : assigned to any menu item whose presence is solely due to a request to include ancestors.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-an-included-ancestor-sibling</code> : assigned to any menu item whose presence is solely due to a request to include<br />\nthe siblings of ancestors.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-an-included-sibling</code> : assigned to any menu item whose presence is solely due to a request to include branch<br />\nitem siblings.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-an-included-level</code> :  assigned to any menu item whose presence is solely due to a request to include one or<br />\nmore levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The menu itself (the outermost list element) :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>cmw-fellback-to-parent</code> : assigned to the menu when the fallback for <em>Current Item has no children</em> is set<br />\nto <code>Start at : -1 (parent)</code>, and it has been invoked.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-fellback-to-current</code> : assigned to the menu when the fallback for <em>Current Item has no children</em> is set<br />\nto <code>Start at : the Current Item</code>, and it has been invoked.</li>\n<li><code>cmw-invoked-alternative</code> : assigned to the menu when the output has been produced as a result of<br />\nan <em>alternative</em> configuration being brought into play.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The menu wrapper :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>shortcode_custom_menu_wizard</code> : if the menu is produced from a <code>[cmwizard]</code> shortcode then this class is assigned<br />\nto the element that wraps the output.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I find all my posts/pages that have a CMW shortcode so that I can upgrade them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a button on the widget&#8217;s &#8220;assist&#8221; &#8211; <code>[...]</code> &#8211; that will provide a list of posts/pages whose content, or meta data (custom fields),<br />\ncontains any CMW shortcode. Each entry is a link that opens the item in a new tab/window.

Rewrite, and Change of Approach !</strong> The widget has had a major rewrite! The <code>Children of</code> filter has been replaced with a <code>Branch</code> filter, with a subsequent shift in focus for the secondary filter options, from the children&#8217;s level (0, 1 or more items) up to the branch level (a single item!). This should provide a more intuitive interface, and is definitely easier to code for. <strong>However</strong>, it only affects <em>new instances</em> of the widget; v2 instances are still <strong><em>fully supported</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Please also note that the shortcode tag for v3 has changed to <strong><code>[cmwizard]</code></strong>, with a revised set of attributes. The old shortcode tag is still supported, but only with the v2 attribute set, and only providing v2 functionality, ie. it is the shortcode tag that determines which widget version to use, and the appropriate attribute set for that version.</p>\n<p>There is no automatic upgrade of widget settings from v2 to v3! I suggest bringing up the &#8220;assist&#8221; for the existing v2 widget, running it side-by-side with the &#8220;assist&#8221; of a new instance of the widget, and using them to the compare the desired outputs. I would also strongly recommend that you put your old widgets into the inactive area until you are completely happy with their new replacements.

This is the default setting<br />\nfor a new widget instance, which, if left alone and with all other options at their default, will show the entire selected menu.</p>\n<p>Example : If you wanted to show all the options that were at level 3 or below, you could check this radio and set the select to &#8220;3&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Branch</strong> <em>(radio &amp; select)</em></p>\n<p>Filters by branch, with the head item of the branch being selected from the dropdown. The dropdown presents all the<br />\nitems from the selected menu, plus a &#8220;Current Item&#8221; option (the default). Selecting &#8220;Current Item&#8221; means that the head item of the<br />\nbranch is the current menu item (as indicated by WordPress), provided, of course, that the current menu item actually corresponds to<br />\na menu item from the currently selected menu!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> <em>(radio &amp; textbox)</em></p>\n<p>Filters by the menu items that you specifically pick (by menu item id, as a comma-separated list). The simplest way<br />\nto get your list of ids is to use the &#8220;assist&#8221;, and [un]check the green tick box at the right hand side of each depicted menu item that<br />\nyou want. Alternatively, just type your list of ids into the box.</p>\n<p>If the id is appended with a &#8216;+&#8217;, eg. &#8217;23+&#8217;, then all the item&#8217;s descendants will also be included.</p>\n<p>Example : If you only wanted to show, say, 5 of your many available menu items, and those 5 items are not in one handy branch of the menu,<br />\nthen you might want to use this option.</p>\n<p>Example : If your menu has 6 root branches &#8211; &#8220;A&#8221; thru to &#8220;F&#8221; &#8211; and you were only interested in branches &#8220;B&#8221; (id of, say, 11) and<br />\n&#8220;E&#8221; (id of, say, 19), you could set <code>Items</code> to be &#8220;11+,19+&#8221;, which would include &#8220;B&#8221; with all its descendants, and &#8220;E&#8221; with all its<br />\ndescendants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Secondary Filter</em></strong> <em>(not applicable to an <code>Items</code> filter)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Starting at</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This is only applicable to a <code>Branch</code> filter and it allows you to shift the starting point of your output within the confines<br />\nof the selected branch. By default it is set to the selected branch item itself, but it can be changed to a relative of the branch item (eg.<br />\nparent, grandparent, children, etc) or to an absolute, fixed level within the branch containing the selected branch item (eg. the root<br />\nlevel item for the branch, or one level below the branch&#8217;s root item, etc).</p>\n<p>Example : If you wanted the entire &#8220;current&#8221; branch then, with <code>Branch</code> set to &#8220;Current Item&#8221;, you might set <code>Starting at</code> to &#8220;1 (root)&#8221;.<br />\nAlternatively, if you wanted the children of the current menu item then <code>Starting at</code> could be set to &#8220;+1 (children)&#8221;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Item, if possible</strong> <em>(radio, default On)</em></p>\n<p>This is the default filter mechanism whereby, if <code>Starting at</code> can only result in a single item (ie. it is the branch item itself, or<br />\nan ancestor thereof) then only that item and its descendants are considered for filtering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong> <em>(radio)</em></p>\n<p>Changes the default filter mechanism such that if <code>Starting at</code> results in the selection of the branch item or one of its ancestors,<br />\nthen all siblings of that resultant item are also included in the secondary filtering process.</p>\n<p>Example : If Joe and Fred are siblings (ie. they have a common parent) and Joe is the selected branch item &#8211; with <code>Starting at</code> set<br />\nto Joe &#8211; then the secondary filter would normally only consider Joe and its descendants. However, if <code>Level</code> was enabled instead of<br />\n    Item, then both Joe and Fred, <em>and all their descendants</em>, would be considered for filtering.</p>\n<p>Note that there is one exception, and that is that if <code>Starting at</code> results in a root-level item, then <code>Allow all Root Items</code> must<br />\nbe enabled in order to allow the other sibling root items to be added into the filter process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Allow all Root Items</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>In the right conditions &#8211; see <code>Level</code> above &#8211; this allows sibling root items to be considered for secondary filtering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For Depth</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This the number of levels of the menu structure that will be considered for inclusion in the final output (in complete<br />\nignorance of any subsequent Inclusions or Exclusions).</p>\n<p>The first level of output is the starting level, regardless of<br />\nhow that starting level is determined (see <code>Starting at</code> and <code>Relative to Current Item</code> options). So if you ask<br />\nfor a Depth of 1 level, you get just the starting level; if you ask for a Depth of 2, you get the starting level and<br />\nthe one below it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Relative to Current Item</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>By default, <code>For Depth</code> (above) is relative to the first item found, but this may be overridden to be relative to the<br />\ncurrent menu item <strong><em>if</em></strong>  <code>For Depth</code> is not unlimited <strong>and</strong> the current menu item can found within the selected menu.<br />\nIf the current menu item is not within the selected menu then it falls back to being relative to the first item found.</p>\n<p>Please note that the current item must also be within the constraints set by the <code>Starting at</code> option. In other words, if<br />\ncurrent item is <em>above</em> the <code>Starting at</code> level in the menu structure then it will <strong>not</strong> be used to alter the determination of<br />\nDepth.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Inclusions</em></strong></p>\n<p>These allow certain other items to be added to the output from the secondary filters.</p>\n<p>The first 3 are only applicable to a <code>Branch</code> filter. Please note that they only come into effect when the <code>Branch</code> filter item is at<br />\nor below the <code>Starting at</code> level, and do not include any items that would break the depth limit set in the Secondary Filter options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Branch Ancestors</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Include any ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc) of the items selected as the <code>Branch</code> filter.<br />\nAncestors can be set to go up to an absolute level, or to go up a certain number of levels relative to the <code>Branch</code> filter item.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8230; with Siblings</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>In conjunction with <code>Branch Ancestors</code>, also include all siblings of those ancestors.<br />\nAs with Ancestors, their siblings can be set to go up to an absolute level, or to go up a certain number of levels relative<br />\nto the <code>Branch</code> filter item. Note that while it is possibe to set a larger range for siblings than ancestors, the final output<br />\nis limited by <code>Branch Ancestors</code> setting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Branch Siblings</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>Include any siblings of the item selected as the <code>Branch</code> filter (ie. any items at the same level and within<br />\nthe same branch as the <code>Branch</code> item).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Level</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>This allows an entire level of items to be included, optionally also including all levels either above or below it.<br />\nThis replaces the <code>All Root Items</code> checkbox (pre v3.0.4), which only allowed for the inclusion of the root level items.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Exclusions</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Item Ids</strong> <em>(textbox)</em></p>\n<p>This is a comma-separated list of the ids of menu items that you do <em>not</em> want to appear in the final output.<br />\nThe simplest way to get your list of ids is to use the &#8220;assist&#8221;, and [un]check<br />\nthe red cross box at the left hand side of each depicted menu item.

So if you selected, say, a child<br />\nof &#8220;A&#8221; as the <code>Branch</code> item, then if &#8220;A&#8221; was the current menu item there would be no output with this qualifier.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Secondary Filter&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be within the items as restricted by the secondary filters. So if you<br />\nselected <code>Branch</code> as &#8220;A&#8221;, with <code>Starting at</code> set to &#8220;+1 (children)&#8221;, then if &#8220;A&#8221; was the current menu item there would be no output with this qualifier.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Inclusions&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be in within the items as set by the primary and secondary filters, and the inclusions.</li>\n<li><em>&#8220;Final Output&#8221;</em> : the current menu item has to be in the final output.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fallbacks Section</h3>\n<p><strong><em>If Current Item has no children</em></strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gets applied at the Secondary Filter stage, and its eligibility and<br />\napplication are therefore determined and governed by the other Secondary Filter settings.</p>\n<p>It only comes into play (possibly) when a <code>Branch</code> filter is set as &#8220;Current Item&#8221;, and the <code>Starting at</code><br />\nand <code>For Depth</code> settings are such that the output should start at or below the current item,<br />\nand would normally include some of the current item&#8217;s descendants<br />\n(eg. <code>Starting at</code> &#8220;the Branch&#8221;, <code>For Depth</code> &#8220;1 level&#8221; does <em>not</em> invoke the fallback).<br />\nThe fallback allows for the occasion when the current menu item <em>does not have</em> any immediate children.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unlabelled Select</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Enable the fallback by selecting one of</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Start at : -1 (parent)</em> : overrides the <code>Starting at</code> option to be the immediate parent of the Current Item</li>\n<li><em>Start at : the Current Item</em> : overrides the <code>Starting at</code> option to be the Current Item</li>\n<li><em>No output!</em> : self-explanatory</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8230;and Include its Siblings</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>This will add in the siblings of the item selected above (excluding the &#8220;No output!&#8221; setting!).</p>\n<p>Note : This <em>only</em> adds the siblings, not the siblings&#8217; descendants! However, if the <code>Level</code> radio (in Secondary Filter stage above) is<br />\nset, then all the item&#8217;s siblings <em>and their descendants</em> will automatically be included, and [un]setting this option will have no effect.<br />\nAlso note that if the fallback results in a root-level item being selected as the new <code>Starting at</code> item, then the inclusion of siblings<br />\noutside the current branch depends on the setting of the <code>Allow all Root Items</code> checkbox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>For Depth</strong> <em>(select)</em></p>\n<p>Override the current <code>For Depth</code> setting. Note that any depth value set here will be relative to the current item, regardless<br />\nof the current setting of <code>...Relative to</code>!</p>\n<p>As an example, this option may be useful in the following scenario : item A has 2 children, B and C; B is the current menu item but has<br />\nno children, whereas C has loads of children/grandchildren. If you fallback to B&#8217;s parent &#8211; A &#8211; with Unlimited depth set, then you will<br />\nget A, B, C, and <em>all</em> C&#8217;s dependents! You may well want to override depth to limit the output to, say, just A, B and C, by setting this<br />\nfallback option to &#8220;1&#8221;? Or maybe A, B, C, and C&#8217;s immediate children, by setting &#8220;2&#8221;?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>If no Current Item can be found</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Try items marked Parent of Current</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>This gets applied right at the start of processing, when determining<br />\nwhich of the menu items (if any) should be regarded as the unique &#8220;Current Item&#8221; by this widget.<br />\nUnder certain conditions, WordPress will mark an item as being the parent of a current item &#8230;<br />\nbut there won&#8217;t actually be a current item marked! This occurs, for example, when displaying a full post for which there is<br />\nno specific related menu item, yet there <em>is</em> a menu item for a Category that the displayed post belongs to :<br />\nWordPress will then mark the related Category as being the parent of the current item (the post) even though<br />\nit can&#8217;t mark the post as being the current item (because there&#8217;s no specific item for it within the menu).</p>\n<p>Enabling this fallback will make the widget look for these situations &#8211; only as a last resort! &#8211;<br />\nand set (one of) the found &#8220;parent&#8221; item(s) as the Current Item.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>If more than 1 possible Current Item</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use the last one found</strong> <em>(checkbox)</em></p>\n<p>Occasionally it is possible for CMW to have more than one possible candidate for Current Item. Since there can only be one<br />\nCurrent Item, CMW picks the <em>first one</em> encountered. However, this may cause a problem where, for example, a root level item <strong>and</strong><br />\none of its sub-menu items are <em>both</em> set to list items from Category A, and the page being displayed is a full post that belongs<br />\nto category A : CMW will more than likely determine that the root level item is the Current Item, whereas you really need the<br />\nsub-menu item to be the Current Item (probably to maintain consistency with what is produced when other sub-menu items are &#8220;current&#8221;).</p>\n<p>Enabling this fallback will make CMW use the last-found (instead of first-found) candidate for Current item, ie. when<br />\nthe choice is between a submenu item or its parent item, the submenu item will be used.</p>\n<p>Note that this option is most likely to only have any effect when the <code>If no Current Item can be found</code> fallback (above) is<br />\nenabled, but given that any other plugin/theme could affect the menu item structure that gets passed thru to CMW it is not<br />\nimpossible for other configurations to also be affected.</p>\n<h3>Output Section</h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical</strong> <em>(radio, default On)</em></p>\n<p>Output in the standard nested list format.

For example, let&#8217;s say you<br />\nwant to show the Current Item and its immediate children, <em>but</em> if there isn&#8217;t a Current Item then you want to show the top 2 levels<br />\nof the menu : previously this was not possible solely with CMW, but now you can configure the main widget settings for the &#8220;current item&#8221;<br />\nscenario, and add an Alternative setting for when no Current Item can be determined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>On condition</strong> <em>(2 selects)</em></p>\n<p>Select the appropriate condition for when your Alternative configuration should be used, and also the stage within the<br />\nFilter processing when this condition should be tested for (similar to the Qualifier, <code>Current Item is in</code>). You need<br />\nvalues in both selects for the Alternative to be considered.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Then switch settings to</strong> <em>(textarea)</em></p>\n<p>This should contain a CMW-generated shortcode equivalent of the configuration that you want to switch to. Please note that leaving<br />\nthis empty will <strong>not</strong> prevent the Alternative kicking in if the conditions are set and met! An empty <code>switch to</code> will merely default<br />\nto the CMW&#8217;s base settings (Level 1, unlimited Depth). Also note that Alternatives cannot be nested : a primary configuration is<br />\nallowed one chance to switch and that&#8217;s it, so providing an Alternative-that-has-an-Alternative will not work.</p>\n<p>The Assist <em>will work</em> with an Alternative &#8211; in that it displays the appropriate output &#8211; but it can get confusing as to which<br />\nconfiguration set is being used. There is a message displayed whenever the Alternative kicks in (green if successful, red if it<br />\nshould have kicked in but couldn&#8217;t due to an error in the alternative settings) so please take note of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A bit more information about the <strong>Alternative</strong> is available<br />\nin <a href=\"http://www.wizzud.com/2014/10/03/custom-menu-wizard-wordpress-plugin-version-3-1/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a>.</p>\n",

        "3.0.4": "<p>Fixed a couple of minor bugs with the &quot;assist&quot; and the widget form, and corrected a bug with accessibility mode when javascript is enabled.\nExtended Include Root Items to allow selection by level, as is provided for Exclusions by Level (eg. include_root=1 is now include_level=&quot;1&quot;).</p>",
        "3.0.3": "<p>Fixed problem with WordPress&#039;s update() reporting Invalid Header when activating immediately following installation (as opposed to activating via Plugins page).\nTweaked the generated shortcode to add a self-terminating forward slash. Please note that this tweak is merely a metter of &quot;good practice&quot; : there is no need to update your existing, working, shortcodes!\nAlso removed multiple calls to get_title() when determining the widget&#039;s title, and made some minor updates in readiness for WordPress v4.</p>",
        "3.0.2": "<p>Fixed a bug where the shortcode displayed on new instances of the widget (in admin) did not initially reflect the automatically-selected menu</p>",
        "3.0.1": "<p>Fixed a bug that created new widget instances as legacy version rather than latest; only encountered when other installed plugins inject their own fields into widgets\nAlso added a couple of filters.</p>",
        "3.0.0": "<p><strong>Rewrite, and change of approach</strong> : <strong>! Important !</strong> : existing (version 2) widgets and shortcodes <em><strong>are fully supported</strong></em>. Please <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/changelog/\">read the Changelog</a> <em>before</em> upgrading!\nVersion 3 swaps the <em>Children-Of</em> filter for a <em>Branch</em> filter, with secondary filters to then refine the branch items. It has better filter capabilities - relative and absolute start level, presence of a current menu item at different stages - and adds exclusion of items by id and/or level. A new shortcode - <em>[cmwizard]</em> - has been added to support the v3 functionality.\nChanges that also apply to version 2 widgets include : <strong>Minimum requirement for WordPress now v3.6!</strong>; handling of duplicate menu ids, improved compatibility with Widget Customizer (required due to its incorporation into WordPress v3.9 core), and tweaks to the &quot;assist&quot;.</p>",
        "2.0.6": "<p>Determination of the current menu item has been slightly modified to cope a bit better with occasions where multiple items have been set as &quot;current&quot;.\nThe display of the upgrade notice in the plugins list has been replaced with a simple request to read the changelog before upgrading.</p>",
        "2.0.5": "<p>Fixed a bug to prevent PHP warnings of Undefined index/offset being output.</p>",
        "2.0.4": "<p>Fixed a bug that prevented the container field being removed, and added removal of the menu-item-has-children class when the filtered item no longer has children.\nThe admin widget styling and javascript have been tweaked to accommodate WordPress 3.8.</p>",
        "2.0.3": "<p>Fixed a minor bug with a missing global when enqueuing script and style for the admin.</p>",
        "2.0.2": "<p>Fixed a bug with the Include Ancestors option, where it was not automatically including the Parent.\nFixed a bug in the &quot;assist&quot;, where it was incorrectly calculating Depth Relative to Current Item when the current menu item was outside the scope of the Filtered items.\nChanged determination of the &quot;current&quot; item such that only the first one encountered is recognised, rather than allowing subsequent &quot;current&quot; items to override previous ones.</p>",
        "2.0.1": "<p>Fixed a bug whereby a test for a specific-items filter prevented show-all from producing any output.</p>",
        "2.0.0": "<p><strong>! Possible Breaker! !</strong> My apologies if this affects you, but there are 2 possible scenarios where settings that previously resulted in no output <em>might</em> now produce output :\n+ if you have set a <code>Children of</code> filter, <strong>and</strong> you have changed the <code>Start Level</code> to a level greater than 2, or\n+ if you have set the <code>Children of</code> filter to Current Parent/Root Item, and you have <strong>not</strong> set the &quot;no ancestor&quot; fallback.\n<em><strong>If you think you may be impacted, please check the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-menu-wizard/changelog/\">Changelog</a> for a fuller explanation of what has changed.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>New options :\n+ <code>Items</code> allows specific menu item ids to be listed, as an alternative to the other filters\n+ <code>Relative to &amp;quot;Current&amp;quot; Item</code> allows a limited Depth to be calculated relative to the current menu item\n+ <code>Must Contain &amp;quot;Current&amp;quot; Item</code> requires that there be no output unless the resultant list contains the current menu item.\nRebuilt the &quot;demo&quot; facility as an &quot;assist&quot; wizard for the widget It is now fully interactive with the widget instance, and generates the entire shortcode according to the widget instance settings.</p>",
        "1.2.2": "<p>Bugfix : The fallback for Current Item with no children was failing because the parent&#039;s children weren&#039;t being picked out correctly</p>",
        "1.2.1": "<p>Added a few extra custom classes, and changed the defaults for new widgets such that only the Filter section is open by default.\nFixed Show All processing so that custom classes always get applied, and &#039;Title from &quot;Current&quot; Item&#039; works regardless of filter settings.\nFixed a couple of the shortcode examples in the readme.txt, and added display of the applicable shortcode settings to the demo.html.</p>",
        "1.2.0": "<p>Added custom_menu_wizard shortcode, to run the widget from within content.\nAdded a new fallback for Current Item having no children, and moved all fallbacks into a collapsible Fallbacks section.\nFixed a bug with optgroups/options made available for the &#039;Children of&#039; selector after the widget has been saved (also affected disabled fields and styling).</p>"
