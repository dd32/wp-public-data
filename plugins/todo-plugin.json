This means scrolling through the list of all users to find the person to receive the assignment. This may be tedious if you have many users. Because WordPress groups users by roles, it may be easier to select a recipient from a smaller group of say &#8220;Authors&#8221; or &#8220;Editors&#8221;. The ToDo List Settings page allows you to keep the default total list or you may select a role (group) from which to choose who will get an assignment.</p>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with the Role Manager plugin so you will also be able to select users from groups created by Role Manager.</p>\n<p>Roles:<br />\nBy default only users in the administrator and editor roles can access the Add a ToDo page. However, if you have installed the Role Manager plugin, you may assign persons with other roles to have access to assign tasks.</p>\n<p>To do this you must use Role Manager to create a capability called Add Assignment. You can then activate it for Administrator, Editor and other roles you wish to give the privilege of adding to dos (assignments).</p>\n<p>Assignments Board:<br />\nAn Assignment Board (ToDo List) widget displays in the Dashboard to remind administrators and editors of the pending tasks. The Widget is set to be viewed only by administrators and editors.</p>\n<p>Template Usage:<br />\nA ToDo list can be shown in your template by using a widget. To show your todo list, just put <code>&lt;?php pravin_get_todo(); ?&gt;</code> in your template.</p>\n"
