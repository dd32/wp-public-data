After that insert the following code: <code>&lt;?php if(function_exists('wp_folksonomy_add_form')) wp_folksonomy_add_form();?&gt;</code></li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Won&#8217;t this get spammed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The truthful answer is I&#8217;m not completely sure. I guess there&#8217;s not much benefit to spammers since tagging doesn&#8217;t provide a link. My blog (only a small fry) has had it up about a year and hasn&#8217;t had a problem. However if you do have a problem, you can easily delete all tags from a given IP address. If you have a serious problem, please let me know and I&#8217;ll work in some sort of blacklist or (annoying) captcha or something. Also you can delete all tags from a given IP and limit users to X tags per Y seconds.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
