It&#8217;s not as complex as some other plugins, but it serves its purpose. The widget will adjust itself to the width of the sidebar automatically. It does use some CSS3 for rounded corners and transitioning, but it will look completely fine on other browsers. It also auto updates the Twitter feed for a specified amount of time which can be changed in the settings page.</p>\n",

Tweeter! should now appear in the widgets section.

The code is based on Remy Sharp&#8217;s twitter.js script. He did an excellent job, so if there&#8217;s any praising that should be done, please thank him.</p>\n<p>The post on his site of twitter.js can be found here:<br />\nhttp://remysharp.com/2007/05/18/add-twitter-to-your-blog-step-by-step/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m not going to tell you my password!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The beauty of the plugin, is you don&#8217;t have to. This plugin will never ask for your password, It simply displays your tweets!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
