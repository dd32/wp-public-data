Firstly out of frustration with other global platforms like Poptin, Optinmonster, Hubspot, Privy etc that both don&#8217;t fully support Japanese or have Japanese templates and overcharge for the service. Since then Promolayer has grown and grown and now fully supports English and is bringing world-class Japanese design sense and customer service to the global market.</p>\n<p><strong>Looking for more information about our features?</strong></p>\n<p>For our English-speaking customers, please visit our <a href=\"https://promolayer.io/\" title=\"Promolayers popup builder\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Popup builder</a>s homepage.</p>\n<p>For our Japanese speaker customers you can find information on specifics such as <a href=\"https://promolayer.io/\" title=\"Abadonment prevention popups\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">abandonment prevention popups</a>, <a href=\"https://promolayer.io/%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B4%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1%E5%AF%BE%E7%AD%96/\" title=\"cart abandonment reduction\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cart abandonment reduction</a> and our <a href=\"https://promolayer.io/\" title=\"Popup tool\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">popup tool</a> at the Promolayer homepage.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install the Promolayer plugin via the WordPress.org plugin respositry or by uploading the files to your server.</li>\n<li>Activate the Promolayer plugin.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the Promolayer plugin page and click &#8216;Connect or create a Promolayer account&#8217;</li>\n<li>After logging in you are finished, everything is connected. All Promolayer featues are available on our free plan. For high traffic sites please consider upgrading.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20a%20plugin%3F%20isn%27t%20this%20just%20a%20gateway%20to%20a%20saas%3F'>\nWhy is there a plugin? Isn&#8217;t this just a gateway to a SaaS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our plugin lets us tighten our integrations with WordPress. Aside from one-click installation and auto domain re-configuring when you migrate between environments our plugin also allows for automatic coupon generation and cart integrations with WooCommerce which wouldn&#8217;t be possible without a plugin.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use the plugin you can sign up for a generic account at promolayer.io and just copy paste a single line of code in. Please be aware in doing so you will not have access to all auto configurations and coupon / cart integrations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20popup%20views%20counted%3F'>\nHow are popup views counted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every time the Promolayer plugin generates content on a page a single view is counted. We feel this is a very fair way of counting as if you have a welcome popup set to only show once you will only be charged for a single view per user no matter how many more pages the user sees. If you are a heavy user with popups on every page then each page will be counted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20well%20does%20promolayer%20convert%3F'>\nHow well does Promolayer convert?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Expect conversion rates to be fantastic. Our platform has proven to convert at consistently higher rates than our competitors due to our highly-usable forms and CVR focused features such as real time email domain correction.</p>\n<p>The final conversion rate will depend on your usage of the platform, the deals you offer your customers and the design and triggering you choose. For our paying customers we&#8217;ve got a team of CRO experts on hand to help you maximize your conversion rate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20developer%20to%20get%20started%3F'>\nDo I need a developer to get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Promolayer plugin auto-integrates everything. Just log in and you are ready to go.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20popups%3F'>\nCan I customize the popups?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure you can! Promolayer has a content builder when you can customize most parts of the popups, slide-ins, banners, coupon wheels and fullscreen displays.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20promolayer%20make%20any%20changes%20to%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill Promolayer make any changes to my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Promolayer adds a single script to your site to enable the popup functionality. If you choose to disable it the script will be gone with no lasting changes whatsoever. Promolayer makes no changes to your sites structure, database etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20popups%20and%20forms%20can%20i%20build%20with%20promolayer%3F'>\nWhat types of popups and forms can I build with Promolayer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types things you can create with Promolayer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>announcement popup</li>\n<li>appointment form</li>\n<li>banner bar</li>\n<li>conditional form</li>\n<li>contact button form</li>\n<li>contact form popup</li>\n<li>contact forms</li>\n<li>coupon popup</li>\n<li>custom form</li>\n<li>custom forms</li>\n<li>custom popup</li>\n<li>donation form</li>\n<li>email form</li>\n<li>email forms</li>\n<li>email submit form</li>\n<li>event form</li>\n<li>exit intent popup forms</li>\n<li>exit popup</li>\n<li>feedback form</li>\n<li>floating bar popup</li>\n<li>lightbox popup</li>\n<li>lead generation forms</li>\n<li>mobile popup</li>\n<li>newsletter form</li>\n<li>newsletter popup</li>\n<li>pdf form</li>\n<li>popup form</li>\n<li>previews</li>\n<li>quiz form</li>\n<li>quote form</li>\n<li>quote request form</li>\n<li>registration popup</li>\n<li>scroll trigger popup</li>\n<li>signature form</li>\n<li>signup form</li>\n<li>slide-in popup</li>\n<li>slide-in scroll popup</li>\n<li>star rating form</li>\n<li>sticky bar</li>\n<li>sticky popup</li>\n<li>subscription form</li>\n<li>targeted popup</li>\n<li>teasers</li>\n<li>time on site popup</li>\n<li>upload form</li>\n<li>user registration form</li>\n<li>web contact form</li>\n<li>web form</li>\n<li>welcome mat popup</li>\n<li>woocommerce popup</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
