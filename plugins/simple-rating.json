Plugin will use content filter to add rating based on your settings.</li>\n<li>Manually &#8211; set &#8216;Insertion method&#8217; option to &#8216;Manual&#8217; and insert <code>&lt;?php if(function_exists('spr_show_rating')){echo spr_show_rating();}?&gt;</code> where you need it in your template. <strong>[!]You should remove function from wherever you&#8217;ve inserted it if you plan to remove plugin[!]</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I reset votes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can by pressing &#8220;Reset votes&#8221; button on Simple Rating setting page.<br />\nNote: This only resets votes.

Please read how_to_translate.txt for localization instructions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I broke my site while trying to create my own localization. What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all, you should have read how_to_translate.txt more carefully. Actually, go read it now.
