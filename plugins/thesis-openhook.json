        "description": "<p>If you aren&#8217;t altogether comfortable with editing PHP files to customize your site, OpenHook is for you! An increasing number of themes &amp; plugins come equipped with a myriad of <em>hooks</em> — points within their code which can receive user customizations, known as <em>actions</em> — which can be customized from within your WordPress admin panel using OpenHook!</p>\n<p>OpenHook brings the world of hooks &amp; actions to the mainstream, providing an easy to use admin interface in which you can customize your site without limit, whether you&#8217;re using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or PHP!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Features</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customize the hooks present in your favorite themes!</li>\n<li>Define any hook you want within OpenHook and add an action to it! In addition to the themes which OpenHook supports explicitly, you can now use OpenHook to customize ANY hook (even something as arcane as <code>theme_hook_before_meta_987</code>) in ANY theme or plugin that has ANY hooks, from WordPress&#8217; bare minimum hooks to hooks that are dynamically created and are as infinitely diverse as your site can be!</li>\n<li>Predefined hooks for Astra, the world&#8217;s most popular non-default WordPress theme!</li>\n<li>Also included are hooks for legacy themes Headway, Thesis 1.8.x, Flat, and K2.</li>\n<li>OpenBox, a PHP-friendly &#8220;box&#8221; for Thesis 2</li>\n<li>Quick access to the header &amp; footer hooks of WordPress</li>\n<li>All hooks can be customized with text, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, or shortcodes</li>\n<li>All actions can be selectively disabled</li>\n<li>A variety of actions already present in Flat, Thesis 1.8.x, and WordPress can be selectively disabled</li>\n<li>Hook visualization allows you to see exactly where each hook is fired on the front-end of your site</li>\n<li>Shortcodes\n<ul>\n<li>[email], for masking email addresses from some spam robots</li>\n<li>[global], which makes use of custom fields on a draft page in order to provide a library of reusable strings</li>\n<li>[php], an admin-only shortcode for including PHP code within posts</li>\n<li>[snap], an easy way to include (nearly) always up-to-date screenshots of websites within your posts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ability to disable <em>all</em> shortcodes</li>\n<li>Display of <code>phpinfo()</code> in the admin panel</li>\n<li>Options management, including tools to upgrade from OpenHook 2 and to uninstall (delete) all OpenHook options</li>\n<li>Only users with the <code>edit_themes</code> permission may access OpenHook or its features. If enabled by such a user, other users may use <code>[email]</code> or <code>[global]</code> shortcodes in their entries as well.</li>\n<li>Compatible with ClassicPress!</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>After you have downloaded the file and extracted the <code>thesis-openhook/</code> directory from the archive&#8230;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>thesis-openhook/</code> directory to the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Visit Settings -&gt; OpenHook and customize to your heart&#8217;s content!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use WordPress&#8217; automatic plugin installer. Go ahead, it&#8217;s easier!</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20openbox%20work%20in%20thesis%202.1.x%3F'>\nHow does OpenBox work in Thesis 2.1.x?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, ensure you have enabled OpenBox in the Thesis 2.1.x &#8220;boxes&#8221; screen (OpenBox should be checkmarked and you&#8217;ll need to press the save button).</p>\n<p>Second, visit the Thesis skin editor. Add instances of OpenBox from the boxes dropdown menu, and drag them into your skin template wherever you would like them to be. I recommend opening each instance of OpenBox (via the gear icon) and giving it a unique name so that they are not all &#8220;OpenBox.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Finally, once you have saved your template, return to the regular admin panel and visit Thesis&#8217; skin content page. On this page,  you&#8217;ll be shown a list of all of the custom boxes, including OpenBoxes, you&#8217;ve added to your template, at which point you can edit them to your liking.</p>\n<p>Yes, this is convoluted, and for that I apologize; fortunately, it isn&#8217;t my fault.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20upgraded%20from%20openhook%202.x.x%3B%20where%20did%20all%20of%20my%20customizations%20go%3F'>\nI upgraded from OpenHook 2.x.x; where did all of my customizations go?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>OpenHook 3 and newer does not automatically import pre-existing customizations. You will need to visit the OpenHook settings page accessible at Settings -&gt; OpenHook; once there, you can use the &#8220;Upgrade from OpenHook 2&#8221; button to import your pre-existing customizations to the new schema. You&#8217;ll then need to activate the Thesis &amp; WordPress action groups as needed from the same settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20use%20one%20of%20the%20supported%20themes%3B%20can%20i%20still%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nI don&#8217;t use one of the supported themes; can I still use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! However, what you are able to do with OpenHook will be limited. Still, you will have access to WordPress&#8217; few public-facing hooks, the new shortcodes, and the <code>phpinfo()</code> panel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20the%20supported%20themes%3F'>\nWhere can I get the supported themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astra can be downloaded at <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/\" rel=\"ugc\">the WordPress theme repository</a>.</li>\n<li>Headway can be purchased at <a href=\"http://headwaythemes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Headway Themes</a>.</li>\n<li>Themes which support the Theme Hook Alliance hooks are <a href=\"https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">listed at GitHub</a>.</li>\n<li>Flat is no longer available.</li>\n<li>K2 is no longer available.</li>\n<li>Thesis is no longer available.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20the%20code%20in%20my%20theme%27s%20custom%20functions%20file%3F'>\nWhat about the code in my theme&#8217;s custom functions file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have already modified your theme&#8217;s installation via <code>functions.php</code>, <code>custom_functions.php</code>, or some other similar file, you are welcome to port those changes into OpenHook to manage all of your changes in one place.</p>\n<p>Note that your blog will use both your theme&#8217;s custom functions and OpenHook, so the two are complementary.</p>\n<p>Likewise, your theme&#8217;s custom functions file will be processed <em>after</em> OpenHook, so you can override OpenHook via the custom functions file, if you need to.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%20only%20certain%20users%20on%20my%20site%20access%20openhook%3F'>\nWhy can only certain users on my site access OpenHook?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to the powerful nature of OpenHook, access is restricted only to the highest level of users (i.e., those with the <code>edit_themes</code> permission).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20security%20risks%20involved%20in%20using%20openhook%3F'>\nWhat are the security risks involved in using OpenHook?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>OpenHook is a powerful tool for customizing your site; however, with great power comes, ahem, great responsibility. You are able to use any (ANY!) PHP code within your OpenHook-managed customizations; any other administrators on your site with access to OpenHook can do the same. The freedom allowed means that database credentials could be displayed, your database could be deleted, or your entire site could be defaced. Therefore, while OpenHook certainly can be dangerous, if you have only trusted administrators on your site, you have nothing to worry about.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20k2%20included%3F'>\nWhy is K2 included?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>K2 is a pretty old WordPress theme &#8212; an abandoned one, for all I can tell. However, it was the first theme that ever had a &#8220;hooks&#8221; plugin made for it &#8212; K2 Hook Up, which the first version of OpenHook was based upon. The K2 theme is included to honor its place in WordPress history. OpenHook now allows access to all of its hooks, including one which K2 Hook Up didn&#8217;t! I would also love to see a theme developer pick up K2 and update it for today&#8217;s users. It&#8217;s a great theme that shouldn&#8217;t fade away completely.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
