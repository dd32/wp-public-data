        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20this%20plugin%20free%20and%20how%20long%20it%20will%20be%20this%20way%3F'>\nWhy is this plugin free and how long it will be this way?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our WordPress plugin to optimize images uses API of this free service: https://resmush.it, So as long as these guys allow free image optimization, our plugin will remain free. Still, we have several ideas of how to make optimization free and planning to implement them in our plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20limits%20for%20image%20optimization%3F'>\nAre there any limits for image optimization?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no limits for image optimization in our plugin. The only thing we have is a kind of a restriction of image weight – it should be greater than 5 MB. But our plugin can reduce pre-optimization image weight, so you’ll be able to optimize almost all images you have.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20image%20formats%20do%20you%20support%3F'>\nWhat image formats do you support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Robin image optimizer can optimize jpg, png and gif (both animated or not).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20remove%20exif%20images%20data%3F'>\nDo you remove EXIF images data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>EXIF-data is removed by default. However, you can keep it by disabling the feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20remove%20source%20images%3F'>\nDo you remove source images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Robin image optimizer replaces images with their optimized analogues. The backup option stores source images and allows restoring them in one click.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20re-optimize%20images%20in%20another%20mode%3F'>\nCan I re-optimize images in another mode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By enabling the backup feature in the plugin, you can re-optimize any image using another compression mode.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20plugin%20support%20webp%20format%3F'>\nDoes plugin support WebP format?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, use modern image formats, such as WebP. Robin image optimizer PRO automatically creates WebP copies of your original images.</p>\n<p>Browsers with the WebP format support will display WebP images. Other browsers will replace such images with JPG, PNP, GIF, BMP, etc.<br />\n<a href=\"https://robinoptimizer.com/features/\" title=\"Learn more about PRO version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about PRO version</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='plugin%20has%20integration%20with%20nextgen%20gallery%3F'>\nPlugin has integration with Nextgen gallery?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Robin image optimizer PRO has full integration with NextGen Gallery, which helps to use all the plugin features.<br />\n<a href=\"https://robinoptimizer.com/features/\" title=\"Learn more about PRO version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about PRO version</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
