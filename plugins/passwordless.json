Please use it with caution and at your own risk. If you find bugs please get in touch with me or better yet help fix it on <a href=\"https://github.com/iclanzan/Passwordless\" title=\"Passwordless on GitHub\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h4>Login process</h4>\n<p>Passwordless allows your site&#8217;s users to log in using only their email addresses. After submitting the login form with the email address filled in, the user will receive an email containing a login link which can only be used once. Clicking that link results in the user getting logged in for one year or until he logs out. Unused login links expire after one day.</p>\n<h4>New users</h4>\n<p>New users will have accounts created for them automatically when they try to log in for the first time. In this case their email will also act as the username. Their visible name will be set to &#8216;Annonymous&#8217; but can obviously be changed on the profile page.</p>\n<h4>Login page</h4>\n<p>The plugin changes the login page URI to <code>example.com/login</code> from the default <code>example.com/wp-login.php</code>. If permalinks are disabled the login page will instead be <code>example.com/?login</code>.</p>\n<p>The page can be customized using some of the same filters and action hooks that the original login page used. If a total overhaul of the page is desired, placing a <code>login.php</code> template file in the currently active theme directory will override the plugin&#8217;s login page.</p>\n<h4>Filters</h4>\n<p>I have included some new filter hooks to make it easy to change important aspects of the plugin&#8217;s inner workings.</p>\n<pre><code>passwordless_login_page applied to the login page URI. Filter function argument: string containing the login page URI. passwordless_pass_length applied to the length of the generated passwords/keys. Filter function argument: integer representing the number of characters. passwordless_key_expire applied to the number of seconds a login key is valid for.
