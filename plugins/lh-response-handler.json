It also handles multiple tatus codes (not all plugins have this feature) and can work at the network level if you are using multisite.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20require%20a%20multisite%20installation%3F'>\nDoes the plugin require a multisite installation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No it works on both a single install and multisite</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20behave%20differently%20when%20networked%20activated%3F'>\nDoes this plugin behave differently when networked activated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes when network activated the you can only set redirects on the main site of the multisite, those redirects you set however are applied to all sites within the multisite.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Response Handler, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-response-handler/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-response-handler/</a> . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20other%20requirements%3F'>\nAre there any other requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin relies on the <a href=\"wp_body_open\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_body_open/</a> hook. 98% of themes include it and it is now a standard. If yours does not, create a child theme, or get a better theme.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
