This plugin provides some modifications to the standard editor buttons and features that will make it easier for clients to have as all the formatting options that are good for them and remove options that can break a custom site design.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removes the toggle advanced button.  This is confusing to many users who can&#8217;t find the features they are looking for. Just provides 1 row of editor buttons.</li>\n<li>Removes features such as strike through, underline (should be reserved for links online, not emphasis), full justification (generally looks bad online, but clients like to use it), and several other less used and confusing features.</li>\n<li>Simplifies the dropdown list of heading and block types available.</li>\n<li>Adds several formats that can be added to a paragraph\n<ul>\n<li>Button &#8211; add this format to a paragraph to make the links into &#8220;call to action&#8221; buttons</li>\n<li>Small &#8211; a format for create a paragraph of smaller text, such as a &#8220;terms &amp; conditions&#8221; section.</li>\n<li>Big &#8211; enlarge the text of a certain paragraph.

(Under Settings &gt; Writing)</li>\n<li>Adds the current theme&#8217;s style.css to the editor to make what you see in TinyMCE match the live site better</li>\n<li>Allows for adding additional css files to the editor styles.  These could be external resources such as google font stylesheets, additional theme css you want to load in the editor, or a custom stylesheet. Just add the URL you want to add in the Additional CSS field under Settings &gt; Writing. For multiple files separate the files by comma with no spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Scope</h4>\n<p>As the description states, this plugin makes <strong>opinionated</strong> changes to the default setup.

Don&#8217;t edit the css in the plugin folder because it may get overwritten on updates. Note that <code>editor-style.css</code> applies to the TinyMCE editor on the backend only and <code>frontend-style.css</code> applies to both the editor and the front end of WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
