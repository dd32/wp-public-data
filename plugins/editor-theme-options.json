I&#8217;ve seen similar sentiments.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not use a role editor plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Those work, too! They&#8217;re just quite robust, and this is for a specific role and capability.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work with Multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It should. Please let me know if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the role or capabilities affected?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t any filters or anything like that. If you know how to <code>apply_filters</code>, then you can fork the plugin and have it do what you need.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
