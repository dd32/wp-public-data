        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin directory <code>moojax-comment-posting</code> to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>If you have already included the mootools framework in your template, edit the moojax-comment.php file to comment out duplicate inclusion of the library</li>\n<li>Add the foillowing CSS classes to your template to style error messages and throbbers:<br />\ndiv.error {}<br />\nform.throbbing {}<br />\nFor example, you can &#8216;disable&#8217; the submit button during the submission with:<br />\nform.throbbing input[type=&#8221;submit&#8221;]{display:none;}</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>But the whole point of AJAX is throbbers! How do I add a throbber?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To indicate &#8216;waiting&#8217; this plugin adds the class &#8216;throbbing&#8217; to the form whilst it&#8217;s working. So to for example add a throbbing gif to the textarea whilst the plugin is working, add this to your site CSS:<br />\n.throbbing textarea {background:transparent url(thobber.gif) no-repeat 50% 50% scroll}</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t my plugin working or it works differently than it should?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"mcp@handsandfeetdesign.com\" title=\"Contact the author of the plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact me</a> to report any bugs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don&#8217;t you include a default throbber/CSS file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because in the interest of keeping your site performing well, easily maintained and fast it&#8217;s best to take the time to do these things yourself. Get a nice throbber at ajaxload.info</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the language?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Edit the plugin php file and add the following above the include statements:<br />\necho &#8216;</p>\n<p>    mcpOptions = {<br />\n            removeForm: true,   //Remove the form after a comment is sent?<br />\n            nameError : &#8216;Please give your name&#8217;,<br />\n            emailError : &#8216;Please give a valid email address&#8217;,<br />\n            msgError : &#8216;You forgot a message!&#8217;,<br />\n            inmoderation : &#8216;Thanks for your comment-it is now in moderation&#8217;<br />\n    };</p>\n<p>&#8216;;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This broke my other MooTools scripts on my page!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin comes with the minimum version of MooTools- probably not including what your page needs- simply comment out the line including the mootools file from the php file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Nothing happens on my funky template</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The script uses CSS selectors to identify form elements- re-name things and it wont play well- remember you can add more than one class to elements!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<p>Version 0.1: initial release<br />\nVersion 0.2: added UTF-8 header so &#8216;foreign&#8217; characters were rendered properly in returned comment<br />\nVersion 0.3: corrected issues with IE and dom objects causing foul ups and added throbber preloader<br />\nVersion 0.4: added some extra error handling in case of browser bugs in Safari BETA<br />\nVersion 1.0: Complete re-write, features smaller footprint, smaller namespace, better error handling, more flexible styling, &#8216;language&#8217; options. Bundled MooTools is latest version (1.1).</p>\n"
