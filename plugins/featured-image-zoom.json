You can confirm that the plugin is active by first checking that the function exists:</p>\n<pre><code>    if ( function_exists('cc_zoom_featured_image') ) {\n        echo cc_zoom_featured_image('');\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use this with different values for any of the parameters, the parameter/value can be included in an array:</p>\n<pre><code>    echo cc_zoom_featured_image( array( 'zoomin' =&gt; '2') );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20using%20the%20plugin%20on%20my%20site%20and%20i%20love%20it%2C%20how%20can%20i%20show%20my%20appreciation%3F'>\nI am using the plugin on my site and I love it, how can I show my appreciation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can make a donation via <a href=\"https://cubecolour.co.uk/wp/\" title=\"cubecolour donation page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my donation page</a></p>\n<p>I would also appreciate a review on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/featured-image-zoom/\" title=\"Featured Image Zoom plugin reviews\" rel=\"ugc\">plugin review page</a> if you enjoy the plugin.</p>\n<p>If it isn&#8217;t working for you, please refer to the documentation and existing posts on the plugin&#8217;s forum.

If you have problems and leave a negative review before asking for support, that is very unhelpful and actually tells people more about you than about the plugin.
