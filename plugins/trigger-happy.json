Use existing data (for example, post meta data or product prices) to calculate values for actions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this replace PHP coding?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. While it does allow you to add functionality to your site that would require coding without this plugin, it is not intended to replace coding completely.<br />\nWhat it intends to do is allow non-developers to tweak the functionality of their site without copying+pasting code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you support [Plugin name here]?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are adding support for plugins every week. The supported plugins are listed above.<br />\nIf you need support for a particular plugin, let us know.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I hook into core WordPress hooks such as init or pre_get_posts</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This will be possible in the next version. We are trying to figure out how to allow this while protecting non-developer users from breaking their sites.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I export my flow to a PHP file or plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet &#8211; but this is currently being worked on.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
