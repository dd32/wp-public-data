This requires that the form does not have any redirect functionality enabled upon submission.</p>\n<p>We can then redirect to a different page upon a meeting being booked or the scheduler being closed via settings within the LeanData app in Salesforce.</p>\n<p>The second is on the page that gets redirected to upon submission (thank you page).</p>\n<p>In both cases, we will display the calendar in a popup modal that appears over the page containing the code snippets generated in this plugin and inserted on the page via shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20shortcode%20should%20i%20include%20and%20where%3F'>\nWhich shortcode should I include and where?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We add two different shortcodes with this plugin, ldbookit_form_page and ldbookit_thank_you_page.</p>\n<p>If you wish to display the calendar on the form page, you will just need to insert the ldbookit_form_page shortcode on the page containing your form.</p>\n<p>If you wish to display the calendar on the page your form redirects to upon submission, you will need to insert the ldbookit_form_page shortcode on the page containing your form and the ldbookit_thank_you_page shortcode on the thank you page that your form redirects to upon submission.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20generate%20the%20shortcode%3F%20what%20goes%20into%20it%3F'>\nHow do you generate the shortcode? What goes into it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To generate the JavaScript code that is being inserted on your page via shortcode, we make use of the form provider and experience type values filled out in the plugin configuration settings to determine what code is necessary and the org id, trigger node name, and hidden field name values to configure the parameters the code needs.</p>\n<p>If the data in the plugin configuration settings is missing, incomplete, or hasn&#8217;t been saved, the code generated and placed on your page via the shortcode may be missing or incomplete.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
