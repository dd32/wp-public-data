Increase your maximum upload size to any value – as large as your available disk space allows – and add file chunking to avoid server timeout errors.</strong></p>\n<p>Bypass the upload limits on your server, set by your hosting provider, that prevent you from uploading large files to your media library.</p>\n<p>Big File Uploads automatically detects upload limits set by your server or hosting provider, allows you to increase the maximum upload size, and prevents timeout errors by uploading files in chunks.</p>\n<p>No messing with Apache/PHP initialization files or settings. Just activate the plugin, set the upload size as large as you like, and use the media uploader as you normally would.</p>\n<h3>Big File Uploads Plugin Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Set maximum file upload file size as large as your hosts available storage</li>\n<li>Upload large files to your media without FTP or SFTP</li>\n<li>Built-in file chunking (upload large files in small pieces preventing timeout errors)</li>\n<li>Control maximum upload size limit</li>\n<li>Get smart recommendations based on available space in your temporary uploads directory</li>\n<li>Set maximum file size for each user role with upload capabilities (Administrator, Editor, Author)</li>\n<li>Set the max file size in Megabytes (MB) or Gigabytes (GB)</li>\n<li>Works with any server or hosting provider</li>\n<li>Upload any size file directly to a connected Infinite Uploads cloud account</li>\n<li>Super simple configuration and small plugin footprint that doesn&#8217;t bog down WordPress</li>\n<li>Uploads directory disk utility for quickly analyzing storage usage in your media library</li>\n</ul>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This is just perfect, EXACTLY what I needed to bypass the Cloudflare upload limit.

Even though my host allowed me a bigger upload limit (from 64MB to 200MB) I could’nt make it work. This plugin solved my problem, fast and easy. Right after the installation, I changed the size, and I was able to upload my big file. Works like a charm, thanks guys.” &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/ynskalad/\" rel=\"ugc\">ynskalad</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Easily Increase Maximum File Uploads</h3>\n<p>Fix “The Uploaded File Exceeds the upload_max_filesize” error that is so common when you are trying to upload big files to your WordPress media library. Set a new max file size in Big File Uploads to bypass limitations set by the server or your host.</p>\n<h3>Set Upload Size Based on User Role</h3>\n<p>Big File Uploads lets you set a new maximum upload size limit for all uploads or customize the maximum file upload size for each of your user roles with upload capabilities. Set custom upload limits for Administrators, Editors, Authors, or even custom roles.</p>\n<h3>Uploads Disk Utility</h3>\n<p>The Big File Uploads plugin includes a media library disk utility that shows a breakdown of the files in your uploads directory by type and size. See how many images, videos, archives, documents, code, and other files (like audio) there are and how much space they&#8217;re taking up.</p>\n<h3>FTP/SFTP Client-free File Uploading</h3>\n<p>Upload files right to the WordPress media library without additional credentials and settings. Skip the protocol settings, server names, port numbers, usernames, long passwords, and private keys. Manage upload size and simplify your workflow for yourself or your clients.</p>\n<h3>Widely Compatible</h3>\n<p>Other plugins simply rewrite the .htaccess or php.ini files in an attempt to adjust the server configuration which does not work with many hosts or causes timeouts. Big File Uploads changes how files are processed and uploads files in chunks (separate smaller pieces) before handing it off to WordPress making it universally compatible with most major hosting services.</p>\n<h3>Wanna make your media library infinitely scalable?
