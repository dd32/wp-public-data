Pressing the button conjures up a form that will let you fill out fields about the image, such as the name of the creator, and the URL of the license under which you are using the image.</p>\n<p>Press submit, and the plug-in will paste a nicely formatted string at the current cursor position of your editor.</p>\n<p>I am currently a happy user of my own plugin, and foresee no major changes in the future. Please let me know if there is any feature you could use.</p>\n<p>If you are using WordPress 5.0 or higher with the Gutenberg editor, use the Classic Editor through the plugin of the same name.</p>\n<p>There is a known problem when using this plugin in the Gutenberg editor with the Classic block: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pop-up-doesnt-work-if-classic-block-editor-is-itself-a-pop-up/ .</p>\n<h4>GDPR compliance</h4>\n<p>This plugin helps you helps you format personal data (such as the name and online address of a photographer), but it does not store such data itself.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.9 or newer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that earlier versions of this plug-in function perfectly fine with earlier versions of WordPress. Version 1.2.1 of the plug-in supports WordPress 3.3 through 3.8.x, but does not support the visual editor.</p>\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Photo</em> by John Smith.</li>\n<li><em>Photo of a fire truck</em> by John Smith, <em>some rights reserved</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Rationale</h4>\n<p>My goal in writing this plugin was mainly to help me avoid typos.</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>A setting will enable wrapping the credit line in HTML mark-up, so that you can style it more easily.
