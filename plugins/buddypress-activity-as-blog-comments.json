This is a requirement in order to pull in activity stream data on a blog post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see the activity stream on my blog post</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most important caveat here is an activity record against the blog post &#8211; without this &#8211; no activity stream data will appear (not even a reply/favorite)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a blog post (new_blog_post) or comment (new_blog_comment) is made &#8211; an activity record is created corresponding to the post_ID or comment_ID. This plugin will cycle over the activity records for threaded comments made and display them in the same fashion as BuddyPress activity stream (ability to reply and nested via the same ajax means)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The activity stream is a centralized commenting system in BuddyPress &#8211; the disconnect on the BP Blog portion may alienate user discussion on your site. This is NOT for everyone &#8211; you will lose the powerful internal WP Commenting admin system and will rely only on activity stream for comments.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about WPMU and subblogs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure yet &#8211; if anyone wants to investigate this further &#8211; please drop me a note.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My question isn&#8217;t answered here</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me at</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.etiviti.com/2010/04/buddypress-activity-stream-as-blog-comments/\" title=\"BuddyPress Activity Stream as Blog Comments - Blog About Page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://etivite.com\" title=\"Plugin Demo Site\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Author&#8217;s BuddyPress Demo Site</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/etiviti\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Author&#8217;s Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
