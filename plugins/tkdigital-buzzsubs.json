        "description": "<p>Buzzsub’s cutting edge gamified email subscriber extension for WordPress gives you the ability to make your pop-ups truly interactive. Imagine the scenario, there is a user on your site and they are about to leave. Normally the only incentive you can give them to stay or subscribe is a pop-up with a discount code, free shipping deal etc. Ok. But not engaging. And research has shown that simple exit pop-up discount codes largely go unused. People just don’t feel engaged enough to use them.This is where Buzzsubs comes in.</p>\n<p>Now imagine that instead of a simple pop up window to click, they are faced with a wheel of fortune. And all they need to do is to submit their email and it spins, giving them a chance of winning any number of cool prizes &#8211; from discount codes, free shipping etc. They are locked in. The evidence is clear: by gamifying the exit pop-up you will get 10x more (in most cases even more) email subscribers. Not only that, these subscribers are already actively engaged with your store. You’ve triggered real brand awareness and a desire to find out more. And active subscribers always lead to way higher conversions to sale. That’s bigger profits.</p>\n<p>With Buzzsubs, your store is a winner every time!</p>\n<p>You are required to create a separate Buzzsubs account. After you created your account, you can login to the dashboard using following link:  <a href=\"https://wp.buzzsubs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BuzzSubs dashboard</a>. The extension itself is free, but the service is not. The extensions costs 15$ per month. You will be given 3 trial days and at any time you can cancel the subscription and will not be charged.</p>\n<p>With Buzzsubs, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customise your pop-ups to fit your store</li>\n<li>Change language</li>\n<li>Change colors</li>\n<li>Use pre-installed event templates to increase traffic</li>\n<li>Set automatic scheduling for your pop-ups</li>\n<li>Push all your email subscriptions automatically to MailChimp, Claviey etc.</li>\n</ul>\n",
