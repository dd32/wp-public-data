This data can be updated from the administration console.<br />\nDownloading and entering data into the database takes several minutes: be patient during the activation phase.<br />\nThe selection of the municipalities was created starting from the code of https://wordpress.org/plugins/regione-provincia-comune/</p>\n<p>This plugin uses data made available by ISTAT and the Agenzia delle entrate (Italian revenue agency).<br />\nIn particular, data made available at these URLs are acquired and stored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/6789</li>\n<li>https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/6747</li>\n<li>https://www1.agenziaentrate.gov.it/servizi/codici/ricerca/VisualizzaTabella.php?ArcName=00T4</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data published on the ISTAT website are covered by a Creative Commons license &#8211; Attribution (CC-by) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/it/), as indicated here: https://www.istat.it/it/note-legali<br />\nThe data taken from the website of the Agenzia delle entrate are in the public domain and constitute a public database made available to allow tax compliance and, more generally, to allow the identification of physical persons with the Italian public administrations, through the personal fiscal code.<br />\nThe data are managed by the Ufficio Archivio of the Agenzia delle entrate.<br />\nBy Italian law (art. 52 d.lgs. 82/2005) all data, that are not personal data, published by an Italian administration without an explicit license are open data (CC0).<br />\nThis plugin uses the data taken from the website of the Agenzia delle entrate exclusively for the purpose of carrying out a formal regularity check of the pesonal tax code.<br />\nThis plugin does not include any links on the external pages of the website on which it is used, neither to the Agenzia delle entrate&#8217;s site nor to the ISTAT&#8217;s website; in particular, no kind of direct link is made, nor of deep linking.</p>\n<h3>How to use form tags in Contact Form 7</h3>\n<p>[comune]<br />\n    [comune] has a manager in the CF7 form creation area that allows you to set various options.<br />\nIn particular, it is possible to set the &#8220;kind&#8221; attribute to &#8220;tutti&#8221; (all); &#8220;attuali&#8221; (current), &#8220;evidenza_cessati&#8221; (evidence ceased). In the first and third cases, in different ways, both the currently existing municipalities and those previously closed are proposed (useful, for example, to allow the selection of the municipality of birth). In the &#8220;attuali&#8221; mode, however, only the selection of the currently existing municipalities is allowed (useful to allow the selection of the Municipality of residence / domicile).<br />\nIt is also possible to set the &#8220;comu_details&#8221; option, to show an icon after the select cascade that allows the display of a modal table with the statistical details of the territorial unit.<br />\nThe value returned by the group is always the ISTAT code of the selected municipality. The corresponding mail-tag converts this value into the name of the municipality followed by the indication of the automotive code of the province.<br />\nFrom version 1.1.1 hidden fields are also populated with the strings corresponding to the denomination of the region, province and municipality selected, useful for being used in plugins that directly capture the data transmitted by the form (such as &#8220;Send PDF for Contact Form 7&#8221; )<br />\nThe cascade of select can also be used outside of CF7, using the [comune] shortcode (options similar to those of the form tag for Contact Form 7).</p>\n<p>Starting from version 2.2.0 there is a new filters&#8217; builder for the field [comune] useful for creating fields that allow the selection of a customizable list of municipalities.<br />\nFilters can be used both for CF7 tag, and for WPForms field, and for the shortcode &#8216;comune&#8217;.<br />\nA short youtube video illustrates how to use filters and the filters&#8217; builder.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/seycOunfikk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>[cf]<br />\n    [cf] has a manager in the CF7 form creation area that allows you to set the various options.<br />\nIn particular, it is possible to set various validation options allowing you to find the correspondence of the tax code with other fields of the form.<br />\nSpecifically, it is possible to verify that the tax code corresponds with the foreign state of birth (selected by means of a select [stato]), the Italian municipality of birth (selected by means of a cascade of select [comune]), gender (indicating the name of a form field that returns &#8220;M&#8221; or &#8220;F&#8221;), the date of birth. If multiple fields are used to select the date of birth, one for the day, one for the month and one for the year, it is possible to find the correspondence of the tax code with these values.</p>\n<p>[stato]<br />\n    [stato] has a manager in the CF7 form creation area that allows you to set various options.<br />\nIn particular, it is possible to set the selection of only the currently existing states (&#8220;only_current&#8221; option) and it is possible to set the &#8220;use_continent&#8221; option to have the select values divided by continent. The field always returns the ISTAT code of the foreign state (code 100 for Italy). The ISTAT code is the type of data expected by [cf], for the verification of the tax code.</p>\n<p>[formsign]<br />\n    [formsign] NOW (v. 2.2.1) has a manager in the CF7 form creation area.<br />\nTo use it, simply insert the tag followed by the field name in your own form: for example [formsign firmadigitale]. This tag will create a hidden field in the form with attribute name = &#8220;firmadigitale&#8221; and no value.<br />\nTo use the code, it is also necessary to insert the [firmadigitale] mail-tag in the email or emails that the form sends (it is recommended at the end of the email).<br />\nIn this way, in the email body it will be written a two-lines sequence containing:<br />\nan md5 hash of the data transmitted with the module (not of the content of any attached files)<br />\na digital signature of the hash.<br />\nIf you use html email, you can style the output using a wp option named: &#8220;gcmi-forsign-css&#8221; with a css as value.<br />\nThe signature is affixed by generating a pair of RSA keys, attributed to each form.<br />\nBy checking the hash and the signature, it will be possible to verify that the emails have actually been sent by the form and that the data transmitted by the user correspond to what has been registered.<br />\nTo facilitate data feedback, it is preferable to use &#8220;Flamingo&#8221; for archiving sent messages. In fact, in the Flamingo admin screen, a specific box is created that allows feedback of the hash and the digital signature entered in the email.<br />\nThe system is useful in the event that through the form it is expected to receive applications for registration or applications etc&#8230; and avoids disputes regarding the data that the candidates claim to have sent and what is recorded by the system in Flamingo.</p>\n<h3>Code</h3>\n<p>Want to check the code? <a href=\"https://github.com/MocioF/campi-moduli-italiani\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/MocioF/campi-moduli-italiani</a></p>\n",

In fact, in the Flamingo admin screen, a specific box is created that allows feedback of the hash and the digital signature entered in the email.<br />\nThe system is useful in the event that through the form it is expected to receive applications for registration or applications etc&#8230; and avoids disputes regarding the data that the candidates claim to have sent and what is recorded by the system in Flamingo.</p>\n<h3>Code</h3>\n<p>Want to check the code? <a href=\"https://github.com/MocioF/campi-moduli-italiani\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/MocioF/campi-moduli-italiani</a></p>\n",
