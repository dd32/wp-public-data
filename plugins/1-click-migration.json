        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20for%20the%20backup%20or%20restore%20process%3F'>\nHow long does it take for the backup or restore process?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Depending on your site size it could take up to 30 minutes for each to finish. We strongly recommend performing a cleanup before backing up and disabling all other plugins. If you have FTP access look in your wp-content folder and remove any unused files, old backups etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20do%20if%20backup%20or%20restore%20times%20out%3F'>\nWhat do I do if backup or restore times out?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try backup up or restoring piece by piece using the advanced menu. If that also fails you need to contact your hosting company and increase the server resources. We&#8217;ve had successfully migrations that were over 2GB in size.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20skip%20some%20files%20from%20migration%20such%20as%20uploads%20or%20plugins%3F'>\nCan you skip some files from migration such as uploads or plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can use the advanced drop down and select what you want excluded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20support%20for%20%3Cstrong%3Ewordpress%20multisite%3F%3C%2Fstrong%3E'>\nDo you offer support for <strong>WordPress Multisite?</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20time%20do%20i%20have%20to%20restore%20the%20site%3F'>\nHow much time do I have to restore the site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have 24 hrs from the time the backup was completed. If you miss the time window you would need to initiate the backup again before you can restore. Once paid you will have 7 days of unlimited migrations when using the same email address.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20update%20all%20urls%20in%20the%20database%20with%20the%20new%20domain%3F'>\nDo you update all URLs in the database with the new domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, as of version we automatically perform a search and replace in all database tables and update the new URL everywhere including serialized entries.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
