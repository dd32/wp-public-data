To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type “Woo Daily Options” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<p>The full files are available on wordpress.org, or from <a href=\"https://github.com/jakewhiteley/woocommerce-daily-coupons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n"
