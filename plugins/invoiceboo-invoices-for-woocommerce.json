This not only provides a faster checkout, but also minimizes <a href=\"https://www.cartbounty.com/\" title=\"Abandoned cart recovery\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cart abandonment</a> and can increase sales ü§ë.</p>\n<p>Once the order is placed and is assigned any of the selected WooCommerce order statuses (&#8220;Processing&#8221;, &#8220;Completed&#8221;, &#8220;On Hold&#8221; etc.), customer receives a unique link to their Invoice page where they can include additional business details that are required for accounting purposes. From here customers can Print and Download their invoices as PDF documents.</p>\n<p>This plugin can be especially useful for businesses selling virtual or downloadable products as they do not require shipping options.</p>\n<h3>For guests and registered customers</h3>\n<p>InvoiceBoo does not require customers to be registered or signed in to view, update or download their invoices.
