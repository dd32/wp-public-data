Plus, the reporting dashboards allow me to know where our sales game is strong and where we can still improve with just a few clicks. Needless to say, I&#8217;m all in on HubSpot.” – <strong>Joe Howard, Founder &amp; CEO, WP Buffs</strong></p>\n<p>“HubSpot educates marketers beyond just the anonymous web analytics they get from Google Analytics. Instead, it digs down to individual users.” – <strong>Michael Shoup, Founder / CEO, 12South Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>“HubSpot dramatically cuts down the time I spend on marketing. We used to spend tons of time generating very few inbound leads, but those numbers have gone through the roof with minimal effort.” – <strong>Brian Ruhlmann, Director of Sales &amp; Marketing, AdmitHub</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Their plugin and sales CRM made our sales process so much more professional and kept us fully organized as we grew from 1 salesperson to 4. Plus, the reporting dashboards allow me to know where our sales game is strong and where we can still improve with just a few clicks. Needless to say, I&#8217;m all in on HubSpot.” – <strong>Joe Howard, Founder &amp; CEO, WP Buffs</strong></p>\n<p>“HubSpot educates marketers beyond just the anonymous web analytics they get from Google Analytics. Instead, it digs down to individual users.” – <strong>Michael Shoup, Founder / CEO, 12South Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>“HubSpot dramatically cuts down the time I spend on marketing. We used to spend tons of time generating very few inbound leads, but those numbers have gone through the roof with minimal effort.” – <strong>Brian Ruhlmann, Director of Sales &amp; Marketing, AdmitHub</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n",
