        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20kind%20of%20questions%20can%20i%20ask%20billy%3F'>\nWhat kind of questions can I ask Billy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can ask Billy to be your WordPress assistant. Ask about WordPress or questions specific to your site.<br />\nYou can also request to write new content or to create a new widget for you to use on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20information%20does%20billy%20know%20about%20my%20site%3F'>\nWhat information does Billy know about my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Billy has access to your site&#8217;s theme, template, editor and WordPress version.<br />\nBilly can access your site&#8217;s content and configuration, but will ask for your approval when the information is private.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20new%20ai-generated%20widget%3F'>\nHow do I create a new AI-generated widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Navigate to &#8216;Build It For Me&#8217; in your WordPress dashboard and click on the &#8216;Widget Builder&#8217; submenu to generate a new widget. Ask a bot to build the widget you want.<br />\nStart with something simple and you can continue asking the bot to do changes until you&#8217;re pleased with the result.<br />\nIf at some point you don&#8217;t like what the bot did, use the UNDO button. It&#8217;s better to not complicate your project too much.<br />\nClick &#8216;Reset&#8217; to start over.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kind%20of%20widgets%20can%20i%20create%3F'>\nWhat kind of widgets can I create?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Billy builds exclusively Elementor widgets, so you will need the Elementor plugin installed to use them, even if you don&#8217;t usually edit your pages with Elementor.<br />\nWe recommend sticking to building widgets that work only on the front-end.<br />\nSome examples we&#8217;ve seen: A Solar System animation, a refinancing calculator, a pricing estimator.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20my%20widget%3F'>\nCan I customize my widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, in two ways. You can ask the Builder to code the widget however you want it.<br />\nYou can also click &#8220;Add Elementor Controls&#8221; to ask the bot to add controls so that, once you save the widget, you can customize it each time you pull it into a page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20elementor%20controls%3F'>\nWhat are Elementor Controls?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Elementor controls allow you to modify things like text and colors when you use the widget in a page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20bot%20not%20doing%20what%20i%20ask%20it%20to%20do%3F'>\nWhy is the bot not doing what I ask it to do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The UNDO button is your best friend. The bot can sometimes fail to understand what you&#8217;re asking, try using the UNDO button and ask with different words.<br />\nIf the button didn&#8217;t do what you expected it&#8217;s always best to use the UNDO button than to continue asking for changes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20limit%20to%20how%20many%20widgets%20i%20can%20create%3F'>\nIs there a limit to how many widgets I can create?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This might depend on your API limits with Build It For Me. Please refer to their official documentation for more details.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20a%20widget%20i%20created%3F'>\nHow do I use a widget I created?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you like the widget you&#8217;ve developed, hit &#8216;Save&#8217;, provide a name for your widget (it can&#8217;t start with a number, can&#8217;t contain special characters). Then you&#8217;ll see the widget in your website under the name you saved it with.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20restart%20the%20builder%20from%20scratch%3F'>\nHow do I restart the Builder from scratch?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the &#8216;Create widget&#8217; page click the broom icon &#8216;Reset&#8217; to start over.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20edit%20a%20widget%3F'>\nCan I edit a widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can iteratively work on your widget by asking the bot to do changes to it. But once you hit the reset button to create a new widget, you can&#8217;t go back to edit an old widget.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20can%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWho can use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your wordpress users with editor permissions and higher.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20help%3F'>\nHow can I get help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will answer your questions and appreciate any feedback at pablo@builditforme.ai</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20setup%20the%20blog%20generator'>\nHow to setup the blog generator\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Step 1: Access your wordpress environment, on the left hand side select “Build It For Me”.<br />\nStep 2: Go to the “Writer Settings” tab and fill out the settings for your blog post<br />\nAuthor’s username: You need to decide which user will be credited for what Billy writes. We recommend you create a new user as “Author” to use for this purpose.<br />\nDescribe your website / company: These are the instructions for the bot that generates text. Explain to it what your company does, share any links you want it to promote and the tone you want to use. Ideally, match the language you want to generate the posts in.<br />\nDescribe the image style: These are the instructions for the bot that generates images. Specify the style of the images. Because this bot doesn’t generate text, the language is less relevant.<br />\nStep 3: Hit UPDATE<br />\n<em>Settings are configured at the user level. Two users in the same company can have different settings.</em><br />\n<em>If you are not an admin, you&#8217;ll have to ask an admin to create an &#8220;application password&#8221; for the account you want to use as the author.</em></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20create%20a%20post'>\nHow to create a post\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to WordPress with your own account.
