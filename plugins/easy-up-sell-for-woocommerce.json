Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re selling 2 subscription types: a basic subscription, and a premium subscription. You notice that most of your customers are buying the basic subscription because it&#8217;s cheaper, but you really want to encourage them to upgrade to the premium subscription so you can maximize your revenue.</p>\n<p>To make it extra enticing, you want to offer a special price on the premium subscription, but you ONLY want it to be available to people who have purchased the basic subscription.</p>\n<p>What you would do is create a new WooCommerce subscription product with the special price. In the Prerequisite Purchase drop down, you would select the basic subscription, and save the new product. Now, any time a customer visits your site, the plugin will check to see if they have purchased the basic subscription AND that the subscription is still active. If these 2 criteria are met, then the customer will see the special. The rest of your customers will not be able to see it, and will have no idea it&#8217;s there.</p>\n<p>And, that&#8217;s it! It&#8217;s that easy.</p>\n<h3>Support and Feedback</h3>\n<p>If you run into any issues or bugs, or if you need the plugin to do something it doesn&#8217;t, don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to us: <a href=\"mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#x40;&#x66;u&#106;&#105;&#x2d;&#x39;&#x2e;&#099;&#111;&#109;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support@fuji-9.com</a>.
