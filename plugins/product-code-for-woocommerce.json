        "description": "<p>This is a user-friendly plugin that many website designers, developers, and business owners look for when they require an additional product code field. It is often used for an inventory control number, internal stock number, or bin location. The plugin allows you to add a product identifier to each or some variable or single items in Woocommerce. The custom field value can be passed through during order fulfillment, referenced from each item ordered. The field value can be viewed user side if desired or turned off if not.</p>\n<p>A unique product code is often added in addition to the GTIN, EAN, SKU, and UPC throughout the order process. However, all current plugins that might address this need entail complex setups and functions which result in extra memory usage, system conflicts, and frequent updates. This plugin eliminates all those hurdles by providing a simple solution without excessive options.</p>\n<p>Simply install, enter your product codes within each product post (variation or single), and publish. Nothing more to it than that! If you don&#8217;t want customers to be able to see the unique product code, the user-side display can be turned off in setup. The field label can be easily changed in setup too, to read ISBN for example or Bin Number, Stock Number, EAN, or JAN. Any value can be created and entered as a single new field.</p>\n<p>The added fields are compliant with mappable data import and export schemes. This same compliance allows the fields to be included in a Google Merchant product feed using custom mapping. It also provides support for Schema.org/Product with an option to choose the property name (GTIN, EAN, UPC, ISBN) to set inside the structured data.</p>\n<p>You can also search product codes using the WordPress default search from the user side as well as from the administrator Woocommerce product list page on the backend. It is compatible to search product codes using the popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/\" rel=\"ugc\">Relevanssi</a>, <a href=\"https://searchwp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SearchWP</a> and, <a href=\"https://ajaxsearchpro.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ajax Search Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s languages include English, Spanish, French, German, and Russian.</p>\n<p>As of <strong>version 1.3.1</strong>, the Product Code primary field is now displayed by default in the WooCommerce product panel, switchable to off from the top tab dropdown if desired. If your second Product Code field is activated from settings, it will appear to the right of the Product panel. Additionally, the Product Code primary field now appears in the WooCommerce Quick Edit panel. Turn on the second Product Code and it will display after the primary field in the Quick Edit panel. Make sure you clear your caches (website and browser) if you are updating from the previous plugin.</p>\n<p>As of <strong>version 1.4.1</strong>, an administrator can choose to hide the default and secondary product code from the user-side product posts while the other display injections still work (checkout, cart, and receipts).</p>\n<h3>Technical Details for Release 1.4.6</h3>\n<p>Load time: 0.279 s; Memory usage: 3.61 MiB<br />\nPHP up to tested version: 8.3.4<br />\nMySQL up to tested version: 8.0.36<br />\nMariaDB up to tested version: 11.3.2<br />\ncURL up to tested version: 8.6.0, OpenSSL/3.2.1<br />\nPHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 compliant.</p>\n<h3>Using in Multisite Installation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Extract the zip file contents in the wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.
