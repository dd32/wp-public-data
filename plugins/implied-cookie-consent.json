When the user navigates to a second page or clicks on the dismiss button, the bar is hidden. This approach is similar to that used on many government websites including gov.uk.</p>\n<p>The plugin has settings in the admin which allows the colour and content of the information bar to be customised.</p>\n<p>An example cookie information page will be created on installation of the plugin. It is up to you to correctly populate the text on that page.</p>\n<h4>Why another cookie plugin?</h4>\n<p>There are many WordPress cookie plugins available but none of them seemed to do what I wanted. They typically tend to provide a very intrusive experience for the user (e.g. via modal popups), or are too complex to configure.</p>\n<h4>Technical Details</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses jQuery (JavaScript) to show and hide the information bar.
