        "faq": "<p>Usage: &#8211; create a premium-post (menu: Premium Posts) &#8211; at the end of the edit form you can set a price (in EUR &#8211; format with decimal point, ex. 4.99 ) &#8211; insert the premium-post into any page using the shortcode<br />\n  [infin_payment_posts id=1714] or [infin_payment_posts id=&#8217;all&#8217;] &#8211; displays the premium-content with the ID 1714 or all of them&#8230;</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>What&#8217;s new: The callback function (which is called by the payment-framework) no longer resides in the wordpress-plugin-folder &#8211; but is located at infin&#8217;s own servers. In this way, the plugin checks over http if a given premium content has been paid or not (yet).</p>\n<p>Demo:</p>\n<p>Go to: http://blog.infin.de/?page_id=1692</p>\n<p>There you see possible premium-content for 0.10 EUR and a button &#8220;Pay with infin-Payment&#8221; Press the &#8220;Pay&#8230;&#8221; button (do not bother &#8211; it won&#8217;t cost you money ðŸ™‚ A payment-window opens. Select there Germany as country (in the bottom right part of the window).<br />\nNormally you will call a premium-rate-phone-number to pay but, for demo-purposes let&#8217;s just pretend you called and got the TAN &#8220;infin&#8221;. So, enter &#8220;infin&#8221; (without the quotes) into the field and press Next. Payment should look fine and, after, closing the payment-window, the premium-content on our blog should be visible (as long as your browser-session is active).</p>\n<p>Thanks for testing ðŸ™‚</p>\n"
