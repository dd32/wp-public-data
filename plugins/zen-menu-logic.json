Tested in WP 3.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added uninstall functionality to delete option used by plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.21</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the text in the options panel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a design flaw in v1.1 where I assumed that the name of the primary menu location</li>\n<li>was primary.  That is the way it is in the 2011 theme.  But not all themes are like that.</li>\n<li>So this new version has an options page as a menu item of the Settings Menu that lists all</li>\n<li>the menu locations by name.  And you need to select which one is the primary, or, in other</li>\n<li>words, which menu location the menu logic will work on.  Please let me know if there are</li>\n<li>any questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>simplify code that tests is this plugin is supported by the theme</li>\n<li>replace code that implemented the change in menu to use the wp_nav_menu_args filter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>write menu logic code</li>\n</ul>\n",
