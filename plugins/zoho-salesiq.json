Zoho SalesIQ&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/live-chat-for-wordpress.html?utm_source=wordpresswebpage&amp;utm_medium=salesiqpluginpage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress plugin</a> is super easy to use and lets you both engage with your website visitors in real time and view your prospects&#8217; detailed website footprint.</p>\n<h4>What do we have in the bag for you?</h4>\n<h4>Forever-free for 3 users</h4>\n<p>The plugin is free for up to 3 users and will come with all the basic features like live chat, visitor tracking, and file sharing that you expect in live chat software. We also have paid plans for users looking for even more punch.</p>\n<h4>Visitor tracking</h4>\n<p>Visitors are organized in four concentric rings based on the criteria you set, with the hottest prospects in the inner rings and the coldest visitors moved outside the rings. With this you can easily prioritize visitors and not waste your firm’s time and resources on junk leads.</p>\n<h4>Automated messages</h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t wait for visitors to message you—instead, reach out to visitors on high-intent pages like your pricing or contact us pages and spark their interest with proactive chat triggers.</p>\n<h4>Chatbots</h4>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a hardcore coder or someone who doesn&#8217;t know the &#8220;C&#8221; of coding—SalesIQ has something for everyone. With our codeless website chatbot builder, you can build a fully functional chatbot for your website without writing a single line of code. For the coders out there, we have a programming interface with which you can customize and automate your chatbot as needed.</p>\n<h4>Built-in audio call and screen share to the rescue</h4>\n<p>Your operators should be smart enough to resolve almost any issue your visitors face. However, there might be issues that can’t be resolved in a couple of texts. In that case, operators can use our built-in audio call and screen share feature to solve even the most complex queries with ease.</p>\n<h4>Typing preview</h4>\n<p>No need to assume what your customer is typing. Our live chat helps you see what they&#8217;re typing in the chat box in real time, enabling you to answer their queries in a matter of seconds.</p>\n<h4>Chat routing</h4>\n<p>Customers expect immediate help without being endlessly traded from agent to agent. Direct chats to the right department or staff based on a customer&#8217;s traffic source, landing page, number of visits or chats, lead stage, and more.</p>\n<h4>Real-time chat translation</h4>\n<p>Assist your customers and visitors in languages they&#8217;re comfortable with. Our website live chat software automatically detects the language of incoming chats and performs two-way chat translation in real time.</p>\n<h4>What makes Zoho SalesIQ the best?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Trusted by over 450,000 businesses</li>\n<li>Most cost-efficient customer engagement software in the industry</li>\n<li>We don&#8217;t compromise on your privacy</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Testimonials</h4>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zoho SalesIQ gave us the best support for integration, and along with that, we came to know that SalesIQ is just not serving our bot purpose, but they had so many features for our live agents also.<br />\n  &#8211; Mahindra &amp; Mahindra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our website is very interactive for designing clothing online, and that comes with a number of questions that customers have.
