There is an option to block IP addresses that have been blocked by Spamcop using their blacklist as well.<br />\nTo prevent bots from using brute force attacks and scanning your site there is an option to block users that fail to login a set number of times or use blocked user names. You can also block IP addresses that generate a large number of 404 errors. This plugin will also prevent WordPress User Enumeration and automatically block anyone attempting it.</p>\n",

        "changelog": "<h4>4.4.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed typo in 4.4.3.  Used _transient_timeout instead of _site_transient_timeout</p>\n<h4>4.4.3</h4>\n<p>Changing transients to use site transients for better compatibility with multisite installs<br />\nAdded check for transients to ensure that they expire rather than living forever<br />\nAdded check for empty array when no honeypot positions are selected</p>\n<h4>4.4.2</h4>\n<p>Added DNS_A argument to dns_get_record calls to only pull A records since that is all the plugin uses.<br />\nMade the logic a little more efficient for deciding if a DNS record was returned.</p>\n<h4>4.4.1</h4>\n<p>Added check to make sure honeypot link isn&#8217;t included in post excerpt if the_content hook is used.</p>\n<h4>4.4</h4>\n<p>Changed the way activity count is updated to use the primary key so the database table will not get locked.</p>\n<h4>4.3.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed missing ajax save function for content honeypot.<br />\nFixed check on settings page to make sure honeypot locations have been saved.</p>\n<h4>4.3</h4>\n<p>Added options to set the locations where the honeypot will appear.</p>\n<h4>4.2.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed PHP warning when checking for a temporary whitelist entry and one doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<h4>4.2.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed call to explode that was missing the delimiter</p>\n<h4>4.2</h4>\n<p>Changed how the server variables are handled.

Changed $wpdb-&gt;prefix to $wpdb-&gt;base_prefix</p>\n<h4>4.1</h4>\n<p>Added functionality to temporarily whitelist an IP if it has passed the Project Honeypot and Spamcop blacklist checks. This prevents the same IP being checked multiple times while a user is visiting a site.<br />\nFix for dropdown css on IP list pages.</p>\n<h4>4.0.9</h4>\n<p>Added the ability to enter a . in the band username field.<br />\nAdded functionality to automatically whitelist the web servers IP address so it doesn&#8217;t block itself while doing a health check.</p>\n<h4>4.0.8</h4>\n<p>Improved input validation and sanatization.<br />\nAdded a checkbox to the IP lists so all entries can be selected.<br />\nAdded functionality to submit the search query when the enter key is pressed in the search box.<br />\nChanged the way notes are stored so line breaks will not be stripped.</p>\n<h4>4.0.7</h4>\n<p>Fixing bug with login monitoring.

Now all IP lists are managed at the network level for multisite installs.</p>\n<h4>2.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed a bug that left details of the IP list entries escaped for MySQL when displaying them on the admin page.<br />\nFixed a bug that prevents the user from selecting Project Honeypot or Spamcop Entry when editing an entry in the blocked list.</p>\n<h4>2.1</h4>\n<p>Moved the code to sanitize server variables for use in determining the visitors IP so that it will not throw an undefined index warning.</p>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<p>Added search functionality to search the different IP lists and make it easier to find an entry.<br />\nFixed a bug that stopped the loading indicator from displaying when data was submitted.</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Added indicator to show sorting direction in ip lists.<br />\nAdded tabs to the settings page.</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Added options to paging so you can go to any page in the list and change the type of records in the lists.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Added paging to the ip list pages.</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>Adding sanitization to the server keys used to prevent injection from request headers.<br />\nEnsuring that the IP being checked is an IP 4 address.<br />\nFixed typo in the spamcop check function that checked the address of the visitor and not the address on the blocked list.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>Initial version.</p>\n"
