        "description": "<h4>POWERFUL TOOL TO GROW YOUR ONLINE STORE FAST</h4>\n<p>Alister is a free powerful tool that will help your online store grow and expand by adding products from AliExpress website. You can add one or multiple AliExpress product links to your own inventory table. It’s like having a warehouse full of products ready for import.</p>\n<h4>GOLD MINE OF ALIEXPRESS PRODUCTS</h4>\n<p>If you don’t have a lot of time to search for the best products on AliExpress, Alister will do that for you. You can add your own ‘import rules’ using criteria such as product, seller ratings etc and ask Alister to fill your inventory for example on a weekly basis. This way you will stay on top of the selling trends and never run out of new products in your store.</p>\n<h4>LIKE A DIGITAL WAREHOUSE FULL OF STOCK</h4>\n<p>All the product links that you or Alister add automatically, will land in the inventory table. From here you can briefly preview the item and ‘load’ it to the product editor. The best part is that you can select multiple products and they will load to a new tab ‘GROUP’ of products that you can edit simultaneously to be even faster.</p>\n<h4>AI GENERATOR FOR THE PRODUCT TITLE AND DESCRIPTION</h4>\n<p>This tool will do the creative writing for you. With the AI generator you can have a new title &amp; description of the product within a few clicks.</p>\n<h4>EASY TO USE PRODUCT EDITOR</h4>\n<p>Change the product details, add more images, set the prices and edit the product variations all on one page. There’s even a Translator tool to help you be more efficient with languages when translating product properties.</p>\n<h4>PRICE SYNCHRONISATION AND RULES</h4>\n<p>Set up your product price rules (use a multiplier field to multiple AliExpress price i.e. x 2) to be synchronised with AliExpress prices. So if they change the price &#8211; it will change accordingly on your website.</p>\n<h4>EXPERT SUPPORT</h4>\n<p>Our team is always happy to hear from you and provide incredible support. Ask your questions in the support forum or contact us directly.</p>\n<h4>GET STARTED</h4>\n<p>Installation is free, quick, and easy. Alister doesn’t require account creation.</p>\n<h4>FEATURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>import one or multiple AliExpress products at once</li>\n<li>inventory table with preview of the products</li>\n<li>automatic import for products according to your criteria on AliExpress</li>\n<li>AI product title generator</li>\n<li>AI product description generator</li>\n<li>Save your own product description templates for later</li>\n<li>Interactive picture gallery with drag and drop feature</li>\n<li>Set up your own pricing rules</li>\n<li>Automatic price adjustment: for example if a  supplier on AliExpress increases their prices, your prices will increase accordingly</li>\n<li>Product variations editor</li>\n<li>Translate feature for the product properties</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>HOW TO USE TO ALISTER (SIMPLIFIED VERSION)</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Paste one or multiple AliExpress product links and hit ‘add’ button to add the products to the inventory table below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional: set up the import rules</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Firstly, set your own criteria of what kind of products you would like to add to the inventory table. For example, maybe you want to have top ten best rated cat beds imported on a weekly basis (btw this is called polling).</p>\n<p>Give this rule a name ex.: ‘Top selling cat beds’.</p>\n<p>Paste the URL to the cat bed category on AliExpress OR search on AliExpress for ‘cat beds’ and paste the link with the results.</p>\n<p>Next, decide on a product and seller’s rating (product rating, seller rating) and how many times the item was sold (orders). ‘Limit’ means how many cat beds you would like to import each time and how often (polling).</p>\n<p>Lastly, set the language, destination and currency of your shop.</p>\n<p>Hit ‘check’ button to see if your criteria worked according to your expectations (you can click on each product link generated). If so, you can already hit ‘import’ and add those products to the inventory table and also ‘save’ the rule.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Load the product or multiple products to the product editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a few properties and generate the title and description.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Edit the product description.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the images.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set up the pricing rule.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose the variations you’d like to import.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, click import and follow the new permalink to preview your new product online.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>GUIDE</h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxelpU-W_rw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n",
