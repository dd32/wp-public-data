What&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The coloring feature works when you pin the website to your taskbar. If you do it afterwise, the changes won&#8217;t be reflected. They seem to be cached in a file located in this folder:<br />\nC:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch\\User Pinned\\TaskBar<br />\nSo, the change you make won&#8217;t be visible unless you unpin then repin your website.
