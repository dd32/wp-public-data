More than likely that is configured to use an outgoing SMTP server. Otherwise, read through documentation provided by your host or contact them (or someone more intimately knowledgeable about your situation) directly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20sent%20out%20a%20few%20test%20emails%20using%20the%20test%20button%20after%20having%20tried%20different%20values%20for%20some%20of%20the%20settings%3B%20how%20do%20i%20know%20which%20one%20worked%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve sent out a few test emails using the test button after having tried different values for some of the settings; how do I know which one worked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your settings worked, you should receive the test email at the email address associated with your WordPress site user account. That email contains a timestamp which was reported to you by the plugin when the email was sent. If you are trying out various setting values, be sure to record what your settings were and what the timestamp was when sending with those settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20getting%20this%20error%20when%20attempting%20to%20send%20a%20test%20message%3A%20%60smtp%20error%3A%20could%20not%20connect%20to%20smtp%20host.%60%3F'>\nWhy am I getting this error when attempting to send a test message: `SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.`?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons you could be getting this error:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your server (or a router to which it is connected) may be blocking all outgoing SMTP traffic.</li>\n<li>Your mail server may be configured to allow SMTP connections only from certain servers.</li>\n<li>You have supplied incorrect server settings (hostname, port number, secure protocol type).</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20am%20i%20getting%20this%20error%3A%20%60smtp%20error%3A%20could%20not%20authenticate.%60%3F'>\nWhat am I getting this error: `SMTP Error: Could not authenticate.`?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The connection to the SMTP server was successful, but the credentials you provided (username and/or password) are not correct. Bear in mind these credentials are likely unrelated to the ones you use to log into your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20include%20unit%20tests%3F'>\nDoes this plugin include unit tests?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
