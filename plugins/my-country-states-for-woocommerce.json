All states are automatically for countries whose states are not implemeted in the WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20customize%20the%20list%20of%20states%20for%20a%20country%20implemented%20by%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow can I customize the list of states for a country implemented by this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can customize the list of states for any country by using the <code>mcsfwc_states_of_{TWO_CHARACTER_COUNTRY_CODE_IN_LOWER_CASE}</code> filter hook provided by the plugin. For example, if you want to override the states for Afghanistan, use <code>mcsfwc_states_of_af</code> filter hook, for Singapore use <code>mcsfwc_states_of_sg</code> filter hook</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20customize%20the%20list%20of%20states%20for%20afghanistan%3F'>\nHow can I customize the list of states for Afghanistan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <code>mcsfwc_states_of_af</code> filter hook allows you to customize the list of states for Afghanistan in your WooCommerce checkout or other parts of your site where states are listed.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of how to use the filter in your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nfunction custom_afghanistan_states( $states ) {\n    $states = array(\n        'BDS' =&gt; 'Badakhshan',\n        'BGL' =&gt; 'Baghlan',\n        'BAL' =&gt; 'Balkh',\n        // Add your custom states here\n        'KAB' =&gt; 'Kabul',  // Example: Adding a custom state\n    );\n    return $states;\n}\nadd_filter( 'mcsfwc_states_of_af', 'custom_afghanistan_states' );\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20interface%20in%20admin%20panel%20where%20i%20can%20customize%20the%20states%20listing%3F'>\nIs there any interface in Admin panel where I can customize the States listing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, currently you can customize the  states list using the avaibale filter hooks. We are planning to implemente this feature in the next paid version.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
