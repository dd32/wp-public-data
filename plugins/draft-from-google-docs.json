In that case, the content is not imported directly into WordPress but displayed in a format that allows it to be copied and pasted into the WordPress editor. In that case, images associated with the document are displayed in a format that allows you to download them into your computer and upload them one by one into your post or page. Including the download_ok=&#8221;1&#8243; attribute within the shortcode means the images will be downloaded into the local WordPress instance. Otherwise, the download links will point to the Google Cloud url for those images.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_eetgU0GJ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rsvpmaker.com/draft-from-google-docs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Plugin Page www.rsvpmaker.com/draft-from-google-docs/</strong></a></p>\n<p>Thank you to Miroslav Mitev for a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/m1r0/f22d5237ee93bcccb0d9\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">code sample</a> on how to download from a url to create WordPress attachments.</p>\n<p>Butterfly image Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/jamesdemers-3416/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=55995\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JamesDeMers</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=55995\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pixabay</a></p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<pre><code>RSVPMaker\nCopyright (C) 2022 David F.
