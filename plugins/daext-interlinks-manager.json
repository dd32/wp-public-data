        "description": "<p>Interlinks Manager is an SEO WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to monitor and optimize your internal links.</p>\n<p>This plugin first generates the internal links data with powerful PHP regular expressions applied to your content and then analyzes these data to provide you valuable information.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the plugin adds to WordPress the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internal links analysis</li>\n<li>Link juice analysis</li>\n<li>An algorithm that detects the internal links optimization status</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p>For SEO professionals, we also distribute the <a href=\"https://daext.com/interlinks-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Version</a> with a 30-day money-back guarantee formula.</p>\n<p>Here is a list of some of the many features that you can get by upgrading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An internal links suggestions feature to receive relevant internal links suggestions and speed up your internal links building sessions.</li>\n<li>An advanced automatic internal links system to create internal links based on the specified keywords.</li>\n<li>A report of all the visits generated from the clicks on the internal links.</li>\n<li>The ability to export the internal links data and the link juice data in CSV format.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Monitor your internal links</h3>\n<p>Keep track of all the internal links available in your articles with the <strong>Dashboard</strong> menu. Here you will find a list of all your articles and the internal links information retrieved by the plugin, such as the content length, the number of internal links, the recommended number of internal links, and the optimization status.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Filter &amp; Sort</strong> section included in this menu will allow you to search through these data, filter them, or sort the data based on specific criteria. For example, you can use this section to find all the non-optimized articles and work on their optimization.</p>\n<h3>Calculate the link juice</h3>\n<p>Visit the <strong>Juice</strong> menu to receive an estimate of the link juice for all the URLs linked in your articles.</p>\n<p>Use the information available in this menu to improve the distribution of link juice, empower your <a href=\"https://yoast.com/what-is-cornerstone-content/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cornerstone articles</a>, or improve the SEO performance of your product pages.</p>\n<p>For the most demanding SEO specialists, there is also the possibility to list all the links that contribute to creating the overall link juice associated with each URL.</p>\n<h3>Optimize the number of internal links</h3>\n<p>Receive information about the optimization status of the internal links while you edit an article with the <strong>Interlinks Optimization</strong> meta box.</p>\n<p>This meta box will give you clear and precise information on making the article optimized in terms of internal links. For example, you will receive messages like &#8220;The number of internal links included in this post is optimized.&#8221; or &#8220;The number of internal links should be included between 4 and 6&#8221;, etc.</p>\n<p>Please note that this feature works best when combined with the <strong>Interlinks Suggestions</strong> functionality available in the <a href=\"https://daext.com/interlinks-manager/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Version</a>.</p>\n<h3>Customize the plugin behavior</h3>\n<h3>Configure the internal links optimization algorithm</h3>\n<p>Change the values of the <strong>Characters per Interlink</strong> and the <strong>Optimization Delta</strong> options to modify the results generated by the algorithm used to measure the optimization status of the articles.</p>\n<h3>Customize the algorithm used to calculate the link juice</h3>\n<p>Use the options in the <strong>Juice</strong> section of the plugin options to customize the calculation of the link juice.</p>\n<p>For instance, you can set default <strong>SEO Power</strong> of all the pages, set a custom <strong>Penality per Position</strong>, aggregate the link juice of URLs with different anchors, aggregate the link juice of the URLs with parameters.</p>\n<h3>Configure the PHP memory, the maximum execution time, and the analyzed post types</h3>\n<p>If your website has many articles, you have options that control the technical aspects of the plugin&#8217;s analysis in the <strong>Analysis</strong> section.</p>\n<p>For example, you can set a custom PHP memory size and increase the maximum execution time with the script used by the plugin, limit the number of analyzed articles, restrict the analysis to specific post types, and more.</p>\n<p>Thanks to these options, you can handle any scenario, even blogs with 100k+ posts.</p>\n<h3>Enable the plugin meta boxes only on specific post types</h3>\n<p>You can use the options in the <strong>Meta Boxes</strong> to display or hide the <strong>Interlinks Options</strong> and the <strong>Interlinks Optimization</strong> meta boxes only with specific post types.</p>\n<h3>Assign a custom links juice to specific posts</h3>\n<p>The plugin allows you to assign each article a parameter used to calculate the link juice named <strong>SEO Power</strong>.</p>\n<p>Configure this constant with a realistic value to improve the accuracy of the link juice.</p>\n",
