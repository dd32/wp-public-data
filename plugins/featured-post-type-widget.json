Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I style the plugin output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses several &#8220;common&#8221; WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file<br />\n* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by &#8220;post-&#8221; apended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output<br />\n* the plugin class <code>post-details</code> wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.<br />\n* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget &#8220;container&#8221; class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.</p>\n<p>With the addition of the display Category Description option an additional class was written into the plugin. To style the category description displayed add the class &#8216;fpt-cat-desc&#8217; to your style.css file then use your choice of properties to style the text, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>.fpt-cat-desc {font-style: italic;}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I increase the maximum posts to display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.0 the Total Posts to Display is independent of the &#8220;posts per page&#8221; setting as set under Settings | Reading.
