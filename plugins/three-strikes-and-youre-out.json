You can change these by editing the two defined<br />\nconstants at the top of the plugin file, just below the copyright notice. There<br />\nare three such defines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>THREE_STRIKES_LIMIT</code> is the number of bad hits at which to block comments.</li>\n<li><code>THREE_STRIKES_TIMEOUT</code> is the time in seconds after which bad hits are no<br />\nlonger considered.</li>\n<li><code>THREE_STRIKES_BB_STRICT</code> indicates that you should consider any &#8220;strict&#8221;<br />\nevents recorded in the Bad Behavior log. These are events that are blocked when<br />\nBad Behavior is using the &#8220;strict checking&#8221; option, but would be ignored<br />\notherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Three Strikes API</h3>\n<p>This plugin includes a number of hooks that allow other plugins to communicate<br />\nwith it. These are implemented as actions and filters, so if Three Strikes is<br />\nnot installed, your plugin will continue to function.</p>\n<p>Full details can be found at</p>\n<p>http://www.jamesmckay.net/code/three-strikes/api/</p>\n<h3>Redistribution</h3>\n<p>Copyright (c) 2007 James McKay<br />\nhttp://www.jamesmckay.net/</p>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br />\nof this software and associated documentation files (the &#8220;Software&#8221;), to deal<br />\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br />\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br />\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br />\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br />\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br />\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br />\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
