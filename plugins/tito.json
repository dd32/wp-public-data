The plugin makes use of the title of your event to create the correct ticket sales portal on your site. Without an account, this will not be possible. But it&#8217;s free to create and simple to set up an account, so don&#8217;t worry!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='there%27s%20no%20ticket%20sales%20appearing%20on%20my%20site%21'>\nThere&#8217;s no ticket sales appearing on my site!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have you included the <code>[tito]</code> shortcode (and/or options) in your content or run the function <code>do_shortcode('[tito]');</code> in the template of your site?</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20a%20widget.%20surely%20there%20should%20be%20a%20widget.%20why%20isn%27t%20there%20a%20widget%3F'>\nI want a widget. Surely there should be a widget. Why isn&#8217;t there a widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the first Tito plugin so we need to gauge requirements. This may come in a future release. And don&#8217;t call me Shirley.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='adding%20tito%20ticket%20sales%20is%20simple%21%20why%20the%20hell%20is%20there%20a%20plugin%3F%21'>\nAdding Tito ticket sales is simple! Why the hell is there a plugin?!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is true. All we aim to do with the plugin is provide the simplest interface possible to users so that those who do not wish to get their hands dirty in the code, can install and use Tito easily on their site. Also, users on wordpress.com will not have the same flexibility of adding the content to their sites as self-hosted users of wordpress.org.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20an%20idea%20to%20make%20the%20plugin%20better%21'>\nI have an idea to make the plugin better!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great, we&#8217;d love to hear it.
