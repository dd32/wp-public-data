That quota is quite generous, so this won&#8217;t be a problem for most users. However, if you have many thousands of video views daily (or if you are sharing an API key), you may have to apply for a quota extension.</p>\n<p>Refer to Google&#8217;s own documentation for more about <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">how the daily quota is calculated</a>, or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">to apply for an extension</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20the%20error%20message%20%22the%20request%20did%20not%20specify%20any%20referer.%20please%20ensure%20that%20the%20client%20is%20sending%20referer%20or%20use%20the%20api%20console%20to%20remove%20the%20referer%20restrictions.%22.%20how%20do%20i%20fix%20it%3F'>\nI get the error message &#8220;The request did not specify any referer.
