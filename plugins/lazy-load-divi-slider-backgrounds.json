        "faq": "\n<h4>What are the requirements?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Divi Builder by Elegant Themes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Something else?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>jQuery, but chances are you already load it. Most popular themes use it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Lazy Loading and why should I care?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Lazy loading is a technique that defers loading of non-critical resources at page load time. Instead, these non-critical resources are loaded at the moment of need. Where images are concerned, &#8220;non-critical&#8221; is often synonymous with &#8220;off-screen&#8221;. By lazy loading images, you improve your website&#8217;s load speed. If you&#8217;ve used Google&#8217;s PageSpeed Insights tool, you may have seen an opportunity called &#8220;Defer offscreen images&#8221;. Google basically tells us to lazy load our images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I already have a lazy loading plugin!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most lazy loading plugins handle only the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements from your pages.<br />\nLazy loading background images requires a different approach and this plugin is specially designed to handle Divi Builder&#8217;s Slider Module.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about browser support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All modern browsers are supported.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about users without JavaScript?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a visitor has disabled their JavaScript, they will still see the slider images as normal.<br />\nHowever, they won&#8217;t benefit from lazy loading.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin affect the performance in a bad way?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin should not cause any slowdown.<br />\nIt&#8217;s designed to help improve your website&#8217;s performance.<br />\nThe plugin won&#8217;t load any additional files.<br />\nInstead, it prints CSS and JS inline in the  section and after the main content respectively.</p>\n<p>Unlike most plugins, the required resources are only included on the pages which need them.<br />\nThe plugin checks the current page&#8217;s content and if there is a slider with a background image the CSS and JS get printed.<br />\nAll other posts/pages won&#8217;t be affected to maximize performance.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t work on my website. Do you know why?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check if the Divi Builder (or Divi Theme) is updated.</li>\n<li>Check if the browser&#8217;s console (F12) shows any errors. jQuery should be loaded and if it&#8217;s not you will see an error.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Anything else you may recommend?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
