        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20bypass%20the%20redirect%20programatically%20%3F'>\nHow can I bypass the redirect programatically ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a filter which allows you to programatically bypass the redirection block:</p>\n<p><strong><code>wploti_matches</code></strong></p>\n<p>This allows you to run pretty much any test you like, although be aware that the whole redirection thing runs <em>before</em> the <code>$post</code> global is set up, so WordPress conditionals such as <code>is_post()</code> and <code>is_tax()</code> are not available.</p>\n<p>This example looks in the <code>$_SERVER</code> global to see if any part of the URL contains &#8220;hello-world&#8221; ( default wordpress post for example )</p>\n<pre><code>function my_wploti_matches( $wploti_matches ) {\n    if ( stristr( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'hello-world' ) ) \n        $wploti_matches[] = \"&lt;!-- hello-world --&gt;\";\n    return $wploti_matches;\n}\nadd_filter( \"wploti_matches\", \"my_wploti_matches\" );\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can follow the same process for pages, posts, categories, taxonomies, custom post types ,etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20let%20my%20logged-in%20user%20see%20the%20front%20end%20%3F'>\nHow can I let my logged-in user see the front end ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, Maintenance &amp; Coming Soon Redirect Animation uses the <code>manage_options</code> capability, but that is normally only applied to administrators. As it stands, a user with a lesser permissions level, such as editor, is able to view the admin side of the site, but not the front end. You can change this using this filter :</p>\n<p><strong><code>wploti_user_can</code></strong></p>\n<p>This filter is used to pass a different WordPress capability to check if the logged-in user has permission to view the site and thus bypass the redirection, such as <code>edit_posts</code>. Note that this is run before <code>$post</code> is set up, so WordPress conditionals such as <code>is_post()</code> and <code>is_tax()</code> are not available. However, it&#8217;s not really meant for programatically determining whether a user should have access, but rather just changing the default capability to be tested, so you don&#8217;t really need to do anything other than the example below.</p>\n<pre><code>function my_wploti_user_can( $capability ) {\n    return \"edit_posts\";\n}\nadd_filter( \"wploti_user_can\", \"my_wploti_user_can\" );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
