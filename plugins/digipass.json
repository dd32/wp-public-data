        "installation": "<p><em>NOTE:</em> We really hope that you find our plugin useful and that it helps you to manage the use of images and relevant accreditation on your website, however, as this plugin makes a number of changes to the structure of the Media Library and other aspects of the base WordPress code we would recommend that you install in on a test site before going live.</p>\n<p>This is only so that you can make sure that the plugin does not have an adverse effect on the custom code which you may have added to the site or any other plugins which you currently use, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>We also recommend that you do not test this plugin at the same time as making any other changes to your site. This is because otherwise it is easy to become confused about where a problem is emanating from. Although with smaller plugins and changes you can normally batch test, when a plugin makes such big changes to certain aspects of your sites functionality, solo testing is highly recommended.</p>\n<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 3.5 or greater</li>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>via Upload (FTP, SCP etc.)</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the extracted archive folder &#8216;digipass&#8217; to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li><em>(optional)</em> Go to &#8220;Settings &gt; DigiPass&#8221; to adjust settings</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>via WordPress Admin</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to &#8220;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8221;</li>\n<li>Search for <code>DigiPass</code></li>\n<li>Install the plugin called <code>DigiPass</code> and activate it</li>\n<li>Go to &#8220;Settings &gt; DigiPass&#8221; to adjust settings (optional)</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I adjust the Plugin Settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you have activated the plugin you can tinker with the settings to your heartâ€™s content. If you head to &#8220;Settings &gt; DigiPass&#8221; and you can adjust all settings from there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I include a DigiPass on my page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Create a FREE NetLicensing account and configure username / password in the plugin&#8217;s setting page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will DigiPass work with my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. DigiPass is designed to work with any theme, but it may require some styling to make it match the rest of the theme and achieve that seamless integration.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with BuddyPress (bbPress)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep, it does.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which WordPress versions are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to get the most out of the plugin and use all of its features, you will need to be using WordPress 3.5 with PHP 5.2.4 as a minimum. Updates will continue to be released for the plugin as the main WordPress CMS is updated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I request new features and extensions to be included in future releases of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We always welcome your feedback and would love to know what you would like to see done next with the plugin and what features you would like integrated.
