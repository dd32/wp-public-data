Google Analytics is a very prominent example. It is free up to 10 million events.</p>\n<p>It is free because data about your traffic and your visitors is feeding Google&#8217;s Advertising business. By getting the service for free, you are indirectly supporting your competition in having a more efficient advertising platform. You are also exposing your visitors to aggressive monitoring and tracking.</p>\n<p>Wide Angle Analytics is not free. For a fee, you get service that handles your data with utmost respect. No sharing. No reselling. This is your data used solely for your analytics and business purposes.</p>\n<p>We run a business around serving the needs of our customer.
