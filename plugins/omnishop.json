We can also connect to custom shops if they have a public API.<br />\nIf unsure, don’t hesitate to contact us below! ��</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20mobile%20platforms%20do%20you%20support%3F'>\nWhich mobile platforms do you support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We support both iOS and Android platforms natively. No PWA, no hybrid<br />\nsolutions, just pure performance and quality!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20having%20a%20mobile%20app%3F'>\nWhat are the benefits of having a mobile app?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Mobile apps give customers a way better user experience than websites.<br />\nAlso, the functionalities of mobile apps are more advanced.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of having a mobile app is that it helps retain<br />\ncustomers. Once a customer downloads the app, they start visiting it<br />\nmore frequently than they would visit your website, creating a closer<br />\nbond with your shop.</p>\n<p>The app gives your clients a faster checkout experience. If you have a<br />\ncart abandonment problem, the app will reduce this. If the customer<br />\nleaves the product in the cart, the app will send them a notification<br />\nreminder. Unlike email notifications that are highly ignored, push<br />\nnotifications through the app trigger customers and make them finish<br />\ntheir shopping. Also, a significant benefit for you is that the app<br />\nmakes retargeting customers easier.</p>\n<p>By having an app, you increase your brand’s visibility and are present<br />\non yet another platform.</p>\n<p>Those are the reasons why the majority of big brands already have their<br />\napp.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20will%20i%20increase%20sales%20with%20a%20mobile%20app%3F'>\nHow will I increase sales with a mobile app?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With a mobile app, you will speed up the processes before checkout. So,<br />\nthe possibility of the client abandoning the purchase is reduced. With<br />\nthe re-ordering option in the app, you increase the possibility of<br />\npurchasing even more. Re-ordering also minimizes friction and losing<br />\ncustomers due to boring and long filling-in forms for shipping, billing,<br />\netc.</p>\n<p>Users can also be targeted and informed about discounts through the<br />\napp’s push notifications, which will redirect them to the product of<br />\ntheir interest that is currently on discount.</p>\n<p><strong>Does OmniShop offer a marketing strategy that will help me attract<br />\ncustomers to my new app?</strong></p>\n<p>We are there to support your process, but you take the initiative to<br />\npromote your app &#8211; it is for your customers. You can download our ebook<br />\n“App Downloads Growth”from the Blog &amp; Resources page. There, you will<br />\nfind helpful tips to increase your profit by boosting app downloads.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20have%20the%20app%20if%20i%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20a%20webshop%20or%20website%20at%20all%3F'>\nCan I have the app if I don’t have a webshop or website at all?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The OmniShop product doesn’t offer this option directly, as the app’s<br />\ncore is to be connected to your website, so it can directly pool the<br />\ninformation and updates about the products from the site. So, you need a<br />\nwebshop for the mobile app to work.</p>\n<p>However, we can offer the complete service of creating a perfectly<br />\nsynced webshop and mobile app. Book a consultation with us if you want<br />\nto hear more about the package.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20want%20to%20stop%20having%20the%20app%3F'>\nWhat happens if I want to stop having the app?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>OmniShop is subscription based, so you can unsubscribe if you don’t want<br />\nto have the app anymore.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
