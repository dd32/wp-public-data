        "faq": "\n<h4>What does tamper resistant mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tamper resistant means that a website owner employs extra measures to detect malicious changes to their website. Malicious changes to websites can<br />\nbe covered up even with security plugins installed. Entrusans IDS stores file change history off-site. To go undetected hackers need access to file change history to cover their tracks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Entrusans IDS correct any problems it finds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Entrusans IDS does not correct problems. Entrusans IDS captures file change history and uses that history to detect changes on a website for analysis. The website owner will determine if the changes to the website are legitimate or malicious.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are there two steps in activation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first step is to activate the plugin from the WordPress plugin screen.  The second activation is to<br />\nestablish contact with the Entrusans IDS server to initiate monitoring and the capture<br />\nof file system snapshots.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when a scan fails?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Entrusans IDS scans are subject to time out for many reasons including the owner&#8217;s website could be offline, there could be a network failure or a hacker could have deleted the Entrusans IDS client. The Entrusans IDS scanner retries in the event of a time out and after successive failures notifies the website owner via email that the scans are failing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I do not receive an email does that mean I’m OK?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Entrusans IDS only sends emails if there are changes to files on your website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How often does the Entrusans IDS scan?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every 24 hours.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with WPMU?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Entrusans IDS supports any PHP based website. The pricing model for the Entrusans IDS is based on the number of domains associated with a multi-site web installation.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
