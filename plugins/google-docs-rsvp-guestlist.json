Sorry, the only solution right now is to use that version of PHP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change some of the text?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you cannot change the text in the options page, you can change it in the source code (by editting wp-gdrsvp-plugin.php). This is not a very safe thing to do, but you could search the code for the words you want to change and fiddle around with it. This take familiarity with HTML and a little PHP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>License</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Copyright (C) 2008-2014 Gifford Cheung, Brian Watanabe, Chongsun Ahn</p>\n<p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br />\n(at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
