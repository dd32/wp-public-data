Assuming you&#8217;re running Groestlcoin on mainnet, you would find them inside the data/chain/groestlcoin/mainnet directory of your LND dir. By default, the LND dir is located at: ~/.lnd-grs on Linux /Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Lnd-grs/ on Mac OSX or $APPDATA/Local/Lnd-grs on Windows.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
