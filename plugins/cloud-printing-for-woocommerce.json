        "installation": "<h4>Prerequisite</h4>\n<p>To use this plugin, you need to:<br />\n<strong>(a)</strong> Register with PrinterCo and access your MyPanel dashboard.<br />\n<strong>(b)</strong> Add your POS printer to your MyPanel dashboard.<br />\n<strong>(c)</strong> Have your unique Printer ID ready to use.<br />\n<strong>(d)</strong> If you already have a Thermal printer, ask our experts if the version of your device is compatible with PrinterCo. This way you can use it again without buying a new one.</p>\n<p>Tutorial for registering with PrinterCo: <a href=\"pco.link/mypanel-setup-guide\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pco.link/mypanel-setup-guide</a></p>\n<p>Tutorial for adding a printer to MyPanel: <a href=\"pco.link/add-printer-guide\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pco.link/add-printer-guide</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>From your WordPress dashboard, in left navigation panel, click on <strong>Plugins</strong> &gt; <strong>Add New</strong> &gt; <strong>Upload Plugin</strong>.</li>\n<li>\nClick the <strong>Choose file</strong> button and browse this plugin after downloading it. Make sure to upload it as a zip file. </li>\n<li>Click on the <strong>Install Now</strong> button.</li>\n<li><strong>Active</strong> the plugin after it has been successfully installed.</li>\n<li>From the left navigation panel click <strong>WooCommerce</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Integration</strong>.</li>\n<li>Complete the form using the information found in your <strong>MyPanel dashboard</strong> &gt; <strong>My Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit Information</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Integration form guideline</h4>\n<p><strong>a) API Key:</strong> Uniquely generated for every account registered with PrinterCo.</p>\n<p><strong>b) API Password:</strong> Uniquely generated for every account registered with PrinterCo.</p>\n<p><strong>c) Licence Key:</strong> To get your licence key from your MyPanel dashboard, click the Printer List button.<br />\nNext, click the edit button (pen icon) for the printer you want to assign the licence to.<br />\nIn the Edit Printer page, select <em>Yes</em> for the <em>Register Licence?</em> dropdown box and click the <em>Submit</em> button to save changes.<br />\nYou will be taken back to the printer list page. Click the View button (eye icon) to open the Printer Details page. Scroll down to find your licence key.<br />\nTutorial: <a href=\"pco.link/licence-key\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pco.link/licence-key</a></p>\n<p><strong>d) Printer ID:</strong> A uniquely generated for every printer added to PrinterCo. Find this under <strong>Printers</strong> &gt; <strong>Printer List</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>e) Notify URL:</strong> This is a page created by yourself with the purpose to retrieve order updates. With a logical statement, you can then take the appropriate action (i.e. notifying your customer when the order is accepted by the kitchen).<br />\nCreate a blank page with the WordPress shortcode [PrinterCoShortCode].</p>\n<p><strong>f) Receipt Header/Footer:</strong> These fields allow you to create the contents for the header and footer of your receipt. Giving you the flexibility to extend your marketing efforts to your receipt papers.<br />\nTo use breaklines use the code %% (i.e. 1st line of text%%2nd line of text).</p>\n<p><strong>g) Text Size:</strong> This allows you to change the font size for the contents on the receipts. For more control, leave the default setting and change the font size from your MyPanel dashboard instead.</p>\n<p><strong>h) Prepaid Payment Option:</strong> This setting allows you to define all prepaid payment options. By selecting a payment option populated in the list box, it will raise a flag to mark your customers orders as <strong>PAID</strong>. If a customer chooses a payment option that you have not selected here, then their order will be marked as <strong>NOT PAID</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>i) Delivery Options:</strong> You may have already set this up with WooCommerce, but this serves a slightly different purpose. Since websites can have different names for a delivery order, it gets a little tricky for the plugin to identify this and label your orders correctly. So, if your website has a delivery option labelled as <em>Deliver It</em>, then you will need to type that in here.</p>\n<p><strong>j) All Included?:</strong> A somewhat redundant setting but nonetheless. This is used to force all order details to be included on your receipt (i.e. Order ID, Order Time, Order Requested Time etc). However, enabling this will essentially disable the options you have on the printers to single out and disable certain order details. We recommend leaving this setting set to the default <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>k) Debug Mode?:</strong> If you require debugging, you will need to enable this option and then provide an email address to where you want the debug information to be sent to.</p>\n<p>After you have configured these settings, your clouding printing should be ready to go. If you think your plugin extension is not working as normal, or you need help then feel free to contact our support team.
