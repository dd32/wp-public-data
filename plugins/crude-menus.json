This plugin will also allow for Exporting menus (slated for a future release), so I expanded upon the CRUD acronym.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I tell this new menu where I want it to display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll still have to go to Appearance / Menus, or set the location through the Customizer.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>But wait, aren&#8217;t you worried that people will think your plugin is crude?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Who says crude inherently means bad?  Just ask the Clampetts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What can be imported for a menu item?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Link is mandatory; you can also import CSS class(es), Link Target (whether it opens in another tab), and a custom title.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about integration with Nav Menu Roles, WP Mega Menu, Ubermenu, etc?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;d have to set that manually as well, through Appearance / Menus.  Menus created via CRUDE Menus will be standard WordPress menus, and will be able to be configured with other plugins just as if you had created them manually.  This plugin is designed to make creating large menus easier, but can&#8217;t bring in data for anything other than stock WordPress menu functions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this to update existing navigation menus?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s planned for a future release.  I&#8217;ve got a three-year-old daughter, time got away from me. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
