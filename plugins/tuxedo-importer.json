By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br />\nsoftware&#8211;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br />\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br />\nFoundation&#8217;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br />\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br />\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br />\nyour programs, too.</p>\n<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>\n<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br />\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>\n<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br />\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br />\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br />\nrights.</p>\n<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br />\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br />\ndistribute and/or modify the software.</p>\n<p>Also, for each author&#8217;s protection and ours, we want to make certain<br />\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br />\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br />\nauthors&#8217; reputations.</p>\n<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br />\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br />\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br />\npatent must be licensed for everyone&#8217;s free use or not licensed at all.</p>\n<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />\nmodification follow.</p>\n<pre><code>                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n</code></pre>\n<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br />\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br />\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The &#8220;Program&#8221;, below,<br />\nrefers to any such program or work, and a &#8220;work based on the Program&#8221;<br />\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br />\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br />\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br />\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br />\nthe term &#8220;modification&#8221;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br />\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br />\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br />\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#8217;s<br />\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br />\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br />\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br />\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br />\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br />\nalong with the Program.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br />\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br />\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br />\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>\n<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br />\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>\n<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br />\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br />\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br />\nparties under the terms of this License.</p>\n<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br />\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br />\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br />\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br />\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br />\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br />\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br />\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br />\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br />\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br />\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />\ncollective works based on the Program.</p>\n<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br />\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br />\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />\nthe scope of this License.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br />\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br />\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>\n<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br />\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br />\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>\n<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br />\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br />\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br />\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br />\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br />\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,</p>\n<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br />\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br />\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br />\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such<br />\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br />\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br />\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br />\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br />\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include<br />\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br />\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br />\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br />\nitself accompanies the executable.</p>\n<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br />\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br />\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br />\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br />\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br />\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br />\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br />\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br />\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br />\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br />\nparties remain in full compliance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br />\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />\nthe Program or works based on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br />\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br />\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />\nrestrictions on the recipients&#8217; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />\nthis License.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br />\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br />\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br />\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br />\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br />\ncircumstances.</p>\n<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br />\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />\nimpose that choice.</p>\n<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br />\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br />\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br />\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br />\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br />\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />\naddress new problems or concerns.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br />\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &#8220;any<br />\nlater version&#8221;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br />\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br />\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br />\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br />\nFoundation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br />\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br />\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br />\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br />\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br />\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br />\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>\n<pre><code>                    NO WARRANTY\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br />\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br />\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br />\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM &#8220;AS IS&#8221; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br />\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br />\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br />\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br />\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br />\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br />\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br />\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br />\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br />\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br />\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n<pre><code>             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br />\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>\n<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br />\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />\nthe &#8220;copyright&#8221; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>\n<p>&lt;one line to give the program&#8217;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />\nCopyright (C)   </p>\n<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />\n(at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br />\nGNU General Public License for more details.</p>\n<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br />\nwith this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br />\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>\n<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br />\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:</p>\n<pre><code>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w' and</code>show c&#8217; should show the appropriate<br />\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br />\nbe called something other than <code>show w' and</code>show c&#8217;; they could even be<br />\nmouse-clicks or menu items&#8211;whatever suits your program.</p>\n<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />\nschool, if any, to sign a &#8220;copyright disclaimer&#8221; for the program, if<br />\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>\n<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br />\n  `Gnomovision&#8217; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>\n<p>, 1 April 1989<br />\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>\n<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br />\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br />\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br />\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br />\nPublic License instead of this License.</p>\n"

But when you<br />\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />\ncollective works based on the Program.</p>\n<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br />\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br />\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />\nthe scope of this License.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br />\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br />\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>\n<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br />\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br />\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>\n<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br />\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br />\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br />\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br />\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br />\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,</p>\n<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br />\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br />\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br />\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such<br />\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br />\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br />\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br />\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br />\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include<br />\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br />\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br />\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br />\nitself accompanies the executable.</p>\n<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br />\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br />\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br />\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br />\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br />\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br />\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br />\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br />\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br />\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br />\nparties remain in full compliance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br />\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />\nthe Program or works based on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br />\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br />\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />\nrestrictions on the recipients&#8217; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />\nthis License.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br />\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br />\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br />\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br />\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br />\ncircumstances.</p>\n<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br />\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />\nimpose that choice.</p>\n<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br />\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br />\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br />\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br />\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br />\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />\naddress new problems or concerns.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br />\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &#8220;any<br />\nlater version&#8221;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br />\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br />\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br />\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br />\nFoundation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br />\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br />\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br />\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br />\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br />\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br />\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>\n<pre><code>                    NO WARRANTY\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br />\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

It is safest<br />\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />\nthe &#8220;copyright&#8221; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>\n<p>&lt;one line to give the program&#8217;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />\nCopyright (C)   </p>\n<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />\n(at your option) any later version.</p>\n<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
