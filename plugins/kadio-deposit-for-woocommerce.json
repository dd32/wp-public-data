Other deposit management plugins offer a deposit per product. This certainly has advantages in some contexts but for example, if you are a hotelier, a restaurant owner, a tourism professional, these solutions of deposit by product will not be adapted to your need.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20support%20services%20do%20you%20offer%20for%20users%20of%20your%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat support services do you offer for users of your plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have an incident with one of our modules, please write us from our <a href=\"https://df.kadio.fr/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact page</a>.
