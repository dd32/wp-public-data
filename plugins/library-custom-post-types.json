I hope to package some basic templates to work with in a future release.</p>\n<h4>Could you create *this* kind of custom post type for me?</h4>\n<p>Well &#8211; I&#8217;m up for suggestions.  Use the support forum for this plugin pack to request future post types.  But I also suggest getting your hands dirty with the packaged custom post types.  I&#8217;ve tried to keep my code clean enough for you to replicate in other post types and I&#8217;ll continue to make it better with each iteration by adding inline documentation.</p>\n",
