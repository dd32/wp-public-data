        "faq": "<h4>What are media queries?</h4>\n<p>If you have to ask that, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be using this plugin yet.</p>\n<h4>Will everyone see this, or just me?</h4>\n<p>That depends on whether you have that option selected. You can have this for &#8220;admin only&#8221; or completely public. This is meant to be a development tool, so after you&#8217;re done you will probably want to disable the plugin.</p>\n<h4>What if my media queries don&#8217;t align to the ones you&#8217;ve defined?</h4>\n<p>I suppose you&#8217;ll have to edit the plugin in that case. If there becomes a high demand, I may try to build a way for each stage to be custom defined, or possibly add/remove stages.</p>\n",
