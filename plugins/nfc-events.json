To do an automatic install of the plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”</p>\n<p>In the search field type “NFC Events,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found the plugin, you can install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>Manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.</p>\n<p>If you encounter issues with the NFC pages after an update, flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting “Save.” That should return things to normal.</p>\n",
