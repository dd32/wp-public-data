While the plugin should work with versions prior to 5.0, as it relies on core ACF functions, it&#8217;s recommended to use the latest version of ACF for optimal performance, security, and compatibility.</p>\n<p>The plugin is regularly tested with the latest ACF versions to ensure continued compatibility. If you&#8217;re using an older ACF version (prior to 5.0), the plugin should still function correctly with your setup.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any compatibility issues, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out for support.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20data%20from%20one%20site%20and%20import%20it%20to%20another%3F'>\nCan I export data from one site and import it to another?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! This is one of the main features of the plugin.
