Pasting your Facebook Pixel into your theme</strong><br />\nThis approach isn&#8217;t great for two reasons:<br />\na) If you edit your live site and make a mistake when pasting your Facebook Pixel script into your theme, you could take down your website.<br />\nb) If your theme is updated with new features or security fixes, your Facebook Pixel code will be overwritten.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Pasting the new Facebook Pixel script into a header/footer script plugin</strong><br />\nThis is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes &#8220;header script plugins&#8221; aren&#8217;t built from the ground-up to support Facebook&#8217;s Pixel.</p>\n<p>What this means is that :<br />\na) These plugins lack Facebook-specific functionality. There&#8217;s no easy way to add Standard Events, Custom Events or Dynamic Events.<br />\nb) These plugins will not adapt if Facebook changes their pixel again in the future. Since Pixel Cat is a dedicated Facebook Pixel plugin, we&#8217;ll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes by Facebook.<br />\nc) These plugins usually don&#8217;t support hiding your Facebook Pixel from logged-in users.</p>\n<p>And, most importantly: with Pixel Cat you can set up Facebook Pixel standard events, without having to write a single line of code.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that Pixel Cat is the best way to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.</p>\n<h4>Does Pixel Cat &#8211; Conversion Pixel Manager support the new Facebook Pixel?</h4>\n<p>Yes. Pixel Cat is built from the ground up to support the new Facebook Pixel.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re currently using v1.3.5, or later, for the old deprecated Facebook Pixel, and would like to continue doing so, no worries. Pixel Cat &#8211; Conversion Pixel Manager will automatically detect your old settings, and will let you continue using the old version of the plugin for this purpose. You can then upgrade to the new pixel at any time.</p>\n<h4>Can I hide my Facebook Pixel form logged in users?</h4>\n<p>Yes. You can hide your Facebook Pixels from logged in users by going to Settings -&gt; Facebook Pixel Manager.</p>\n<h4>Is Pixel Cat &#8211; Conversion Pixel Manager easy to translate?</h4>\n<p>Yes. Pixel Cat &#8211; Facebook Pixel Cat is fully translateable. Please let us know if you&#8217;re interested in contributing.</p>\n<h4>Do you integrate with WooCommerce</h4>\n<p>Yes, our our <a href=\"https://fatcatapps.com/pixelcat/premium\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro plugin</a> makes setting up a Facebook Pixel WooCommerce integration a breeze. Not only that, Pixel Cat Premium lets you create a Facebook Product Catalog for WooCommerce. <a href=\"https://fatcatapps.com/pixelcat/premium\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>\n<h4>What is a Facebook Pixel and how does it help my business?</h4>\n<p>Please read this guide: <a href=\"https://fatcatapps.com/facebook-pixel/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Pixel WordPress Installation &amp; Best Practices: The Definitive Guide</a>.

Pasting your Facebook Pixel into your theme</strong><br />\nThis approach isn&#8217;t great for two reasons:<br />\na) If you edit your live site and make a mistake when pasting your Facebook Pixel script into your theme, you could take down your website.<br />\nb) If your theme is updated with new features or security fixes, your Facebook Pixel code will be overwritten.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Pasting the new Facebook Pixel script into a header/footer script plugin</strong><br />\nThis is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes &#8220;header script plugins&#8221; aren&#8217;t built from the ground-up to support Facebook&#8217;s Pixel.</p>\n<p>What this means is that :<br />\na) These plugins lack Facebook-specific functionality. There&#8217;s no easy way to add Standard Events, Custom Events or Dynamic Events.<br />\nb) These plugins will not adapt if Facebook changes their pixel again in the future. Since Pixel Cat is a dedicated Facebook Pixel plugin, we&#8217;ll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes by Facebook.<br />\nc) These plugins usually don&#8217;t support hiding your Facebook Pixel from logged-in users.</p>\n<p>And, most importantly: with Pixel Cat you can set up Facebook Pixel standard events, without having to write a single line of code.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that Pixel Cat is the best way to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.</p>\n<h4>Does Pixel Cat &#8211; Conversion Pixel Manager support the new Facebook Pixel?</h4>\n<p>Yes.
