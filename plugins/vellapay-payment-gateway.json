Click <strong>Set Up</strong></li>\n<li>On the next screen, configure the plugin. There is a selection of options on the screen. Read what each one does below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enable/Disable</strong> &#8211; Check this checkbox to Enable Vella on your store&#8217;s checkout</li>\n<li><strong>Title</strong> &#8211; This will represent Vella on your list of Payment options during checkout. It guides users to know which option to select to pay with Vella. <strong>Title</strong> is set to &#8220;Make Payment with Vella&#8221; by default, but you can change it to suit your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong> &#8211; This controls the message that appears under the payment fields on the checkout page. Use this space to give more details to customers about what Vella is and what payment methods they can use with it.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Test Mode</strong> &#8211; Check this to enable test mode. When selected, the fields in step five will say &#8220;Test&#8221; instead of &#8220;Live.&#8221; Test mode enables you to test payments before going live. The orders are processed with test payment methods, no money is involved so there is no risk. You can uncheck this when your store is ready to accept real payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>API Keys</strong> &#8211; The next two text boxes are for your Vella API keys, which you can get from your Vella Dashboard. If you enabled Test Mode in step four, then you&#8217;ll need to use your test API keys here. Otherwise, you can enter your live keys.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong> to update the settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you do not find Vella on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ve checked the <strong>&#8220;Enable/Disable&#8221;</strong> checkbox</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve entered your <strong>API Keys</strong> in the appropriate field</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve clicked on <strong>Save Changes</strong> during setup</li>\n</ul>\n",
