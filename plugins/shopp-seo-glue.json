        "installation": "<p>It&#8217;s just like any other plugin!</p>\n<p>Either upload the zipped plugin archive using the Add New Plugin screen in WordPress, or unzip and upload the<br />\n<em>shoppseoglue</em> directory so that it resides within your wp-content/plugins directory &#8230; then activate!</p>\n<p>Shopp and WPSEO must both be installed and activated or this plugin will not do anything.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shopp uses custom post types and custom taxonomies, it&#8217;s true, but it does not use the standard WordPress-generated post<br />\nand taxonomy editors. For that reason, WordPress SEO has a hard time integrating with Shopp. This plugin aims to solve<br />\nthat problem by doing the legwork needed to make these plugins play nicely with one another.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I configure virtual page titles/descriptions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Navigate to the Shopp <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">â†’</span> Setup admin screen then click on the SEO tab.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How about All in One SEO Pack?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To the best of my knowledge All in One SEO Pack works with Shopp without any problems. Consequently, this plugin does<br />\nnot integrate with AIOSEOP in any way whatsoever (as there&#8217;s no need). If anyone becomes aware of a popular SEO solution<br />\nother than WPSEO and feels this plugin ought to cover that, too, then please drop a suggestion into the support forum.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this actively maintained &#8230; what&#8217;s next on the roadmap?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t depend upon it! I rebooted the plugin to coincide with the release of Shopp 1.3. At this time however I tend not<br />\nto use WPSEO in my own projects and so this plugin does not occupy the upper strata of my to-do list. With that in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you encounter bugs please do report them and I&#8217;ll fix them when I can. If you can fix them yourself (or perhaps<br />\nhave a developer do so on your behalf) and submit a diff then that&#8217;s even better &#8211; it will benefit everybody</li>\n<li>Remember that this plugin is free and open source &#8211; and is provided in the hope that it will be useful, but without<br />\nany warranty</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
