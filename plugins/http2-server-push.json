So even if you can&#8217;t take advantage of HTTP/2&#8217;s features, people visiting your site may still get a better experience from prefetching.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know if this is working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a couple ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nghttp2.org/documentation/nghttp.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">nghttp</a> is an HTTP/2 client that ships with the nghttp2 suite. <code>nghttp -v http://example.com</code> will show all the HTTP/2 signalling packets, HTTP headers, content, and resources sent from the server in a single request. You can see <code>PUSH PROMISE</code> signals from the server and the pushed resources after the main page is sent.</li>\n<li>In Google Chrome, <a href=\"//net-internals/#spdy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">chrome://net-internals/#spdy</a> will show a history of server connections from the browser. Clicking on a connection will show the discussion between the browser and the server. Within that text, you can see <code>PUSH PROMISE</code> packets and the pushed resources.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I help with development and testing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The source code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/daveross/http2-server-push\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/daveross/http2-server-push</a>.
