        "faq": "\n<h4>Is there a UI to add ostrichcize rules?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. At this time, I really only want developer&#8217;s using this tool. Any WordPress developer that is messing with error<br />\nhandling should easily be able to make this plugin work. If not, the developer should not be using this tool. Similarly,<br />\nusers should not be messing with error reporting.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I run this in production?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You certainly can, but that is not the intent of the tool. It is best to only run this in development.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the use case?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is inspired by having installed countless plugins that throw error notices. Many times, these are small,<br />\nnon-critical errors. Since I often do not have time to fix the errors myself, I allow them to continue to muck up my<br />\nerror logs or on screen display of errors. I thought it would be nice to have a way to hide these errors so that only<br />\nerrors due to my custom code are displayed. Ostrichcize allows you to do just that.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
