It supports built-in wordpress types and custom post types.</p>\n<p>CSV Mass Importer can import attachments and is compatible with WPML.</p>\n<h4>EXPORTING DATA</h4>\n<p>Before you hit the Export button you may want to adjust some settings in the Export section.<br />\nHere are the options you have:</p>\n<p>&#8212; Post type</p>\n<p>You are free to choose between defaut wordpress post types or any custom post type registered.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Load fields</p>\n<p>Use &#8220;Load fields&#8221; button to discover fields associated with the post type you selected previously,<br />\nit includes entity fields, metas and taxonomies. If you don&#8217;t invoke &#8220;Load fields&#8221; action or don´t check any of the loaded<br />\nfields CSV Mass Importer will assume you are trying to export all the data associated with the post type.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Dates</p>\n<p>This will allow you to export posts within a specific time period. Leave empty to export all dates.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Limit</p>\n<p>Specify the number of posts you want to export or leave empty to export them all.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Destination</p>\n<p>Here you select what to do with the exported file, download it or leave it on the server at /wp-content/cmi-data/data.csv.</p>\n<p>Note that CSV Mass Importer does not export post&#8217;s media attachments, but it does import them, see below.</p>\n<h4>IMPORTING AND UPDATING DATA</h4>\n<p>When importing data be sure to have a well structured data file. Its always a good idea to export a number of posts that will serve you as a template. These are the key points to keep in mind:</p>\n<p>&#8212; CSV file header (field names)</p>\n<p>As usual, the first row in the CSV file represents field names.</p>\n<p>There are three data types: entity data, meta data and taxonomy data.</p>\n<p>To distinguish meta data and taxonomy data from the entity data append :meta or :taxonomy to the field name respectively.<br />\nThis plugin version does not include fields mapping facility, therefore be sure to provide correct field system names in your CSV header.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Required fields and default values when importing new posts</p>\n<p>[ID] (required). In case we are acreating new posts the ID field must contain &#8220;new&#8221; keyword for each post entry.<br />\nIf ID is an integer, CMI assumes its an update.</p>\n<p>[post_type] (optional). If ommited or empty CMI will assume you are importing &#8220;post&#8221; type.</p>\n<p>[post_content] (optional). If ommited or empty &#8221;&nbsp;&#8221; will be inserted as a dummy value.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Required fields when updating posts</p>\n<p>[ID] (required). ID is the only required field when updating posts. This field expects an integer. Of course it makes no sense<br />\nto have it alone, add whatever entity, meta or taxonomy field you want to update to your CSV file.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Values</p>\n<p>Values may be simple or multiple. Multiple values always refer to metas or taxonomies and will expand across multiple rows until<br />\nthe next data row begins.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Attachments</p>\n<p>When importing posts with attachments you have to structure the import package differently.</p>\n<p>In order to import posts with attachments place media files in /images folder. Then, add &#8220;attachments&#8221; column in the CSV file and<br />\nfill it with media file names (no paths, just file names) for each post entry respectively. You can enter multiple values, one per cell.</p>\n<p>Assigning thumbnail is simple. To do this, add a &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; column to your CSV file and fill it with file name for<br />\neach post entry respectively. The attachment file must be one of the files you entered in the &#8220;attachments&#8221; column.</p>\n<p>Requirements to the import package when importing data with attachments.</p>\n<p>When importing posts with attachments it is important how you name the CSV file and where you place media files.<br />\nThe requirement is to name the CSV file as data.csv and place the attachment files in /images folder:</p>\n<p>/data.csv<br />\n/images/myimage1.png<br />\n/images/myimage2.png<br />\n/images/myimage3.png<br />\n/images/myimage4.png<br />\n/images/myimage5.png</p>\n<p>For direct upload method, compress data package as a zip archive.<br />\nIf you prefer to upload files by FTP, place them in /wp-content/uploads/cmi-data folder of your wordpress installation.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Multilingual content with WPML</p>\n<p>CSV Mass Importer can import post translations at the same time you import original post data in original language.<br />\nTo accomplish this create &#8220;lang&#8221; column and set language code for each post entry as a two-digit code (e.g. en, fr, de, es &#8230;).<br />\nIts important that translated posts go after the original post.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Post taxonomies</p>\n<p>CSV Mass Importer does not create taxonomy terms. Make sure taxonomy terms exist prior to the data import.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Deleting metas</p>\n<p>Meta values and taxonomies will be deleted if value cell is empty. To prevent this &#8220;Safe mode&#8221; is enbaled by default.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Export button freezes.
