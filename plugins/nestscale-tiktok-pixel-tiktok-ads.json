For example, you can retarget those who have visited their website, viewed specific products but did not purchase, and so on. This will make your products memorable and enhance the possibility that a visitor will return to your store and eventually make a purchase. In addition, based on collected data from TikTok pixels, you can model lookalikes to find new customers and scale your ads faster.</p>\n<p>Ready to boost your TikTok ad conversion rates with our one-click TikTok pixels installer?<br />\nStart today for free!</p>\n",
