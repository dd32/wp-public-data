        "description": "<p>When in Admin mode, this plug-in adds classes to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag to let<br />\nyour CSS know where you are.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are viewing the list of all your Posts, you would get this additional class:<br />\n    edit-list-post<br />\nAnd, when you are editing a Post, something like this:<br />\n    edit-page-post</p>\n<p>Alternatively, for custom posts, for example &#8220;movie&#8221;, you would see either:<br />\n    edit-list-movie<br />\nor:<br />\n    edit-page-movie</p>\n<p>This allows you to write custom CSS and JS to interact with these varying edit pages within WP.</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/thoughts,<br />\nAtg</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the ZIP</li>\n<li>Unzip the ZIP</li>\n<li>Copy/paste the unzipped files into your WP plug-in directory (<code>/wp-content/plugins/</code>)</li>\n<li>From within WP&#8217;s Plugin Admin panel, Activate the plug-in</li>\n<li>Write some wicked CSS and JS to amaze your friends and befuddle your enemies!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What does this do, exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional CSS classes are added to the HTML <code>body</code> tag when certain pages load in Admin mode</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>What classes?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are in WP Admin, if you click Posts, you will see a list of all your Posts, and the CSS class <code>edit-list-post</code><br />\nwill be added to the HTML <code>body</code> tag.  If you click a specific Post, you will enter the edit page for that Post,<br />\nand the CSS class <code>edit-page-post</code> will be added to the HTML <code>body</code> tag.  Note the difference between the two:<br />\n  edit-list-post vs. <code>edit-page-post</code>, <code>list</code> vs. <code>page</code><br />\nSimilarly, if you click Pages, the same thing as above will happen, except the word <code>post</code> will be replaced with<br />\nthe word <code>page</code> in each of the CSS classes.  Futher, if you have custom post types, the word <code>post</code> will be replaced<br />\nwith whatever your custom post type is, so a custom post type called &#8220;Movies&#8221; will results in the following CSS classes<br />\nbeing added:<br />\n  edit-list-movie vs. <code>edit-page-movie</code></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I want to do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Really only if you used some custom CSS or JS in your WP Admin.  You could color the List or Edit headers or<br />\nbackgrounds differently, add custom validation to some fields, etc.  Maybe when you are viewing the list of Posts,<br />\nyou want to see red column and field headers, blue when viewing Pages, and green when viewing Movies, and for the<br />\nMovies Edit page, you have a custom field that you want to validate as some specific format, like a date or number,<br />\nyou could add custom JS just for that page, all based on these new classes on the HTML <code>body</code> tag.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
