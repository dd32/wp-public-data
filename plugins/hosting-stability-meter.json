The graph shows hosting performance peaks and dips.<br />\nMany peaks and dips mean low hosting stability. You can use this in hosting support conversations.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses this <a href=\"https://github.com/hostingstabilitymeter/php-benchmarks-library\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">benchmarks library</a>.<br />\nEach benchmark takes no more that 1 second. You fully control benchmarks calls frequency.</p>\n<p>The plugin may inform you about performance lacks by e-mail.<br />\nAlso it may send stability benchmark results to <a href=\"https://HostingStabilityMeter.Com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HostingStabilityMeter.Com</a> if you allow.

        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhy do I need one more hosting benchmarks plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because it measures benchmarks stability in time, not just hardware or database speed.</p>\n<p>The response time of your site on the hosting should be stable, predictable and should not depend on the load of neighboring sites on the same hosting server or network.<br />\nUnstable response times degrade SEO and usability.</p>\n<p>You can increase the speed of the site by purchasing additional resources, but even in this case, the stability may remain low.<br />\nTherefore, it is important to choose a stable hosting service, this is a guarantee that you will get the desired response time of the site at any time.</p>\n<p>Hosting Stability Meter gives you information about stability of hosting services and helps you to choose the best hoster.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
