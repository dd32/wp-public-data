Since the integration is fully white-labeled its hard to spot and we are proud for it. You will have to go to open your developer tools and check on network tab you will see your images having type: &#8220;webp&#8221; or &#8220;avif&#8221; instead of jpeg/png.

But you can rest assure that<br />\nyour users are enjoying webp Images from over 300 Edge Servers worldwide.</p>\n<p>This is actually part of the WHITE LABEL solution since your urls won&#8217;t change.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20don%27t%20you%20just%20rewrite%20the%20urls%3F'>\nWhy don&#8217;t you just rewrite the urls?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The minute you sign up for url rewrites on your website (imghaste or any other similar service)<br />\nyou immediately lose a portion of SEO juice from your website towards the image service.</p>\n<p>So why waste it when you can benefit from both worlds? 100% SEO and enhanced user experience.</p>\n<p>Also what if you decide to change CDN 3 months later? Will you re-re-write the urls?<br />\nIn our humble opinion it&#8217;s better to have YOUR links in place even if its undetectable (remember.. 100% white label).</p>\n<p>Therefore, we have one option for those brave users<br />\nwho wishes to ditch their brand name in favor of ours, but we advice against it ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20it%20with%20other%20cdn%3F'>\nCan I use it with other CDN?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it works transparently. Our CDN will be the one serving your images, and we will get them from your CDN.<br />\nAs long as your images come from your own domain name, we will intercept them.<br />\nThis setup won&#8217;t provide any additional performance benefits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20all%20browsers%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work with all browsers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can check browser compatibility <a href=\"//caniuse.com/#search=service%20workers&quot;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> as of today there is 95.12% compatibility and growing.<br />\nAs for the rest of the 5.5% this will work the same way it already used to.</p>\n<p>Any browser that supports Service Worker will support the image service.<br />\nTake notice that you need to serve your website using https:// only to register your Service Worker</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20using%20wp%20json%20api%2C%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nI am using WP JSON API, does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Oh yes!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20a%20cname%20for%20seo%3F'>\nDo you offer a cname for SEO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, due to customer demand we do offer cname support<br />\nHowever, We do offer much better than CNAME on our default setup<br />\nWe offer the service on your own domain.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20theme%20does%20not%20provide%20info%20for%20client%20hints'>\nMy theme does not provide info for client hints\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That can be even better in some cases.<br />\nIn that case, the resizing options will be limited to Device<br />\nContact support, to find out about a hybrid solution called Smart Hints by imghaste<br />\nand we be glad to investigate on your behalf.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
