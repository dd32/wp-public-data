When the plugin turns a term into a link, it adds a <code>class</code> of <code>sspg term</code> to the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. In your style sheet, use a CSS selector like <code>a.sspg.term { cursor: help; }</code> to give the glossary links a special rollover style (for instance). You are only limited by your skill and imagination. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
