        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20directories%20can%20i%20build%3F'>\nWhat types of directories can I build?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our directory website builder software combined with our add-on modules is the most powerful directory plugin on the market. The options are limitless. Here are a few types of directories you can create:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business listings</li>\n<li>Company directory</li>\n<li>Team directory</li>\n<li>Member directory</li>\n<li>Staff directory / Employee directory</li>\n<li>Hotel directory</li>\n<li>Medical directory</li>\n<li>Restaurant directory</li>\n<li>Church directory</li>\n<li>Travel review directories</li>\n<li>Software review sites</li>\n<li>Professional directory</li>\n<li>Local provider listings (like a Yelp clone)</li>\n<li>A Yellow Pages directory</li>\n<li>Online magazine listings</li>\n<li>Website listings</li>\n<li>Book review sites</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20accept%20paid%20and%20free%20listings%3F'>\nCan I accept paid and free listings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it can. You can do this by creating plans for 0.00 and some other paid amount at the same time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20video%20tutorials%20for%20building%20wordpress%20directories%3F'>\nDo you have video tutorials for building WordPress directories?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes we do. They can be found <a href=\"https://businessdirectoryplugin.com/video-tutorials/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteversion\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nWill this plugin work with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our WP directory plugin will work with any well-written, WP compliant theme. Generally speaking, paid themes tend to be higher quality than free ones.</p>\n<p>Whatever theme you pick, we recommend using the Theme Check plugin (available for free on WordPress.org) to validate a theme. The more errors and warnings you see on the theme when you run that check, the worse the theme is. You can read more about it at https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20translate%20my%20web%20directories%3F'>\nCan I translate my web directories?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We offer many user-provided translations under the /languages folder. It is already available in the following languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>French</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Russian</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n<li>Polish</li>\n<li>Arabic</li>\n<li>Swedish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And you can also easily <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/business-directory-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translate it yourself</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20wordpress%20multisite%20%28wpmu%29%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite (WPMU)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is. However, you cannot &#8220;network activate&#8221; the plugin (as this will share the database). Activate it on only the sub sites you need it.</p>\n<p>This can be done under Plugins -&gt; Add New as the Administrator user. Do not &#8220;network activate&#8221; as the &#8220;super admin&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
