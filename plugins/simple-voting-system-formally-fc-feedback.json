How does the SVSFc Feedback plugin prevent visitors from providing multiple feedback on the same article?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SVSFc Feedback plugin utilizes visitor fingerprinting methods, such as checking IP addresses, to prevent multiple feedback submissions from the same user on a single article. This ensures that each visitor can provide feedback only once per article, maintaining the integrity of the feedback data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='2.%20can%20i%20customize%20the%20appearance%20of%20the%20feedback%20buttons%20to%20match%20my%20website%5C%27s%20design%3F'>\n2. Can I customize the appearance of the feedback buttons to match my website\\&#8217;s design?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can easily customize the appearance of the feedback buttons to align with your website\\&#8217;s theme. After activating the plugin, navigate to Settings &gt; SVSFc Feedback in your WordPress admin panel. From there, you can customize button labels, colors, and other display settings to seamlessly integrate the feedback feature with your website\\&#8217;s design aesthetic.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='3.%20is%20the%20svsfc%20feedback%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20all%20wordpress%20themes%20and%20plugins%3F'>\n3. Is the SVSFc Feedback plugin compatible with all WordPress themes and plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The SVSFc Feedback plugin is designed to be compatible with most WordPress themes and plugins. However, compatibility can vary depending on the complexity of your theme or the functionality of other plugins installed on your website. We recommend testing the plugin on a staging or development environment to ensure compatibility before deploying it on your live website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='4.%20can%20i%20view%20the%20overall%20feedback%20statistics%20for%20all%20articles%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\n4. Can I view the overall feedback statistics for all articles on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, the SVSFc Feedback plugin displays feedback statistics on a per-article basis. However, you can aggregate feedback data manually by exporting the feedback results from each article and compiling them into a single report. We are considering adding a feature for viewing overall feedback statistics in future updates based on user feedback and demand.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
