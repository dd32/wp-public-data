        "faq": "\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the title properly link to my profile page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Earlier versions of the widget had a bug which would not correctly link up identi.ca profiles in the widget title. To fix this, simply set the widget to use a different network (i.e., Twitter), switch it back to identi.ca, and then save your changes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is it pulling fewer status posts than I&#8217;ve configured it to pull?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either you literally don&#8217;t have enough statuses to fill the queue (i.e., a new account with the service), or you have deleted some. Twitter, and possibly other services, will include a deleted status post in the count (though it is not included in the data).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Added widget configuration options for excluding replies and re-posts.</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed &#8220;Reset cache&#8221; command in widget options and added support for curl with URL-based fopen as the fallback method.</p>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<p>The Twitter API URL was no longer functioning properly, and so it was reconfigured.</p>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<p>A bug that prevented the widget from properly linking up identi.ca profiles in the widget title has been fixed. In order to correct the previous behavior, though, you must manually set your feed network to something other than identi.ca, then back to identi.ca, and save your changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the GPLv2 license in the readme.txt file has been updated to GPLv3 to match the license in the source code.</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>PHP &#8220;short tags&#8221; have been converted to standard echo statements so that the short_open_tag php.ini setting should not break the widget.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<p>Caching has been re-engineered to be more intelligent. Also, the option to clear an instance of the widget&#8217;s cache has been added to the widget configuration menu.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<p>First version released!</p>\n"
