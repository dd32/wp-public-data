Add the Migrator plugin, choose a couple of quick options and click the button. That’s it!

Your UltimateMember community will move to PeepSo. UltimateMember and Migrator will also be deactivated. All necessary shortcodes are set in WordPress pages and your community will be ready for use with PeepSo.</p>\n",

(The other fields in UltimateMember will also be moved but the gender and birthdate fields are available in PeepSo by default and have to be matched manually.)</li>\n<li>Click the ‘Start Migration’ button.</li>\n<li>Confirm that you want to migrate the data.</li>\n<li>Stroke the cat and plan world domination while your data flies into PeepSo.</li>\n<li>Done!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the Migrator only moves the data within the same WordPress installation. You won’t be able to use it to migrate UltimateMember from http://sampledomain1.com to http://sampledomain2.com. It also is designed to migrate from Ultimate Member to PeepSo, not the other way around.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20um%20to%20peepso%20work%20with%20third%20party%20ultimatemember%20plugins%3F'>\nDoes UM to PeepSo work with third party UltimateMember plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As much as we’d love to move all the data stored by every plugin, UltimateMember just has too many. We focused on core UltimateMember and its official extensions. Third party plugins are not supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20to%20migrate%20everything%3F'>\nHow long does it take to migrate everything?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The migration time depends on the size of your community and will vary according to:<br />\n* Number of users<br />\n* Number of posts<br />\n* Number of comments<br />\n* Number of messages<br />\n* Number of notifications<br />\n* Number of friend connections</p>\n<p>The move is also influenced by the speed of the server on which you’re hosting your site.</p>\n<p>We tested moving a few hundred users with over 15,000 activities on a shared hosting environment. It took about four minutes to migrate everything from UltimateMember to PeepSo.</p>\n<p>With a community with a 1000+ members, nearly 60,000 activities on a shared hosting environment the whole migration process took about 11 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20migration%20process%20look%20like%3F'>\nWhat does the migration process look like?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s really simple. You’ll need to install UltimateMember, PeepSo and UM to PeepSo. Open UM to PeepSo and click the ‘Start Migration’ button. That’s it!</p>\n<p>You can see the process in the Screenshots section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20already%20have%20data%20in%20peepso%3F'>\nWhat if I already have data in PeepSo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>UM to PeepSo can move a community from UltimateMember to PeepSo but it’s not able to merge a UltimateMember-based community into an existing PeepSo community. During the migration, all PeepSo data is removed and substituted with the data taken from UltimateMember.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20um%20to%20peepso%20to%20move%20my%20community%20to%20a%20different%20website%3F'>\nCan I use UM to PeepSo to move my community to a different website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. UM to PeepSo will move a UltimateMember-based community to PeepSo within the same WordPress installation. It can’t move the data between websites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20report%20a%20bug%20or%20a%20problem%20with%20um%20to%20peepso%3F'>\nHow do I report a bug or a problem with UM to PeepSo?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the support tab here on the <a href=\"https://PeepSo.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
