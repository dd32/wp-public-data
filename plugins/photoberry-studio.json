        "faq": "\n<dt id='supported%20image%20formats%20and%20size%20restrictions'>\nSupported Image Formats and Size Restrictions\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PhotoBerry Studio currently supports the following extensions: &#8220;.jpeg&#8221;, &#8220;.jpg&#8221;, &#8220;.png&#8221;, and &#8220;.webp&#8221;.<br />\nThere are no inherent size restrictions within the plugin itself; however, any limitations will depend on the user&#8217;s hosting provider. It&#8217;s important to verify your hosting plan&#8217;s file upload size allowances to ensure smooth uploads and performance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20images%20stored%3F'>\nWhere Are Images Stored?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PhotoBerry Studio intentionally keeps gallery images separate from your main media library. This helps avoid any accidental use of gallery images in blog posts or portfolios. Separating these images prevents your media library from becoming cluttered and overwhelming, especially with potentially hundreds or thousands of gallery images.</p>\n<p>Additionally, PhotoBerry Studio ensures that when you delete a gallery, all related images are automatically removed from the server to free up storage space.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
