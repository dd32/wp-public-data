What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses built in WordPress functions to handle image uploading. Therefore, you need to have <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions\" title=\"Changing File Permissions\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">correct permissions</a> set for your uploads directory.</p>\n<p>Also, a file that is not an image, or an image that does not meet the minimum height/width requirements, will not upload. Images larger than the dimensions set in the Settings of this plugin will be scaled down to fit, but images smaller than the dimensions set in the Settings will NOT be scaled up. The upload will fail and you will be asked to try again with another image.</p>\n<p>Finally, you need to verify that your upload directory is properly set. Some hosts screw this up, so you&#8217;ll need to check. Go to &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Miscellaneous&#8221; and find the input box labeled &#8220;Store uploads in this folder&#8221;. Unless you are absolutely sure this needs to be something else, this value should be exactly this (without the quotes) &#8220;wp-content/uploads&#8221;. If it says &#8220;/wp-content/uploads&#8221; then the plugin will not function correctly. No matter what, the value of this field should never start with a slash &#8220;/&#8221;. It expects a path relative to the root of the WordPress installation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting an error message that I don&#8217;t understand. What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://www.nathanrice.net/plugins/wp-cycle/support/\" title=\"email Nathan Rice\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">use my support form</a>. This plugin is now relatively stable, so if you are experiencing problems that you would like me to diagnose and fix, please use my support form.</p>\n<p>As much as I would like to, in most cases, I cannot provide free support.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I style the slideshow further?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the settings of the plugin, you&#8217;re able to set a custom DIV ID for the slideshow. Use that DIV ID to style the slideshow however you want using CSS.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>In what order are the images shown during the slideshow?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Chronologically, from the time of upload. For instance, the first image you upload will be the first image in the slideshow. The last image will be the last, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I reorder the images?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at the moment, but this is a feature I do want to include in the plugin soon.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I rotate anything other than images with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This is an image slideshow. Enjoy it for what it is.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you have future plans for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Here are some things that I want to eventually include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add ability to reorder the images</li>\n<li>Add new effects to the slideshow</li>\n<li>Add the ability to override settings by using function arguments: <code>&lt;?php wp_cycle('rotate=1&amp;effect=fade&amp;img_width=300&amp;img_height=200&amp;div=slideshow'); ?&gt;</code></li>\n<li>Possibly add widget support so that you can put a slideshow in a widget area</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
