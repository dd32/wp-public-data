Sometimes WordPress does not quite resize the featured image in the best way. Avoid this and have full control over your featured images on any device with this plugin.</p>\n<p>To add a mobile featured image, simply upload a new image in the meta box right below the WordPress Featured Image called <em>Mobile Featured Image</em>. The new image can be a specifically resized version of your featured image or an entirely new image targeted especially for mobile viewers.</p>\n<p>You can add your mobile featured image without worrying about slowing down your site. The mobile image is added to the <code>srcset</code> attribute of your featured image. Vistors&#8217; browsers will automatically download the best image for the size of their screen.</p>\n<p>This plugin works by filtering the <code>wp_calculate_image_srcset</code> function and changing the url for all screens under 980w to the mobile featured image. 980w is a reliable breakpoint between the iPhone 6+ and the iPad, two common measures for when a mobile image would be needed.</p>\n",

The mobile image is added to the srcset attribute of the featured image. The visitor&#8217;s browser will download only the image they need. Leverage responsive images and speed up mobile experiences!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress automatically adds a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#Example_3_Using_the_srcset_attribute\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">srcset attribute</a> to your featured image. The srcset tells modern browsers which image is most appropriate for the size of the screen&#8217;s device so the visitor doesn&#8217;t have to download a giant image to show on a small phone screen.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
