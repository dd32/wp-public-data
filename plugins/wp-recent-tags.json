It&#8217;s very easy to use, think this way, if you want to google your post, what keywords should you use, that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p><strong>Why &#8216;Recent Tags&#8217;?</strong></p>\n<p>Giving an example:</p>\n<p>Olympics were very hot about a month ago, and we might write many posts about this topic, then &#8216;Olympics&#8217; was a very hot tag. But Olympics would not always the hot spot, right? It&#8217;s gone, and we might talk Elections now, so how to let the visitors get this, get what you&#8217;re talking about now?</p>\n<p>Recent Tags! That&#8217;s the simplest way.</p>\n<p><strong>How to define &#8216;Recent&#8217; and something you should know?</strong></p>\n<p>&#8216;Recent&#8217; is a problem? Yep, actually it is.  Recent tags might be tags used in some recent posts, or it might be the tags used in some recent days, strictly speaking, they&#8217;re different, but most of the time, the difference can be very small. The point is when you see the tags, you do tell it is the &#8216;recent&#8217; ones.</p>\n<p>For performance considerations, this plugin will log your tags by days, that means it can tell you what and how many times a tag be used for a specific day, and what the hot tags in some recent days.</p>\n<p>But for most of us, we don&#8217;t write posts very day, right?  So there&#8217;s a problem here, if you ask hot tags in recent 2 days, you might get a empty box, as you didn&#8217;t publish anything. To solve this problem, this plugin will still ask to show the hot tags in some recent posts, but the calculation method will be:</p>\n<p>Giving an example, to show the hot tags in recent 20 posts, it will get the date of the 20th post first, and calculate the hot tags since that day.</p>\n<p><strong>Worry about performance?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to calculate the tag stat directly through wordpress tables, but the server usage  will be extremely high, so this plugin creates a table in your database to track your tags by day. You can treat these data as some pre-calculation, if you&#8217;re not publishing posts every minute and every post gets lots of tags, I don&#8217;t think you should worry about this table.</p>\n<p>Also, I think you may use the <a href=\"http://www.mashget.com/2008/09/01/wp-widget-cache-for-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Widget Cache</a> to cache the widget output</p>\n",
