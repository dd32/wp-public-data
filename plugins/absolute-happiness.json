Doing this as a daily exercise your brain will learn to scan the world for the positives first.</li>\n<li><strong>Journaling</strong> – Write about 1 positive experience from the last 24 hours this allows you to relive it. This activity, much like the first one, trains your brain to think about and focus on the positives first.</li>\n<li><strong>Exercise</strong> – Teach you and your body that your behavior matters.</li>\n<li><strong>Meditation</strong> – 5 minutes each day to watch your breath go in and out, when doing this, try to remain patient and if you feel your mind drifting bring it back to focus. this will take practice, but it is one of the most powerful happiness lifters. Shortly after meditation you will feel calm and contentment and you will increase your awareness and empathy. Longer term affects of regular meditation include the rewiring of the brain to elevate your happiness baseline, reduce stress, and improve immune function.</li>\n<li><strong>Conscious Acts of Kindness</strong> – Write 1 positive email praising or thanking someone in their social support network. Alternatively plan and carry out one positive act for someone in your social network, then write about it here, reflect on what you did and how it made you and the recipient of your positive act feel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How do I contribute?</h3>\n<p>If you are a developer or would like to contribute to the code you can head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/ericfrisino/absolute-happiness\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github repo</a> and submit bug reports and/or create pull requests!</p>\n<p>If you are a user and have no interest in the code, please hit me up in the support tab above, but be nice and please explain your problem fully so I can figure out how to best fix it.</p>\n<p>Maybe you are interested in <a href=\"http://ericfrisino.com/absolute-happiness-wordpress-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reading the docs</a>.</p>\n",
