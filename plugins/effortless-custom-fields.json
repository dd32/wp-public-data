        "description": "<p>Effortless custom fields is the <strong>super easy</strong>, <strong>most beautiful</strong>, and the <strong>least confusing</strong> custom fields plugin you have seen so far.</p>\n<p>It offers 32 field types including <strong>posts-dropdown,</strong> <strong>taxonomy-dropdown,</strong> <strong>users-dropdown,</strong> <strong>menus-dropdown,</strong> <strong>sidebars-dropdown,</strong> <strong>multiple-images,</strong> <strong>multiple-files,</strong> and many more.</p>\n<p>It allows you to create fields for all <strong>post types,</strong> <strong>taxonomies,</strong> <strong>all setting pages,</strong> <strong>customizer,</strong> and <strong>user profiles.</strong></p>\n<h3>How it makes your life 5 times easier :</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<em>It lets you <strong>save all your time &amp; energy</strong> that go in “<strong>confusion, learning, organizing, waiting, and styling</strong>” with other custom field plugins.</em><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</p>\n<h3>Create your custom fields in 3 simple steps :</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose Fields’ Destination:</strong> Choose where you want to create your fields: for posts, pages, categories, customizer, or profile, etc… Every location has its own set of fields.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Select Field Type:</strong> Out of 32 types of fields, decide the type you want. Fields’ visuals, search, and logical categorization help you decide quickly.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Enter Field’s Data:</strong> Just fill the data related to field: label, key, placeholder, description, default value, etc… You can also control field’s visibility with visibility filters.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDRot_n2BuU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Amazing new possibilities, you’ve never seen before :</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now <strong>organize</strong> your fields with <strong>incredible ease.</strong></li>\n<li>Its <strong>beautiful</strong> and <strong>minimal design,</strong> and <strong>how elegantly it responds</strong> to actions gives an absolute delight.</li>\n<li>We value your time, so there are <strong>no unnecessary ajax-calls</strong> and <strong>page-loads.</strong></li>\n<li>It demands almost <strong>zero learning.</strong> Using it is as easy as breathing. Everything just makes sense.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</p>\n<h3>More reasons to love it:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Only one function to learn — “effcf_get” :</strong>  This is the only function you need to get the field value in the frontend. If a single function can handle it, why to offer more. Offering more functions lead to more confusion, more complexity, and more effort—exact opposite of our core values. How big deal it can be to learn using just one function. Even for learning this, you don’t need to go anywhere else; code is provided where you create the field itself.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Short and simple documentation :</strong> In a race to give more features than their competitors, companies end up making softwares so complex that at most times user struggles. Instead of putting efforts on design and ease of use, they try to explain everything in documentation. But ECF is different. It won’t require you to refer documentation often—everything is clear and obvious. Documentation is, however, created for ECF but is kept super simple and small. It only covers things that are not obvious.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Fields management is not a pain anymore :</strong> In ECF, you have one place to create or manage fields for one location (let’s say post type = post) and a completely separate place for another location (post type = page), and so on. No field sharing accross locations—direct one to one mapping. Everything neatly organized. No matter how many fields you need to manage for each location, you’ll do it with ease and confidence.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Easily copy fields to other locations :</strong> In ECF, each location own its independent set of fields. If you want similar fields—that you already created for one location—for other locations, you can use this option.<br />\nFollow the steps:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1)</strong> Select fields you want to copy.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>2)</strong> Choose action “Copy to other locations.”<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>3)</strong> Choose locations where you want these fields.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>4)</strong> Click “Copy Selected Fields to Selected Locations” button.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Fields are trashed before permanent deletion :</strong> Now, you won’t be interrupted with most irritating prompt in most software: “Are you sure you want to delete…?” Whenever you press delete on a field or field-group, it will safely move to trash—living there as long as you want. Whenever you feel the need, you can delete all or some of them in one go—by selecting and deleting.<br />\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>You can disable fields, groups, tabs, etc… :</strong> Disabling fields, groups, tabs, etc… is a great option to have. if you are unsure of an entity’s (field, tab, section, repeater section) future need, don’t delete it, disable it. It will hide disabled entities for your clients but remain in place to be shown whenever needed. You can think of this feature as a temporary deletion.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ecfwp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Visit our Website</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ecfwp.com/docs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>See Docs</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ecfwp.com/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Get Support</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––</p>\n<h3>PREMIUM</h3>\n<p><strong>Effortless Custom Fields</strong> plugin’s <strong>premium version</strong> is also available.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ecfwp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more »</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ecfwp.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"> Buy ECF Premium »</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Free vs Premium</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Field Grouping</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free:</strong> You can group your fields only with “headings.”</li>\n<li><strong>Premium:</strong> You can group your fields only with “tabs,” “accordions,”  “field groups,” and “headings.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Repeater</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free:</strong> No repeatable fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Premium:</strong> Create unlimited repeatable fields in any possible location.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",
