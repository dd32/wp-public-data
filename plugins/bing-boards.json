Email yourteam@bing.com and let us know you&#8217;re ready to start using the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get a WordPress key?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve been onboarded as a Bing Boards contributor, we&#8217;ll give you the WordPress key to add to the Bing Boards plugin. Everyone needs to do this, but once you&#8217;ve got the key, you can start submitting boards.</p>\n<p>Add your WordPress key in Users &gt; Your Profile &gt; About Yourself</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I click the Submit to Bing button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the Submit to Bing button is greyed out, you may not be an approved Bing Boards contributor yet.  You&#8217;ll need to request access.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the difference between a Bing Board and a panel?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A panel is what we call a &#8216;page&#8217; of a board. In general, we like Bing Boards to have at least 5 panels, or pages. If you&#8217;re in preview mode, add a panel to a board by clicking the Create a New Panel thumbnail at the bottom of the preview screen. If you see a list of panels but no preview, add a panel by clicking the blue Add New Panel button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens after I submit a board?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Bing editors will review your board and make minor edits, if necessary.  If larger edits are needed, we&#8217;ll reach out to you directly. Once the board is ready, we&#8217;ll add keywords that make your board appear in search results and publish your board to Bing. We will send you a mail letting you know once your board has been published.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are good topics for Bing Boards?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now we are only publishing boards in the lifestyle category. Lifestyle is a broad category that includes everything from recipes and crafts to gardening and photography. If you have an idea for a board and you&#8217;re not sure it&#8217;s a fit for lifestyle, please reach out to yourteam@bing.com.</p>\n<p>When choosing topics for your boards, think about which topics are most popular on your blog. Holidays generally see high search volume. If you have content that aligns well to an upcoming holiday or seasonal event, consider using it for a board topic-or you can create entirely new content to appear on Bing. We accept content that&#8217;s already published on your blog as well as new content that you publish first on Bing. Finally, you can use Bing Ads (https://bingads.microsoft.com/) to evaluate how popular a particular topic is before you create your board.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Still have questions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Email yourteam@bing.com at any time for help.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
