        "faq": "\n<h4>How are grades calculated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WpCues Quiz computes the grade either on basis of total points collected or percentage correct answer scored  by the visitor. Then it finds the grade. For example: If you have 2 questions and the correct answers in them give 5 points each, the visitor will collect either 0, or 5 or 10 points at the end. You may decide to define grades &#8220;Failed&#8221; for 0 to 4 points and &#8220;Passed&#8221; for those who collected more than 4 points. In reality you are going to have more questions and answers and some answers may be partly correct which gives you full flexibility in assigning points and managing the grades.<br />\nYou can also issue certificate on the basis of grade attained by the user.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I show the quiz to the visitors of my blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to create a post and embed the quiz short code. The quiz short code is shown in a column on Quiz table. Also you can directly insert from add/edit quiz form by clicking &#8216;Insert into post&#8217; button.<br />\nYou can place as many as exam shortcode as you want in a post /page or anywhere (even in widget in sidebar).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to translate the plugin interface in my language</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the standard WordPress way of translating plugins (via Poedit and .po / .mo files).<br />\nIf using Poedit, your file names should start with &#8220;watu-&#8220;. For example: watu-de_DE.po / watu-de_DE.mo. They should be placed in wp-content/languages/plugins folder.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
