Click/hover on the menu. You see a sub-menu page named Add Form. Click on the sub-menu page. Please wait for while and your initial set up is ready. You have to give a title for your form and then select a blank/basic form which would be appeared when your initial set-up is done. Now you can add/customize/delete your form field.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use my created contact form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use a short code named &#8220;ngForms&#8221;. When you create a form, in All Forms sub menu page you can get the short code of your created form. Just copy and paste the short code to any page, post or anywhere you want.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there any conflict with Angular and WordPress in your plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, we have integrated Angular within WordPress in a way that there must have no conflict with existing theme, plugin or WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Did you integrate full Angular framework within WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, we just integrated some necessary Angular packages through webpack. Even total file size of the plugin is just 2.1MB!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
