        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this in compliance with Google Adsense Terms of Service and Policies ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Google adsense allows ads to be placed inside the content. However, you should review Google Adsense Terms of Service and Policies to make sure that your content is good to place ads in it. Your google ads should not be associated with other images in your content, should not be placed along with pornographic content. Since the ads are added automatically, you must check that they do not end up to be displayed in a way that is not recommended by Google.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why the ads appear on a single post but not on the homepage ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your theme contains a slider or any other feature that will use the_content function the ads won&#8217;t be displayed on the homepage. We are working to fix this.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
