        "description": "<p>LeadBooster Chatbot by Pipedrive is a chatbot plugin that captures visitors to your WordPress website and turns them from qualified leads into deals in your Pipedrive CRM account.</p>\n<p>Just customize your chatbots appearance, set up conversations from templates or by creating your own, and let your bot get to work engaging each of your website visitors. While greeting and offering them assistance, your bot is also pre-qualifying them as leads.</p>\n<p>Hot leads are then assigned to the right sales reps and fed straight into your Pipedrive pipeline as deals. Your bot can even help visitors schedule calls and meetings with your sales reps that sync to their Pipedrive calendars. With leads flowing into your pipeline, your sales team has more time to focus on turning them into customers instead of tracking them down in the first place.</p>\n",
