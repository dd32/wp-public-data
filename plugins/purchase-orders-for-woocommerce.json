The gateway will ask for the purchase order number &#8211; select whether to also display text boxes for name and address of the company to be invoiced, and whether any of those are required fields. Don&#8217;t forget to mark a field as not required if it&#8217;s not to be displayed or your customer will not be able to check out!</p>\n<p>The purchase order details will be displayed in the admin order screen, the customer order received screen and both admin and customer order emails.</p>\n<h4>WooCommerce compatibility</h4>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with WooCommerce 3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x and 8.x versions.</p>\n<h4>HPOS compatibility</h4>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with WooCommerce High Performance Order Storage (HPOS) and WordPress posts storage (legacy).</p>\n<h4>Checkout Blocks Compatibility</h4>\n<p>This plugin is not yet compatible with checkout blocks.</p>\n<h4>Compatibility with other plugins</h4>\n<p>Some invoicing plugins require the meta keys of purchase order data to display this data on invoices. The meta keys used in this plugin are listed below:</p>\n<p>_purchase_order_number<br />\n_purchase_order_company_name<br />\n_purchase_order_address1<br />\n_purchase_order_address2<br />\n_purchase_order_address3<br />\n_purchase_order_town<br />\n_purchase_order_county<br />\n_purchase_order_postcode<br />\n_purchase_order_email</p>\n<h4>Order status</h4>\n<p>Select the order status to apply to the order to when a customer checks out using a Purchase Order. All order statuses are available for selection including any custom statuses that may have been added. Be aware that if you set the status to Pending, neither you nor the customer will receive an order email after checkout &#8211; this is standard WooCommerce functionality. By default, order emails will be sent when a status is changed from Pending to On Hold or Processing.</p>\n<h4>GDPR information</h4>\n<p>This plugin will gather and store a company&#8217;s name, address and/or email address. This could also be construed as an individual&#8217;s personal data. However, as the user has opted to pay by this method, it is suggested that the lawful basis for processing this data is contractual necessity. Processing is necessary in order to send the invoice to the user or user&#8217;s representative. This data is stored as standard postmeta data and will be retained until the order is permanently deleted (not trashed).</p>\n",
