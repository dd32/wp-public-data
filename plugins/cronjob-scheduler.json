It is designed to make easy work of creating and managing custom cron jobs. If this plugin has been helpful for you, then please donate to keep our WordPress plugin projects running!</p>\n",

If you manage the server, you can setup your cron using the crontab service. Make sure that wget is installed befor doing this.</p>\n<h4>Creating Custom Action Example</h4>\n<pre><code>function my_cronjob_action () {\n    // code to execute on cron run\n} add_action('my_cronjob_action', 'my_cronjob_action');\n</code></pre>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nCan I create my own custom schedules?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the whole idea of the plugin, you setup your schedules and the tasks you want to run and the plugin will handle the rest!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I create a task to run?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just create a new function in your theme files (or somewhere else you will remember) and create an action with the same name.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I run an event at any time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, just go to the Cronjob Scheduler interface and hit the <code>Run</code> button against the task.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
