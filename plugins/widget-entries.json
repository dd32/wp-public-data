There you will be able to create and manage your custom widgets.<br />\nA new widget will be able in Appearance &gt;&gt; Widgets menu, called &#8216;Widget Entry&#8217; that allows to use all the widgets entries created.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I use PHP inside my widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to add some scripting to your widgets using the shortcodes <code>[php][/php]</code>. All the text inside those tags will be interpreted as PHP code.<br />\nThe PHP execution is based in the exceptional plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/allow-php-in-posts-and-pages/\" rel=\"ugc\">Allow PHP in Post and Pages</a>. Have a look to its page for further usage instructions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want my widget to display the message `[php]Hola amigo[/php]`. How can I do it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the shortcodes <code>[php off][/php]</code>: If you write <code>[php off]Hola amigo[/php]</code> the widget will display <code>[php]Hola amigo[/php]</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why the `[php]` shortcodes are not working on my posts or pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Widget Entries does not aim to give the inline php execution feature to the posts and pages. To do so I recommend to use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/allow-php-in-posts-and-pages/\" rel=\"ugc\">Allow PHP in Post and Pages plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a lot of widget entries in my WordPress, and selecting them for appearing in the sidebar is a pain, because the list is too long. How can i make it shorter?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have created a lot of widget entries I&#8217;m sure you are not using them. You can unpublish (save as a draft) the ones that you don&#8217;t use it anymore, and they will not appear in the select box of the widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>An editor user cannot create widget entries. What capability is needed to create them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The capability needed is &#8216;edit_theme_options&#8217;, the same that is needed to edit sidebar widgets. You can change the capability modifying the &#8216;cap_required&#8217; variable at the begining of the plugin source.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>More info</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find further information on the <a href=\"http://marquex.posterous.com/pages/widget-entries\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Widget Entries plugin web page</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
