Which might help you pinpoint the error.</p>\n<h4>Why is the number of comments wrong?</h4>\n<p>The nr of comments will be updated when a user views the post in question or fetches it through ajax. Which means the<br />\nstatic numbers of comments will not change until a proper refresh of the page is done.</p>\n<h4>The meta-box contains an empty comment rss feed!</h4>\n<p>Since the comments are replaced with comments from your Zoorum forum the rss feed will be more or less useless, try<br />\nto disable it if you can.</p>\n<h4>What is the plugin prepending my posts with?</h4>\n<p>The plugin prepends the Zoorum topic titles with the category for the given post. if no category is set, the plugin will use &#8216;uncategorized&#8217; or whatever the standard fallback category is. If there are multiple categories, the plugin<br />\nwill choose the prepend like this: 1. the first parent found where both child and parent is categories for post, 2.<br />\nthe first category in alphabetic order. If the comments are done on non-post-object the plugin will select a fallback<br />\nprepend.</p>\n",
