For instance, if you want to create a long list of Word documents or PDF documents, you can simply attach them to the page or post, then insert the shortcode where you&#8217;d like that list to appear.</p>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>The simplest way to use this plug-in is just to use the shortcode. That will, by default, list the attachments with the most recent upload at the top of the list and the oldest upload at the end of the list. No heading will be included above the list. The list will be created as an unordered list with the CSS class of &#8220;attachment-list&#8221;.</p>\n<p>[list-attachments]</p>\n<h4>Options</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>type &#8211; a comma-separated list of file extensions that should be included in the list.

For instance, you can use a common &#8220;description&#8221; for your attachments to organize them into groups. In that case, you would use &#8220;post_content&#8221; as the &#8220;groupby&#8221; parameter for this shortcode</li>\n<li>before_list &#8211; any HTML code you want to appear before the list begins<br />\nopening &#8211; the opening tag(s) for the list (defaults to &lt;ul class=&#8221;attachment-list&#8221;&gt;)</li>\n<li>closing &#8211; the closing tag(s) for the list (defaults to &lt;/ul&gt;)</li>\n<li>before_item &#8211; the opening tag(s) for each item of the list (defaults to &lt;li&gt;)</li>\n<li>after_item &#8211; the closing tag(s) for each item of the list (defaults to &lt;/li&gt;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the first version of this plug-in, so I&#8217;m certain there are a lot of features that still need to be added and bugs that need to be worked out.

If that folder does not exist, you can safely create it. Make sure <strong>not</strong> to upload the listAttachments <em>folder</em> into your mu-plugins directory, as &#8220;Must Use&#8221; plugins must reside in the root mu-plugins directory in order to work.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.4.1a</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Verified compatibility with WordPress 3.5.1</li>\n<li>Allow uppercase/mixed-case usage of order property (previously, the plugin ignored the property if it wasn&#8217;t lowercase)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4a</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the usage of the &#8220;orderby&#8221; argument. Was previously only working with the &#8220;groupby&#8221; argument set. Now works as it should.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3a</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to display the size of each attached file</li>\n<li>Fixed the usage of the &#8216;type&#8217; argument</li>\n<li>Adjusted the way the HTML code arguments are handled</li>\n<li>Added the plugin to the WordPress plugin repository</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2a</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the usage of links to each attachment</li>\n<li>Prepared the plugin for public release in the WordPress repository</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1a</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First version of the plugin</li>\n</ul>\n"
