        "description": "<p>WP-CRM System is a fully featured WordPress CRM that allows you to use the WordPress interface you are already familiar with to manage your customers, projects, and tasks with ease.</p>\n<p>Why spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a CRM that charges based on the number of records you have in your database, or the number of users that you have accessing your database?

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20makes%20wp-crm%20system%20different%20from%20other%20crm%27s%3F'>\nWhat makes WP-CRM System different from other CRM&#8217;s?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many other CRM&#8217;s are hosted on the CRM company&#8217;s servers, which requires you to maintain an active subscription in order to access YOUR data. WP-CRM System gives you control over your data by keeping it all contained on your WordPress CRM website. You own it all and no one can ever keep you from it &#8211; just like it should be. There are no expensive contracts required in order for you to access your customer&#8217;s information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20share%20information%20with%20customers%3F'>\nCan I Share Information With Customers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! We have a <a href=\"https://www.wp-crm.com/downloads/client-area/?utm_source=extensions&amp;utm_medium=description_tab&amp;utm_content=client-area&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Client Area</a> add-on, which lets you assign projects, tasks, campaigns, and even invoices (with our <a href=\"https://www.wp-crm.com/downloads/invoicing/?utm_source=extensions&amp;utm_medium=description_tab&amp;utm_content=invoicing&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Invoicing</a> add-on) to your contacts. When your contact logs into their account, they&#8217;ll be able to see everything you&#8217;re working on for them.</p>\n<p>If you need to show your contacts the data that you have on them for GDPR purposes, you will be able to use the GDPR settings to handle this without the need for any additional plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20am%20coming%20from%20another%20crm%2C%20can%20i%20import%20my%20data%3F'>\nWhat if I am coming from another CRM, can I import my data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. There are inexpensive extensions that allow you to import as little or as much information as you need to into your WordPress CRM.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20my%20data%20secure%3F'>\nIs my data secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your data is only accessible through the WordPress CRM dashboard. None of it will be accessible through the public facing portion of your website unless you are using our GDPR features (see above). This allows you to provide access to as few or as many people as you need to.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Create a project or task once, and have it automatically generate a new one after a given number of days, weeks, months, or years.</li>\n<li>Depreciated settings for GDPR page. This has been replaced with the built-in WordPress privacy export and erase tools. The GDPR page setting will still function for anyone who was using it, but will no longer show as an option if it was not previously set.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added upsell feature and minor improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Introduced features to integrate with the WordPress privacy tools included in WordPress version 4.9.6. Includes the ability to export or erase information on a contact when the contact&#8217;s email address is entered into the export or erase tool in WordPress.</li>\n<li>New: Included text to assist users when drafting their website&#8217;s privacy policy. Legal guidance is not provided. Only information about the types of information that is collected in WP-CRM System and where it is located.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Introduced features to allow users to more easily comply with GDPR rules. Those features include a way for your contacts to view the data that is stored on them in WP-CRM System, the ability for your contacts to export that data, and the ability for contacts to request that their data be deleted. <strong>This plugin by itself does not guarantee GDPR compliance.</strong></li>\n<li>Change: register taxonomies on the plugins_loaded action rather than init as was done previously. This allows taxonomies to be exported in reports since the export is done around the setup_theme hook, which takes place prior to init.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Variable $status used in WPCRM_System_Create for a new filter, which incorrectly caused the $status variable passed to the function to be overridden.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Provided filter <code>wpcrm_system_create_contacts_email_key_status</code>, which can be used to change the <code>post_status</code> value when searching for existing contacts by email address. Default value is <code>publish</code> as this is the default <code>post_status</code> value, which was used previously.</li>\n<li>Update: Provided filter <code>wpcrm_system_menu_name</code> to allow for whitelabeling of WP-CRM System&#8217;s menu name. This filter allows for changing the name in the left menu.</li>\n<li>Update: Provided filter <code>wpcrm_system_menu_icon</code> to allow for changing the dashicon used in the menu next to WP-CRM System. By default the dashicon is <code>dashicons-id</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Provided filter &#8216;wpcrm_system_create-contacts_email_key&#8217; which should return true or false. False is default, and will cause contacts to be created or updated based on the contact&#8217;s name. True would cause contacts to be created or updated based on the contact&#8217;s email address.</li>\n<li>Add Zapier to list of extensions.</li>\n<li>Minor bug fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Added extra conditions to be passed to the update or create new record method.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Campaign list table was pulling the incorrect information in the projected reach column.</li>\n<li>Fix: WPCRM_System_Create projects had an incorrect key for the project description field, causing project creation to not set the description correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.1 &amp; 2.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Included campaigns to WPCRM_System_Create class.</li>\n<li>Fix: Corrected error in contact category filter on email page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Added WPCRM_System_Create class to enable developers to create new records in WP-CRM System.</li>\n<li>New: Added filters to each record&#8217;s field type to allow developers to modify the default fields that are shown.</li>\n<li>Fix: Minor CSS update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Sort function on record categories would return an error when no categories were assigned to a record. Moved the sorting into the check to see if record has categories.</li>\n<li>Update: Compatible with WordPress 4.9</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update: Added a category column to each of the overview pages (Contact, Organization, Project, Task, Opportunity, Campaign). Allows for easier navigation to the various category overview pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Certain extensions were incorrectly displayed as not installed on the WP-CRM System &gt; Extensions page. This has no impact on the functionality of the extensions just the display of whether or not they are installed.</li>\n<li>Update: Added new information (can users register) to system info report found on WP-CRM System &gt; Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; System Info.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Added filter wpcrm_system_add_calendar_entry to allow plugin developers to add custom dates to the calendar shown on the WP-CRM System dashboard. Developers can query custom fields, or hard code important dates in the calendar such as holidays.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved: Google Maps scripts were loading when no Maps API key was provided. Maps will not display without an API key, so there is no need to load scripts.</li>\n<li>Minor update: Added new plugins to extensions page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Output of dates in certain circumstances would produce an error. Fix should prevent invalid dates from being displayed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.8 &#8211; 2.1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved: Added export class for export plugins to extend. Compatible with WP-CRM System Import/Export plugins version 2.1 or later.
