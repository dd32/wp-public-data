Oh, and did I mention it has a very pretty animation?</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>In the menus, you&#8217;ll see a new menu for &#8220;Progress Bars&#8221; which is what you&#8217;ll use to add and manage progress bars. There&#8217;s also an area here for settings, but honestly if you never touch them, things will work fine.</p>\n<p>After configuring a progress bar, insert it anywhere you&#8217;d like with shortcode.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple example: <code>[progress id=32]</code></li>\n<li>Race multiple bars: <code>[progress id=32,35,54]</code></li>\n<li>Set the bar&#8217;s width: <code>[progress ids=12,33 width=\"25%\"]</code></li>\n<li>Set the height of the bar `[progress ids=12 height=&#8221;50px&#8221;]</li>\n<li>Align Center: <code>[progress ids=4 width=\"50%\" class=\"aligncenter\"]</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that &#8220;id&#8221; and &#8220;ids&#8221; are interchangeable</p>\n<p>Or use the widget which allows you to pick bars to display</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t look right..</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This project uses some cutting-edge CSS3 to make things look cooler like drop shadow, inner-shadow, border-radius, etc. If it doesn&#8217;t look right in your browser first, consider upgrading, second: let me know what browser you&#8217;re using to see if I want to consider support. Things should degrade gracefully for non-cutting edge browsers (although IE6 is still going to look like crap no matter what you do). You&#8217;re welcome to write your own CSS to override what I&#8217;ve already written (or un-check &#8220;Default Styles&#8221; on the settings page and roll-yer-own). Of course, if it&#8217;s supposed to look right and it isn&#8217;t, then there may be issue you should let me know about&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the filter hook to modify a percentage?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add this to your functions.php file, or your own plugin.\n        </p>\n<p>You can use this to add 10%, like the example above, or do something cool like pull in data from an external API. If you come up with something fun and clever, I&#8217;d love to feature it!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: An issue with the minified CSS resulted in ugly progress bars unless WP_DEBUG was set to true. Thanks to @maximus85018 for pointing it out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where all the shortcodes in the Progress Bar Administration Panel were displaying the same.</li>\n<li>Now allows for two digit precision floating numbers on percentages inputed, calculated, and the start/end values.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>UPGRADE NOTICE: Because of the change to how bars in the widget are selected and stored your widgets will not display properly until you re-configure them. Sorry for any inconvenience, but I thought the new interface was totally worth it.</li>\n<li>Much easier to select bars to display in the widget thanks to Chosen.js.</li>\n<li>Custom Colors! Now possible to set custom colors for each bar using the very nice miniColors color picker</li>\n<li>Lots of sanitization behind the scenes to make the plugin more secure</li>\n<li>Height options. It&#8217;s now possible to set the height of the progress bar(s) in the shortcode by passing a CSS height value. See &#8220;Usage&#8221; for an example</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Progress bars can now be defined using a percentage or two numbers ( x of y ) and let the plugin do the calculation</li>\n<li>The text display on the bar itself can be nothing, the percentage, the two numbers, or both. The global setting to turn this on and off still exists.</li>\n<li>Changed the checkbox on the admin page to make it clear it is a global &#8220;off&#8221; switch for bar text, not just percentage.</li>\n<li>Added a filter hook for the percentage being shown. This provides the ability to hook in your own method of calculating percentages. The hook name is <code>tdd_pb_calculated_percentage</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: The malformed CSS classes were still present in the minified file causing errors. This has been fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SVN issue means anyone downloading 0.3.3 may have only received a subset of the files needed. This is a version bump to get around that, no other changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Some CSS classes were malformed causing the wrong color progress bar to display.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a description textbox to the progress bar widget. Displays below the progress bar.</li>\n<li>Modified the title tag of the progress bar to include the percentage.</li>\n<li>Added role=&#8221;progressbar&#8221; and aria hints to the progress bar container</li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the title of the widget instance wasn&#8217;t be included in the widget admin form container header. (confusing, I know). Basically, it&#8217;s easier to see what the widgets are when they are all collapsed.</li>\n<li>Animation Javascript is now loaded minimized when WP_DEBUG == false</li>\n<li>Props to user ablereach for providing the input for much of this update, specifically the input on accessibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now loads a minimized and optimized version of the stylesheet when WP_DEBUG == false</li>\n<li>Stylesheet run through prefixr which may broaden browser support for the advanced CSS3 bling I use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New Colors! Added Black and Silver to the mix.</li>\n<li>Updates the CSS classes to all be prefixed by tdd_pb. This may break any custom CSS you were using, but it eliminates conflicts with other themes and plugins.</li>\n<li>Adds basic widget functionality making it much easier to add progress bars into widgetized areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>fixes an issue where the get_text_domain() function was referencing a non-existant directory and throwing an error</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes an issue where the &#8220;quick edit&#8221; link (and others) would not show up on the Manage Posts screen.</li>\n<li>Also a version bump to 0.2 (which should have happened instead of 0.1.3)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Given the major change to the CSS, the javascript to make things animate also had to change pretty extensively. One side effect is that the animations on a page will eventually slow to a standstill at the rate of about 1-2 pixels every 15 seconds or so. The animation is still a work in progress&#8230;</li>\n<li>Major bug fixes for the CSS to show up in, well, pretty much everything but Chrome. Didn&#8217;t realize I was using an unsupported style.</li>\n<li>Small CSS fix for the &#8220;Strawberry&#8221; color &#8211; now shows up correctly</li>\n<li>Quick Edit mode on the &#8220;Manage Progress Bars&#8221; page now has the ability to change percentage and bar color. No need to specifically edit the progress bar now.</li>\n<li>Added the function tdd_pb_get_bars() function, which could be used in templates, but I&#8217;m going to leave undocumented for the moment so If it needs to change, it can. It&#8217;s mostly designed for internal use.</li>\n<li>Added [tdd_pb] as a shortcode alias for [progress]. I think most people will use [progress], but I wanted to use [tdd_pb] since it&#8217;s all over the code</li>\n<li>The Default CSS and Javascript are now added to the progress bar pages in wp-admin.</li>\n<li>Progress bars are now displayed in wp-admin on the &#8220;Manage Progress Bars&#8221; and the &#8220;Edit Progress Bar&#8221; screens</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Settings page actually works now</li>\n<li>Settings page now references <strong>FILE</strong> instead of some arbitrary tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Left some debugging code for the advanced debug bar in the script. Have to remove it to make this thing work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>.1</h4>\n<p>The first version admin side as well), and remove the action that adds the styles to the public side.</p>\n<h4>0.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&#8217;d like the settings page to work, upgrade.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Blocking bugfix. Plugin won&#8217;t work unless you upgrade</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>.1</h4>\n<p>Yes, you should totally upgrade to the first version released&#8230;</p>\n"
