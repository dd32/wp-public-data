The plugin comprises of a suite of third-party external tools, which will help users to analyse, assess and improve the SEO and search engine visibility of their pages, posts or other post types.</p>\n<p>The Essential SEO Toolkit is a very powerful suite of tools used by Opace everyday and will be particularly beneficial in roles such as SEO, Web Development and Digital Marketing (as well as many others too). There is no charge for this tool, so why not download it, there is nothing to lose and a lot to gain!</p>\n<p>As with any toolkit, there are a range of tools – each of which when used helps to get a different part of the job done! The tool when opened will use the current URL as its default (this can be changed) and will provide speedy data viewing for the website selected.</p>\n<p>In our latest version, we have added some new features.

In the makeup of the URL, you can use three tags, which will be replaced by the current page&#8217;s URL markup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[%scheme%] &#8211; The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. It can be HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL).</li>\n<li>[%host%] &#8211; The host name identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.yoursite.com.</li>\n<li>[%path%] &#8211; The path identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, /tags/news/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember to click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; once you have finished.
