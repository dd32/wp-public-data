        "description": "<p><strong>Important: This plugin is designed to operate on media files hosted<br />\noutside your WordPress site. It does not integrate with the Media library,<br />\nand it does not create the media files.</strong></p>\n<p><em>External &#8220;Video for Everybody&#8221;</em> is a WordPress plugin that you can use to show<br />\nvideos on your WordPress site. You enter a simple shortcode on your page, and<br />\nthe plugin generates the HTML to deliver the media. Browsers that understand<br />\nthe HTML5 tag will display MPEG/H.264 (.mp4) files, VP8/webm (.webm), or Ogg/Theora (.ogv) files. Other browsers can use Flash to play the .mp4. In all cases, the<br />\nmarkup includes links to download the media files. The HTML comes with<br />\nonly minor variations straight from the <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video for<br />\nEverybody</a> model. See that site for fuller details.</p>\n<p>Users can optionally use the<br />\n<a href=\"http://videojs.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">VideoJS</a> JavaScript library to outfit their videos<br />\nwith an attractive set of controls that includes a full screen option.</p>\n<p>This plugin is not for everybody, even if the video tries to be. If I were not<br />\nwriting my own plugin, I would probably be using the <a href=\"http://soukie.net/degradable-html5-audio-and-video-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Degradable HTML5 audio<br />\nand video Plugin</a> by Pavel Soukenik. My plugin uses and will follow the <a href=\"http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Video for<br />\nEverybody</a><br />\napproach. I also offer an options page where you can define site-wide default paths and dimensions. The defaults can be overridden in any particular shortcode, but if most of your video resides in the same place and has consistent dimensions, site-wide defaults keep the shortcodes simple. Soukenik&#8217;s<br />\nshortcodes give you more control over playback options.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> Most autobuffering problems have been settled, but<br />\npreloading (autobuffering) preferences are supported unevenly in some<br />\nolder browers and versions of browsers. Depending on how many movies you<br />\nserve on a single page, and on how large they are, autobuffering can<br />\nsignificantly slow your clients&#8217; browsers, and it can also hit your bandwidth.</p>\n<p>For a discussion of autobuffering in html5 see:<br />\nhttp://daringfireball.net/2009/12/html5_video_unusable</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>A minimal shortcode takes the form</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>[external-vfe name=\"VIDEO\"]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>where <em>VIDEO</em> stands for the simple name of your video (without any file<br />\nextension).</p>\n<p><em>name</em> is the only required attribute. Optional attributes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>width (in pixels)</li>\n<li>height (in pixels)</li>\n<li>path (URL to the folder where you host your video files)</li>\n<li>query (to follow the file name in the URL; should start with &#8220;?&#8221;)</li>\n<li>include_poster (set to &#8220;true&#8221; to include a poster attribute in the video tag)</li>\n<li>webm_download (include a link to a webm file in the list of downloads)</li>\n<li>poster_extension (png, jpg, or gif)</li>\n<li>swf_file (The address to your Flash player)</li>\n<li>vjs (set to &#8220;true&#8221; to provide attractive video controls with full screen option)</li>\n<li>file_detector (try to detect remote files if &#8220;true&#8221;)</li>\n<li>access_cookie (if you need a simple cookie to access the remote files)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the above can also be set as defaults on the options page under:<br />\nMedia &gt; External VfE</p>\n<p>The options page also includes two parameters that cannot be overridden for<br />\nan individual video:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the ability to disable VideoJS so that the JavaScript and the style sheet will not load at all </li>\n<li>the option to disable the built-in style sheet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the plugin home page for more details:<br />\nhttp://open.pages.kevinwiliarty.com/external-video-for-everybody/</p>\n",

As I update the plugin, existing video will be served using the new code.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted to have a settings page so that I could spare myself the trouble of adding repetetive details to each video entry.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who is this plugin for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ultimately it&#8217;s for myself. I created the External &#8220;Video for Everybody&#8221;<br />\nplugin to suit my own priorities, but I also tried to put it together in a way<br />\nthat would make it useful for and usable by others, and I am happy to share<br />\nit. I host my video outside my WordPress site. I want to use HTML5, Ogg and Webm.<br />\nSo&#8230; <em>External &#8220;Video for Everybody&#8221;</em></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are you offering support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I create the video files this plugin looks for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.flossmanuals.net/TheoraCookbook/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Theora Cookbook</a> has a lot of information on how to encode .ogv files.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Miro Video Converter</a> is a handy free and opensource utility for this purpose.</p>\n<p>You might also be interested in trying a <a href=\"https://github.com/kwiliarty/vfe-sh\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shell<br />\nscript</a> I use to convert videos<br />\nfor myself. The shell script depends on your having certain command-line<br />\ntools installed on your computer: ffmpeg and qtfaststart.py in particular.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
