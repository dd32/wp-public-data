This is a bad idea for security, and for SEO, as it can look like duplicate content on different URLs.</p>\n<p>The answer to this is to redirect requests to non-SSL (http) URLs over to their SSL (https) equivalents using something called a 301 redirect. This tells the client (and search engines) that the resource they are looking for should always be accessed over SSL.  This plugin offers two methods to achieve this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By intercepting WordPress pages at header time, and if they are not already being requested over HTTPS sending a 301 redirect header, or</li>\n<li>By adding mod_rewrite rules in the .htaccess file to redirect all requests to their HTTPS equivalents using 301 redirects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optionally, this plugin can also set <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HSTS</a> headers for you, and make sure that all requests use the same hostname (i.e. fixing the issue where many sites can be accessed using both www. and non-www.

While using www. or not is personal preference, it&#8217;s usually a good idea to make sure that <strong>all</strong> visitors access your site using whichever hostname you have chosen.</p>\n<p>Selecting this option achieves this by applying a 301 redirection that makes sure that requests use the hostname you have specified in <code>WordPress Admin -&gt; General Settings</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='troubleshooting'>\nTroubleshooting\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin checks your SSL certificate and warns you if it detects any issues, but if you enable it without a properly configured SSL certificate then you could end up not being able to access your website. If that happens please try the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, try bypassing the SSL warning in your browser (sometimes the option to do this is hidden behind an &#8220;Advanced&#8221; or &#8220;Show Details&#8221; button, in Chrome you need to type &#8220;thisisunsafe&#8221; &#8211; search online for how to bypass SSL warnings in your particular browser).</li>\n<li>If that doesn&#8217;t work, try adding the following line in your wp-config.php file to disable the redirection plugin:<br />\ndefine(&#8216;DISABLE_SIMPLE_SSL_REDIRECTS&#8217;, true);</li>\n<li>Or, edit your .htaccess file and remove everything between the lines<br />\n# BEGIN Simple SSL Redirects<br />\nand<br />\n# END Simple SSL Redirects</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
