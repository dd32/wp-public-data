Why?</p>\n<p>The standard approach is to display a &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; feed by pulling in links to pictures and content straight from &#8220;Voldemort&#8221;. This means that not only are all of the pictures often much larger than they should be, but on every single page load, your user has to make http requests to multiple domains and download all of the content from your &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; feed, on EVERY page load.</p>\n<h4>Typical &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; Feed Plugins can double page loads in some instances!</h4>\n<p>As a web consultant for hundreds of sites, I found myself constantly having to tell my client &#8220;this site would have great load times and page scores&#8230;if it weren&#8217;t for the social media feed&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This plugin was built to address this issue. It finds and retrieves the optimal image sizes from &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; and then stores them to your server, creating a fully cacheable newsfeed.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Does this make my entire site faster?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It makes your &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; feed faster due to not having to fetch content from &#8220;Voldemort&#8221; servers on every page load. However, your site may still suffer from bad coding practices that are out of my control. Test your site with a speed testing website, such as http://gtmetrix.com to find out more information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Nothing happens when I implement the feed</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin requires the PHP basics: cURL, Apache write permissions to the plugin folder, and basic jQuery on the front end.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin is free. There has to be a catch?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No catch. I made this plugin out of necessity for the websites that I build and manage and I felt as if the rest of the community could use it!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>You made such an awesome plugin, you must be ruggedly handsome as well?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we are all ruggedly handsome and consistently spend time in the outdoors wearing flannels.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
