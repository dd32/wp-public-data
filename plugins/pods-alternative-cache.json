It was developed for and tested on the WPEngine platform to improve performance of cached objects generated from Pods, but it works on numerous other hosting providers.</p>\n<p>Pods Alternative Cache is a great addition to a site already utilizing Object Caching, it further separates and allows Pods to utilize more consistent persistent caching without affecting other plugins and WordPress caching objects. Especially when utilizing larger configurations, this plugin improves performance by ensuring other necessary objects are not removed by the server to make room for Pods cached objects.</p>\n<p>This plugin requires the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/\" rel=\"ugc\">Pods Framework</a> version 2.4 or later to run.</p>\n<p>For more information on how to use this plugin, see <a href=\"https://pods.io/2014/04/16/introducing-pods-alternative-cache/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pods.io/2014/04/16/introducing-pods-alternative-cache/</a>.</p>\n<p>Also check out the FAQ below for more details on customizing the configuration through your wp-config.php file.</p>\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\n<p>Check out our GitHub for a list of contributors, or search our GitHub issues to see everyone involved in adding features, fixing bugs, or reporting issues/testing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-alternative-cache/graphs/contributors\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github.com/pods-framework/pods-alternative-cache/graphs/contributors</a></p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20an%20alternative%20cache%3F'>\nWhy an Alternative Cache?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hosts like WPEngine and GoDaddy have limits set on their object caching engine that are based on what they find optimal for their environment. Sometimes, plugins, themes, and even WordPress core can utilize object cache to the point where it gets too full. When that happens, certain caching engines like APC can remove objects from their cache and that can cause what appears to be random numbers of queries on each page load.</p>\n<p>What Pods Alternative Cache does is store all of the Pods objects that need caching, separate from the default object caching engine. Depending on the environment or site, this may still not be optimal. You&#8217;ll want to test things out and keep an eye on your site&#8217;s performance to see if it&#8217;s the right fit for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20options%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat options are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In your wp-config.php, or prior to the <code>plugins_loaded</code> action, you can define other constants to change how the plugin works.</p>\n<p>Change the storage type (be sure to deactivate/activate between storage type switches):</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'PODS_ALT_CACHE_TYPE', 'db' ); // Default is 'file', you can choose 'memcached' too\n</code></pre>\n<p>Change the path to the File cache folder:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'PODS_ALT_FILE_CACHE_DIR', 'path/to/folder' ); // Default is 'wp-content/podscache'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Set Memcached Server host or IP address</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'PODS_ALT_CACHE_MEMCACHED_SERVER', '127.0.0.1' ); // Default is 'localhost'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Set Memcached Server PORT number</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'PODS_ALT_CACHE_MEMCACHED_PORT', 11211 ); // Default is 11211\n</code></pre>\n<p>Disable Pods Alternative Cache:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'PODS_ALT_CACHE', false ); // Default is true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Disable object cache fallback, when File writes fail:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'PODS_ALT_CACHE_FALLBACK', false ); // Default is true\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
