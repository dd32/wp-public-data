This means that your visitors are routed through the Cloudflare network. This<br />\n   allows Cloudflare to stop attacks before they reach your network. It also allows Cloudflare to<br />\n   speed up page load time by more efficiently routing packets and, more importantly, caching<br />\n   static resources (images, javascript, css, etc.) on a very fast connection. However, as a<br />\n   result, the connecting IP will always come from the Cloudflare network.</p>\n<p>As a result, commenters&#8217; IP will also be masked by Cloudflare. Luckily, Cloudflare sends the real<br />\nuser&#8217;s IP in a separate header. This plugin saves it, as well as the user&#8217;s geo-location (also<br />\nprovided by Cloudflare), and displays this information in the admin panel.</p>\n",
