You will also need to have an active IDX Broker account for the plugin to work. If you have an account, simply go to the IMPress for IDX Broker plugin page within WordPress, enter the API key provided via your setup email, and click the &#8216;Save&#8217; button.</li>\n<li>Your plugin will now pull your IDX Broker account information into WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20idx%3F'>\nWhat is IDX?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Internet Data Exchange, or IDX, is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS&#8217;s website. IMPress for IDX Broker connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and then adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to your website(s).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20idx%20broker%20connect%20with%20the%20impress%20for%20idx%20broker%20plugin%3F'>\nHow does IDX Broker connect with the IMPress for IDX Broker plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An IDX Broker API key (IDX Broker Account Required) provides the IMPress plugin with access to preset Widgets, search forms, an xml sitemap file, and much more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20the%20idx%20content%20hosted%2Fupdated%3F'>\nHow is the IDX content hosted/updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IDX Broker hosts your IDX data on a subdomain (e.g., search.yoursite.com). This allows IDX Broker to update quickly, and offers a lightning-fast, co-brandable search engine for real estate professionals and WordPress designers regardless of the quality of the hosting solution that you are using for your website. Low quality, inexpensive hosting solutions often cannot process or manage the amount of data provided by an IDX feed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20idx%20broker%20hosted%20in%20the%20cloud%3F'>\nWhy is IDX Broker hosted in the cloud?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All IDX feeds are hosted on high-quality GCP (Google Cloud Platform) servers with multiple layers of redundancy. This ensures that even if your hosted website (mysite.com) goes down, your IDX Broker pages (search.mysite.com) will almost always be available to visitors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20wrapper%20and%20why%20does%20idx%20broker%20need%20to%20create%20a%20wrapper%20page%20on%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nWhat is a Wrapper and why does IDX Broker need to create a Wrapper page on my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The IMPress plugin offers an easy one-button option to create a Wrapper for IDX pages. This wrapper page is then used to magically update your IDX pages every hour, or whenever you modify/refresh your IDX Broker plugin page. This means less work for you or your website developer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20an%20idx%20broker%20lite%20or%20platinum%20account%20in%20order%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need an IDX Broker Lite or Platinum account in order to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you (or your client if a designer) are not a member of a local board or MLS, or the MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IMPress for IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20my%20service%20area%20available%3F'>\nIs my service area available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://idxbroker.com/idx_mls_coverage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about our MLS coverage.</a> Note that some MLS&#8217;s may charge you a separate fee for access to your IDX feed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20idx%20broker%20require%20a%20long-term%20contract%20like%20other%20idx%20services%3F'>\nDoes IDX Broker require a long-term contract like other IDX services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. IDX Broker requires a month-to-month agreement only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20pricing%20for%20idx%20broker%20services%3F'>\nWhat is the pricing for IDX Broker services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For updated pricing, please <a href=\"https://idxbroker.com/idx_broker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visit our website</a> to compare the available account types.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20i%20expect%20if%20i%20decide%20to%20get%20my%20idx%20feed%20through%20idx%20broker%3F'>\nWhat can I expect if I decide to get my IDX feed through IDX Broker?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you sign up for a new account our MLS team will send you a Docusign email (or PDF). Simply add your signature to the Docusign file or PDF in order to proceed. If you are not a Principal Broker, and have provided us with your Broker name and contact information, we will then forward the same paperwork to your Broker for approval. Once we receive the paperwork from your Broker, we will send it to the MLS for data approval. MLS approval can take anywhere from 3-10 days. Once approved, we will activate your account, integrate your site&#8217;s design into IDX pages, and send you IDX Broker login credentials so that you can use this plugin to add links and Widgets to your site or blog.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20blogs%2Fwebsites%20can%20i%20integrate%20with%20idx%20broker%3F'>\nHow many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Features provided by this Plugin &#8211; Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto any WordPress website or blog. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. Note that using iframes to display this same content is prohibited and may result in account termination due to MLS rules.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20other%20requirements%20for%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat are Other Requirements for this Plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin requires PHP version 7.0 or higher. For security reasons, we recommend updating to the latest stable version of PHP your web host provides. We also recommend using the latest production version of WordPress. See <a href=\"https://support.idxbroker.com/s/article/wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this article</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20currently%20have%20impress%20listings%20and%2For%20impress%20agents%20-%20what%20does%20the%20new%20plugin%20consolidation%20mean%20for%20me%3F'>\nIf I currently have IMPress Listings and/or IMPress Agents &#8211; what does the new plugin consolidation mean for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For users with IMPress 3.0+ who have legacy versions of IMPress Listings and/or IMPress Agents already installed, the plugins will continue to work as-is. However, if the user selects ‘Enable Listings’ or ‘Enable Agents’ in the new IMPress for IDX dashboard, the legacy IMPress Listings/Agents will be deactivated and the new consolidated version of the plugin will be used. Any existing data for Listings/Agents will be unaffected.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
