If this is a problem, go into the settings page in your admin screen and you can configure it to not use the alternate headline on the page, only on the link to the page. This means that when a post wins, you would be best served by changing the post title, although that might mess up your social media mojo as well. Alas.</p>\n",

When a headline has been shown enough, the headline with the most clicks wins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>That sucks!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yeah, but it is better than some alternatives.
