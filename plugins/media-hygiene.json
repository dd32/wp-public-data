You’ll be presented a list in our dashboard that is safe to delete.</p>\n<p>Please backup your site before you delete the files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20remove%20any%20media%20files%20that%20are%20still%20being%20used%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill this plugin remove any media files that are still being used on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Media Hygiene plugin will not remove media files that are in use on your website. This means that if a media file is being used in a post, page, or other database entry, it will NOT show up in the scanning results and be presented as an option to be deleted.</p>\n<p>If you are certain that some files are being used on your site, you can whitelist that file and it will longer be considered for deletion.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20identify%20and%20remove%20the%20unused%20media%20files%3F'>\nHow does the plugin identify and remove the unused media files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Media Hygiene uses a few scanning modes. The first mode compares the database entries of specific modules with the files. The second mode scans each folder in the wp-content/upload directory. It identifies files that are not listed in the database and considers them to be unused.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20remove%20any%20media%20files%20from%20my%20backups%3F'>\nWill this plugin remove any media files from my backups?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Media Hygiene plugin does not have the ability to look inside backups and/or remove any files from your backups.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20removing%20unused%20media%20files%20affect%20the%20performance%20of%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill removing unused media files affect the performance of my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While removing unused media files does not directly impact page loading times, removing unused media files can actually improve the performance of your server and indirectly improve loading times. Unused media files take up space on your server and can cause backups to take longer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20risk%20of%20data%20loss%20or%20corruption%20when%20using%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nIs there any risk of data loss or corruption when using this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like any software, there is a small risk of data loss or corruption when using the Media Hygiene plugin. However, the developer has taken steps to minimize this risk by thoroughly testing the plugin and including safety features on various hosting platforms (e.g. shared, VPS, and dedicated). Please note: websites hosted on shared platforms have a greater probability of failure due to limited allowable resources dictated by the hosting provider.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is always recommended to keep a backup of your website before using any plugin that modifies your directories, just in case something goes wrong.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20should%20i%20run%20this%20plugin%20to%20keep%20my%20media%20library%20clean%3F'>\nHow often should I run this plugin to keep my media library clean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The frequency at which you run the Media Hygiene plugin depends on how frequently you add media files to your website. There is an email notification feature that allows informs you of the number of files uploaded but not scanned.</p>\n<p>If your website receives a high volume of traffic and media files are frequently added, it&#8217;s recommended to set notifications more frequently, such as every week.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20have%20any%20limitations%20or%20potential%20conflicts%20with%20other%20plugins%20or%20themes%3F'>\nDoes this plugin have any limitations or potential conflicts with other plugins or themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Media Hygiene plugin is designed to work seamlessly with all the most popular WordPress themes and plugins.
