As a result, once the order is placed, the customer doesn&#8217;t see the discount they got in the email or invoice they receive, and the admin doesn&#8217;t see this in the order details either.<br />\nThis is because WooCommerce only considers <em>coupon discounts</em> as discounts, whereas a change in price (a sale price or a programmatically modified price) is simply regarded as the actual price of the product.</p>\n<p>This plugin addresses that issue by copying the &#8216;regular price&#8217; from the product data as soon as the order is created (either in the backend or via the checkout). This price is then set as the item&#8217;s &#8220;pre-discount&#8221; price (leaving the actual price paid untouched).
