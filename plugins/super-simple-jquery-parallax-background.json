        "faq": "\n<h4>How does this work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It enables a very lightweight bit of javascript on your pages. Using jQuery, it watches for scrolling on the page, and makes the background scroll slower than the content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t it look *awesome*?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>How it looks depends on the background image used, and your theme. It works well with themes like Twenty Twelve, where content bits have their own opaque background color. I also suggest using a background image that tiles seamlessly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While I will do my best to honor inquiries about this plugin, I did not release it with the intent to support it. This plugin is to be used at the user&#8217;s own risk and I may not always be able to respond to inquiries or continue updating the plugin on a regular basis. The actual methods employed by this plugin are relatively &#8220;simple&#8221; in nature, and almost any WordPress or web developer should be able to help you out, in my absense. Use the fine forums provided by WordPress to seek help.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
