        "faq": "\n<h4>Why not reset failed attempts on a successful login?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is very much by design. Otherwise you could brute force the &#8220;admin&#8221; password by logging in as your own user every 4th attempt.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is this option about site connection and reverse proxy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A reverse proxy is a server in between the site and the Internet (perhaps handling caching or load-balancing). This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.</p>\n<p>The option default to NOT being behind a proxy &#8212; which should be by far the common case.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I whitelist my IP so I don&#8217;t get block?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First please consider if you really need this. Generally speaking it is not a good idea to have exceptions to your security policies.</p>\n<p>That said, there is now a filter which allows you to do it: &#8220;login_lmt_whitelist_ip&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\nfunction my_ip_whitelist($allow, $ip) {<br />\n     return ($ip == &#8216;my-ip&#8217;) ? true : $allow;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;login_lmt_whitelist_ip&#8217;, &#8216;my_ip_whitelist&#8217;, 10, 2);</p>\n<p>Note that we still do notification and logging as usual. This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either wait, or:</p>\n<p>If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/login-limit/login-limit.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the login_lmt_blocks option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: &#8220;UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = &#8221; WHERE option_name = &#8216;login_lmt_blocks'&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
