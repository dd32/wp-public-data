All of our plans require that you first create your free Kraken.io account. No credit card is required, and we give you free testing quota of 50 MB, with which you can test all the features we offer, including this plugin.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you would like to test the performance and results of Kraken.io Image Optimizer, you can try the free Web Interface at https://kraken.io/web-interface which does not require any registration.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20purchase%20an%20api%20key%20and%20secret%3F'>\nWhere can I purchase an API key and secret?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From our plans page, right <a href=\"https://kraken.io/plans\" title=\"Kraken.io plans and pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

You can now start optimizing images from within Media Library. Any image you upload from now on, through any of the media upload screens will be optimized on-the-fly by Kraken.io.</p>\n<p>For advanced users, there is a third party WordPress Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to allow image optimization from the command line, or by using cron. For details, visit: https://github.com/tillkruss/wp-cli-kraken</p>\n<p>Please send bug reports, problems, feature requests and so on to support (at) Kraken dot io, or directly to the author of this plugin.</p>\n<h4>Connect with Kraken.io</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Website: https://kraken.io</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrakenIO\" title=\"@KrakenIO\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/krakenio\" title=\"Kraken.io Image Optimizer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kraken-io\" title=\"Kraken.io on Github\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes and Incompatible plugins</h3>\n<p>If you use the WP Super Cache plugin, you must <strong>disable the plugin</strong> prior to performing any image optimization, as it is known to cause strange and buggy behaviour with the Kraken.io Image Optimizer plugin.</p>\n<h3>Any Questions?</h3>\n<p>We love to hear from you!
