Creating users is essential for the proper functioning of the plugin and data synchronization.</p>\n<h3>Use of 3rd Party or External Services</h3>\n<p>Our plugin relies on the following third-party services for data synchronization and processing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Toret Endpoint Services:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used for data synchronization between websites.</li>\n<li>Service URL: <a href=\"https://app.toret.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">app.toret.net</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.toret.net/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Use and Privacy Policies</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>wp-background-processing Library:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used for gradual processing of lengthy tasks, specifically for initial synchronization.</li>\n<li>Library URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-background-processing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp-background-processing</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These services are integral to the plugin’s operation, and their use is fully documented and transparent.</p>\n",
