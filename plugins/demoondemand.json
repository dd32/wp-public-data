When their website visitors want to view the videos, they access it via the DemoOnDemand player, directly from the WordPress website. The WordPress plugin allows DemoOnDemand customers, whose corporate websites have been developed using WordPress, to add the DemoOnDemand player directly to their website. When the website visitor clicks the DemoOnDemand button on a WordPress website, it launches the player and serves the video from our SaaS application to the WordPress website. The player allows the visitor to search, start, stop and play the video. The experience is similar to launching YouTube or Adobe PDF player on a WordPress website. However, instead of a YouTube video player, they will launch the DemoOnDemand player, and enjoy additional functionality and benefits.</p>\n",
