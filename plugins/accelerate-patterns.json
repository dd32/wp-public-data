        "description": "<p>Create Patterns in the Block Editor<br />\nCreating Patterns that you can easily re-use on your site or on other sites has never been easier. After installing the Accelerate Patterns plugin you can use the WordPress Block Editor to create your Patterns.</p>\n<p>You can quickly create Patterns from the My Patterns editor. Just select any block or blocks (core and premium blocks), style them however you want, then click the “Create Pattern” button that the Accelerate Patterns plugin adds to the top toolbar. The new design will then be stored in your Patterns library.</p>\n<p>You can also easily create a Pattern from a Post or Page you are working on.  Just click on the first block and then hold the shift key and click on the last block you want to include. Then click the Create Pattern button in the editor toolbar.</p>\n<p>You can create full pages, layouts, and blocks that can all be saved as reusable Patterns.</p>\n<p>Build Out a Library of Custom Patterns<br />\nYou can build out an unlimited number of Patterns that you can always access from your Library or export to a new site. Create custom categories for your Patterns so you can keep them organized. You can even add searchable descriptions.</p>\n<p>Preview, Manage &amp; Edit Your Patterns<br />\nYou can preview your Patterns and even edit them within the My Patterns editor.</p>\n<p>Use Your Patterns in the WordPress Pattern Inserter/Explorer<br />\nYou can insert your Patterns from the Patterns tab/drop-down in the inserter, or click the Explore button to access them from the explorer. Once inserted you can edit the blocks without affecting the Pattern.</p>\n<h3>Copyright</h3>\n<p>Accelerate Patterns, Copyright 2022 TAC Marketing Group<br />\nAccelerate Patterns is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>In your admin panel, go to Plugins and click the &#8216;Add New&#8217; button.</li>\n<li>Click Upload Plugin then Browse for the .zip file on your computer. </li>\n<li>Click Install Now.</li>\n<li>Click on the &#8216;Activate&#8217; button.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Does creating a Pattern with the plugin require any coding?<br />\nNo coding is required. Simply select one or more blocks and create your Patterns from the Block editor. You can use WordPress core blocks as well as premium blocks. Use the block editor to customize your block layouts and styles.</p>\n<p>Can I create new categories for my Patterns?<br />\nYes you can create custom categories to easily manage your Patterns. If you are a designer you create a set of home page designs, landing pages, pricing tables, and more. You can even add descriptions to make them searchable.</p>\n<p>What happens to my Patterns if I uninstall the plugin?<br />\nOnce a pattern&#8217;s content is inserted into a page or post it will not change unless you edit the post. You simply won&#8217;t have access to your patterns in the Pattern Explorer.</p>\n",
