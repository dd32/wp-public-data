This is what led to the development of our <a href=\"https://gravityforms.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravity Forms</a> to <a href=\"https://salesforce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SalesForce</a> plugin. It allows WordPress sites to easily integrate and funnel potential customers and leads from Gravity Forms to SalesForce systems. It works with any WordPress theme.</p>\n<p>If assistance is still needed in setting up our Gravity Forms to SalesForce plugin we provide direct support through a full documentation section, FAQs and a contact form to speak directly to our development team who built the plugin.</p>\n<p>Quit worrying about the setup and management of your Gravity Forms to SalesForce integrations and instead focus on driving leads and results!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Salesforce Setup</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses a Salesforce Connect App in order to access your Salesforce installation. Please refer to the Salesforce documentation (https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Connected_Apps) for more details on Connected Apps and how they work.</p>\n<p>This user guide will go through the basics of setting up a Connected App for use by the plugin.</p>\n<p>First, go the Setup area of Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Under Platform Tools, locate the App Manager.</p>\n<p>Then click the New Connected App button.</p>\n<p>Fill in all of the required basic information.</p>\n<p>Make sure to enable OAuth Settings and set the Callback URL to https://salesforce.com</p>\n<p>While you can limit the OAuth Access Scope of the app to whatever you want, Full Access may be the easiest and give you the most flexibility.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve created the app, make note of your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. These are needed when configuring the plugin in WordPress.</p>\n<p>After the app is set up, click the Edit Policies button.</p>\n<p>Make sure that Permitted Users is set to All users may self-authorize and IP Relaxation is set to Relax IP restrictions.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Setup</h4>\n<p>Once you’ve installed and activated the plugin, click Settings to configure Salesforce and your license.</p>\n<p>Enter the license key you received when you purchased the plugin.</p>\n<p>Next, enter your Salesforce username, password, consumer key, and consumer secret. You can also enter an optional security token if your Salesforce installation requires on.</p>\n<p>Once everything is configured properly, you should see a message saying you’re connected to Salesforce and displaying how many API requests you have remaining.</p>\n<h4>Setting Up A Form</h4>\n<p>In this simple example, we’ll connect a Gravity Form to the Contact object in Salesforce. In GravityForms, create a basic Contact form with name, email, phone, &amp; address fields.</p>\n<p>Then click on Settings for your form and click Salesforce.</p>\n<p>The plugin works by creating Feeds. Each feed will allow you to select a Salesforce object and then map the fields of that object to the fields of the GravityForm.</p>\n<p>You can have multiple fields tied to different Salesforce object. Feeds are processed in the order they’re listed and can be rearranged by dragging and dropping.</p>\n<p>From the Salesforce Feeds list, click Add New to create a new feed.</p>\n<p>Give the feed a meaningful name. Since we’re mapping this feed to the Contact object, we’ll name the feed Contact.</p>\n<p>Select the Contact object from the pulldown in Step 2. Once it’s loaded, look at the Field Settings. The pulldown on the left will contain all available Salesforce fields for the Contact object.</p>\n<p>The pulldown on the right in Feed Settings contains all of the available fields from the GravityForm. In the example below, we’ve mapped the Email field from the GravityForm to the Email field of the Contact object in Salesforce.</p>\n<p>Here is a complete feed which maps all of the important fields from our GravityForm back to the Salesforce Contact object.</p>\n<p>When this form is submitted, a new Contact will be created in Salesforce.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhere can I find the complete documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>https://plugins.viastudio.com/plugin/via-gravityforms-salesforce/docs</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nAre there any hooks or filters for developers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! There are several useful hooks and filters for extending the plugin.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the complete documentation:<br />\nhttps://plugins.viastudio.viastaging.com/plugin/via-gravityforms-salesforce/docs</p>\n</p>\n\n",
