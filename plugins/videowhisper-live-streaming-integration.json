Conventional out-of-the-box WebRTC solutions require each client to establish and maintain separate connections with every other participant in a complicated network where the bandwidth load increases exponentially as each additional participant is added. For P2P, streaming broadcasters need server grade connections to live stream to multiple users and using a regular home ADSL connection (that has has higher download and bigger upload) causes real issues. These solutions use the powerful streaming server as WebRTC node to overcome scalability and reliability limitations. Solution combines WebRTC HTML5 streaming with relay server streaming for a production ready setup.<br />\nCurrent implementation allows HTML5 broadcasting using WebRTC from Chrome and Safari.</p>\n<h3>Attributions</h3>\n<p>Some demo site screenshots show tests with the &#8220;Big Buck Bunny&#8221; video, available under Creative Commons Attribution at https://peach.blender.org/download/ .</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin Homepage : https://broadcastlivevideo.com </li>\n<li>Developer Contact : https://consult.videowhisper.com</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Demo</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Test it on live site https://videonow.live</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Extra</h3>\n<p>More information, the latest updates, other plugins and non-WordPress editions can be found at https://videowhisper.com/ .</p>\n",
