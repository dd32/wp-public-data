In Events Manager it can be quite cumbersome to make sure you have done everything.

Unlike what the EM Dev told me, it <em>is</em> possible to filter the Admin Events List per Event Category if Global Tables Mode is enabled.</p>\n<p>Since version 2.0 this add-on is (almost) fully compatible with that. The <em>only</em> thing still missing, is selecting Events Categories in the Quick Edit menu on sub blogs. But all other features of this add-on run smoothly.</p>\n<p><strong>Compatibility with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stonehenge-em-ongoing-events/\" rel=\"ugc\">EM &#8211; Ongoing Events</a>:</strong><br />\nIf you cancel a main event, all sub events will be cancelled as well, but if you cancel a sub event, the rest of this Ongoing Series will remain unchanged.</p>\n<h4>How to test it?</h4>\n<p>Simply create a test event like any other. Publish it and add yourself as a participant. Then set the test event to &#8220;Cancelled&#8221; and watch the magic happen.</p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>I am open to your suggestions and feedback!<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.stonehengecreations.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Please also check out my other plugins, tutorials and useful snippets for Events Manager.</a></p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='are%20refunds%20automated%3F'>\nAre Refunds automated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, if you cancel an event refunding the online payment has to be done manually. Events Manager allows for many Payment Gateway add-ons and all work differently behind the scenes. Also, refunds might be subject to your General Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>\n<p>You could consider offering your customer to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stonehenge-em-move-bookings/\" rel=\"ugc\">Move the Booking</a> instead.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20add-on%20compatible%20with%20em%20ongoing%20events%3F'>\nIs this add-on compatible with EM Ongoing Events?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is. If you have <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stonehenge-em-ongoing-events/\" rel=\"ugc\">EM &#8211; Ongoing Events</a> installed and cancel the Main Event, all Sub Events will be cancelled as well. If you cancel a Sub Event, only that occurrence will be cancelled, leaving the rest of the Ongoing Series as is.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20part%20of%20the%20events%20manager%20team%3F'>\nAre you part of the Events Manager team?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>No, I am not!</strong><br />\nI am not associated with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/\" rel=\"ugc\">Events Manager</a> nor its developer, <a href=\"http://netweblogic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Marcus Sykes</a>, in <em><strong>any</strong></em> way.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
