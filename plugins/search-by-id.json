        "faq": "\n<h4>What does it do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whenever a search is executed, the plugin simply hooks into that query and checks if the query (the phrase you entered into the search field) is a numeric value. If it is, it modifies the query so that it also searches for post ID&#8217;s (default is to only search title and content).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve installed and activated the plugin, but cannot find it in the admin area</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is nothing new to be found, my friend. It hooks into the good old search input field you see in the top right corner when viewing the lists of posts (or pages, or whatever post type you may use). Just enter an ID into that field, and you will see.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s not working</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not really a very descriptive question, but I shall try to answer nonetheless ;). If you find that searching for an ID that definitely does exist does not work, it&#8217;s most likely because you have another plugin installed that interferes with the same filter that this plugin uses. I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t do anything about that. Almost every bug report I receive is caused by an interfering plugin, so please check before you post in the support forum.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
