The calendar adds a new CSS class to your post for every catalog.  The class is based on the slug for the category.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a category named &#8220;My Category&#8221; you might have a slug for it named &#8220;my-category&#8221;.  Then you can make all posts with that category show up as red in the calendar with CSS like this:</p>\n<pre>\n.post.my-category {\n    color: red;\n}\n</pre>\n<p>You can use any CSS properties to change posts in the calendar based on the post category.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20default%20post%20time%20or%20status%20when%20creating%20new%20posts%3F'>\nCan I change default post time or status when creating new posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The calendar allows you to create new posts.  The default time for this new posts is 10:00 AM and the default status for this new posts is draft.  You can change those values by specifying options in your blog.</p>\n<p>The <code>edcal_default_time</code> property controls the default time for new posts in the calendar.  This value is in 24 hour time and you can change it by specifying the time in a format like <code>11:00</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>edcal_default_status</code> property controls the default status for new posts in the calendar.  The allowed values are <code>draft</code>, <code>future</code>, and <code>pending</code> for the statuses of <code>Draft</code>, <code>Scheduled</code>, and <code>Pending Review</code> respectively.  This value will only be used if the current user doesn&#8217;t have access to change that status.  For example, if you&#8217;re an author then you can&#8217;t use a default status of <code>pending</code> since you aren&#8217;t allowed to publish posts.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
