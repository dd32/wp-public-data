        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20access%20to%20monitor%20and%20forecast%20tools%3F'>\nHow do I get access to Monitor and Forecast tools?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, please email support@kunato.io to gain access to the Monitor and Forecast tools.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20prices%20not%20showing%3F'>\nWhy are prices not showing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually, the prices start coming in 5 minutes if the website has proper SEO and Kunato servers are not being blocked by a firewall. Please read the Installation section for more details on how to resolve this issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20show%20prices%20in%20different%20currencies%3F'>\nCan I show prices in different currencies?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now the plugin gives option for USD and INR. However, more currencies can be easily added on demand. Please drop an email at support@kunato.io about the currency.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20for%20prices%20to%20appear%3F'>\nHow long does it take for prices to appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Prices usually start appearing within a few minutes of activation. If they don&#8217;t show up within 15 minutes, please check your SEO and firewall settings as outlined in our installation guide.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20kunato.ai%20compatible%20with%20all%20websites%3F'>\nIs Kunato.ai compatible with all websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin is designed to work seamlessly with most WordPress websites. For specific compatibility concerns, please contact our support team.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20calculate%20the%20pricing%20and%20what%20are%20metrics%20used%3F'>\nHow do you calculate the pricing and what are metrics used?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use advanced AI models that analyze numerous factors to provide accurate, real-time content valuations. These factors include market trends, user engagement, content quality, audience interest, behavioral insights, content uniqueness, and contextual relevance. This comprehensive approach ensures that our pricing reflects the true value and potential of your content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20pricing%20usually%20go%20down%20with%20time%20even%20though%20an%20article%20is%20doing%20well%20overall%3F'>\nWhy does pricing usually go down with time even though an article is doing well overall?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As content ages, newer articles often capture more attention, leading to a natural decline in demand for older content. Our dynamic pricing model continuously adjusts to reflect current market conditions and audience interest, ensuring the most accurate and relevant valuation at all times. This helps maintain a balanced and competitive content ecosystem.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20plugin%20help%20with%20engagement%2C%20traffic%2C%20or%20revenue%3F'>\nDoes Plugin help with engagement, traffic, or revenue?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The signal along with other tools provide insights that can help increase user engagement, improve traffic, and optimize revenue through dynamic content pricing and actionable recommendations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20a%20higher%20price%20prediction%20indicate%20more%20popularity%20and%20views%3F'>\nDoes a higher price prediction indicate more popularity and views?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not necessarily. A higher price prediction indicates higher potential value based on multiple factors, but it doesn&#8217;t directly correlate to popularity or views. It reflects the market demand and perceived value of the content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20slow%20down%20my%20website%3F'>\nWill the plugin slow down my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the plugin is designed to be lightweight and efficient.
