        "description": "<p>A WooCommerce plugin that adds a product settings tab for creating additional fees that show up at checkout if that product is in the cart.</p>\n<p>In the WooCommerce products edit screen, there will be a new product data tab called &#8216;Product Fees&#8217; where you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give the fee a custom name that is displayed to the customer at checkout describing the fee.</li>\n<li>Enter the cost of the fee as either a flat rate number or as a percentage.</li>\n<li>Choose whether or not the fee should be multiplied based on the quantity of the product in the cart.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will also be similar fields within each variation tab on the product. If the variation does not have a fee, it will fallback and look to use the product fee if one exists.</p>\n<p>For the plugin settings, you can go <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products &gt; Product Fees</strong>. Here you will find two settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fee Tax Class &#8211; Assign a tax class to be applied to fees, or leave it so fees are not taxed.</li>\n<li>Fee Name Conflicts &#8211; Choose whether fees with the same name should be combined or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<p>I have kept this plugin simple on purpose. It is very lightweight and should not conflict with any other plugins or themes. Here are the features included in the plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Percentage based fees that go off of the product&#8217;s price.</li>\n<li>Variation specific fees.</li>\n<li>A quantity multiplier that can be toggled on/off per product and per variation.</li>\n<li>Option to combine fees with the same name.</li>\n<li>Ability to assign a tax class to be used on fees.</li>\n<li>Coupon setting that will remove fees when added.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Contributions</h4>\n<p>If you’re interested in contributing to WooCommerce Product Fees &#8211; head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WPprodigy/woocommerce-product-fees\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Product Fees GitHub Repository</a> to find out how you can pitch in.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/benjamin-smith\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ben Smith</a> for contributing the plugin&#8217;s banner and icon image designs.</p>\n",
