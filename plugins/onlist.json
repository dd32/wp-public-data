(they can not change the plugin settings.)</p>\n<p>Q.: Where is the controls for this plugin?<br />\nA.: You will find the setup under menu page &#8220;OnList Settings.</p>\n<p>Q.: Can I change the listing style?<br />\nA.: If you know CSS then you can use any CSS editor to add a selctor in your Customizer or and other stylesheet. Using the Inspector on your browser it is easy to look up the selector name. Most all of OnList selectors start with onlist-.</p>\n<p>Q.: How do I get an API key to use the maps?<br />\nA.: To get an API Key, Visit: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key. Upi will be<br />\nrequired to have a Google account in order to create the key but the proccess is simpler than pie. No programming<br />\nexperience or coding required. Just copy the number and paste it into the plugin field.</p>\n<p>Q.: I just loaded a new theme and can not see the listings?<br />\nA.: Go to Settings &gt; Permalinks and hit &#8220;Save Changes.&#8221; This refreshes your posts to recognize the onlist post.
