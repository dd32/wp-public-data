Grant full permissions.</li>\n<li>If you wish, activate the extender plugin that removes formatting from Google Docs and removes comments, placing them in a separate meta box</li>\n<li>To run the plugin, you will need to either activate the included Cron Extender or put code in a separate file and point a cron job to it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tara Kerwin has made a helpful installation walkthrough video available at https://youtu.be/oFLjn2VOn-U</p>\n<h4>To run using WP CRON</h4>\n<p>Activate the cron extender.</p>\n<h4>To run using real cron</h4>\n<p>Create a file to run cron against, and put the following code in it:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\ninclude('./wp-load.php');\n$docs_to_wp = new Docs_To_WP();\n$results = $docs_to_wp-&gt;startTransfer();\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will need to have a folder to draw the docs from and an optional folder to put the docs in after they&#8217;ve been processed.</p>\n<p>First create the folder that you want to store unpublished docs in. This is your &#8220;Origin&#8221; folder. Next create the folder that you will move converted files to. This is the &#8220;Target&#8221; folder. If you&#8217;re using Cron, you&#8217;re going to want to write stories in a separate folder, and then move them to the Origin folder for publishing, when they&#8217;re ready.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Version bump. Removes anonymous functions, so it can be used as far back as PHP 5.2</p>\n<h4>1.0-beta</h4>\n<p>Update to remove deprecated Google API and use Drive API v2<br />\nUpdates to code to clean it up, remove extraneous loops.<br />\nAdded Options page. Changes to make it easier to use.</p>\n<h4>0.4-beta</h4>\n<p>Use HTTPS instead of HTTP, per new Google API spec.</p>\n<p>Fix a few bugs with carrying over bold and italic</p>\n<h4>0.3-beta</h4>\n<p>In extend-clean.php, extract the styles and apply them so bolding and italicizing goes through. Also, don&#8217;t strip heading styles. Props nacin and  Rob Flaherty.</p>\n<h4>0.2-beta</h4>\n<p>Added the cron extender</p>\n<h4>0.1-beta</h4>\n<p>Initial release</p>\n"
