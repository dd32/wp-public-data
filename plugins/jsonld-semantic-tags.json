Unlike others, ours gets to the very source code of your content.</p>\n<p>This enables Google and other search engines to understand what your content relates to, even giving you the ability to link out to authority resources from the tag itself.</p>\n<h3>How to use the Semantic Tag Plug-In</h3>\n<p>Unlike other tags that you simply enter into a sidebar widget, these tags are extremely editable.  You are “marking up” the tags, giving them a whole new dimension and purpose.</p>\n<p>Once you have installed the Plug-In, click through your WordPress.org dashboard into the “Posts” section, as you would if you were going in to edit existing posts.</p>\n<p>Once through, you will be prompted to “Add new Semantic Tag”. A Word Cloud of the most popular tags will appear above the data entry board. A full list will simultaneously appear to the right, should you need to edit any tags.</p>\n<p>Please bear in mind that an edit to the tag will be reflected across your site.</p>\n<p>If you’ve created the Semantic Tags or used them in posts before you publish your content, you can add them to your post in the “New Post” dashboard as with the previous tag widget.

If you’re linking to external sources, it is well worth entering a “nofollow“ here as your first rel. A space in between each is all you need to enter multiple rel properties</ol>\n<ol>4. Title &#8211; is the text that customers see when they hover over the tag; needless to say, it should be relevant to the content you’re linking to.</ol>\n<ol>5. Property &#8211; what is the type of tag you are entering, such as a Ctag that would be in the source code of your page</ol>\n<ol>6. Resource &#8211; is a background link that provides authority to your tag.  It will not be clickable on site</ol>\n<ol>7.

Target &#8211; if you want the tag link (2.) to open in new tab, check this box</ol>\n<ol>10. Popup &#8211; similarly, if you’d prefer a popup (keeping the reader on page), check this box</ol>\n</ul>\n<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>\n<p>Press update and the tag, with all its configuration data, will save in the “Saved/Editable Tag” list.</p>\n<p>You can add each tag to your post from the Semantic Tag Sidebar Widget and, when published, they will render on the screen.</p>\n<p>Please proceed to our FAQ where we have a list of queries we had ourselves when creating this Plug-In.</p>\n<p>Thanks for downloading our Semantic Tag Plug In; don’t forget to write a rave review!</p>\n",
