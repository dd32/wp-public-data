By default, our AI engine can answer customer questions using public internet data. For increased accuracy, simply load documentation (e.g., pre-sales, operations, support) that your internal teams already use to answer questions. Vizaport will leverage your documents to train the AI engine to provide accurate answers. Note this requires an upgrade.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20exceed%20the%2010%2C000%20chats%20per%20month%20with%20google%20gemini%3F'>\nWhat if I exceed the 10,000 chats per month with Google Gemini?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Vizaport offers free use for Google Gemini during 2024, for up to 10,000 chats per month, pending availability of Vizaport&#8217;s Gemini credits. If you exceed this limit, we suggest switching to OpenAI. Note you will need to acquire and pay for your own OpenAI API key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%20the%20widget%20on%20my%20web%20site%3F'>\nHow do I install the widget on my web site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple.

Then, you will be guided through the steps to load documents and web pages to train the AI on your products and services.  You can upload various types of structured data (spreadsheets, XML) or unstructured data (documents, PDFs). There are step-by-step instructions to train the AI, preview your widget and then install on your web site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
