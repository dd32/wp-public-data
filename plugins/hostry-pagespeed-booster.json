        "faq": "\n<dt id='minification-what%E2%80%99s%20that%20supposed%20to%20mean%3F'>\nMinification-what’s that supposed to mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically, ‘minification’ stands for the disposing of excessive or irrelevant data. However, the process does not disturb browser’s processing of the website. For instance, code comments, shorter identifiers for variables and function symbols, false code removal, and formatting, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20cdn%3F%20how%20does%20a%20cdn%20work%3F'>\nWhat Is a CDN? How Does a CDN work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CDN is short for <strong>Content Distribution Network</strong>, which is a wide-area network of Proxy servers and their data acquisition centers. The major target is achieved by spatial service distribution to the end users thus providing uninterrupted operations and improved performance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20hostry%20pagespeed%20booster%20when%20i%20already%20have%20http%2F2%3F'>\nDo I need a Hostry Pagespeed Booster when I already have HTTP/2?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HTTP/2 is certainly a breakthrough when we consider successful reduction of one-server multiple request impact by elegantly putting to use one and the same connection for any quantity of concurrent requests. In this case, the CSS/JS concatenation remains acute. To sum up, customize, try, reconfigure, try again, adjust and go by what is more applicable to you current situation. In some cases HTTP/2 is more than enough; in other circumstances you may need aggregation and minification as well as HTTP/2 or HTTP/2 at one stretch with minification.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20process%20html%20compressing%20with%20deflate%2Fgzip%2C%20why%20would%20i%20need%20hostry%20pagespeed%20booster%3F'>\nI process HTML compressing with deflate/gzip, why would I need Hostry Pagespeed Booster?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hostry Pagespeed Booster makes the source HTML even smaller, thus further speeding up its compression and providing better results. Moreover, bare deflate/gzip can make your HTML markup look mediocre and non-professional. But here Hostry Pagespeed Booster comes to your aid.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
