        "description": "<p>Do you feel like you need to be a wizard when creating a custom filter for your WooCommerce? Are you tired of trudging through an arcane tutorial to figure out how to offer simple filtering based on various parameters to your users? If you are lost in the world of WooCommerce filtering, Eazy Filter is here for your rescue.</p>\n<p>üëâ Check out our website for more details about EazyFilter : <a href=\"https://eazyplugins.com/eazyfilter/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View Demo</a></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter is a handy Elementor Powered product filter plugin for WooCommerce that comes with numbers of useful shortcodes which can be used across your site. It lets you filter products based on categories, attributes, product tags, price, color swatches, and more. Eazy Filter is always compliant with the latest WooCommerce &amp; Elementor, so your filters will always keep on working. We will also keep updating Eazy Filter to always be in sync with all future Elementor and WooCommerce versions. Eazy Filter will make product owner‚Äôs life easier with our state-of-the-art  setup system. Eazy Filter is so easy to use that you can be up and running with creating new filters in about 5 minutes. Say goodbye to the dull and tedious process of setting up filtering, and welcome to Eazy Filter.</p>\n<p>Eazy Filter really stands out from other filter plugins currently available in the market. Be it for the hand crafted setup wizard that makes setting up initial filters a breeze or the expertly researched options that puts just the right amount of control to your hand, there‚Äôs always a reason to check out Eazy Filter. Let‚Äôs dive into the feature set now.</p>\n<p><strong>Standalone Shortcode and Elementor Version:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter comes with a collection of intuitively designed widgets for Elementor page builder so that you can feel at home when integrating these filters on your shop page or any other page using a built-in product grid widget that adheres to your workflow. Besides, you can integrate these filters anywhere using shortcodes that come bundled with Eazy Filter, so you are not limited to using only Elementor.</p>\n<p><strong>Responsive:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter is fully responsive, so you can filter your WooCommerce items even when you are on the go. Laptop, Tablet, or even iPad, Eazy Filter adapts to your workflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Unlimited Filters &amp; Filter Groups:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter can create unlimited Filters. But that‚Äôs the boring part; with Eazy Filter, you can also create unlimited Filter Groups where you can apply multiple filters by clicking in a single grouped filter. So go ahead and unleash your creativity.</p>\n<p><strong>Compatible With All WordPress Themes &amp; PHP Versions:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter works with all WordPress themes, post types, and pages. It also is compatible with all major PHP versions starting from 5.6. ‚ÄúPlugin incompatible with your setup‚Äù is a non-issue when it comes to Eazy Filter.</p>\n<p><strong>AJAX Based Filtering:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter supports AJAX-based filtering that enables easy, quick, and convenient filtering capability based on your product category, tag, attributes (size, color, weight, material, etc.). No reload is needed!</p>\n<p><strong>AJAX Pagination on Filtering:</strong></p>\n<p>You‚Äôd think that something as trivial as AJAX Pagination after filtering works on all major filtering plugins. But you‚Äôd be wrong. Our secret algorithm (which isn‚Äôt a secret anymore) solved this  pagination issue. Now you can always browse through pages after filtering. Forward &amp; Back!!</p>\n<p><strong>Gorgeous UI &amp; UX:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter is designed with aesthetics in mind. Most WooCommerce filtering plugins in the market are complicated, cumbersome, and non-intuitive to use, except Eazy Filter. Eazy Filter makes complex and mundane tasks like creating, organizing &amp; maintaining a filter group easy &amp; fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Seamless Filtering From Inside Elementor:</strong></p>\n<p>With Eazy Filter, you never have to leave Elementor while creating a filter. Eazy Filter offers seamless filtering capability when you are inside Elementor.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazyfilter has shortcode support. Upon creating a new filter, you can see its shortcode on the UI. With this shortcode, you can then use it on any page. Now your filters are more portable!!</p>\n<p><strong>Filter Based on Custom Attributes:</strong></p>\n<p>Eazy Filter offers filtering based on any custom product attributes like color, size weight, material, brand, any custom tag, and custom category. If you can think of a way to filter, chances are, Eazy Filter is already capable of implementing such a filter.</p>\n<p>More features coming soon!</p>\n",
