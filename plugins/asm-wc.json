It costs you $6 to ship anywhere with your rate. If a customer orders up to 3 t-shirts, it still only costs you $6 to ship.<br />\nUsing this plugin, you can make a ruleset either via product categories or shipping classes to offer a new shipping rate if a customer orders 2 or 3 t-shirts rather than 1 or 4+</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br />\nYou have a scheduled pickup with your shipping service of choice TheRiteShipping Co. at 3:30pm every day.
