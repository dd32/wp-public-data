        "faq": "\n<h4>Why Static Feeds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all about web server performance. It is much more efficient for a web server to serve a static XML file than to dynamically re-create the feed in PHP/MySQL upon each request. Since a blog feed doesn&#8217;t change as often as it is downloaded, it makes sense to serve this information as a static file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What else do you recommend?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Combine this plugin with a web server configured with compression (<a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mod_deflate</a> in Apache) and a PHP Accelerator (such as APC), and you have yourself a real WordPress serving powerhouse!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work with other caching plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It may work, but I wouldn&#8217;t guarantee it. If you&#8217;re using this plugin with another caching plugin without problems, let me know and I&#8217;ll start a list of Static Feed compatible Caching plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need this plugin if I am already using a caching plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely no since the caching plugin may be doing something similar.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Static Feed handle category, tag or comment feeds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, sorry.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I previously switched from Movable Type to WordPress, can this plugin continue to maintain my original Movable Type feed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! This is what version 1.0 of this plugin was originally written for. Simply configure this plugin to write to the appropriate xml file on your server and you&#8217;re all set.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Web Server Compression?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Web server Compression is when the web server compresses the data before returning it to the client (web browser). Compression will shrink XML to more than half its normal size, resulting in less bandwidth and a faster downloading experience for the end user.</p>\n<p>You can test your site and feeds for compression by using the <a href=\"http://www.whatsmyip.org/http_compression/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">What&#8217;s My IP HTTP Compression</a> test.</p>\n<p>Note: This plugin does not add HTTP Compression to your web server. HTTP Compression is a feature your web hosting providor or administrator would configure.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
