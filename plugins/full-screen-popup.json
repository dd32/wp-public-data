It is normally used to show subscription forms, contact forms, promotions, etc</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2. The Full Screen Popup plugin is not working properly</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check the wordpress version you are using. Make sure it meets the minimum version recommended by us. Make sure all files of the <code>Full Screen Popup</code> plugin are uploaded to the folder <code>wp-content/plugins/</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>3. Can I use this plugin with other popup plugins ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use it with any other popup related plugins from XYZScripts. However it may interfere with popup plugins from other vendors.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>4.
