First go to the Theme Pages menu item in your dashboard (make sure to activate the plug-in first). Create a theme page giving it a name, and make sure it is published or scheduled. Once you have done that, the developers section will tell you where to create a new page template. If you are new to page templates, then check out the Page Templates article over at WordPress.org codex.</p>\n"
