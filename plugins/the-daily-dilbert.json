You can simply do this by dragging the &#8216;The Daily Dilbert&#8217;-entry on the right side of the panel and and dropping it between the other widgets where you want to have it positioned.</li>\n<li>If desired, enter a custom widget title by selecting the &#8220;Configure&#8221;-button and changing the title.</li>\n<li>Click on the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;-button on the page. </li>\n<li>Edit your styles.css of your active template to tweak the presentation.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Did you make the flash-thing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the flash object was made available by United Feature Syndicate. I just made the WordPress implementation. Silly UFS forgot all about WordPress.</p>\n<p>The flash object can be found on http://widget.dilbert.com/</p>\n<p>The flash object comes with its own <a href=\"http://dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/info/terms_of_use.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Use</a>.<br />\nThe license of UFS is included in the plug-in source.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I modify the style of the widget in the sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like any widget in your sidebar you can modify presentation by using the ID &#8220;dilbert&#8221;. Modify the style.css in your active template:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>li#dilbert { /* your css directives here, eg: &#8220;text-align: center;&#8221; */ }</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>How come in step 2 &#8216;grf-dilbert&#8217; is already in the activated plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because you were doing an upgrade and forgot to disable the plugin before you did so, you naughty boy/girl.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin is cool, can you make something similar for &#8230;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have requests feel free to mail them to me (contact me through my blog: http://www.greftek.net/blog).</p>\n<p>Please do take into account that a comic needs to have some sort of feed in order to make such a plugin. It can be done without a feed (with scraping), but such a technique is high maintenance and prone to breaking. Aside from that not every artist appreciates such methods, so I don&#8217;t make them.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
