        "faq": "\n<h4>Why not use the other etsy sidebar widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the time I wrote this plugin another etsy sidebar widget was available. However, it didn&#8217;t meet my needs because it only allowed you to embed Etsy Mini code. Functionality which could just as easily be obtained with the default &#8216;Text&#8217; widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not use Etsy Mini?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Etsy Mini uses an iframe or flash object. In either case there is no easy way to control the styling. Also, you must go to your etsy account to generate new code if you want to change the basic layout. This widget allows complete styling and an equivalent number of layout options in the widget configuration.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it cache the Etsy API call results?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By default, a json cache file is stored in the system temp directory. The cache is refreshed every 6 hours. You can change the cache location in the configuration window.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not use the wordpress object cache?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The wordpress object cache is not enabled by default. I choose not to use it because I wanted the plugin to be as easy as possible to install.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.8</h4>\n<p>Fix optional link to store home page.</p>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<p>Clear the cache on activation. This solves a couple of problems. Most importantly if Etsy changes the API format the cache will be cleared automatically on upgrade. It&#8217;s also handy to be able to clear the cache manually by deactivating and reactivating the plugin.</p>\n<p>You must use your shop name. An error will appear if an old version of the plugin was set to use you user id number. If this happens go to the widget configuration and change it.</p>\n<h4>1.0.6</h4>\n<p>Upgrade to use Esty API V2.</p>\n<p>Removed invalid image size options.</p>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<p>Add option to change cache location. The default is to use whatever is returned by the php function sys_get_temp_dir (usually /tmp on unix systems).</p>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed bug in column layout. Older version wouldn&#8217;t render more than 2 columns.</p>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<p>Add admin option to choose image thumbnail size for display.</p>\n<p>Set cache life to 6hrs to comply with etsy api requirements.</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>Fix a cache problem that would occur when showing the widget from multiple blogs installed as different users.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<p>Add readme, comments, and documentation.</p>\n"
