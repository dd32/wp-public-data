Install and activate the plugin</strong><br />\nIn your WordPress dashboard, go to Plugins =&gt; Add New. Search for &#8220;LTL Freight Quotes &#8211; XPO Edition&#8221;, and click Install Now.<br />\nAfter the installation process completes, click the Activate Plugin link to activate the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>2.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20my%20shopping%20cart%20contains%20products%20that%20ship%20ltl%20and%20products%20that%20would%20normally%20ship%20fedex%20or%20ups%3F'>\nWhat happens when my shopping cart contains products that ship LTL and products that would normally ship FedEx or UPS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the shopping cart contains one or more products tagged to ship LTL freight, all of the products in the shopping cart<br />\nare assumed to ship LTL freight. To ensure the most accurate quote possible, make sure that every product has a weight, dimensions and a freight classification recorded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20forget%20to%20identify%20a%20freight%20classification%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I forget to identify a freight classification for a product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the absence of a freight class, the plugin will determine the freight classification using the density calculation method. To do so the products weight and dimensions must be recorded. This is accurate in most cases, however identifying the proper freight class will be the most reliable method for ensuring accurate rate estimates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20was%20the%20invoice%20i%20received%20from%20xpo%20logistics%20more%20than%20what%20was%20quoted%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy was the invoice I received from XPO Logistics more than what was quoted by the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions, freight class) is different, or additional services (such as residential<br />\ndelivery, lift gate, delivery by appointment and others) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping<br />\nsettings on the products included in the shipment. Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packaging<br />\nmaterials, such as a pallet, is included by the carrier in the billable weight for the shipment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20out%20what%20freight%20classification%20to%20use%20for%20my%20products%3F'>\nHow do I find out what freight classification to use for my products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact your local XPO Logistics office for assistance. You might also consider getting a subscription to ClassIT offered<br />\nby the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA). Visit them online at classit.nmfta.org.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20a%20xpo%20logistics%20account%3F'>\nHow do I get a XPO Logistics account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check your phone book for local listings or call  800-755-2728.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20my%20xpo%20logistics%20username%20and%20password%3F'>\nWhere do I find my XPO Logistics username and password?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usernames and passwords to XPO Logistics online shipping system are issued by XPO Logistics. If you have a XPO Logistics account number, go to <a href=\"http://www.xpologistics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">xpologistics.com</a> and click the login link at the top right of the page and choose Customer and then Less-Than-Truckload. You will be redirected to a page where you can register as a new user. If you don’t have a XPO Logistics account, contact the XPO Logistics at 800-755-2728.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20a%20api%20key%20for%20my%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I get a API key for my plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must register your installation of the plugin, regardless of whether you are taking advantage of the trial period or<br />\npurchased a API key outright. At the conclusion of the registration process an email will be sent to you that will include the<br />\nAPI key. You can also login to eniture.com using the username and password you created during the registration process<br />\nand retrieve the API key from the My API keys tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20my%20plugin%20api%20key%20from%20the%20trail%20version%20to%20one%20of%20the%20paid%20subscriptions%3F'>\nHow do I change my plugin API key from the trail version to one of the paid subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to eniture.com and navigate to the My API keys tab. There you will be able to manage the licensing of all of your<br />\nEniture Technology plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20install%20the%20plugin%20on%20another%20website%3F'>\nHow do I install the plugin on another website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has a single site API key. To use it on another website you will need to purchase an additional API key.<br />\nIf you want to change the website with which the plugin is registered, login to eniture.com and navigate to the My API keys tab.<br />\nThere you will be able to change the domain name that is associated with the API key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20purchase%20a%20second%20api%20key%20for%20my%20staging%20or%20development%20site%3F'>\nDo I have to purchase a second API key for my staging or development site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Each API key allows you to identify one domain for your production environment and one domain for your staging or<br />\ndevelopment environment. The rate estimates returned in the staging environment will have the word “Sandbox” appended to them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20plugin%20working%20on%20my%20other%20website%3F'>\nWhy isn’t the plugin working on my other website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you can successfully test your credentials from the Connection page (WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; XPO Logistics &gt; Connections)<br />\nthen you have one or more of the following licensing issues:</p>\n<p>1) You are using the API key on more than one domain. The API keys are for single sites. You will need to purchase an additional API key.<br />\n2) Your trial period has expired.<br />\n3) Your current API key has expired and we have been unable to process your form of payment to renew it. Login to eniture.com and go to the My API keys tab to resolve any of these issues.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
