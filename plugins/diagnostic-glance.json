When that happens, it&#8217;s time to ask people in a forum or email a friend. They&#8217;ll probably be better able to help diagnose your challenges if they can quickly scan some of the basic settings of your site, your site&#8217;s host, and gain a general idea of the number of posts, pages and media that are on your site.</p>\n<p>This widget resides on the dashboard and uses the standard dashboard widget &#8220;Configure&#8221; link. It can be easily hidden or revealed via the screen options pulldown, just like any other dashboard item. It can be dragged to either column to suit your needs.</p>\n<p>These are the items this plugin lists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WordPress Version</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Themes</strong> alphabetically with version and the active theme indicated, plus the total number of installed themes.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugins</strong> alphabetically with version and activation indicated, plus the number of active and total plugins.</li>\n<li><strong>WordPress Config</strong> with various configured settings that could be helpful.</li>\n<li><strong>Hosting and System Config</strong> with Server version, PHP version, MySQL version, some PHP settings.</li>\n<li><strong>PHP Extensions</strong> alphabetically, comma-separated, 4 to a row.</li>\n<li><strong>Apache Modules</strong> alphabetically, comma-separated, 3 to a row, if the information is available.</li>\n<li><strong>General Site Statistics</strong> should be self evident.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Here are a number of forums that may be useful to you depending on your level of expertise. Listing below does not necessarily constitute endorsement of the listed sites.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://WordPress.org/support/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org Forum</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forums.WordPress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress.com Forum</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://WordPress.stackexchange.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Development &#8211; Stack Exchange</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Stack Overflow</a></li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20selected%20text%20isn%27t%20very%20fancy.%20why%20is%20that%3F'>\nThe selected text isn&#8217;t very fancy. Why is that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The text is rendered as text-only, just exactly as if you were typing it in a secure shell terminal. The text will copy and paste easily into any forum with little fuss, and will still be reasonably legible by forum readers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20%5Ba%5D%20mean%20next%20to%20each%20theme%20and%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat does the [a] mean next to each theme and plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the theme or plugin is prefixed with [a] instead of an empty box [ ], it means this particular theme or plugin is active. There will only ever be one active theme, but there may be multiple active plugins. The total number of active plugins will show at the bottom of the plugins list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20won%27t%20the%20text%20select%2Fcopy%20when%20i%20press%20%22copy%20to%20clipboard%22%3F'>\nWhy won&#8217;t the text select/copy when I press &#8220;Copy to Clipboard&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress depends on javascript to function normally. Make sure javascript is enabled in your browser. If you are unable to make it work in your preferred browser &#8212; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s Firefox &#8212; try Chrome or Opera until you can get help from your IT person or tech guru.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20an%20asterisk%20after%20%22default%22%20in%20the%20wordpress%20configuration%20section%20after%20some%20settings%3F'>\nWhy is there an asterisk after &#8220;default&#8221; in the WordPress configuration section after some settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your wp-config.php file may contain settings that are not otherwise <em>explicitly</em> defined. For example, if we don&#8217;t define it in wp-config.php, the WP_DEBUG setting is not only <em>not set</em>, it&#8217;s not even defined. If it&#8217;s not defined, WordPress still has a default action. In this case, when not defined in wp-config.php, WP_DEBUG is not active.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
