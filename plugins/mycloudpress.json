If you exceed the storage limits we do have plans!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you use/distribute anything with my data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No we don&#8217;t use your data in any way accept to show your data to you or restore the data on your behalf! You are fully in control of your data!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you update content or create content it&#8217;s automatically synced with the cloud. You have peace of mind that if you lose your database you have a copy of it on the cloud! The database is the heart of WordPress!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I already backup my WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s great you can&#8217;t have too many ways to get your blog or website back up &amp; running! When you put a ton of hours into blogging &amp; filling the internet with more data you don&#8217;t want that data to be gone in a matter of seconds! Think of it like your second home!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t I schedule my backup?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need a scheduler, it happens in realtime! When you create something it&#8217;s replicated on the cloud, it&#8217;s like having your blog or website in two diffrent places but one is shown to the internet &amp; one is private!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
