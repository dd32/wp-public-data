If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll get nasty error messages.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>sidebar-photoblog.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress backend</li>\n<li>Go to &#8216;Appearance&#8217; menu, then to &#8216;Widgets&#8217; (or &#8216;Design&#8217; then &#8216;Widgets&#8217; for older versions).</li>\n<li>Add Sidebar Photoblog widget to your sidebar.</li>\n<li>Save your changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Upgrading</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the Sidebar Photoblog plugin</li>\n<li>Delete sidebar-photoblog.php from your server</li>\n<li>Download and unzip the new file(s) into the plugins dir</li>\n<li>Enable the Sidebar Photoblog plugin</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After installation, the plug-in automatically creates a category called &#8216;Sidebar Photo blog&#8217; and a page for a photo archive called &#8216;Photos&#8217;. You can edit those categories and pages via WordPress but &#8216;[sphoto_archive]&#8217; should remain in the page content.<br />\nTo Insert Your Photos<br />\n    1.Click for new posts and choose the photo blog category (usually &#8216;Sidebar Photo blog&#8217;).<br />\n    2.Upload your photo via the WordPress Editor (don&#8217;t use &#8220;From URL&#8221; tab).<br />\n    3.Insert the full size image into post and publish it.<br />\nItâ€™s that easy!</p>\n<p>It is very flexible.  You can upload several photos and add your own content but olny first photo will be appear in widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My photos show in main column of the blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please remove Recent Posts Widget from your sidebar. This problem will be solved in next version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Customizing</h4>\n<p>\n<p>-You can customize padding, borders,etc using CSS (Don&#8217;t forget to disable style related options in widget settings first).<br />\n-If your theme can&#8217;t show large photos properly change &#8216;Max Width&#8217; in Settings-&gt;Media. You can also change thumbnail size and size of preview pop-up image(&#8216;Medium size&#8217;) over there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Would you like to show your photos in main page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Open sidebar-photoblog.php with a text-editor(like notepad) or plugin editor in WP admin. search for &#8220;exclude_from_home&#8221; and change it to false.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to display photo grid (in two or more columns)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply reduce photo size. If you don&#8217;t want it you should increase your sidebar width. The plugin arrange photos automatically.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
