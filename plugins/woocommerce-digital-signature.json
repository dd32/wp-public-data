Once customers sign…</strong></p>\n<p><em>…you and the customer will automatically receive a PDF of their signed contract.</em></p>\n<p><em>…no need to register on an outside website (all signatures happen without leaving your site)</em></p>\n<p><em>… you’ll have a 100% legally compliant signature on file to protect you AND the customer (according to UETA/ESIGN guidelines).</em></p>\n<h3>This Digital Signature add-on transforms your WooCommerce store into a court-recognized document signing application (but without the monthly fees&#8230; and with unlimited users).</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Perfect for those wanting to automate the collection of signatures on terms of service agreements, new client contracts, waiver forms and more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Automatically require your WooCommerce customers to sign a legally binding agreement before downloading your product.</p>\n<p>“I agree to terms” checkboxes have the legal standing of a limp handshake.</p>\n<p><strong>Do the smart thing.  Don’t get caught in a courtroom with a document that’s not legally binding.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transform one single page of your existing WordPress website into a secure document and electronic signature application.

Problem is a paper agreement doesn’t hold up if your business is an online business and your customers are online customers. You can try mailing or even scanning a contract to your digital customers which costs you time and money, in the meantime you have the risk of losing your customer because of the added delay.</p>\n<p>What you need is WP E-Signature.

Both the ESIGN and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, they say “A document or signature cannot be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” The ApproveMe WP E-Signaturen is UETA/ESIGN compliant.</p>\n<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong><br />\nIn the UK, similar legislation to the ESIGN Act in the USA was likewise settled in 2000, and is known as the UK Electronic Communication Act. Approve Me is the main WordPress Plugin to Sign Contracts that warrants its e-signature solution to be consistent with this act.</p>\n<p><strong>European Union</strong><br />\nThe appropriation of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of 13 December 1999 established a the utilization of electronic marks on electronic and digital contracts inside of the European Union (EU). Thirty European nations (EU-27, Croatia, Turkey and Liechtenstein) have officially adopted Directive 1999/93/EC. To that end Electronic and Digital marks are effectively being used in Europe, and ApproveMe’s compliant WP E-Signature plugin is legitimately acceptable and enforceable within the European Union.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20need%20to%20renew%20my%20approveme%20license%3F'>\nWill I Need to Renew my ApproveMe License?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you will.

Not only is our plugin the most powerful of its kind, it’s also the most affordable.

All of your signed documents and signatures are kept hidden and encrypted on your server using a secure encryption sequence and signer specific URL.  Additionally you have the option of forcing SSL security (when an SSL certificate is installed on your server) for all WP E-Signature related pages.</p>\n<h4>Signer Audit Trail &amp; Reporting</h4>\n<p>Documents move turbo speed from signer to signer. We include a detailed audit report with viewer details, ip addresses, analytics and signer history.</p>\n<h4>Document Signing Automation</h4>\n<p>If you do business online, customers probably have to sign an agreement or an online contract. Problem is a paper agreement doesn’t hold up if your business is an online business and your customers are online customers. You can try mailing or even scanning a contract to your digital customers which costs you time and money, in the meantime you have the risk of losing your customer because of the added delay.</p>\n<p>What you need is WP E-Signature.
