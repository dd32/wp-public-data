If you have multiple podcasts with Podiant, either separately or as part of a network, you can add them to your WordPress site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20syncing%20work%3F'>\nHow does syncing work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin creates a new type of post, called Episode, which you can show in your main loop (the list of posts on the homepage), or via a separate page.</p>\n<p>The plugin periodically checks with Podiant, to see if new episodes are available, or any changes have been made. Because we use your Podiant Pull Key, the plugin will sync scheduled episodes, which will only go live on WordPress when your content goes live on Podiant.</p>\n<p>When a new episode is uploaded, the plugin will add the artwork and the text of the episode&#8217;s show notes to a new Episode post within WordPress. When you view the episode in your published WordPress site, a player will appear, similar to the one you&#8217;ll find on your Podiant website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20player%3F'>\nCan I customize the player?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep. You&#8217;ll find settings for the player in the Podiant &gt; Settings menu within your WordPress dashboard. You can pick the style of player, and whether it appears above or below the show notes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20host%20my%20podcast%20with%20podiant%3F'>\nDo I need to host my podcast with Podiant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can do so by signing up for an account at https://app.podiant.co/. You can review our terms and conditions at https://podiant.co/terms/.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
