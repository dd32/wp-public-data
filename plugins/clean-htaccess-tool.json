        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20it%20safe%20to%20clean%20my%20.htaccess%20file%3F'>\nIs it safe to clean my .htaccess file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, when used correctly. The plugin creates a backup of your .htaccess file before making any changes. It also only removes entries from deactivated or uninstalled plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20to%20restore%20my%20original%20.htaccess%20file%3F'>\nWhat if I need to restore my original .htaccess file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin creates a backup file named &#8216;.htaccess.bak&#8217; in the same directory as your .htaccess file. You can use this to restore your original configuration if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20should%20i%20clean%20my%20.htaccess%20file%3F'>\nHow often should I clean my .htaccess file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good practice to clean your .htaccess file after you&#8217;ve deactivated or uninstalled plugins, especially those that modify server behavior. As a general rule, running the Clean .htaccess Tool once a month or after major plugin changes can help keep your site optimized.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20break%20my%20website%3F'>\nCan this plugin break my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While the Clean .htaccess Tool is designed to be safe, modifying the .htaccess file can potentially affect your website&#8217;s functionality if not done correctly. This is why the plugin creates a backup before making any changes. If you experience any issues after cleaning, you can easily restore the backup. We recommend testing your site thoroughly after making changes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20technical%20knowledge%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need technical knowledge to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Clean .htaccess Tool is designed to be user-friendly and doesn&#8217;t require deep technical knowledge of server configuration. The plugin provides a simple interface to review and approve changes before they&#8217;re made. However, having a basic understanding of what the .htaccess file does can be helpful.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
