See next question for more information on that.</p>\n<p>Enter your source code at Settings &gt; Campus Explorer (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=campusexplorer_settings) and hit &#8220;Save Settings&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Now you can start configuring widgets at Appearance &gt; Widgets. Find the Campus Explorer widget and drag it to a Widget Area. Update settings (or leave blank for default values) and hit save.</p>\n<p>Or you can create a shortcode at Settings &gt; Campus Explorer &gt; Shortcode Builder. The shortcode without any custom settings is, you guessed it, [campusexplorer]. Enter custom texts and area of study and concentration if you need a more customized experience.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Wait, I don&#8217;t have a source code. Where do I get one?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To learn more about Campus Explorer and how you can be a partner (and get paid), please visit <a href=\"http://search.campusexplorer.com/partnership.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://search.campusexplorer.com/partnership.html</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
