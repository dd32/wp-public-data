Can this be self hosted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You do need an account on Frill.co because this is a Standalone Portal SaaS (Software as a Service) product and can not be self hosted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20a%20user%20need%20an%20account%20on%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nDoes a user need an account on my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, because Frill requires that a user&#8217;s email, display name and ID are sent over to be able to create an token and login the user thru SSO (Single-sign-on)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20data%20is%20shared%20from%20wordpress%20to%20frill%20about%20my%20wordpress%20users%3F'>\nWhat data is shared from WordPress to Frill about my WordPress Users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ONLY data shared from WordPress to <a href=\"https://frill.co/\" title=\"Frill.co\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Frill</a> with this plugin is:<br />\n&#8211; User ID. This is the user&#8217;s ID within the WordPress database. Example: 3, if they are user #3.<br />\n&#8211; User Display Name. This is the name set on their user profile as display name.<br />\n&#8211; User Email. This is shared so they can get updates from their posted feedback or other feedback points they are following.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='jwt%20%28json%20web%20token%29'>\nJWT (JSON Web Token)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>JWT is JSON Web Token, and is an authentication protocol used in many web services. We have built this plugin so that it will work even on shared hosting providers that do not have /Firebase/php-jwt installed!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20to%20add%20%3Ffrill_sso_redirect%20to%20a%20custom%20link%3F'>\nWhy do I need to add ?frill_sso_redirect to a custom link?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That will trigger a function that creates the user&#8217;s SSO token and redirect the user to your Frill.co page if the user is logged in.</p>\n<p>If the user is not logged in then it will redirect the user to WordPress login page. And after login it will redirect the user to Frill.co</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='pro%20version%2C%20to%20be%20announced'>\nPro Version, to be announced\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To support continued development of this plugin into the future with new features, we will be working on a Pro version of this plugin. When the proversion becomes available, nothing will be taken away from this plugin. The SSO function is core to the product and will always be available for free!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
