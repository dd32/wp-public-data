All you need is a <a href=\"https://www.sisow.nl/aanmelden/?r=309206\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sisow account</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to create and send beautiful invoices as well?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out our invoicing plugin for Gravity Forms:<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qinvoice-connect-for-gravity-forms/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress repository</a><br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://github.com/q-invoice/qinvoice-connect-for-gravity-forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use Mistercash, DIRECTebanking and/or Credit card payments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Because of the design of Sisow&#8217;s API you will need to create a different feed for each payment method though.<br />\nSecondly, add a dropdown (or any other field) to your form and let the user pick their preferred payment method before submitting.<br />\nUsing conditional logic in the feed setting you can now present the correct payment method based on the user&#8217;s input.<br />\n&#8211; The availability of payment methods depends on your profile and your contract with Sisow.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you offer support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure we do. Contact us at support@q-invoice.com.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
