For example, you can disable free shipping for orders weighing over 30 kg or create a special shipping method for large products.</p>\n<p>The plugin works with your existing shipping methods and zones. You can restrict flat rate, free shipping, pickup or any other shipping method created with shipping zones.</p>\n<h4>Example</h4>\n<p>You have two flat rate shipping methods, Freight and Economy. Orders weighing under 30 kg are shipped with Economy shipping. Orders over 30 kg have to be shipped with Freight.</p>\n<p>With Conditional Shipping you can set maximum weight (30 kg) for Economy and minimum weight for Freight (30 kg).

        "installation": "<p>Conditional Shipping is installed just like any other WordPress plugin.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin zip file</li>\n<li>Go to Plugins in the WordPress admin panel</li>\n<li>Click Add new and Upload plugin</li>\n<li>Choose the downloaded zip file and upload it</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the plugin is activated, you can create rulesets at <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Shipping &gt; Conditions</strong>. Each ruleset comprises of conditions and actions which are run if conditions pass.</p>\n<p>There is a debug mode which is really helpful to see how rulesets are working. You can activate it at <strong>WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Shipping &gt; Conditions &gt; Debug mode</strong>. Once the mode is activated, you should be able to see <strong>Conditional Shipping Debug</strong> in the checkout which shows which conditions passed and actions were taken.</p>\n<p>If you have dynamic / live shipping rates such as USPS, you will need to use <strong>Match by name</strong> option for selecting dynamic shipping methods. Please see <a href=\"https://wptrio.com/guide/control-live-shipping-rates-e-g-usps-or-fedex/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>That should be all.
