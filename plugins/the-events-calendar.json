If you’re running Events Calendar PRO or  any other add-ons, make sure those are current / running the latest code as well.</p>\n<p>The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just The Events Calendar is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/\" rel=\"ugc\">Twenty Twenty</a> theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you’ll know that is the source of the conflict.</p>\n<p>Note that we aren’t going to say “tough luck” if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can’t guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20still%20stuck.%20where%20do%20i%20go%20to%20file%20a%20bug%20or%20ask%20a%20question%3F'>\nI&#8217;m still stuck.
