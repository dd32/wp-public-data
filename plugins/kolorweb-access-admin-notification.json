What I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>✅ If you have found that access is actually not attributable to you, the only thing you absolutely must do is click on the link received in the email to reset the password and force the logout of that account from all devices.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%E2%9D%93%20i%20have%20reset%20my%20password%20but%20i%20do%20not%20receive%20the%20email%2C%20what%20do%20i%20do%3F'>\n❓ I have reset my password but I do not receive the email, what do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>✅ Follow this guide to learn how to reset your password in several ways: https://wordpress.org/support/article/resetting-your-password/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%E2%9D%93%20i%20receive%20too%20many%20emails%2C%20how%20can%20i%20extend%20the%20sending%20times%20between%20one%20login%20notification%20and%20another%3F'>\n❓ I receive too many emails, how can I extend the sending times between one login notification and another?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>✅ Notifications are sent per account, so each user will have their own notification counter. For each login, the time between one notification and another is set at 15 minutes. This means that if the same account logs in 5 in less than 15 minutes, you will only receive one notification. And the next one only after 15 minutes have elapsed starting from the first one relating to the first access.</p>\n<p>I have made available a filter that allows you to change the time that must pass between one notification login and another.</p>\n<p>To change this time frame to 30 minutes, for example, you can use this snippet of code that you can paste at the end of the currently active theme&#8217;s functions.php file:</p>\n<p>add_filter( &#8216;kolorweb_notify_interval&#8217;, function( $interval ) { return 30; } );</p>\n<p>If you want receive notifications for every single admin access, set $interval value to -1</p>\n<p>add_filter( &#8216;kolorweb_notify_interval&#8217;, function( $interval ) { return -1; } );</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%E2%9D%93%20where%20can%20i%20report%20bugs%3F'>\n❓ Where can I report bugs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>✅ Report bugs and suggest ideas at:  https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/kolorweb-access-admin-notification/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
