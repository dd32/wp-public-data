Simple, easy to use, and lightweight. Some of the features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightweight, with no Javascript needed and minimal CSS at less than 0.3kb!</li>\n<li>Bulk image uploading, integrated with new WordPress Media Library</li>\n<li>A built in template loader, allowing you to create your own gallery templates for your theme</li>\n<li>Developer friendly, with huge scope for customization using built-in actions &amp; filters</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Follow &amp; contribute to this plugin on <a href=\"https://github.com/rocket-galleries/rocket-galleries\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>The modern, straight forward interface is built to fit right into the WordPress admin area. It&#8217;s built to feel like native WordPress functionality, not a plugin, which is great for impressing clients and instantly feeling familiar with the plugin&#8217;s admin area. Simple, just the way we like it.</p>\n<p>Rocket Galleries is also developer friendly. We&#8217;ve made it easy to integrate the plugin with your theme by including a template loader. This allows you to create your own gallery templates and use your own HTML, CSS and Javascript easily. We&#8217;ve also included dozens of filters and actions within the plugin&#8217;s code, allowing you to hook into the core and create your own Rocket Galleries extensions. The possibilities are limitless!</p>\n<p>Last but not least, Rocket Galleries is a very new plugin, so we look forward to your feedback. Over the next couple of months we&#8217;re hoping to rapidly develop it&#8217;s functionality, so feel free to use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/rocketgalleries/\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Forums</a> to make feature suggestions and feedback.</p>\n",
