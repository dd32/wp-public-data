You can switch between &#8216;Administrator&#8217; and &#8216;Editor&#8217;. The default value is &#8216;Editor&#8217;.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Bulk Edit: Actions</h4>\n<p>With Quick Featured Images you can apply time-saving tasks with many featured images: add, exchange and delete them in bulk.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Adding featured images:</strong> You can select an image to set it as the new featured image to hundreds of posts in one go.

Then take a look the <strong>Pro version</strong> <a href=\"https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&amp;utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Quick Featured Images Pro</a>.</p>\n<h4>Bulk Edit: Options</h4>\n<p>Based on your selected action you can toggle on and off some options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>overwrite existing featured images</strong> or <strong>keeping them unchanged</strong>. The latter setting is the default.</li>\n<li><strong>consider only posts without a featured image</strong>. This will hide posts with featured images in the results list and will speed up the process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to use the option to <strong>remove the first image in the content</strong> then take a look the <strong>Pro version</strong> <a href=\"https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&amp;utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Quick Featured Images Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Pro version</strong> offers you several approaches for <strong>setting the first image as featured</strong> additionally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>the first post image</strong> if available in the media library</li>\n<li><strong>the first post image from the current site domain</strong>, copy and add it to the media library if not available there</li>\n<li><strong>the first external post image</strong>, download it and add it to the media library</li>\n<li><strong>the first attached image of a post</strong></li>\n<li><strong>the first image of a WordPress standard gallery</strong></li>\n<li><strong>the first embedded content thumbnail</strong> (like YouTube etc.)</li>\n<li><strong>the first image of a NextGen Gallery</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>Pro version</strong> offers you two more options if you selected multiple images to set them as featured images in random order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Use each selected image only once</strong>.

In most cases this is not desired.</p>\n<p>The implemented filters allow you to narrow down the action to only the posts and pages you want to modify. The built-in filters are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Filter by <strong>post type</strong>: Search by post types. By <strong>default all</strong> posts, pages and custom post types will be affected</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>category</strong>: Search posts by category</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>tag</strong>: Search posts by tag</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>Pro version</strong> offers you additionally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Filter by <strong>format</strong>: Search by post format</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>author</strong>: Search by author</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>custom taxonomy</strong>: Search by terms of registered taxonomies of a plugin or a theme</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>featured image size</strong>: Search for small featured images below a given size</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>multimedia type</strong>: Search for audio and video files</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>search</strong>: Search by search term: Search in post title and post content or in post title only</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>status</strong>: Search by several statuses (published, draft, private etc.). By <strong>default all</strong> statuses will be affected</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>time</strong>: Search by time specifications</li>\n<li>Filter by <strong>parent page</strong>: Search child pages by parent page</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to use these filters then take a look the <strong>Pro version</strong> <a href=\"https://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&amp;utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Quick Featured Images Pro</a>.</p>\n<h4>Bulk Edit: Presets (Pro only)</h4>\n<p>In the Pro version you can store all settings of a process as a preset. That is time-saving for recurring tasks managing featured images of your site.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Default Featured Images: Rules</h4>\n<p><strong>You can set rules for default featured images of posts easily.</strong> Every time you insert a new post or save an existing post Quick Featured Images will look for a rule to add and to change the preset featured image to the saved post.</p>\n<p>You can define the rules based on</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>first content image</strong></li>\n<li><strong>custom taxonomy</strong> supporting featured images</li>\n<li><strong>post tag</strong></li>\n<li><strong>post category</strong></li>\n<li><strong>post author</strong></li>\n<li><strong>post types</strong>: &#8216;Post&#8217;, &#8216;Page&#8217; and <strong>custom post types</strong> supporting featured images</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>Pro version</strong> offers you additionally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>multiple random images</strong> to assign one of them to a new post</li>\n<li><strong>external featured images</strong>, e.g. from a CDN, to assign them automatically</li>\n<li><strong>user defined order</strong> of applying the types of rules</li>\n<li><strong>first content image</strong> if available on an external server</li>\n<li><strong>post format</strong> match</li>\n<li><strong>search string in post title</strong> match</li>\n<li><strong>random featured images at each page load</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rules are easy to set: choose an image, a taxonomy, a value and save the settings. That&#8217;s it. <strong>You do not need to code.</strong></p>\n<p>You can add, change and delete every rule whenever you want. So you get an <strong>precise set of rules</strong> for automatic default featured images in your website.</p>\n<p>After an image is removed from the library all preset rules assigned with that image will be removed automatically.</p>\n<p>The rules take effect when a post is saved in the backend &ndash; e.g. on the post edit page &ndash; or in the frontend &ndash; e.g. via a &#8220;Create Post&#8221; form by Gravity Forms.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Default Featured Images: Options</h4>\n<p>You can switch between</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>overwriting existing featured images</strong> or </li>\n<li><strong>keeping them unchanged</strong>. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The latter setting is the default. The option is used every time a post is saved.</p>\n<h4>Easy managing in a sortable image column in posts lists</h4>\n<p>Quick Featured Images adds a new column &#8216;Featured Image&#8217; in posts lists. The additional column is sortable by the image ID. It shows the currently assigned <strong>featured image of each post</strong> and <strong>action links to set, replace, edit and remove the featured image at each post</strong>.</p>\n<p>With that column you can get a <strong>quick overview about all used images</strong> and a <strong>change featured images at every single post quickly</strong>. You can also see posts with no featured image at a glance.</p>\n<p>Quick Featured Images also adds a new column in the media library. It lists the titles of all posts for which the corresponding image is set as featured images. The post titles are links to the respective post edit page.</p>\n<p>Under <strong>&#8216;Featured Images&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Settings&#8217;</strong> you can switch on and off the additional columns for every single post type, even custom post types if they support thumbnails.</p>\n<h4>Languages</h4>\n<p>Quick Featured Images is available in multiple languages maintained by the amazing WordPress community (e.g. Arabic, Dutch, Dutch (Belgium), English (US), French (France), German, Greek, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain) and more).<br />\nYour language is missing?

That is time-saving for recurring tasks managing featured images of your site.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Default Featured Images: Rules</h4>\n<p><strong>You can set rules for default featured images of posts easily.</strong> Every time you insert a new post or save an existing post Quick Featured Images will look for a rule to add and to change the preset featured image to the saved post.</p>\n<p>You can define the rules based on</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>first content image</strong></li>\n<li><strong>custom taxonomy</strong> supporting featured images</li>\n<li><strong>post tag</strong></li>\n<li><strong>post category</strong></li>\n<li><strong>post author</strong></li>\n<li><strong>post types</strong>: &#8216;Post&#8217;, &#8216;Page&#8217; and <strong>custom post types</strong> supporting featured images</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>Pro version</strong> offers you additionally:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>multiple random images</strong> to assign one of them to a new post</li>\n<li><strong>external featured images</strong>, e.g. from a CDN, to assign them automatically</li>\n<li><strong>user defined order</strong> of applying the types of rules</li>\n<li><strong>first content image</strong> if available on an external server</li>\n<li><strong>post format</strong> match</li>\n<li><strong>search string in post title</strong> match</li>\n<li><strong>random featured images at each page load</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rules are easy to set: choose an image, a taxonomy, a value and save the settings. That&#8217;s it. <strong>You do not need to code.</strong></p>\n<p>You can add, change and delete every rule whenever you want. So you get an <strong>precise set of rules</strong> for automatic default featured images in your website.</p>\n<p>After an image is removed from the library all preset rules assigned with that image will be removed automatically.</p>\n<p>The rules take effect when a post is saved in the backend &ndash; e.g. on the post edit page &ndash; or in the frontend &ndash; e.g. via a &#8220;Create Post&#8221; form by Gravity Forms.</p>\n<h4>Automatic Default Featured Images: Options</h4>\n<p>You can switch between</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>overwriting existing featured images</strong> or </li>\n<li><strong>keeping them unchanged</strong>. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The latter setting is the default. The option is used every time a post is saved.</p>\n<h4>Easy managing in a sortable image column in posts lists</h4>\n<p>Quick Featured Images adds a new column &#8216;Featured Image&#8217; in posts lists. The additional column is sortable by the image ID. It shows the currently assigned <strong>featured image of each post</strong> and <strong>action links to set, replace, edit and remove the featured image at each post</strong>.</p>\n<p>With that column you can get a <strong>quick overview about all used images</strong> and a <strong>change featured images at every single post quickly</strong>. You can also see posts with no featured image at a glance.</p>\n<p>Quick Featured Images also adds a new column in the media library. It lists the titles of all posts for which the corresponding image is set as featured images. The post titles are links to the respective post edit page.</p>\n<p>Under <strong>&#8216;Featured Images&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Settings&#8217;</strong> you can switch on and off the additional columns for every single post type, even custom post types if they support thumbnails.</p>\n<h4>Languages</h4>\n<p>Quick Featured Images is available in multiple languages maintained by the amazing WordPress community (e.g. Arabic, Dutch, Dutch (Belgium), English (US), French (France), German, Greek, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain) and more).<br />\nYour language is missing?
