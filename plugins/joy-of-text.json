This compares to only 22% of emails sent, so give your marketing a boost, by sending SMS messages from the JOT plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>The JOT Lite Admin screens explained.</strong></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab</p>\n<p>Within this tab your <a href=\"http://www.twilio.com\" title=\"Twilio\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twilio</a> authentication details are entered.

First select the recipients of your message, then enter your message. The message can contain the special tags shown below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>%name% &#8211; when the message is sent, this tag is replaced by the message recipients name.</li>\n<li>%number% &#8211; the tag is replaced by the recipients phone number.</li>\n<li>%lastpost% &#8211; the tag is replaced by the URL of your last blog post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From this tab, you can also specify a message suffix, that will be appended to all messages.</p>\n<p>You can also specify whether your message is sent as an SMS message or as a text-to-voice message. For text-to-voice messages, the text you enter will be converted (by Twilio) to speech, which is played to your chosen recipients when they answer their phones.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Group Manager&#8221; tab</p>\n<p>The free version of the plugin provides one member group.</p>\n<p>From this tab you can change the name and description of the group. You can add new members to the group, delete existing members from the group or update their name and number details.</p>\n<p>From the &#8220;Group Invite&#8221; you can construct a form which you can place on your website, to invite your website visitors to subscribe to SMS or text-to-voice message updates. You can also choose whether to send a new subscriber an SMS message containing a welcome message.
