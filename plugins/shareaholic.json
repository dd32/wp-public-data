This plugin adapts the Shariff concept.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;original&#8221; share buttons from Facebook, Pinterest and others automatically transmit data of your visitors to the social network sites as soon as they visit your website. They do not need to click on a share button for this to happen and therefore have no choice. Shareaholic enables visitors to see how popular your page is and display share buttons without this needless leakage to the social networks (unless they decide to share, of course). This is done via server-side code that is part of this plugin to fetch share counts. Once fetched, share counts are cached to ensure maximum performance.</p>\n<p>To take advantage of this privacy feature, enable &#8220;Share Count Proxy&#8221; under Advanced Settings.</p>\n<h4>Share Buttons for Images</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically add Pinterest&#8217;s “Pin It” button and other social share buttons directly onto the images on your site to increase outbound traffic to your social sites, and inbound traffic to your website. </li>\n<li>Includes integrated share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Share Buttons for Images</a> demo</p>\n<h4>Floating Share Buttons</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase social sharing by 2x or more by adding our Share Button plugin that hovers on the side of the page, rather than in the page content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Floating Share Buttons</a> demo</p>\n<h4>Related Posts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increases pageviews, engagement, and time on site by highlighting related content &amp; related posts that may not otherwise be discovered on your site.

Simply insert the following Shortcode where you want the corresponding app to appear:</p>\n<pre><code>[shareaholic app=\"share_buttons\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;\"]\n[shareaholic app=\"recommendations\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;\"]\n[shareaholic app=\"ad_spaces\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;\"]\n[shareaholic app=\"follow_buttons\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;\"]\n[shareaholic app=\"total_share_count\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Grab the corresponding App ID from your Shareaholic Dashboard for the App you want to manually insert into your theme. If you prefer, you can also use the <code>App Name</code> instead of the <code>App ID</code>. This can be very useful for multi-site installations and theme developers who would like to bundle Shareaholic. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>[shareaholic app=\"share_buttons\" id_name=\"post_below_content\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If both <code>id</code> and <code>id_name</code> are defined, <code>id</code> will take priority.</p>\n<p>In your PHP / theme template code, you would add:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app=\"share_buttons\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;\"]'); ?&gt;\n&lt;?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app=\"recommendations\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here&gt;\"]'); ?&gt;\n&lt;?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app=\"ad_spaces\" id=\"&lt;Insert Shareaholic App ID here\"]'); ?&gt;\n&lt;?php echo do_shortcode ('[shareaholic app=\"follow_buttons\" id=\"Insert Shareaholic App ID here\"]'); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: optionally, you can specify <code>title</code>, <code>link</code> or <code>summary</code> as Shareaholic shortcode parameters. If you don&#8217;t specify these optional parameters, the shortcode will automatically determine these values.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>[shareaholic app=\"share_buttons\" id=\"&lt;insert shareaholic app ID here&gt;\" title=\"About Me\" link=\"https://mysite.com/about\" summary=\"This is me\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If use double quotes (&#8220;&#8216;s) in your title or summary, make sure to encode them properly as <code>&amp;quot;</code>. Shareaholic Shortcode&#8217;s are full featured and support all available configuration options available. Enjoy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">General information about shortcodes and WordPress</a></p>\n<h4>Share Count SDK</h4>\n<p>For example &#8211; To display Facebook and Pinterest Share Counts:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n(function(s,r){;s[r]=s[r]||function(){(s[r].q=s[r].q||[]).push(arguments)}})(window,'Shareaholic');\n\nShareaholic(\n    'getShareCounts',\n    { services: ['facebook', 'pinterest'] },\n    (counts) =&gt; {\n      document.querySelector('#shr-share-counts').innerText = counts.total;\n    },\n);\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=\"shr-share-counts\"&gt;-&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Facebook share counts are part of our premium Share Count service and <a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/plan\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">requires a paid plan</a>.

This plugin adapts the Shariff concept.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;original&#8221; share buttons from Facebook, Pinterest and others automatically transmit data of your visitors to the social network sites as soon as they visit your website. They do not need to click on a share button for this to happen and therefore have no choice. Shareaholic enables visitors to see how popular your page is and display share buttons without this needless leakage to the social networks (unless they decide to share, of course). This is done via server-side code that is part of this plugin to fetch share counts. Once fetched, share counts are cached to ensure maximum performance.</p>\n<p>To take advantage of this privacy feature, enable &#8220;Share Count Proxy&#8221; under Advanced Settings.</p>\n<h4>Share Buttons for Images</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically add Pinterest&#8217;s “Pin It” button and other social share buttons directly onto the images on your site to increase outbound traffic to your social sites, and inbound traffic to your website. </li>\n<li>Includes integrated share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Share Buttons for Images</a> demo</p>\n<h4>Floating Share Buttons</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase social sharing by 2x or more by adding our Share Button plugin that hovers on the side of the page, rather than in the page content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shareaholic.com/website-tools/social-share-buttons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Floating Share Buttons</a> demo</p>\n<h4>Related Posts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increases pageviews, engagement, and time on site by highlighting related content &amp; related posts that may not otherwise be discovered on your site.
