This feature empowers you to tailor promotions by limiting coupon applicability to selected payment methods, ensuring greater control over discount distribution and promotional strategies.</p>\n<h3>User Role Restrictions for Coupons</h3>\n<p>Introducing an advanced feature in our WooCommerce plugin, designed to provide precise control over coupon usage based on user roles. Now, you can effectively manage promotions by applying coupons exclusively to selected user roles or excluding them from specific user roles.</p>\n<h3>Store Credit Coupon</h3>\n<p>Store Credit coupons offer a versatile and customer-friendly way to manage discounts and returns within your WooCommerce store. This coupon type allows you to issue credit that customers can use for future purchases, providing a seamless shopping experience and encouraging repeat business.</p>\n<p>Customers can use part or all of their store credit in a single purchase. If the cart total is less than the store credit amount, the remaining balance can be used for future orders.</p>\n<p>Customers can view their remaining store credit balance directly in the cart, enhancing transparency and encouraging further engagement.</p>\n<h4>Issue Refunds as Store Credit</h4>\n<p>With this feature, you can now issue full or partial refunds as store credit directly from the order edit page. This provides a convenient and flexible way to manage refunds and retain customer loyalty. By issuing refunds as store credit, you can effectively manage returns and keep customers engaged with your store.</p>\n",
