Make sure to include wp-content also</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Plugin X doesn&#8217;t work with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not all plugin include javascript the way specified in the codex. Sometimes, there is a good reason for, sometimes not. It is best to email us with a link to your website and tell us with which plugin it conflicts. We can then diagnose and specify a solution.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Not all CSS Files are cached?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Dynamic css files are excluded, since these require a request from the server. This generates too much overhead. Some plugins also output CSS instead of enqueing it. This plugin doesn&#8217;t detect that. Same goes with javascripts.</p>\n<p>**Q. Why is javascript not combined?* *</p>\n<p>Because it blocks! It is much better to load javascript after the page has been fully rendered.</p>\n<p><em>If you have any questions or feature suggestions, please DO ask.</em></p>\n</p>\n\n",
