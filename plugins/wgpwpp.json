The second data centre, titled WEDOS DC 2 “Podskalí”, is a unique project designed to cool servers using oil and water.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20activation%20process%20of%20the%20service%20work%3F'>\nHow does the activation process of the service work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin on its own, without activating the WEDOS Global service, allows you only to set the Local WordPress Cache feature which stores frequently visited web pages on the web server, thus saving the overall load on the server, and speeding the website up. If you want to take full advantage of our WEDOS Global infrastructure, and activate the Global WordPress Cache feature, click on the Activate button on the introductory page of our plugin. This action takes you to the website login.wedos.com. Register, unless you have already done so, or log in.
