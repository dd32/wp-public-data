Simply click on the <code>Stock</code> admin column to arrange by ascending or descending.</p>\n<p>If sorting in ascending order, out of stock items will be shown first, followed by in stock but inventory not managed (no stock amount number), and finally showing in stock items which have a stock amount number, starting with 1 and increasing.</p>\n<p>If sorting in descending order, will provide the opposite, starting with items with the largest amount of stock, moving down to out of stock.</p>\n",

This will not affect your front end in any way.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
