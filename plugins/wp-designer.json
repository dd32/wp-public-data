        "installation": "<p>Log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New. In the search field type <strong>WP Designer</strong> and click <em>Search Plugins</em>. Once you’ve found the plugin you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<p>Or you can follow the steps given below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>wp-designer</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>DO NOT change the name of the <code>wp-designer</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Once activated, visit the <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>WP Designer</strong> for usage instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20start%20my%20customizations%3F'>\nHow do I start my customizations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On activation, WP Designer automatically creates a wp-designer folder in the uploads directory which includes all the necessary files and folders required for designing the site. You can start by editing the functions.php for adding any custom functionality. If you need CSS customizations you can use the style.scss file SCSS/CSS customizations. The inbuilt compiler will automatically handle the SCSS to CSS generation for the front-end.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20make%20use%20of%20sass'>\nHow do I make use of SASS\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You just need to place all your design customizations in the style.scss file located in the wp-designer folder in the uploads directory and it will be automatically compiled to autogenerated.css and your customizations would reflect on the site front-end.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='just%20a%20second%2C%20now%20when%20i%20use%20sass%2C%20will%20my%20old%20customizations%20stay%20and%20will%20they%20work%3F'>\nJust a second, now when I use SASS, will my old customizations stay and will they work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Rest assured, your existing customizations stay in the same style.css file and you can continue to use it to customize your design. With the support of SASS, WP Designer will create an additional style.scss file so that you can go ahead and SASSify your customization. The compile routine is automatically managed by the plugin so that your customizations appear on the front-end.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20disable%20my%20customizations%3F'>\nHow do I disable my customizations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are three ways to do this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Setting &gt; WP Designer and check the option to disable functions.php and style.css.</li>\n<li>Comment out your code.</li>\n<li>Disable the WP Designer plugin itself.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='some%20of%20the%20customizations%20in%20plugin%27s%20style.scss%20%2F%20style.css%20are%20not%20working.'>\nSome of the customizations in plugin&#8217;s style.scss / style.css are not working.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have made any specific customizations using WordPress in-built Customizer or your child theme, they may not work due to CSS priority or specificity. For instance, if you have set the <code>background-color</code> for the site using the WordPress customizer, the plugin&#8217;s style.css may not be able to override the same CSS rule.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
