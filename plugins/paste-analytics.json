Done!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I do advanced tracking stuff with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably. You have the freedom to write whatever you need in the script.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can block IP numbers from being tracked?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and no. Not by this plugin, but you can do it with Google Analytics own settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the tracking work when I&#8217;m logged in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It&#8217;s disabled when logged in. Just a HTML comment remains in the code.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I disable tracking on certain pages/post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe. You can not do it with this plugin but it might be possible in Google Analytics, or by disable an action on that page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not just use an advanced Google Analytics plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced plugins often have tons of options. Still they might not have everything. With this plugin you can write the script as you like.\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin is very simple. Set it and forget it. Paste the script and save. Done!</li>\n<li>This plugin only use one option field which makes it very fast.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not use a before / after-plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They are ment for all kinds of scripts / CSS / HTML. It also means more settings that you don&#8217;t need.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The tracking code does not appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are not logged in and still no tracking code are visible in the source you might be missing the <code>wp_head</code> action in header.php (or another file)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have the tracking code in the footer or direcly after the -tag?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Not at present. If <code>wp_head</code> is not in the theme it will try to use <code>wp_footer</code> instead.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
