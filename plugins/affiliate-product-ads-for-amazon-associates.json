With this feature enabled, Amazon&#8217;s search algorithm is used to detect which products are best related to this post and displays them for your visitors to discover.</p>\n<p>When the visitor clicks on one of these display ads and makes a purchase in Amazon, you will earn affiliate commission for sending that visitor to Amazon.  (subject to <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/operating/policies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amazon terms and conditions</a>)</p>\n<p>The product ads are generated on the server-side and are part of the page &#8211; they are not loaded after the page loads in JavaScript.  This method prevents most ad-blockers from removing the product ads.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this plugin can display a disclaimer on posts that contain Amazon links as well as a site-wide disclaimer in the footer.  A disclaimer message is required by the United States FTC and Amazon Affiliates when displaying recommended product links for which you will be financially compensated.</p>\n<h4>Included Features</h4>\n<p>Each feature can be configured and customized to the needs of <em>your</em> site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-add Amazon product display ads at the bottom of any post containing an <code>amzn.to</code> URL in it</li>\n<li>Auto-add a disclaimer at the bottom of any post containing an <code>amzn.to</code> URL in it</li>\n<li>Auto-add a disclaimer in the footer of all pages on the website</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This plugin does require that you are a <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/signup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">registered Amazon Affiliate</a>.  It utilizes the Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0 to obtain product ad information.

Wait until Amazon approves you into their program</li>\n<li>Install this plugin via the standard WordPress plugin installation methods</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin</li>\n<li>In your WordPress admin, click on <strong>Amazon Product Advertising</strong> in the left hand menu</li>\n<li>Enter your Amazon credentials</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin settings as desired</li>\n<li>Save the configuration page</li>\n<li>Collect money.  No extra setup is needed as the plugin is automatic from here &#8211; adding ads to any pages that have Amazon links on them.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20amazon%20charge%20a%20fee%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDoes Amazon charge a fee to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  There is no fee.  This uses the Amazon Product Advertising API they provide to approved users.  This may result in you earning money from Amazon.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20published%20by%20amazon'>\nIs this plugin published by Amazon\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  This is an independent developed plugin that utilizes the Amazon Product Advertising API.  Amazon has made the Amazon Product Advertising API available to developers to use for creating product ads.  This plugin implements the necessary API calls for WordPress sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20amazon%20sitestripe%3F'>\nIs this Amazon SiteStripe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Essentially yes.  This plugin is a way to automatically generate SiteStripe URLs and place them on a WordPress site.  Commission is earned from Amazon the same way that SiteStripe is earned.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20limits%20or%20restrictions%3F'>\nAre there any limits or restrictions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Amazon does have a limit to 8640 requests per day.  <a href=\"https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/troubleshooting/api-rates.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source</a>  This means that any page views that trigger this plugin to display product ads over 8640 per day will not have ads displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20posts%20will%20automatically%20display%20amazon%20product%20ads%3F'>\nWhich posts will automatically display Amazon Product Ads?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any post that already contains a link to Amazon in it will get automatic ads.  You have already indicated that the post has a promoted product from Amazon, thus this plugin will work to supplement that link with additional product ads generated based on what the Amazon search algorithm determines is popular at this time.</p>\n<p>This plugin will first look for any <strong>tags</strong> on the post and use those as the keywords as the basis for the Amazon search criteria.  If no tags are set for the post then the post title is used.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
