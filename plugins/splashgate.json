        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I style the splash page content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Templates are not provided, by design.  You can manually create a template to style your splash page however you like &#8211; by default the SplashGate will redirect homepage visitors to that page, whatever template it uses. If using the fancybox SplashGate option, it is recommended to create a custom template for that page content that will look nice in the small fancybox overlay.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I test the splash page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a permanent path to the splashpage, &#8220;[wp-site-root]/splashgate/&#8221;.  Even if you&#8217;ve already viewed the splashpage, and can no longer see it because your cookie hasn&#8217;t expired, manually visiting the splashgate path will cause the active splash page to appear.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this mess up my SEO? Will it still work on a cached site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SplashGate uses javascript for redirection, not server side logic.  So, search engines will not be redirected, and thus will not mistakenly index your splash page content as the home page.  This also allows SplashGate to work even for sites that do a lot of caching.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
