        "installation": "<h4>Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>The automatic installation process is the most convenient method for adding WooCommerce to your WordPress site, as it eliminates the need for manual file handling. With this option, WordPress manages the entire file transfer process, allowing you to complete the installation without leaving your web browser.</p>\n<p>To begin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the “Plugins” menu, and click on “Add New.” In the search box that appears, type “Monek Checkout” and press “Search Plugins.” Once you locate Monek Checkout in the search results, you’ll be able to view key details about the plugin, including the current version, user ratings, and a brief description of its features. When you\\&#8217;re ready to proceed, simply click the “Install Now” button, and WordPress will automatically handle the installation for you.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>If you prefer to install Monek Checkout manually, this method requires downloading the plugin directly from the WordPress plugin repository and uploading it to your web server via an FTP client. To start, download the Monek Checkout plugin file to your computer. Next, use an FTP application of your choice to upload the plugin files to the appropriate directory on your web server.</p>\n<p>For detailed instructions on how to carry out a manual installation, refer to the WordPress Codex, which provides comprehensive guidance on the process. https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation</p>\n<p>Configure Monek Settings:<br />\n&#8211; Navigate to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Payments.<br />\n&#8211; Find Monek Checkout in the list of available payment methods and click \\&#8217;Manage\\&#8217;.<br />\n&#8211; Enter your Monek ID (available from your Monek account) into the settings.<br />\n&#8211; Save changes to enable Monek Checkout on your WooCommerce store.</p>\n<p>Start Accepting Payments:<br />\n&#8211; Once configured, Monek Checkout will seamlessly integrate into your checkout process.<br />\n&#8211; Customers can now securely pay using credit and debit cards via Monek.</p>\n<p>Note: If you do not have a Monek ID, please visit Monek\\&#8217;s website to sign up and obtain your ID. For any assistance with setup or integration, contact Monek directly through their website.</p>\n<p>Experience the future of payment processing with Monek where simplicity meets sophistication.</p>\n<p>Other Configuration Settings:</p>\n<p>Enable GooglePay:<br />\nIndicates if the Google Pay™ button will appear on the checkout page. <code>YES</code> or <code>NO</code> (default)</p>\n<p>All merchants must adhere to the Google Pay APIs <a href=\"https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/aup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and accept the terms defined in the Google Pay API <a href=\"https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a>.</p>\n<p>Google Pay is a trademark of Google LLC.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Why is my order in \\&#8217;Pending Payment\\&#8217; and not cancelling when the user fails to complete the payment?<br />\nPending Payment means the order has been received, but no payment has been made. Pending payment orders are generally awaiting customer action.</p>\n<p>If the customer fails to complete the payment, the order will remain in \\&#8217;Pending Payment\\&#8217; status until it is manually cancelled or the payment is completed unless the timeout period is reached.</p>\n<p>The timeout period is set in the WooCommerce settings. To change the timeout period, navigate to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Products &gt; Inventory &gt; Hold Stock. Adjust the timeout period as needed.</p>\n<p>This is a WooCommerce default behavior and not specific to the Monek Gateway plugin.</p>\n",
