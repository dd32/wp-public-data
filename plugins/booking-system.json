This AJAX simple calendar makes it easier for your clients to make appointments because there is no need to refresh the page to make any updates.</p>\n<p>This user friendly WordPress booking calendar is perfect for any of your clients &#8211; it&#8217;s responsive, so it can be viewed on any device and it adapts to your customer&#8217;s time zones.</p>\n<p>The Pinpoint booking calendar can be customized to a great extent: the client can select how many months to view in the calendar and there is a sidebar, where your customers can search for availability, select the number of rooms or items that they need, use coupons or select extras.</p>\n<p>Your client is able to see a summary of their reservation and, if necessary, you can add a custom form that they can fill in &#8211; directly in the booking calendar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/demos/wordpress-booking/calendar/?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fbooking-system&amp;utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View demo</a> | <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/wordpress-booking/calendar?utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Book Days</h4>\n<p>In your booking calendar, days are displayed with one out of 5 types of availability: none, available, booked, special or unavailable. You can set a special price for groups of days, or select the minimum or the maximum number of days that can be booked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/demos/wordpress-booking/days-en/?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fbooking-system&amp;utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View demo</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Book Nights</h4>\n<p>This feature is perfect for you if you&#8217;re in the accommodation business. The booking calendar offers support for morning check-outs. Your clients will have the option of checking-in in the afternoons and checking-out in the mornings &#8211; and the prices and availability will be displayed accordingly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/demos/wordpress-booking/nights-en/?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fbooking-system&amp;utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View demo</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Book Hours</h4>\n<p>With Pinpoint, you can control your reservations by hours. Hours are treated exactly the same as days, with 5 types of availability, special prices for groups of hours or a minimum or a maximum number of bookable hours.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/demos/wordpress-booking/hours-en/?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fbooking-system&amp;utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View demo</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Book Hours Intervals</h4>\n<p>Pinpoint booking calendar lets you adjust the reservation time interval even more &#8211; with the help of the time slot. You can set hour intervals for your bookings, down to the minute. This gives you increased precision and control over your client&#8217;s reservations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/demos/wordpress-booking/hours-intervals-en/?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fbooking-system&amp;utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View demo</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Reservations management</h3>\n<p>Booking management has never been easier. Booking calendar administrators can add, cancel, edit, reject or delete reservation requests. Bookings can be instantly approved or rejected, but can never overlap &#8211; and the booking calendar will update accordingly.</p>\n<p>You can choose between a list view or a calendar view to display your clients&#8217; reservations, and they can be printed or exported in 4 types of formats &#8211; CSV, XLS, JSON, and ICS.</p>\n<h3>BOOKING CALENDAR EXTENSIONS</h3>\n<h4>Extras</h4>\n<p>With Pinpoint, you can add extra amenities, services or others to your client&#8217;s bookings, either with a price or for free. You can set default values for the extras, and whether they are mandatory or not. Also, multiple extras groups can be made to be used with your booking calendar.</p>\n<h4>Forms</h4>\n<p>In case you need more information from your clients, you can create a custom form that your customers can fill in directly in the booking calendar. You can have text fields, text areas, checkboxes, dropdowns and even custom fields in your form. It&#8217;s worth knowing that you can create an unlimited number of custom forms for your calendar.</p>\n<h4>Discounts</h4>\n<p>In this booking calendar, you can create discounts according to the time interval the reservation is made for. You can decide how the discounts will be calculated &#8211; once by day or hour, fixed or a percent &#8211; and their default amount.</p>\n<h4>Taxes and fees</h4>\n<p>If reserving your product or service comes with extra taxes or fees &#8211; you can add them to your booking calendar. You can decide their value, and if they will be included or not in the overall reservation price.</p>\n<h4>Coupons</h4>\n<p>Another useful feature Pinpoint has is the creating of vouchers or coupons for your customers. You can set their default value, the terms and conditions of how they can be used and add them directly into the booking calendar.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Bookings</h3>\n<p>This booking calendar can be greatly extended with the WooCommerce plug-in. With this, you can make the most of the shopping cart, the specific payment gateways and all the other extra features that come with the WooCommerce WordPress plug-in. Additionally, all your reservations data is saved both in Pinpoint and WooCommerce orders.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/woocommerce-booking?utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Other WordPress Booking System Features</h3>\n<h4>Synchronization via iCal files</h4>\n<p>For better reservation management, the Pinpoint Booking Calendar can be synchronized with other calendars &#8211; Mac Calendar, Outlook, Google Calendar, iCalendar or Airbnb, via iCal format data.</p>\n<h4>Notifications for Booking Requests</h4>\n<p>You can send your clients&#8217; reminders and notifications form your booking calendar, either by email or SMS.  You can set up text messages to be sent, either to you or your customers &#8211; with Clickatell SMS gateway. For an email notification, you can create custom templates for any type of notice or language, and they will be sent with STMP, PHPMailer class or PHP mail function.</p>\n<h4>Support for multiple languages</h4>\n<p>If your local language is different from English, or you need to offer your services in multiple languages, the Pinpoint booking system offers support for a couple of languages already. However, if you find that yours is not, you can modify or translate your own texts with a simple “to-do” tool.</p>\n<h4>Support for multiple currencies</h4>\n<p>You can use any currency with our Pinpoint booking system. However, if you need to, you can customize your own currency to fit your needs, using hooks.</p>\n<h4>Online Payment Getaways</h4>\n<p>Even though payment cannot be mandatory when a client makes a reservation, it can be an option. With this booking calendar, PayPal is the default payment method, but if you have another preference, you can change that with add-ons. There are 6 payment gateways to choose from  &#8211; Stripe, WePay, 2Checkout, Authorize.Net, Braintree, ICEPAY and Mollie.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/wordpress-booking/features?utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>FULL LIST OF FEATURES</strong></a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n        <a href=\"https://pinpoint.world/blog/pinpoints-2019-roadmap-1?utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_medium=Plugin%20FREE%20repository\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more</a>\n    </p>\n</blockquote>\n",
