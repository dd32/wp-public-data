It natively supports <strong><a href=\"https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&amp;utm_medium=cryptopay_lite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cryptocurrency payments for WooCommerce</a></strong>, and can also be integrated with other plugins thanks to its API. You can also receive direct payments with crypto wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance Wallet and Phantom. With WalletConnect support, you can receive <strong><a href=\"https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&amp;utm_medium=cryptopay_lite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress cryptocurrency payments</a></strong> from mobile devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Review WooCommerce crypto payment gateway with video</strong></p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vaoFL4XG10?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p><strong>What advantages does CryptoPay provide you?</strong></p>\n<p>As you know, virtual POS and many other payment methods deduct commission from you. The only commission here is the &#8220;gas&#8221; fee that blockchain networks charge. So the money will be transferred directly to your account. You can receive payments from all EVM-based networks as well as other Blockchain networks such as Bitcoin, Solana, Tron.</p>\n<p><strong>Nonsense that CryptoPay doesn&#8217;t have:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No KYC\n<ul>\n<li>You don&#8217;t need to provide any documents to start receiving payments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No commission\n<ul>\n<li>We don&#8217;t charge any commission (%0 fees).

So the whole system works as P2P (Peer to Peer).<br />\n✅ No commission is charged to sellers in any way. Only payers pay blockchain transaction fees.<br />\n✅ Since all transactions are P2P (Peer to Peer), payment confirmation times are minimal.<br />\n✅ Easily integrable to other plugins with the APIs in the plugin (integrated 16+ plugins).<br />\n✅ For example, providing services with many extra plugins such as the Donation plugin.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Other services:</em></strong></p>\n<p>❌ They transfer the payment first to their wallet to get a commission and then to your wallet.<br />\n❌ Payments are usually not P2P (Peer to Peer). Therefore, payment approval times are very long.<br />\n❌ The commission amounts that the service generates its own income will be deducted from your earnings.<br />\n❌ Even the fastest networks have very high payment confirmation times, as multiple transfers are made to earn commissions.<br />\n❌ Generally you can only use it for WooCommerce. To integrate with other plugins, you need a serious programming knowledge.<br />\n❌ An additional transaction fee is charged to transfer the payment from their wallet to you, and this is deducted from your earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Are Network Supports available in Lite Version?</strong></p>\n<p>Bitcoin, Solana, Tron etc. network supports are for premium only. So you can&#8217;t get Bitcoin or Solana payments by buying network support add-ons. Because network supports work with the premium version.</p>\n<p>This is because some services such as “Pay by transfer to address” run on servers that cost us monthly. So it&#8217;s a one-time payment of 49 dollars. It is impossible for us to cover these costs every month.</p>\n<p><strong>General features:</strong></p>\n<p>The following features are available in both versions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No commission</li>\n<li>No KYC required</li>\n<li>Payment reminders</li>\n<li>WooCommerce supports</li>\n<li>Special currency discounts</li>\n<li>Completely P2P (Peer to Peer)</li>\n<li>Mobile device support with WalletConnect</li>\n<li>Fully owned (all process in your server)</li>\n<li>Integrations with other plugins (16+ plugins)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Free Version:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited EVM-based network support (Only 5)</li>\n<li>No have pay by transfer to address support (QR Code)</li>\n<li>No have some extra features like custom token &amp; prices support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pro Version:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited EVM-based network support</li>\n<li>Pay by transfer to address support (QR Code)</li>\n<li>Unlimited coin payments support for each network</li>\n<li>Custom token &amp; prices support (Your utility tokens)</li>\n<li>Extra network support add-ons (Bitcoin, Solana, Tron etc.)</li>\n<li>Extra converter support add-ons (CoinGecko, Moralis etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Requires</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP 8.1 or higher</li>\n<li>WordPress 5.0 or higher</li>\n<li>PHP Extensions: cURL, BCMath, GMP</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Privacy notices</h4>\n<p>With the default configuration, this plugin, in itself, does not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use cookies;</li>\n<li>track users by stealth;</li>\n<li>It only sends active plugin count and active feedback;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>You can easily translate with Loco translate.</p>\n<p>Read documentation: <strong><a href=\"https://beycanpress.gitbook.io/cryptopay-docs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation</a></strong><br />\nReview CryptoPay Premium: <strong><a href=\"https://beycanpress.com/cryptopay/?utm_source=wporg_readme&amp;utm_medium=cryptopay_lite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cryptocurrency payments for WooCommerce</a></strong></p>\n",
