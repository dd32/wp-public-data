You can recover up to $500 completely free, You can <a href=\"https://recapture.io/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">learn more about Recapture pricing here</a> for our paid accounts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20do%20you%20consider%20a%20cart%20%22abandoned%22%20and%20how%20do%20you%20get%20emails%20from%20my%20customers%3F'>\nWhen do you consider a cart &#8220;abandoned&#8221; and how do you get emails from my customers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A cart is considered abandoned if a customer has added items to the cart, but has not checked out or shown any cart activity for at least 30 minutes.  At this point, Recapture starts the timers for your recovery emails.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20get%20emails%20from%20my%20customers%3F'>\nHow do you get emails from my customers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Recapture can get an email in a few different ways&#8211;First, any logged in customer who abandons a cart will receive recovery emails because of their WP profile.  Any guest customer who has entered a full, valid email address somewhere in the site (e.g.  email popup, our Add to Cart popup, even OTHER plugins that collect emails&#8211;Recapture can track that, easily) will receive recovery emails too.  Our success here comes from a few secrets in our JavaScript library that makes Recapture so powerful.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20include%20unique%20coupon%20codes%20in%20my%20emails%3F'>\nCan I include unique coupon codes in my emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep! Recapture can find and include WooCommerce coupon codes in your automated emails.  This gives you a proven and powerful means of increasing conversion rates and generating more orders!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20broadcast%20emails%3F'>\nDo you support broadcast emails?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  As of July 2021, Recapture can now send broadcast campaigns to promote your sales, send newsletters and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20gdpr%20compliant%3F'>\nAre you GDPR compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Completely.
