Similarly, with themes, you may be keeping a native WordPress theme, such as twenty twenty-one for troubleshooting but you don&#8217;t actually need to immediately address any available updates for it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20security%20concerns%3F'>\nAre there security concerns?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t advised to keep a WordPress site on a live environment with updates required. The purpose of this plugin is quick notification, straight to your screen, of when updates are needed / available, especially with the Core of WordPress (which is why you&#8217;re unable to &#8220;ignore&#8221; a Core update). The purpose behind ignoring plugins and themes is designed to reduce &#8220;notification overload&#8221; so that you&#8217;re in control of the alerts you are sent and aren&#8217;t bombarded with needless information for themes and plugins that you don&#8217;t need to be informed about.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20plugin%27s%20limitations%3F'>\nWhat are the plugin&#8217;s limitations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>This plugin has been tested on WordPress core versions 4.0 onwards.</li>\n<li>This plugin has been tested on a WordPress Multisite environment.</li>\n<li>If there&#8217;s a demand to continue to add further functionality to this plugin then I am open to doing so. In the meantime I intend to keep it working on new versions of WordPress.</li>\n<li>The plugin author accepts no liability for any losses or damage caused as a result of this plugin not alerting to updates.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
