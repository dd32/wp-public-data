Not only in the way we talk with our family and friends, but also in the way we interact with business of all sizes. The question many business owners are asking themselves is: <strong>How can I effectively use WhatsApp for my business?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Millionchats</strong> is the swiss army knife your business needs if you&#8217;re serious about Whatsapp automations. It offers a set of tools that will help your to engage your users on Whatsapp and convert them into paying customers.</p>\n<p>No matter if you&#8217;re looking for a simple solution to connect the website of your business with a whatsapp account, a way to automatically answer the FAQ&#8217;s from your customers, or a tool that can handle conversations at the same whatsapp number with multiple agents simultaneously, this plugin has got you covered.</p>\n<h3>GETTING STARTED</h3>\n<p>First of all you will need to request an <strong>Api Key</strong> on <a href=\"https://www.millionchats.com/\" title=\"Millionchats\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website</a> so the plugin can connect with the Millionchats servers.</p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve requested your personal API key you must establish the **general settings* necessary for the correct functioning of the tool on your website.</p>\n<p>In the general settings you have to define the name of the domain you&#8217;re installing the plugin on and the telephone number where you will receive the messages if they are not processed by the Millionchats channel. Messages are directed to this number by default when you use the free version of Millionchats, or the option &#8220;Send all messages to this phone&#8221; is activated</p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s have a closer look at all the things our all-in-one solution can do to <strong>automate whatsapp</strong> for your business.</p>\n<h3>INSTALL A CONTACT BUTTON ON YOUR WEBSITE</h3>\n<p>Our contact buttons are called bubbles. You can install the button sitewide, or decide on what pages you want it to appear. You can choose between two different types: a text button, or an icon (image). If you choose the text button you will have to define the call to action text that will be shown to your customers.</p>\n<p>Define if you want the button to show on the left or the right hand side of the screen, customize the text of the chat message on your website and the call to action text that will make the user click on the button.
