        "faq": "\n<h4>Why does the plugin display an information about e-mail address not being correct?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The e-mail address provided in the plugin has to be the same address you used to sign up for wix.cx, as it connects the plugin with an account. The plugin won&#8217;t work without a wix.cx account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I sign up for a wix.cx account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply create an account at https://wix.cx/user/register  wix.cx is completely free to use.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I check my statistics and earnings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can track all of your ad stats in wix.cx user panel, straight after you log in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I check if the plugin works? I can&#8217;t see ads after installation.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There might be a case where you won&#8217;t see ads after plugin installation &#8211; this could happen if you have already visited several wix.cx ads today (due to a mechanism called capping). The best way of checking if the plugin works is through visiting the wix.cx user panel. While on statistics page, click on &#8220;Website Scripts&#8221; tab to display detailed stats for your plugin. It&#8217;s best to wait for a few hours before checking statistics, as your website needs to get some visitors and clicks.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
