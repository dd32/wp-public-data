Online help is available for all the options. Just click the question mark icon next<br />\nto the option title you need help for.</p>\n<p>When you have changed the settings to your satisfaction, click <strong>Save Changes</strong><br />\nand the requested changes to the theme will be made instantaneously.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will the plugin work with themes other than Twenty Eleven?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the plugin has been designed to work specifically with Twenty Eleven, the current default WordPress theme, and<br />\nchild themes using Twenty Eleven as their template. Most of the features depend on the HTML and CSS used by this theme,<br />\nand will almost certainly not work with the vast majority of the other themes out there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>But what if I am using a tailored version of Twenty Eleven? Can I use it then?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. The plugin checks to see if the current theme is a child of &#8220;Twenty Eleven&#8221; and also<br />\nlooks for the phrase &#8220;Twenty Eleven&#8221; in the name of the theme, so as long as it is a child theme of &#8220;Twenty Eleven&#8221; or the theme&#8217;s name<br />\n(obtained from the styles.css file in the theme directory) contains &#8220;Twenty Eleven&#8221;, the Theme Extensions admin page will be<br />\nactive and the extensions will be available to you.</p>\n<p>Please note, however, that some or all of the plugin&#8217;s features may not work with your customized version<br />\nof Twenty Eleven. If you, other plugins or child themes have changed something this plugin depends up, then<br />\nthe results cannot be guaranteed. But the only way to tell if it will work is to give it a try. If something doesn&#8217;t work,<br />\nyou can easily disable the option again on the administration page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The color I want to change is not listed in the Theme Options page. How do I change it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not all the colors used in Twenty Eleven are configurable from the Theme Options page, but you can<br />\nstill use the Theme Extensions plugin to change those that are not listed.</p>\n<p>Look up the CSS styling you need to modify in the <strong>styles.css</strong> file of Twenty Eleven.<br />\n(Click on <strong>Appearance</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Editor</strong> and locate <strong>styles.css</strong> near the bottom of the list of<br />\nfiles on the right.)</p>\n<p>Now enable the <strong>Custom CSS</strong> option on the <strong>Theme Extensions</strong> admin page, and enter the<br />\nCSS styles you want set for your blog.</p>\n<p>If you have a lot of changes to make, it would be better to create a child theme, and put the<br />\nCSS changes in its own <strong>styles.css</strong> file. For more information, see the<br />\n<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Child Theme</a> documentation.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can add your own color settings using a filter called by the Theme Extensions plugin. For<br />\nmore information, please see<br />\n<a href=\"http://moztools.com/wordpress/theme2011-plugin/adding-your-own-custom-color-settings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Adding Your Own Custom Color Settings</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I changed the height of the header image, but the images still come out the same height as before. What&#8217;s happening?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no automatic way to recrop existing header images to make them smaller. You can turn<br />\non the option to force all images to the new height, but that will distort those images that are taller or shorter than<br />\nthe new height, which will include all of the preinstalled header images that came with the theme.</p>\n<p>The option is really intended to allow you to upload <em>new</em> images (or new copies of existing images) that will be<br />\ncropped to the new height. Therefore, if you like the set of header images that comes with the theme, but want<br />\nto use smaller versions of them, you will have to download the images to your computer (right click on them and<br />\nselect &#8220;Save Image As&#8221;) and then use the <strong>Header</strong> theme options page to upload them at the new height. This will<br />\nallow you to crop the image just the way you want it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the minimum versions of software the plugin has been tested with?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress: version 3.2 is the minimum the plugin has been tested on</li>\n<li>PHP5: version 5.2.6 (required for WordPress 3.2)</li>\n<li>MYSQL: no dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>Version 1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New feature: a new option allowing you to customize twelve more colors on the Theme Options page.</li>\n<li>New feature: added a WordPress filter to allow others to add or modify the colors that can be edited.</li>\n<li>New feature: access the Theme Options and Theme Extensions pages directly from the admin menu bar on your home page. </li>\n<li>Now any child theme using the template <strong>twentyeleven</strong> can use the theme extensions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: adjusted percentage widths slightly to keep right-sidebar in place when sizing the page on IE7.</li>\n<li>Bug fix: added two more CSS styles to correct content positioning problem when using the &#8220;Widget Titles&#8221; option with left-sidebars.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the first version.</li>\n</ul>\n"
