A frame is a subdivision of a Web browser window and can act like a smaller window. A framekiller is usually used to prevent a website from being loaded from within a frameset without permission or as an attack, as with clickjacking.</p>\n<p>See:<br />\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framekiller</p>\n</p>\n\n",
