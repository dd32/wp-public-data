The technical limit is about 8000 votes if all are made from guests, however that limit can be overcomed by doing a minor adjustment to the database your blog runs in.</p>\n<p>Running the following query will remove the technical limit. Note that this will take up more space on your hosting. (Note, the following SQL query assumes your database prefix is wp_, which is default for WordPress).</p>\n<pre><code>ALTER TABLE `wp_votes` CHANGE `guestsinks` `guestsinks` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL \nALTER TABLE `wp_votes` CHANGE `guests` `guests` LONGTEXT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NOT NULL\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
