Perhaps in a later version, but not right now.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the look/feel of this plugin via CSS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the quotes are wrapped in the tag, #obi-wan. I&#8217;d suggest changing the CSS in your theme&#8217;s CSS as opposed to the plugins hello-obi-wan.php file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I suggest more quotes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. Direct any suggestions, problems, or smart remarks to @kloptikus on Twitter</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I suggest a new feature?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, add your comments/suggestions about this plugin here:<br />\nhttps://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hello-obi-wan</p>\n</p>\n\n",
