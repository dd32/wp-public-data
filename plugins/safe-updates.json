I was excited and updated few of my installations only to find out that some of them ran into fatal errors.

I wondered, only if there was a plugin which could warn me about plugins or themes that might have not been tested, just before I tried to run updates.</p>\n<p>Thus, I decided to build <strong><em>Safe Updates</em></strong>, a small nifty WordPress plugin which lets you know if there are any plugin or theme on your installation that might have not been tested with the target WordPress version before you try to update.</p>\n<h3>Use Cases</h3>\n<p>The use case of this plugin is very straight-forward.

In such a case, a plugin/theme might still be incompatible with the targetted update, but <strong><em>Safe Updates</em></strong> might not show it if its author didn&#8217;t disclose its tested up to version.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Installation of the <strong>Safe Updates</strong> plugin is very simple.
