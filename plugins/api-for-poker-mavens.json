That page will ask the user to input their Password (Poker Mavens Account Password) and if it is correct the wordpress Password hash will be stored in the &#8220;Custom&#8221; field of the Poker Mavens Server.  From there on wordpress will compare the hash with the logged in user password hash and if they match will allow for modification of the account data.  If the wordpress password changes account verification will be asked again.</p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>upload the contents of the zip file to the plugins directory of your wordpress site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
