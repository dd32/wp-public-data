When you find it, click the Activate link.</p>\n<p>In order for the plugin to talk to TSAWaitTimes.com, you&#8217;ll need to create an API key &#8211; please note that access may require a paid subscription.

Please Note: If you do not generate an API key, the plugin will return dummy data. Dummy data can be useful for making sure that the plugin works, but you&#8217;ll want to get an API key to return live data.</p>\n<p>Next, add your API Key to WordPress.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20calculate%20the%20estimated%20wait%20times%3F'>\nHow do you calculate the estimated wait times?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use a combination of data sources including the TSA, FAA, traveler contributions, and our own internal data including a custom spider. The government data is often incomplete so we use additional custom logic to help fill in some of the blanks. Combining historical along with recent data points helps form the basis of the estimates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20estimated%20wait%20times%20accurate%3F'>\nAre the estimated wait times accurate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All wait times are estimates and may not be reflective of the actual experience that a traveler may have at any given moment. Wait times are a combination of historical, user-submitted data, and additional custom logic. The TSA itself states on their website &#8220;Wait times are based on crowdsourced data provided by passengers and we cannot ensure their accuracy. Prepare for your trip by checking the histogram, which is based on historical data and can estimate how busy your airport is likely to be on your selected day and time of travel.&#8221; We use a combination of factors to help determine the estimated wait time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20website%20owned%20by%20the%20tsa%3F'>\nIs this website owned by the TSA?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This website is not owned or affiliated with the TSA. We are an independent software company (TayTech LLC) located in the state of Wisconsin in the United States.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%3F'>\nHow much does it cost?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check the TSAWaitTimes.com website for current pricing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20an%20api%20key%20and%20why%20do%20i%20need%20one%3F'>\nWhat is an API key and why do I need one?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An API key is a unique string assigned to you that lets the WordPress plugin talk to TSAWaitTimes.com. It lets us know who is asking for information, what info they want, and how we should return it. Creating an API key can be done from the TSAWaitTimes.com website.  If you do not have an API key, the WordPress plugin will return cached, dummy data which can be useful for testing but not so useful in a production environment.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
