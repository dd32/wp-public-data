Notices are displayed in the booking calendar and users can be notified about changes.</li>\n<li>A map view can now be set for the location page. The setting can be activated via the location editor.</li>\n<li>Customizable booking confirmation text on booking page (&#8220;Your booking has been confirmed&#8221;).

This setting also applies to all existing time frames.  The setting is done via the time frames. The time frame can thus be created for a longer or infinite period. Users can then always only book a maximum of x days in advance, calculated from today.</li>\n<li>Thumbnail size in article and location lists now adjustable (Settings -&gt; Templates -&gt; Image formatting).</li>\n<li>GBFS API integrated to enable standardized data exchange with other mobility platforms.</li>\n<li>Calendar Legend:The booking calendar has now received a legend to explain the colors and settings of the calendar.</li>\n<li>For experts: metadata sets (individual attributes / fields can be added to items or categories here).API extended (individual API releases possible).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Enhanced or changed</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The map view no longer shows pickup notes and contact details in the small preview popup, as we want to output these only in the booking process.

It is now possible to restrict bookable timeframes to one or more user groups to restrict bookings based on these timeframes.</li>\n<li>FIXED: In case of consecutive time frames, it could happen that not all time frames were displayed in the calendar. This is now fixed. (#612)</li>\n<li>FIXED: In a some combination of time frames it could happen that an already existing booking could be overwritten (in case of slotwise booking). (#610)</li>\n<li>FIXED: Some parts in the calendar were not translated to English when the website language was set to English. (#545)</li>\n<li>FIXED: API was available by default &#8211; this is standard behaviour of the wordpress integrated API too. Now the CommonsBooking API is deactived by default an can be activated in CommonsBooking options. We also removed the Owner information from items that has been available via the API (first and last name)</li>\n<li>FIXED: In the email template tags, the tag following the pattern {{xxx:yyy}} could not be used within an a href link as it is not allowed by WordPress security methods.

Example a href=&#8221;{{xxxx#yyyy}}&#8221;</li>\n<li>FIXED: New booking codes could not be generated in some cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.4.4 (26.04.2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: Added category filter in items and locations shortcode. You can use [cb_items category_slug=category_slug] to show items by a single category.</li>\n<li>NEW: Added the p attribute to cb_items shortcode, so you can display a single item by using [cb_items p=POSTID]</li>\n<li>CHANGED: Item and location list in select dropdown in timeframe editor is not restricted to published elements anymore. </li>\n<li>ENHANCED: template improvements: not available notice now in separate line in item/location lists</li>\n<li>ENHANCED: pickupinstructions now inclueded in the location section on the booking page (changed template: booking-single.php)</li>\n<li>ENHANCED: inlcuded pickupinstructions in the following templates: location-calendar-header.php / location-single-meta.php</li>\n<li>ENHANCED: Changed the standard image thumbnail size in listings</li>\n<li>FIXED: If multiple timeframes are set the calendar only showed the last timeframe in booking calendar. </li>\n<li>FIXED: Fixed some issues with map category filter</li>\n<li>FIXED: fixed interaction issues with calender when using timeslots. pickup field resets when selecting pickup time (fixed issues #629 and #619)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2.4.3 (09.04.2021)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NEW: Eport-Tool for exporting timeframes (Bookings etc.) with flexible data fields.

You can choose the maximum days in the timeframe editor.</li>\n<li>NEW: We added 2 new menu items in the CommonsBooking section so that you can now the edit Commonsbooking categories for locations and items (rename, remove etc.)</li>\n<li>NEW: Hide Contact Details: It is now possible to configure whether contact details of the station are only displayed after the booking has been confirmed by the user. This prevents users from already receiving booking details for an unconfirmed booking and thus possibly already contacting the location without having completed the booking.</li>\n<li>ENHANCED: Added migration of elementor special fields</li>\n<li>ENHANCED: Added map link to dashboard</li>\n<li>ENHANCED: Validation of bookings optimized</li>\n<li>FIXED: Bookable timeframe without enddate caused some issues in frontend calendar. Now it is possible to leave end date empty to allow infinite booking timeframe</li>\n<li>FIXED: performance issue on some systems in backend view (issue #546)</li>\n<li>FIXED: cancelation of an unconfirmed booking triggered a cancelation mail to user and location.
