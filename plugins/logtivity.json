You can record all the user activity on your clients&#8217; sites. Then you can use the activity log data to send notifications to email or Slack. Plus, you can easily search and export the information. And you can turn the activity log data into beautiful, useful charts.</p>\n<p>If you have customers on your clients&#8217; WordPress site, you’ll find Logtivity to be invaluable. Because Logtivity records all the important activity, you can see a stream of real customer journeys across the WordPress sites. This can be incredibly helpful for customer support: the activity log will show exactly what a user has done on your site.</p>\n<p>To get started, simply install the Logtivity plugin and then connect your site to <a href=\"https://logtivity.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Logtivity</a>. You’ll immediately start to see the results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/event-tracking/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about activity logs</a>.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Error Logs</h3>\n<p>Logtivity records all PHP errors on your sites, including Errors, Warnings, and Notices.</p>\n<p>You can see the errors, how often they occur, and when they last occurred. It doesn’t matter where your site is hosted. Our logs will record the errors and point you to the file that’s causing problems.</p>\n<p>We’ll notify you as soon as an error occurs, allowing you to jump on it as soon as possible rather than waiting for a user to report it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/error-logs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about error logs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Instant Alert Notifications for WordPress Sites</h3>\n<p>With Logtivity alerts, you can keep an eye on all your clients’ sites. You can set up flexible alerts for single sites or all your clients’ sites.</p>\n<p>These notifications can go directly to your email inbox or to Slack channels.</p>\n<p>If you have many sites, you can set up global alerts. For example, even if you have 100 sites, you only need to configure the alert once.</p>\n<p>One Logtivity customer chooses to receive an email every time a plugin or theme is updated. Another WordPress agency has a Slack alert for every time an administrator logs in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/instant-alerts/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about alerts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Charts from Your Activity Logs</h3>\n<p>Logtivity is a WordPress activity log with a big difference. You can track all the activity on your clients’ sites, and you can also turn that information into beautiful and useful charts.</p>\n<p>Displaying data in charts gives you a helpful and organized overview of your clients’ key metrics. You can use these charts to show logins, purchases, subscriptions, cancellations, downloads, or any other key events. If it happens in WordPress site, Logtivity can turn it into a bar chart or a line chart.</p>\n<p>You can also customize the date range for charts. Your charts have advanced date ranges, so you can zoom in to view any time period.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/customisable-reporting-dashboard/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about charts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Large Activity Log Exports</h3>\n<p>Normal WordPress activity plugins can not handle large amounts of data.</p>\n<p>Logtivity is able to handle exports for even the biggest WordPress sites! If your clients’ site uses Logtivity, you can export millions and millions of logs.</p>\n<p>In the image next to this text, you can see over a dozen CSV files. Each of these files is a Logtivity export that contains 100,000 logs. This export has 13 files, so it’s over 1,300,000 million logs in total.</p>\n<p>Logtivity is the activity log solution for large WordPress sites!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/large-exports/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about log exports</a>.</p>\n<h3>View Activity Logs Inside WordPress</h3>\n<p>Logtivity has a central dashboard where you can see the logs for all your clients’ WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>Plus, you and your clients can also view and search the logs from inside each WordPress site.</p>\n<p>The image on this screen shows what you’ll see inside WordPress after installing the Logtivity plugin.</p>\n<p>All of the activity log data is visible and searchable in the WordPress admin area. And if you want more information on any specific log entry, you can click the “View” button next to each log.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/easy-wordpress-integration/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about the WordPress integration</a>.</p>\n<h3>Logtivity has a White Label Mode for Agencies</h3>\n<p>The most frequent users of Logtivity are WordPress agencies and maintenance services who want to keep an eye on lots of websites.</p>\n<p>Agencies and maintenance services often white label the services they use, and so we’ve made this possible for Logtivity also.</p>\n<p>There’s a “White Label Mode” in Logtivity, so you can provide the smoothest experience possible for clients. You can remove all the references to Logtivity from the WordPress admin area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/features/white-label/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about the White Label mode</a>.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Activity Log</h3>\n<p>If you run an eCommerce store, it’s crucial to know who is making changes to your site.</p>\n<p>This is equally important if you are a web agency assisting clients with their eCommerce stores.</p>\n<p>Mistakes are inevitable, and sometimes clients might inadvertently damage their own sites. The issue is that these errors can take your agency many hours to rectify. Without evidence that the mistake was made by the client, the agency often has to bear the cost of fixing it.</p>\n<p>Logtivity is the solution.</p>\n<p>With Logtivity, you can record detailed changes to WooCommerce products, sales, refunds and more. Our activity log can also record changes to WooCommerce fields, such as the SKU, sales price, inventory count, and more.</p>\n<p>With this level of tracking, agencies can show clients who messed up, and potentially save themselves a lot of time and money.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/woocommerce-activity-log-error-log/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about the WooCommerce activity log</a>.</p>\n<h3>Join Logtivity and Start Your Monitoring</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Logtivity is a SaaS service</strong><br />\n  You will need to create a Logtivity account to store your activity logs and create alerts. <a href=\"https://app.logtivity.io/register\" title=\"Logtivity\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Click here to get started with Logtivity!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20plugins%20do%20logtivity%20activity%20logs%20support%3F'>\nWhat plugins do Logtivity activity logs support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Logtivity has some support for most WordPress plugins. If the plugin uses post types, we record when most post types are updated, created or deleted.</p>\n<p>We currently have integrations with Easy Digital Downloads, Memberpress and Download Monitor. These integrations allow you to track things like Memberpress subscription creations, changes, or cancellations and also track when files are downloaded through Download Monitor.</p>\n<p>We are working on more detailed event monitor support for some key plugins, including eCommerce plugins such as WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.</p>\n<p>Please contact us for specific details on any plugin that you are using.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20log%20custom%20events%3F'>\nCan I log custom events?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, our user activity tracking plugin provides a flexible API to log and store custom events with Logtivity. An example of logging a custom event is below. This example is recording information from Stripe.com for a customer:</p>\n<pre><code>Logtivity::log()\n    -&gt;setAction('My Custom Action')\n    -&gt;addMeta('Meta Label', $meta)\n    -&gt;addMeta('Another Meta label', $someOtherMeta)\n    -&gt;addUserMeta('Stripe Customer ID', $stripeCustomerId)\n    -&gt;send();\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/docs/custom-events/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about custom activity logs</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20user%20activities%20does%20logtivity%20record%3F'>\nWhat user activities does Logtivity record?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Logtivity records all core WordPress actions. In addition to support for the WordPress core, Logtivity records events for many plugins and themes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/docs/what-logs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about what Logtivity records</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20logtivity%20have%20activity%20logs%20for%20wordpress%20user%20logins%3F'>\nDoes Logtivity have activity logs for WordPress user logins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s important to have an activity log on your WordPress site. You need user tracking because you need to know many people are visiting, making purchases, and logging in to your site. Yes, you can track visitors with Google Analytics, and you can track purchases with your payment gateway, but it’s harder to track WordPress-specific information such as log ins. Using Logtivity, you can get an overview of who is logging in to your site, and how many people are logging in every day.</p>\n<p>If Logtivity is active on your site, you can go to the “Logs” screen and search for all the “User Logged in” events. You can use the search boxes to drill down for more specific user tracking information. For example, you can use the “Context” box to search for a particular user role. You can use this to search for all &#8220;Administrator&#8221; logins or all &#8220;Editor&#8221; logins.</p>\n<p>You can also use the search option as a security log and look for nefarious patterns in the audit logs. For example, you can search by IP address to see if one person is using multiple logins. Or you can search by username to see if one account is being shared by different people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/track-user-logins-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to see more about activity logs for user logins</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20logtivity%20a%20gdpr-compliant%20activity%20log%3F'>\nIs Logtivity a GDPR-compliant activity log?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Logtivity gives you complete control over the user tracking information recorded in the audit logs. You can choose your GDPR settings. You can decide to only log a profile link, user ID, username, IP address, or nothing at all.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inside your WordPress site, go to “Tools” and then “Logtivity”.</li>\n<li>You can uncheck the boxes on this screen to stop Logtivity from recording personal user trackking data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of the key GDPR-compliant settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store User ID: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users User ID in the logged action.</li>\n<li>Store Users Profile Link: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users profile link in the logged action.</li>\n<li>Store Users Username: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users username in the logged action.</li>\n<li>Store Users IP Address: If you check this box, when logging an action, we will include the users IP address in the logged action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/docs/personal-data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here for more about the GDPR and activity logs</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20disable%20all%20activity%20logs%20and%20only%20store%20custom%20logs%3F'>\nCan I disable all activity logs and only store custom logs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can easily disable all event monitoring that this plugin provides so that you can only store the user tracking audit logs that matter to you manually. You can also disable built in logs on an individual basis via the filter example below:</p>\n<pre><code>add_action('wp_logtivity_instance', function($Logtivity_Logger) {\n\n    if (strpos($Logtivity_Logger-&gt;action, 'Page was updated') !== false) {\n        $Logtivity_Logger-&gt;stop();\n    }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/docs/select-events/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here for more about disabling activity logs</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20rename%20the%20activity%20logs%3F'>\nCan I rename the activity logs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is possible to rename the events that are stored in Logtivity’s audit logs. For example, you can add this code to your site’s functions.php file. This code will result in an event “File Downloaded” being logged as “Resource Downloaded”.</p>\n<pre><code>add_action('wp_logtivity_instance', function($Logtivity_Logger) {\n    if (strpos($Logtivity_Logger-&gt;action, 'File Downloaded') !== false) {\n        $Logtivity_Logger-&gt;setAction('Resource Downloaded');\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://logtivity.io/docs/rename-events/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here for more about renaming activity logs</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20the%20activity%20logs%3F'>\nCan I export the activity logs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Logtivity makes it easy to export your user activity data into a CSV file.
