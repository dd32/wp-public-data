        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.4 or greater</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.0 or greater</li>\n<li>PHP version 5.3 or greater</li>\n<li>PayPal Here app installed on a compatible iOS or Android Device</li>\n<li>PayPal Here-compatible card reader</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of this plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type <code>WooCommerce PayPal Here</code> and click &#8220;Search Plugins&#8221;. Once you’ve found our plugin, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n<p>If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and hitting &#8216;save&#8217;. That should return things to normal.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20online%20customers%20pay%20using%20paypal%20here%3F'>\nCan online customers pay using PayPal Here?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, PayPal Here is a point-of-sale (POS) solution. It&#8217;s designed to take payments in-person, while syncing them to your WooCommerce store.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20support%20recurring%20payments%2C%20like%20for%20subscriptions%3F'>\nDoes this support recurring payments, like for subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No &#8211; this plugin helps you connect your store to PayPal for in-person (card present) transactions. As such, saving cards to a vault for later is not supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20currencies%20can%20i%20use%3F'>\nWhat currencies can I use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin supports all currencies allowed by PayPal Here. Supported currencies are: USD, GBP, and AUD.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20support%20both%20production%20mode%20and%20sandbox%20mode%20for%20testing%3F'>\nDoes this support both production mode and sandbox mode for testing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. PayPal Here requires an iOS or Android app on your device to process payments when a credit or debit card is swiped. These apps do not have a sandbox or test mode available, so only live payments can be processed.</p>\n<p>You must use a live PayPal account to test transactions as a result. We recommend testing by using the &#8220;Cash&#8221; method in the PayPal Here app, or using a small transaction if you need to test credit card payments (PayPal&#8217;s minimum transaction is $1).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20paypal%20here%20compatible%20with%20all%20woocommerce%20extensions%3F'>\nIs PayPal Here compatible with all WooCommerce extensions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most extensions are supported. Some plugins (Local Pickup Plus is an example) make pretty advanced changes to the &#8220;Create order&#8221; screen in WooCommerce, and therefore aren&#8217;t supported. If you need to create orders that support specific plugins to pay using PayPal Here, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create the order by browsing your shop and adding items to the cart.</li>\n<li>Create an order that needs payment by using a &#8220;pay later&#8221; gateway, such as the &#8220;Check&#8221; gateway.</li>\n<li>Open that order in your store admin, and pay in PayPal Here using the PayPal Here action or QR code.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20support%20or%20talk%20to%20other%20users%3F'>\nWhere can I get support or talk to other users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the Plugin Forum, or <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reach out to WooCommerce support</a> for support via email.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
