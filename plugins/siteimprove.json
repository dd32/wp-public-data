        "description": "<p>The Siteimprove CMS Plugin bridges the gap between the WordPress content management system (CMS) and the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform. Now you can scan your website for errors as soon as a page is published, allowing you to fix mistakes, optimize content, and manage your site more efficiently.<br />\nThe plugin also provides you access to Prepublish, an add-on which allows you to check your page for issues before it has been published.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>There are two ways to install the Siteimprove plugin on WordPress.</p>\n<p>To install the plugin via the listing page, type ‘Siteimprove’ in the search box on the WordPress plugin listing page and click on ‘install’.</p>\n<p>OR</p>\n<p>Upload the Siteimprove plugin zip file using WordPress’ ‘Upload Plugin’ feature. The plugin can be activated immediately after upload.</p>\n<h4>Configuration</h4>\n<p>After installing and activating the plugin, navigate to a piece of content in your WordPress configuration panel, i.e. &#8220;Pages&#8221;. While you are editing it, you should now see a Siteimprove icon on the right sidebar of the admin page.</p>\n<p>Click on ‘Login’ and enter your Siteimprove username and password to access Siteimprove.</p>\n<p>A new Siteimprove menu option will also appear on the left menu bar. Click on this menu option to continue configuring the plugin once you’ve logged in.</p>\n<p>The token field is automatically filled and should not be changed unless a new token is required. In such cases, please click on “Request new token” to generate a new token.</p>\n<p>Public URL is optional to fill in if, for any reason, your published pages are not on the same URL as your configuration panel.</p>\n<p>When you download the plugin, you automatically will be using the latest experience. If for some reason, you want to use the previous experience of the Siteimprove plugin, uncheck &#8220;Use latest experience&#8221; in the configuration panel.</p>\n<p>API Username (Email) and API Key are API credentials that should be filled in if you have purchased the ‘Prepublish’ add-on feature. When provided correctly, you should be able to begin utilizing Prepublish when you are previewing a page.</p>\n<p>Click on ‘Save’ once you have filled out the relevant fields.</p>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Once you have completed configuring the Siteimprove plugin and you are on a content page in the configuration panel, clicking on the Siteimprove icon in the right sidebar will open the Siteimprove plugin, which will provide you with the content&#8217;s current issues and the page&#8217;s current Digital Certainty Index (DCI) score.</p>\n<p>You will also be able to review accessibility, content and policy issues on the page you are currently editing.</p>\n<p>While editing a published page, the plugin provides you a page-level DCI score alongside an assessment of the readability and quality level of the page.</p>\n<p>You can also evaluate what the impact of unpublishing the specific page may have on your overall DCI score and website quality.</p>\n<h4>Prepublish</h4>\n<p>If you have purchased the Prepublish add-on, you should see a Prepublish icon at the top of any page in preview mode.</p>\n<p>Clicking on this button will trigger the Prepublish check, which provides live results of the accessibility and quality of the page.</p>\n<p>Once the checks are complete, you will be able to see issues with the potentially unpublished content.</p>\n<p>You can expand each area to review the issues that need to be fixed, make the necessary edits, and then rerun the Prepublish check to ensure that a page is optimized and issue-free before final publication by clicking on the Prepublish button again.</p>\n",
