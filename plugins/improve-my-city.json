This is the core page of the plugin, where all the issues will be presented. You can add it on a menu, or assign it as you front page.  If you ever delete this page or any page that is created by the Improve My City plugin you can bring them back by disabling and enabling the plugin again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[1.1] Add Improve My City Main Page to your main menu</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit Appearance &gt; Menus</li>\n<li>Choose an existing menu or create a new one.</li>\n<li>Search and Add to Menu the &#8220;IMC &#8211; Improve My City Main page&#8221; from the Pages section.</li>\n<li>Choose a location for your menu at Theme locations and save it.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[1.2] Set Improve My City Main Page as your site&#8217;s Front page</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to use the Improve My City Main Page as your front page, go to Settings &gt; Reading and set &#8220;Front page displays&#8221; to &#8220;A static page&#8221;. From the dropdown menu, select the &#8220;IMC &#8211; Improve My City Main Page&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>[2] Issues &amp; Categories</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[2.1] Before creating your first Issue</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each issue that is submitted to the &#8220;Improve My City&#8221; platform is assigned a Status and a Category. Statuses denote the progress of an issue. You can have as many statuses as you want, although it is best to limit the number of statuses to 6. You can have as many Categories as you like.</p>\n<p>Before using the plugin to report issues, there has to be at least one Status and one Category set, so the plugin can function as intended.</p>\n<p>In the following sections, it is described how to manage the Statuses &amp; Categories.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[2.2] Manage Statuses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>To access the Status manager navigate to Improve My City menu &gt; Issue Statuses.</em></p>\n<p>On the left hand side of this screen you can add a new status by providing the necessary information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>: The Status name that will be shown everywhere in the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Slug</strong>: The unique identifier of the Status. It usually is the status name in lowercase without special characters and spaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: A short description about the status that is usually used internally to convey information between administrators.</li>\n<li><strong>Color</strong>: A unique color that best represents the status. Use the color picker to select from a predefined color or set your own.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then click on the Add new Status button to save it.</p>\n<p>You can also edit an existing Status.</p>\n<p>On the right hand side of this screen resides the Status table that lists all of your created statuses. The chronological order that they are created, define the order of each step (as seen in the order field).</p>\n<p>For example the first status that you create, is also an issue&#8217;s first (initial) status (the one with the smallest order number). The second one is the status after the initial, and so on.</p>\n<p>There is a soon to be implemented ordering mechanism to enable setting the ordering manually.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[2.3] Manage Categories</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>To access the Category manager navigate to Improve My City menu &gt; Issue Categories</em></p>\n<p>On the left hand side of this screen you can add a new category by providing the necessary information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>: The Category name that will be shown everywhere in the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Slug</strong>: The unique identifier of the Category. It usually is the category name in lowercase without special characters and spaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Parent</strong>: Use this dropdown if you want to make this Category a sub-Category; you have to select the sub-category&#8217;s parent category. &#8220;Improve My City&#8221; can only support depth of one level.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: A short description about the category that is usually used internally to convey information between administrators.</li>\n<li><strong>E-mail Notifications</strong>: The e-mail address that will receive all notifications about any changes. You can use more than one if you like, by separating them with a comma. By leaving it blank, it means that all the notifications for this category will be sent to the website&#8217;s admin mail (WordPress admin).</li>\n<li><strong>Category Image</strong>: Select an icon that will represent this category. Icons should have at least 100&#215;100 pixels size and background transparency.<br />\nThen click on the Add new Category button to save it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also edit an existing Category.</p>\n<p>On the right hand side of this screen resides the Categories table that lists all of your created categories.</p>\n<h4>[3] Issue Reporting</h4>\n<p><em>In the following section, the default roadmap on how to report an issue is described, both from the frontend and from the administrator panel.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[3.1] Report an issue (Citizens)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To report a new issue as a citizen:<br />\n1.

This is the core page of the plugin, where all the issues will be presented. You can add it on a menu, or assign it as you front page.  If you ever delete this page or any page that is created by the Improve My City plugin you can bring them back by disabling and enabling the plugin again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[1.1] Add Improve My City Main Page to your main menu</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit Appearance &gt; Menus</li>\n<li>Choose an existing menu or create a new one.</li>\n<li>Search and Add to Menu the &#8220;IMC &#8211; Improve My City Main page&#8221; from the Pages section.</li>\n<li>Choose a location for your menu at Theme locations and save it.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[1.2] Set Improve My City Main Page as your site&#8217;s Front page</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to use the Improve My City Main Page as your front page, go to Settings &gt; Reading and set &#8220;Front page displays&#8221; to &#8220;A static page&#8221;.

Statuses denote the progress of an issue. You can have as many statuses as you want, although it is best to limit the number of statuses to 6. You can have as many Categories as you like.</p>\n<p>Before using the plugin to report issues, there has to be at least one Status and one Category set, so the plugin can function as intended.</p>\n<p>In the following sections, it is described how to manage the Statuses &amp; Categories.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[2.2] Manage Statuses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>To access the Status manager navigate to Improve My City menu &gt; Issue Statuses.</em></p>\n<p>On the left hand side of this screen you can add a new status by providing the necessary information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>: The Status name that will be shown everywhere in the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Slug</strong>: The unique identifier of the Status. It usually is the status name in lowercase without special characters and spaces.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: A short description about the status that is usually used internally to convey information between administrators.</li>\n<li><strong>Color</strong>: A unique color that best represents the status. Use the color picker to select from a predefined color or set your own.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then click on the Add new Status button to save it.</p>\n<p>You can also edit an existing Status.</p>\n<p>On the right hand side of this screen resides the Status table that lists all of your created statuses. The chronological order that they are created, define the order of each step (as seen in the order field).</p>\n<p>For example the first status that you create, is also an issue&#8217;s first (initial) status (the one with the smallest order number). The second one is the status after the initial, and so on.</p>\n<p>There is a soon to be implemented ordering mechanism to enable setting the ordering manually.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[2.3] Manage Categories</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>To access the Category manager navigate to Improve My City menu &gt; Issue Categories</em></p>\n<p>On the left hand side of this screen you can add a new category by providing the necessary information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name</strong>: The Category name that will be shown everywhere in the application.</li>\n<li><strong>Slug</strong>: The unique identifier of the Category.
