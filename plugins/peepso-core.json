So a proof of concept was created, and we&#8217;ve received amazing feedback from the community. With Gecko we have close to limitless possibilities to showcase PeepSo and its plugins in the most stunning way.

Please note that the built-in configuration options for the GDPR cover only PeepSo plugins. Should you use any other 3rd party software that also needs to be GDPR compliant, it needs to be covered by its respective developers. PeepSo does NOT cover 3rd party solutions under its GDPR compliance features.

But since there are thousands of themes for WordPress, it is hard for us to test with all of them. Well, virtually impossible. The theme we recommend is <a href=\"https://www.peepso.com/downloads/peepso-theme-gecko/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PeepSo Theme: Gecko</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s a theme developed by the same team that makes PeepSo plugins and it can take your community to the next level. It is beyond anything 3rd party themes can offer with PeepSo. The theme is included for free in every single one of our bundles.</p>\n<p>Having that said, you can check PeepSo with the 3rd party theme and if you find any problems, please report them and we&#8217;ll fix whatever PeepSo might be breaking. However, if 3rd party theme itself is interfering with PeepSo&#8217;s styles and overriding them in any way, there&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;d be able to do &#8211; we can fix only what we&#8217;ve made ourselves.

So a proof of concept was created, and we&#8217;ve received amazing feedback from the community. With Gecko we have close to limitless possibilities to showcase PeepSo and its plugins in the most stunning way. You can get the theme here: <a href=\"https://www.peepso.com/features/#gecko\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PeepSo Theme: Gecko</a>.
