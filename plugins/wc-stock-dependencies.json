        "description": "<p>With Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce, you can make the products and<br />\nvariations in your WooCommerce store dependent on the inventory of your other<br />\nproducts or variations. Customers will be able to select and purchase the<br />\nproduct without seeing the products on which it depends in their cart, during<br />\ntheir checkout, or on their receipt. Inventory management in Woo Commerce is<br />\ngreatly simplified since you only have to manage inventory levels for the<br />\nitem(s) on which your product or variation is dependent.</p>\n<p>Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce works for Simple and Variable product types<br />\nin WooCommerce and you can make a product or variation dependent on a<br />\ncombination of other products and variations. Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce<br />\nlets you create dependencies on quantities of one or more of the other products.</p>\n<p>Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce is ideal for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selling products in multiple quantities. For an product you already have in<br />\nyour inventory, you can use Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce to sell, for<br />\nexample, a package of six items and and package of 12 items. With Stock<br />\nDependencies for WooCommerce you do not need to maintain inventory levels for<br />\neach quantity of the product as the product inventory is managed for only the<br />\nsingle quantity item.</li>\n<li>Selling bundled products. You can create a bundle of<br />\nmultiple items and sell them as a single item. With Stock Dependencies for<br />\nWooCommerce your customers will only see the bundle product in their cart,<br />\nduring the checkout process, and on their order receipt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a product with stock dependencies is displayed in your store, Stock<br />\nDependencies for WooCommerce will check the inventory of the products on which<br />\nit depends and will only show the product as being available if all the<br />\ndependent stock items are available. When a product with stock dependencies is<br />\nadded to a shopping cart and eventually purchased, the customer will only see<br />\nthe single product in their cart and order, and will not see the products on<br />\nwhich it is dependent. When the product is purchased, Stock Dependencies for<br />\nWooCommerce will reduce the inventory of the items on which it is dependent by<br />\nthe appropriate amount.</p>\n<h3>Configuring</h3>\n<p>Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce is easy to configure for any simple or<br />\nvariable product in your WooCommerce store. A single checkbox is added to each<br />\nsimple product or variation in your WordPress admin that allows you to enable<br />\nstock dependencies for that product or variation. Once checked, two fields are<br />\nadded for the SKU and the quantity of the dependency. Additional dependencies<br />\ncan be easily added.</p>\n<h3>Shopping</h3>\n<p>When a customer views a product with dependencies in your WooCommerce store,<br />\nthey will see the product as you have configured it, but the available quantity<br />\nand in-stock status will be determined by Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce<br />\nfrom the available quantities of each of the products and variations on which it<br />\nis dependent.</p>\n<h3>Cart, Checkout, and Receipt</h3>\n<p>Customers will only see the product they selected, and not the products upon<br />\nwhich it is dependent, in their shopping cart, during the checkout process, and<br />\non their receipt.</p>\n<h3>Restocking Refunds and Cancelled Orders</h3>\n<p>When you issue a refund or cancel an order that has stock dependencies, the<br />\nplugin will restock the dependency products.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>The Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce plugin does not affect the way personal<br />\ninformation is collected or stored within your WooCommerce store or your<br />\nWordPress installation.</p>\n<h3>Open Source</h3>\n<p>The Stock Dependencies for WooCommerce plugin is open source software.
