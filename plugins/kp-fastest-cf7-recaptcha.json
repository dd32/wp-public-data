This is confusing and frustrating for most website owners. Reading SPAM submissions also wastes your time.</p>\n<h4>Why this plugin?</h4>\n<p>A lot of Our customers wanted to use Contact Form 7 Recaptcha V3 and still wanted a very fast website. This is when our team got together one Sunday to discuss a possible solution and we found a great idea.</p>\n<p>This plugin is a result of that idea. For more than a year, we kept this plugin within our own company and used only for our own customers.

It&#8217;s great but it lacks the speed angle with V3 that we are hitting with our plugin.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as a website owner, you want Fast website with no SPAM. Contact Form 7 recommends Recaptcha V3. So with our plugin we have tried to keep Recaptcha V3 and also speed up your website.</p>\n<p>You can use our plugin and check your website speed using GTMetrix or Pingdom or Google Pagespeed Insights. The speed (load time) and scores with our plugin are higher.</p>\n<p>The great thing is that our codes can be combined and minified by Popular caching plugins like WP Fastest Cache, Autoptimze, WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, Swift Performance etc.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<pre><code>Copyright 2018-20 Kreativo Pro\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
