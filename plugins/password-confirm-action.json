They may attempt to do this by doing one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the password of the hijacked user to one of their choosing</li>\n<li>Changing the e-mail of the hijacked user</li>\n<li>Creating a new user </li>\n<li>Changing the role of their account to escalate privileges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin prevents the attacker from doing any of these by prompting them for the user&#8217;s password.</p>\n<h4>Caveat</h4>\n<p>Of course by default WordPress allows adminstrative users the ability to install arbitrary plugins and themes, and edit existing plugins/themes through in-built editors.
