You can learn more on <a href=\"http://ace.ajax.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ace.ajax.org</a> or on its <a href=\"http://github.com/ajaxorg/ace\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any known issues?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you try to edit the Ace Edit plugin itself (with the plugin active), Google Chrome will fall back to the default textarea after saving the plugin. This is due to Chrome’s security features which refuse to run any JavaScript that was just part of a POST request sent to the current page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about planned features?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While we try to keep Ace Editor as lightweight as possible, we will introduce a settings page in near future to let users choose one of the included themes for syntax highlighting and set options like word wrap, hidden characters and more.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
