This means that a lot of them load self scripts/styles on every single post and or page of your site. This is not good, because it slows your site down.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we created the WP Asset manager, with it, you can choose which scripts and styles should be loaded on the page, and which ones do not. One example of this would be with the Contact Form 7 plugin. With two clicks you can disable it everywhere except for on your contact page.</p>\n<p>THIS PLUGIN’S BENEFITS INCLUDE</p>\n<p>Decreases number of HTTP requests loaded (important for faster load)<br />\nReduces the HTML code of the actual page (that’s even better if GZIP compression is enabled)<br />\nMakes source code easier to scan in case you’re a developer and want to search for something<br />\nRemove possible conflicts between plugins/theme (e.g. 2 JavaScript files that are loading from different plugins and they interfere one with another)<br />\nBetter performance score if you test your URL on websites such as GTmetrix, PageSpeed Insights, Pingdom Website Speed Test<br />\nGoogle will love your website more as it would be faster and fast page load is nowadays a factor in search ranking<br />\nYour server access log files (e.g the Apache ones) will be easier to scan and would take less space on your server</p>\n<p>We used some useful functions from plugins <strong>Asset Queue Manager</strong>, <strong>WP Asset CleanUp (Page Speed Optimizer)</strong>, <strong>Clearfy – disable unused features</strong>, <strong>wp disable</strong>, <strong>Disabler</strong>, <strong>Admin Tweaks</strong></p>\n<h3>Translations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>English &#8211; default, always included</li>\n<li>French &#8211; Thank you very much to user (kingteamdunet)</li>\n<li>Russian</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to help with the translation, please contact me through this site or through the contacts inside the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Recommended separate modules</h4>\n<p>We invite you to check out a few other related free plugins that our team has also produced that you may find especially useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/clearfy/\" rel=\"ugc\">Clearfy – WordPress optimization plugin and disable ultimate tweaker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/comments-plus/\" rel=\"ugc\">Disable Comments for Any Post Types (Remove Comments)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cyrlitera/\" rel=\"ugc\">Cyrlitera – transliteration of links and file names</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cyr-and-lat/\" title=\"Cyr-to-lat reloaded\" rel=\"ugc\">Cyr-to-lat reloaded – transliteration of links and file names</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-admin-notices/\" title=\"Disable admin notices individually\" rel=\"ugc\">Disable admin notices individually</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hide-login-page/\" title=\"Hide login page\" rel=\"ugc\">Hide login page</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webcraftic-updates-manager/\" rel=\"ugc\">Disable updates, Disable automatic updates, Updates manager</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
