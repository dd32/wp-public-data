By default, it collects a yes/no response to an event (and, optionally, a PayPal payment). This Toastmasters extension allows the software to collect signups for specific roles.</p>\n<p>RSVPMaker includes many features you will not use in the course of a regular Toastmasters meeting, but you may have open house events or seminars you might want to advertise as events on your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20the%20version%20hosted%20at%20toastmost.org%20different%3F'>\nHow is the version hosted at toastmost.org different?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Toastmasters clubs can get websites hosted as subdomains of <a href=\"https://toastmost.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">toastmost.org</a>, a service of project project sponsor <a href=\"https://www.carrcommunications.com/toastmasters-club-website-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Carr Communications Inc.</a> based on the free, open source software from the <a href=\"https://wp4toastmasters.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress for Toastmasters</a> project. Toastmost.org uses the WordPress Multisite version of WordPress, meaning that all sites hosted in this fashion run on the same instance of the software, with the network administrator controlling what plugins and themes are available. This is similar to the way WordPress.com, the service provided by the company behind WordPress, functions.</p>\n<p>The software will run on any WordPress web hosting service.</p>\n<p>When you install this software on your own website, you have greater freedom to install other plugins or themes, including those of your own design. However, you must also take more responsibility for providing your own technical support and solving problems such as spam filters blocking email notifications.</p>\n<p>The toastmost.org service is supported by subscriptions from member clubs.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
