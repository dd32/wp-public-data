Widgets</h4>\n<p>To configure your sidebar in the ordering process:<br />\n1. Go to the Widgets section on your WordPress Dashboard<br />\n2. Add the WooCommerce Cart Totals widget to your sidebar.<br />\n3. It is also recommended that you add the WooCommerce Cart Widget under the<br />\n  WooCommerce Cart Totals. <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/widgets.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Example</a></p>\n<h4>III.

The Step-By-Step is located under the Step-By-Step tab in the Step-By-Step Ordering settings<br />\n2. Create product categories. Each page in the ordering process will display one parent category, which will include their child categories.<br />\n3. To create child categories, make a new category and select the parent category under the Parent field.<br />\n4. To display products, assign <strong>both</strong> a parent and child category to each product.  This is needed for Step-By-Step to function correctly. <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sbs-product-category.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Example</a><br />\n5. Go to the Step-By-Step settings page and drag categories into Your Ordering Process.  You can rearrange the categories inside to change the order.</p>\n<h4>IV.

This is an optional page you can create that displays products in a table rather than a catalog.<br />\n2. A product category named Options and Fees was automatically created on install. This category is the default for the Options and Fees page.<br />\n3. If you wish a different category to serve this role go the Options and Fees settings page and select the category you want and save.<br />\n4. Create child categories of the chosen Options and Fees category, and make products belonging to those categories. Assign <strong>both</strong> a parent and child category to each product.  This is needed for Step-By-Step to function correctly. <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sbs-product-category.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Example</a><br />\n5. Drag and drop child categories from Available Categories to Options and Fees Page Outline to build your Options and Fees page.</p>\n<h4>V. WordPress Themes</h4>\n<p>This plugin is configured to work with themes already compatible with WooCommerce.  While the plugin is fully functional with these themes out of the box, it is recommended to take these steps if you are using one of the following themes:</p>\n<p>** WordPress Twenty Sixteen **</p>\n<p>It is recommended that a full-width template be used on the Choose Package page.  Since Twenty Sixteen does not come with a full-width template, download a child theme from our website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the package selection page in the Admin settings and choose the Full Width template on the right-hand sidebar.</p>\n<p>Download the child theme <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>** WordPress Twenty Seventeen **</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen does not come with a sidebar.  Download a child theme from our website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the Ordering page in WP-Admin and choose the Page with Sidebar template on the right-hand sidebar.</p>\n<p>Download the child theme <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>** Divi by Elegant Themes **</p>\n<p>The Choose Package and Checkout page works best on a full-width template. The Step-By-Step Ordering page should be used on a 2/3 and 1/3 width template for main content and sidebar, respectively.</p>\n<p>It is strongly recommended that a child theme be used, as core template CSS needs to be modified to optimize the UI.  You can download our custom Divi child theme here.</p>\n<p>Download the child theme <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>** Storefront by WooCommerce **</p>\n<p>The Choose Package page is best displayed on the Full width template, which you can select when you edit that page on the right-hand sidebar.  The default template is recommended for the Ordering page.</p>\n<h4>Step-By-Step Premium Upgrade</h4>\n<p>If you like our plugin and would like to see more content from us please consider Going Premium by getting the Step-By-Step Ordering System For WooCommerce Pro version.

WordPress Themes **</p>\n<p>This plugin is configured to work with themes already compatible with WooCommerce.  While the plugin is fully functional with these themes out of the box, it is recommended to take these steps if you are using one of the following themes:</p>\n<p>** WordPress Twenty Sixteen **</p>\n<p>It is recommended that a full-width template be used on the Choose Package page.  Since Twenty Sixteen does not come with a full-width template, download a child theme from our website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the package selection page in the Admin settings and choose the Full Width template on the right-hand sidebar.</p>\n<p>Download the Child Theme <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>** WordPress Twenty Seventeen **</p>\n<p>Twenty Seventeen does not come with a sidebar.  Download a child theme from our website, install it, then activate it.  Go to the Ordering page in WP Admin and choose the Page with Sidebar template on the right-hand sidebar.</p>\n<p>Download the child theme <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>** Divi by Elegant Themes **</p>\n<p>The Choose Package and Checkout page works best on a full-width template. The Step-By-Step Ordering page should be used on a 3/4 and 1/4 width template for main content and sidebar, respectively.</p>\n<p>It is strongly recommended that a child theme be used, as core template CSS needs to be modified to optimize the UI. You can download our custom Divi Child Theme. Download the Child Theme <a href=\"http://stepbystepsys.com/download\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>** Storefront by WooCommerce **</p>\n<p>The Choose Package page is best displayed on the Full Width Template, which you can select when you edit that page on the right-hand sidebar.  The default template is recommended for the Ordering page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20suggested%20amount%20of%20packages%20to%20use%3F'>\nWhat is the suggested amount of packages to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With regard to SBS Premium Version, there is no correct amount of packages to use.  You may choose to offer only one package for certain situations, but most people use between 3-6 packages.  To keep it simple, we recommend using up to 3 packages to not overburden your customer with decisions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20suggested%20amount%20of%20step-by-step%20pages%20to%20use%3F'>\nWhat is the suggested amount of Step-By-Step pages to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Up to 6 total steps for SBS Premium customers.  This means you can have 4 Category pages, 1 Options and Fees page and a Checkout page.  Or you can configure it to have 5 category pages and 1 checkout pages.  It&#8217;s flexible and its totally up to you!  If you only need a couple category pages, then you can do that as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20default%20step-by-step%20%28ordering%29%20page%20called%3F'>\nWhat is the Default Step-By-Step (Ordering) Page called?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default ordering page for the Step-By-Step Navigations page is set to &#8220;Ordering&#8221; by default.  You can change this to anything you would like in the General Settings tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20use%20widgets%3F'>\nDo I have to use Widgets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is recommended that you add two widgets to your sidebar.

You can display your featured items under both their parent category and the featured section, or you can display featured products only in the featured section.
