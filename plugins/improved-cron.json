        "faq": "\n<h4>What is a “fake visit”?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress Cron only runs when someone visits your site. A fake visit causes a page to load without needing a real person to visit.<br />\nFor the more technically minded, the plugin spawns a PHP sub-process that loops indefinitely and loads wp-cron.php each minute. This causes WP Cron to be triggered in exactly the same way it would if a real user was visiting your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can the interval be adjusted?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. However, you’d need to modify the plugin code. The reason is that WordPress won’t allow cron jobs to run more frequently than 1 minute, and running every minute has very little downside.<br />\nIf you really must tinker with it, hook a filter into &#8216;imcron_interval_id&#8217; like this (change &#8216;123&#8217; to your desired interval time):</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'cron_schedules', 'add_my_own_interval' );\nfunction add_my_own_interval() {\n    $seconds = 123;\n    $interval['my_own_interval'] = array('interval' =&gt; $seconds, 'display' =&gt; sprintf( '%d seconds', $seconds ) );\n    return $interval;\n}\n\nadd_filter( 'imcron_interval_id', 'set_imcron_interval' );\nfunction set_imcron_interval() {\n    return 'my_own_interval';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You’ll need to stop and re-start on the settings page to get the new interval to take effect.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it list every scheduled event in the admin, including those scheduled by plugins or themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it includes all events scheduled within WordPress at the time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is PHP requirement of using this? Is it PHP exec() enable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your WP-Cron jobs work when you have a visitor, then this plugin should work for you. The plugin uses exactly the same code as WP Cron does, just in a different way, and with safeguards, a keep alive, logging available, etc.<br />\nThe ‘background process’ is really a HTTP request that loops indefinitely until you press stop in the panel. I also use a lock file system to prevent multiple ‘processes’ starting, as well as provide a failsafe method of killing the process (if the lock file is gone when it wakes up, then it dies).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Doesn’t running a background process consume extra memory?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but only a small, fixed, amount of memory. During testing, I left the plugin running for a couple of weeks while logging memory usage each minute. There was no growth in memory usage (Iow, no memory leak) and a pretty small memory footprint (under 250KB).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you know if the “fake” visits will be detected by WP Stats/Google Analytics/etc?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin calls wp-cron.php directly, so I doubt any stats programs will record these visits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this allow you to create cron jobs, or does it just help them run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It just helps them run when you expect them to (+/- 1 minute). Normally, WP Cron requires a visitor so the actual run time of a cron job can be hours after you scheduled it to run.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this works with WordPress MultiSite? And if so, can I turn certain double crons (like plugin update checks) off?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I haven’t done any testing with WordPress multisite yet. I created it for a project I was working on and spun it off into a standalone plugin. Unfortunately, I haven’t made anywhere near enough sales to justify much extra development effort at this stage, however I’m open to sponsorship to test and/or extend it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
