The cache timeout for a feed is 5 min.<br />\nAlso upgraded the plugin to my basis framework and fixed a few bugs and anoyances.</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed some minor bugs</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made the plugin translatable and added dutch languagesupport</li>\n<li>Rewrote the plugin partly to clean up the code and avoid clashes with my other plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Nothing much. Moved the ID field block to the side where it takes less space.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release</li>\n</ul>\n"
