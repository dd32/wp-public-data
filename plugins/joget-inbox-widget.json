By default, the URL should be configured up to your /wflow-wfweb/ (i.e., http://localhost:8080/wflow-wfweb/).</li>\n<li>Make sure your Joget installation is loaded and configured with the correct WordPress Directory Manager plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Full wiki of setup instructions can be found at http://dev.joget.org/community/display/KB/Wordpress</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What can I build with Joget Workflow ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any process-driven web application. It could be a CRM, ERP or HR management solution, or procurement software. If it&#8217;s process-driven<br />\nor process-centric, Joget will help you build it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What technology is Joget Workflow written on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Joget is built mostly on a J2EE stack.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does that mean that it will not apply to the PHP guys in the WordPress community ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not. We&#8217;ve designed our integration points to be web technology agnostic. You can do a whole lot with our JSON and REST APIs<br />\nwithout having to ever touch the JAVA suite. The WordPress widget itself is written purely on PHP and JavaScript.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I can also do JAVA ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>More power to you ! We have a full OSGI implementation that will allow you to build very, very, very cool stuff. We have existing plugins that<br />\ncan connect to LDAPs or Google Apps, or even make it so that you can send SMS or make calls to phones from your web apps simply by dragging<br />\nboxes around on your browser !</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The widget looks weird..</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feel free to change it. The jiw.css is packaged with the widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I learn more about Joget Workflow ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We always welcome new members to our growing community and hope that we can help you build cool stuff. Register and join our community of<br />\ndevelopers at http://dev.joget.org/community.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
