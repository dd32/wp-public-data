Now, plugin set charset to UTF-8.</li>\n<li>Added possibility to scale page.<br />\nI know (and some people wrote me about that), that functionality for changing font size works incorrectly.<br />\nIn fact, that works correctly, but only if you are using CSS REM or EM units (instead of pixels).<br />\nAccessibility spring just changing the font size of  element.<br />\nAfter research, I found a universal solution, and implement that in my plugin. Now, you can choose an approach that works better in your case &#8211; &#8220;Option to change font size&#8221; or &#8220;Option to scale page&#8221;. But I am still finding the best practice, and I hope that I will find the most universal solution for changing the size of text, even when your site is written with px, vh, %, pt, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Special thanks to Anton from CSR Technology and Peter Smith</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug when &#8220;handicap-icon&#8221; was displayed on wp-login page.</li>\n<li>Added the possibility to change the close button&#8217;s color on the plugin setting page.</li>\n<li>Added animation on hover to the buttons in the sidebar.</li>\n<li>Rewritten text in sidebar, when all options are disabled. Added link to console in text for faster access.</li>\n<li>Optimized space between some elements on plugin setting page. Control elements become a little bit compact.</li>\n<li>Added the fourth icon to the list of standard icons.</li>\n<li>Thanks for the feedback on this version to &#8220;elodiechatelais&#8221; and &#8220;Сергей Лебедев&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added message in the sidebar when all options are disabled in settings.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug when whole page content was put in the sidebar when all accessibility-options are disabled.</li>\n<li>Added possibility to set one of three icons for Accessibility sidebar.</li>\n<li>Improved validity of code.</li>\n<li>Added possibility to enter color not only in HEX, but using color names, like &#8220;red&#8221;, &#8220;pink&#8221;, etc.</li>\n<li>Changed default design of sidebar.</li>\n<li>Few small bugs were fixed too.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First version of plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n"
