        "faq": "\n<h4>Who can use Force SSL Site ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For anyone who has an SSL certificate installed on their site and wants to be sure all content is accessed (and redirected if needed) via a secure connection.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need an SSL certificate for this to work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you do need an SSL certificate regardless of the plugin you&#8217;re using. If you don&#8217;t have one try switching to a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/hosting/\" rel=\"ugc\">quality hosting provider</a> that provides and installs free certificates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where and how can I get an SSL certificate?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can buy an SSL certificate but we recommend getting one for free from Let&#8217;s Encrypt. The easiest way to get a free SSL certificate is to use a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/hosting/\" rel=\"ugc\">good hosting provider</a> that will automatically get an SSL certificate for you and install it. There&#8217;s nothing to configure, it&#8217;s just one click &#8211; they do everything for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>After activating Force Secure Siteplugin, do I need to do anything else?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, nothing. After activating Force Secure Site , the main option &#8220;redirect SSL&#8221; will already be active. What you can do is use our tool to test your SSL certificate, to make sure it works properly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
