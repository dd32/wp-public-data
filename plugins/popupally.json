        "description": "<p>If you&#8217;re looking to grow your list, then PopupAlly is the no-fluff free WordPress popup plugin for you. With built-in advanced features this lightbox popup plugin allows you to build your list as people are about to exit your website.</p>\n<p>Exit-intent popups allow you to capture lost visitors and have been shown to increase conversion by over 300%. <a href=\"https://popupally.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PopupAlly</a> allows you to create advanced popup signup forms in under 5 minutes, even if you don&#8217;t know code. PopupAlly&#8217;s visual editor allows you to customize the look-and-feel of your popups with an instant preview, saving you lots of time.</p>\n<p>Beyond popups, with PopupAlly you can also design an optin box that&#8217;s embedded anywhere on your site like in your sidebar, below your blog posts, or under your header as a horizontal opt-in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The AccessAlly Team does not monitor the WordPress.org forums for the free popup plugin, but you&#8217;ll find our <a href=\"https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/whats-the-difference-between-popupally-pro-and-the-free-version/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">extensive tutorials</a> will help you get started fast!</p>\n<p>Hands-on concierge email support is available to <a href=\"https://popupally.com?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PopupAlly Pro plugin</a> customers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://popupally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here</a> to see why we created the <a href=\"https://popupally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">premium version</a> with all of the extra feature requests we received! It&#8217;s even more intuitive and quick to design beautiful drag-and-drop customized popups and multiple types of embedded opt-ins, too. It&#8217;s well worth your investment!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>How PopupAlly Can Help You Build Your List Faster</h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the different features that make PopupAlly worth adding to your site&#8230; and the many ways that this free popup and optin box plugin can help you build a strong subscriber base.</p>\n<h4>Mobile Friendly Popups and Opt-in Forms</h4>\n<p>PopupAlly and PopupAlly Pro are both mobile responsive, which means that you don&#8217;t have to worry about bad user experience for those on tablets or mobile phones. With PopupAlly, each template comes in 3 sizes that are easily tweaked to look good on smaller screens.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://popupally.com?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PopupAlly Pro</a>, you can add an unlimited number of screen sizes, so if you wanted to show a totally different opt-in form or popup on a different device &#8211; you could do that!</p>\n<h4>Horizontal Opt-In Forms</h4>\n<p>Ever wanted to have a horizontal optin form across the top, bottom, or below the navigation section on your WordPress website? Now you can! With PopupAlly you can use the horizontal optin box template and have people joining your list without taking up a ton of real estate on your site.</p>\n<p>Plus, PopupAlly is compatible with any theme &#8211; so it will look good and fit with your existing set up.</p>\n<h4>Time Delay and Exit-Intent Popups</h4>\n<p>Not sure about using a popup on your site? With PopupAlly, you can choose when a popup appears&#8230; whether it&#8217;s after a certain amount of time of your site, or right before someone is about to leave.</p>\n<p>The exit intentionality feature is extremely effective, because it doesn&#8217;t interrupt your readers and visitors but it helps you capture their attention and their email address, before it&#8217;s too late!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why PopupAlly Should Be The Popup Plugin You Choose</strong><br />\n  &#8220;PopupAlly should be THE popup that people install. It&#8217;s so much nicer and less intrusive than all of the other popups I&#8217;ve seen&#8230; even on big name sites. They should totally have PopupAlly instead of the one they have!&#8221;¬ù &#8211; Davina Fear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Why You Should Consider Upgrading to PopupAlly Pro</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been using our free PopupAlly plugin, then you already love the awesome exit intent functionality and the ability to create popups as well as embedded opt-ins&#8230; and you might be wondering what&#8217;s included in our premium version to justify the upgrade?</p>\n<p>We have a full side by side comparison of the two versions <a href=\"https://popupally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>On top of the incredibly flexible drag-and-drop design templates that allow you to customize your opt-ins to your heart&#8217;s content&#8230; we&#8217;ve also included new ways to customize the user experience.</p>\n<p>You can create mini-surveys, have unlimited opt-ins, more polite popups, and much more. <a href=\"https://popupally.com/upgrading-to-popupally-pro/?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to find out why you should consider the upgrade</a>.

PopupAlly helps you create sign up forms that collect names and emails. Your email marketing automation platform stores the email addresses, and allows you to send a welcome sequence as well as regular newsletters to your subscribers. PopupAlly does not send emails directly to your subscribers.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have an email platform yet, here are some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://accessally.com/aaconvertkit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ConvertKit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://accessally.com/active-campaign\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ActiveCampaign</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://accessally.com/drip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Drip</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://accessally.com/infusionsoft\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Infusionsoft</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://accessally.com/ontraport\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ontraport</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nathalielussier.com/mailchimp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MailChimp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nathalielussier.com/aweber\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AWeber</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Not sure how to choose between these options?

Normally, you do not want to popup to show up every time a visitor comes to your website, so this option will stop the popup from showing up for [x] number of days. However, this makes testing difficult. The good news is that there are many ways to get around it. Please see the <a href=\"https://kb.accessally.com/tutorials/popupally-not-working-here-are-some-troubleshooting-tips/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tutorial</a> for more details!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20done%20everything%20according%20to%20the%20tutorials%2C%20but%20the%20popup%20is%20not%20showing%20up%21'>\nI have done everything according to the tutorials, but the popup is not showing up!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are 3 main causes for this:<br />\n* With &#8220;Show for all pages?&#8221; checked in Display Settings, please make sure you do NOT check &#8220;All Pages&#8221; and &#8220;All Posts&#8221; under &#8220;Except for these posts/pages&#8221;<br />\n* Javascript errors will prevent popups from showing. With the page loaded, you can open the Developer View in Chrome and look for the red error sign. The error is usually caused by another plugin, so you can disable the active plugins one-by-one to see if that helps.<br />\n* It could be a theme issue.

With built-in advanced features this lightbox popup plugin allows you to build your list as people are about to exit your website.</p>\n<p>Exit-intent popups allow you to capture lost visitors and have been shown to increase conversion by over 300%. <a href=\"https://popupally.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PopupAlly</a> allows you to create advanced popup signup forms in under 5 minutes, even if you don&#8217;t know code.

With PopupAlly, each template comes in 3 sizes that are easily tweaked to look good on smaller screens.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://popupally.com?utm_source=wordpressdirectory&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_campaign=popupallypro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PopupAlly Pro</a>, you can add an unlimited number of screen sizes, so if you wanted to show a totally different opt-in form or popup on a different device &#8211; you could do that!</p>\n<h4>Horizontal Opt-In Forms</h4>\n<p>Ever wanted to have a horizontal optin form across the top, bottom, or below the navigation section on your WordPress website? Now you can! With PopupAlly you can use the horizontal optin box template and have people joining your list without taking up a ton of real estate on your site.</p>\n<p>Plus, PopupAlly is compatible with any theme &#8211; so it will look good and fit with your existing set up.</p>\n<h4>Time Delay and Exit-Intent Popups</h4>\n<p>Not sure about using a popup on your site? With PopupAlly, you can choose when a popup appears&#8230; whether it&#8217;s after a certain amount of time of your site, or right before someone is about to leave.</p>\n<p>The exit intentionality feature is extremely effective, because it doesn&#8217;t interrupt your readers and visitors but it helps you capture their attention and their email address, before it&#8217;s too late!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Why PopupAlly Should Be The Popup Plugin You Choose</strong><br />\n  &#8220;PopupAlly should be THE popup that people install. It&#8217;s so much nicer and less intrusive than all of the other popups I&#8217;ve seen&#8230; even on big name sites.
