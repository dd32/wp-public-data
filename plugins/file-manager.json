Readable volumes not available.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check your file permission from your hosting panel. The permission must be 0755 for file/folder, this means the path you have set must be readable by php process. If you are using a vps(virtual private server) then you must ensure that the owner of your installation is PHP aka www-data. Another reason could be wrong root folder path/url. Inserting a correct root folder path/URL should fix the issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%20not%20upload%20larger%20files%20then%202%20mb'>\nI can not upload larger files then 2 MB\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can upload any size of file.

It is very easy. Just right click on the file and you will see a menu named **Change Mode **. Clicking will open a dialogue box, where you can update the file permission, just like cPanel.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20edit%20file%20using%20code%20editor'>\nIs it possible to edit file using code editor\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, It is possible to edit writeable files in the wordpress directory using code editor.
