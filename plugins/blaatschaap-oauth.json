        "description": "<p>The OAuth plugin for WordPress allows you to provide authentication against any<br />\nOAuth provider. This plugin is uses the OAuth library by Manuel Lemos. The<br />\nplugin allows the admin to select any from the services supported<br />\nout-of-the-box by the said library. Additionally it is possible to configure a<br />\nservice manually, which means any site supporting the OAuth protocol can<br />\nbe used.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Plugins are usually installed through the WordPress admin panel, which is<br />\nan automated process. If manual installation is desired, extract the archive<br />\nand upload the files and directories to<br />\n/path/to/your/webroot/wp-content/plugins/</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>0.4.5:<br />\nUpdate of 3rd party components</p>\n<p>0.4.4:<br />\nMajor rewrite. Much of the code in this release was intended to be released<br />\nonly with version 0.5. However, the issues discovered leading to the 0.4.3<br />\nrelease made me decided to create a release before the rewrite was completely<br />\ndone. This version should work reliable on all supported OAuth services. At<br />\nthis point, not all services can be supported. Pre-configured services are<br />\nFacebook, github, Google, Linkedin Microsoft, and Twitter. Other services<br />\ncan be configured manually, but at the moment only those that use a flat<br />\ndata structure. Nested data structures will be supported in a future release.<br />\nData migration for earlier releases is included, but at this moment limited<br />\nto Facebook, github, Google, Linkedin Microsoft, and Twitter.</p>\n<p>0.4.3:<br />\nDatabase query fix. $wpdb-&gt;prepare was called with %d and a string as<br />\nparameter. This error conceiled a number of other bugs. Any version<br />\nprior to this release is considered unreliable. Due a design flaw any<br />\nrelease only works with few providers. Known to work are Twitter and github.</p>\n<p>0.4.2:<br />\nBugfixes in the Registration and Linking code.</p>\n<p>No more PHP notices when WordPress is running in DEBUG mode.</p>\n<p>When a user is deleted from WordPress, also delete the user&#8217;s OAuth sessions<br />\nfrom the database.</p>\n<p>0.4.1:<br />\nBugfix: the sort order of the buttons was ignored.</p>\n<p>0.4:<br />\nStructural rewrite to support multiple authentication frameworks. This<br />\nis a preparation for planned plugins to support OpenID 2.0 and BrowserID.</p>\n<p>Fixes for the registration using an OAuth provider. In previous versions<br />\nsigning up using an OAuth provider was not working properly. Also<br />\nimproved linking code.</p>\n<p>Added logos for some OAuth services, logos included in this release are<br />\nbitbucket, bitly, dropbox, etsy, facebook, flickr, github, google,<br />\nlinkedin, meetup, microsoft, paypal, tumblr, twitter, vimeo, vk,<br />\nwordpress, xing, yahoo, yandex.</p>\n<p>0.3.6 :</p>\n<p>Bugfix release: options page not found message fixed. This error<br />\n  occured in the General Auth Settings page upon saving. This resulted<br />\n  that the pages for login/link/register could not be set.</p>\n<p>0.3.5 :</p>\n<p>Bugfix: Previous versions allowed a logged in user to link to an already<br />\n        linked service.</p>\n<p>Field for configuring OAuth services are wider.<br />\nStarted rewrite to abstract generic Authorisation code, to allow future support<br />\nfor other Authorisation methods</p>\n<p>0.3 :</p>\n<p>Rewritten button code. It no longer uses &#8220;CSS3 Social Sign-in Buttons by<br />\nNicolas Gallagher&#8221;.<br />\nYou can now upload your own logos. Adding custom CSS is also possible.</p>\n<p>0.2 :</p>\n<p>Bugfix: BlaatSchaap Plugins Overview page was missing, and displayed an<br />\n        error message when trying to access it.</p>\n<p>Synchronised with the OAuth library. The library uses an external<br />\nconfiguration file now. This configuration file is parsed and all<br />\nnew services are listed.</p>\n<p>0.1 :</p>\n<p>Initial release</p>\n"
