You must put the same category filter as the filter id you need. Every item with the category will be filtered by the filter with the same filter id.</p>\n<p>Example: you can filter Animals, which has the filter id &#8216;animals&#8217;. You must use this word &#8216;animals&#8217; in the items in the category filter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20want%20to%20use%20the%20image'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t want to use the image\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can remove the default image and use the background color, which you can choose on the tab Styles -&gt; Items.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20is%20responsive'>\nIs the plugin is responsive\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can make different changes for desktop, tablet and mobile</p>\n</p>\n\n",
