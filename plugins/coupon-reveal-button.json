You don&#8217;t need no coding or programming skills to help. We need help with translation for following languages: Russian, Persian, Hindi, Spanish, German, Vietnamese, Swedish is what we need the most. Having a translatable dashboard will make the plugin easier to use for a lot of people. Leaving feedback is valuable help as well!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20having%20issues%20with%20ad-blocker'>\nI&#8217;m Having issues with Ad-blocker\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are having issues with ad-blocking then we recommend that you disable the target=&#8221;_blank feature&#8221;. You can also try talking with your affiliate vendor, perhaps it&#8217;s an issue with the affiliate link you have. No matter which sort of voucher or offer code you insert, it shouldn&#8217;t have any effect for ad block extensions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20coupon%20code%20reveal%20buttons%20work%20with%20all%20wordpress%20plugins%20and%20themes%3F'>\nDoes coupon code reveal buttons work with all WordPress plugins and themes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin works with BuddyPress, Easy Digital Downloads, Pop ups, Twitter Card Meta for WordPress, WordPress Exit Intent Popup, Email Pop Up, Inline Contact Form Builder – Poptin, Ads Manager, Ali Dropship,  Marketpress, MemberPress, Membership 2 Pro, WishList Member, WooCommerce Autoship, WP EasyCart, WPPayForms, WP Simple Pay Pro, S2Member, bbPress, WooCommerce eCommerce, Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, AFC, Multisite, Themify Builder, Brizy, Visual Page Builder, Live Composer, Oxygen, Visual Composer, Page Builder by SiteOrigin, WP Page Builder, Gutenberg (The WordPress 5.0 page editor) and GeneratePress. We try to update the plugin so it works with all drag and drop page builder plugins. The plugin works with all WordPress themes with page builders integrated too.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20as%20checkout%20button%20on%20my%20woocommerce%20store%3F'>\nCan I use this as checkout button on my Woocommerce store?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That requires custom code, we recommend that you use it to give your users a rebate through your blog, but we don&#8217;t have an option so it replaces the Woocommerce checkout button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20on%20all%20browsers%20and%20devices%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work on all browsers and devices?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we have tested this plugin on following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11+, Opera and Safari. The plugin is responsive, it works on every tablet, mobile phone and desktop computer such as iPhone and Android.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20if%20i%20have%20a%20promotion%20on%20my%20own%20website%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin if I have a promotion on my own website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a click to reveal, if you want your users to visit a certain link to view current discounts or vouchers then sure. It&#8217;s not intended to be used for that, but you its compatible. We created this plugin as an affiliate tool so you can link to your vendors and display a voucher on-click. There is nothing that stops you from being creative and use it for other purposes though.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20increase%20my%20website%20traffic%3F'>\nWill this plugin increase my website traffic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the code is W3C valid and search engine optimized. It won&#8217;t harm your SEO, but it adding this plugin is not equal to doing SEO optimization on your website, for that we recommend plugins such as Yoast, W3 Cache and WP Rocket. This plugin won&#8217;t get you in trouble with Google, it&#8217;s not a Blackhat SEO to use hidden text, we are doing with Javascript so it&#8217;s not with display none, that ensures that Google see that you are not trying to do keyword stuffing. <strong>This plugin is whitehat and will not affect your search engine optimization (SEO) in any way.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20coupon%20code%20reveal%20button%20work%20with%20all%20affiliate%20programs%3F'>\nDoes Coupon Code Reveal Button work with all affiliate programs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can use all sort of affiliate links popular affiliate programs such as Amazon Associate, AdSense, Shareasale, Clickbank, eBay, Wallmart, BestBuy, Commission Junction, Envato, Impact, all gambling and sport betting affiliate programs or CJ.
