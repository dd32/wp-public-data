It requires a Google Cloud Vision API key, which is free and can be acquired <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>. As of 2022, the first 1000 requests per month are free. If you need more that is between you and our Google overlords (i.e. you&#8217;ll need to give them your credit card).</p>\n<h3>Can I automatically smart crop all images at once?</h3>\n<p>Yes and no. You can load all of the eligible images in the tool by scrolling down until they&#8217;re all on the page, then selecting all and clicking &#8220;save and overwrite&#8221;. This long-running operation may time out, or you may run out of credits with Google. If so, just refresh the page and only the un-smart cropped images will be displayed. Good luck!</p>\n<h3>Is it Compatible With Image Optimization Plugins?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but you may need to recompress any smart cropped images. If a smart cropped image is derived from an image that is already compressed, it is likely to be fairly small anyway. TinyPNG keeps track of what images have changed after compression so you can recompress them. Smush and Shortpixel do not.</p>\n<h3>Is it Compatible with WebP?</h3>\n<p>Not yet. I plan to include automatic smart cropping of webp images in a future version.</p>\n<h3>Is it Compatible with Retina?</h3>\n<p>Not yet. I plan to include automatic smart cropping of retina images in a future version.</p>\n<h3>Can it automatically smart crop on image upload?</h3>\n<p>I have deliberately left out this feature to avoid conflict with other image plugins. I may add it later.</p>\n",
