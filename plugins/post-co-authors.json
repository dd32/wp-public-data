        "faq": "\n<h4>1) How do I add  Post Co-Authors support to my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin works on shortcode and is independent of any theme. You will just need to put a short code on the single.php or you can directly add in content area. Check installation steps for using shortcode of our plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2) What happens to posts and pages when I delete a user assigned to a post or page as a coauthor?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t affect the page anyhow when you delete it. It stores data as standard post meta so, you will not have to worry about deleting data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>3) Can I use Post Co-Authors with WordPress multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Certainly, you can use it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>4) Who needs permission to do what?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For now in version 1.1 we have common functionality for all users so, no permission is needed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>5) Can I easily create a list of all co-authors?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You dosen&#8217;t even have to create list of co-authors, all users are listed in the post types you select and wish to display for. Our plugin will list all wordpress authors,  editors and administrators for that post and you will have to select only names of required persons</p>\n</p>\n\n",
