        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Deactivate and uninstall any other caching plugin you may be using. Pay special attention if you have customized the rewrite rules for fancy permalinks, have previously installed a caching plugin or have any browser caching rules as W3TC will automate management of all best practices. Also make sure wp-content/ and wp-content/uploads/ (temporarily) have 777 permissions before proceeding, e.g. in the terminal: <code># chmod 777 /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/wp-content/</code> using your web hosting control panel or your FTP / SSH account.</li>\n<li>Login as an administrator to your WordPress Admin account. Using the &#8220;Add New&#8221; menu option under the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; section of the navigation, you can either search for: w3 total cache or if you&#8217;ve downloaded the plugin already, click the &#8220;Upload&#8221; link, find the .zip file you download and then click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;. Or you can unzip and FTP upload the plugin to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/). In either case, when done wp-content/plugins/w3-total-cache/ should exist.</li>\n<li>Locate and activate the plugin on the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; page. Page caching will <strong>automatically be running</strong> in basic mode. Set the permissions of wp-content and wp-content/uploads back to 755, e.g. in the terminal: <code># chmod 755 /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/wp-content/</code>.</li>\n<li>Now click the &#8220;Settings&#8221; link to proceed to the &#8220;General Settings&#8221; tab; in most cases, &#8220;disk enhanced&#8221; mode for page cache is a &#8220;good&#8221; starting point.</li>\n<li>The &#8220;Compatibility mode&#8221; option found in the advanced section of the &#8220;Page Cache Settings&#8221; tab will enable functionality that optimizes the interoperablity of caching with WordPress, is disabled by default, but highly recommended. Years of testing in hundreds of thousands of installations have helped us learn how to make caching behave well with WordPress. The tradeoff is that disk enhanced page cache performance under load tests will be decreased by ~20% at scale.</li>\n<li><em>Recommended:</em> On the &#8220;Minify Settings&#8221; tab, all of the recommended settings are preset. If auto mode causes issues with your web site&#8217;s layout, switch to manual mode and use the help button to simplify discovery of your CSS and JS files and groups. Pay close attention to the method and location of your JS group embeddings. See the plugin&#8217;s FAQ for more information on usage.</li>\n<li><em>Recommended:</em> On the &#8220;Browser Cache&#8221; tab, HTTP compression is enabled by default. Make sure to enable other options to suit your goals.</li>\n<li><em>Recommended:</em> If you already have a content delivery network (CDN) provider, proceed to the &#8220;Content Delivery Network&#8221; tab and populate the fields and set your preferences. If you do not use the Media Library, you will need to import your images etc into the default locations. Use the Media Library Import Tool on the &#8220;Content Delivery Network&#8221; tab to perform this task. If you do not have a CDN provider, you can still improve your site&#8217;s performance using the &#8220;Self-hosted&#8221; method. On your own server, create a subdomain and matching DNS Zone record; e.g. static.domain.com and configure FTP options on the &#8220;Content Delivery Network&#8221; tab accordingly. Be sure to FTP upload the appropriate files, using the available upload buttons.</li>\n<li><em>Optional:</em> On the &#8220;Database Cache&#8221; tab, the recommended settings are preset. If using a shared hosting account use the &#8220;disk&#8221; method with caution, the response time of the disk may not be fast enough, so this option is disabled by default. Try object caching instead for shared hosting.</li>\n<li><em>Optional:</em> On the &#8220;Object Cache&#8221; tab, all of the recommended settings are preset. If using a shared hosting account use the &#8220;disk&#8221; method with caution, the response time of the disk may not be fast enough, so this option is disabled by default. Test this option with and without database cache to ensure that it provides a performance increase.</li>\n<li><em>Optional:</em> On the &#8220;User Agent Groups&#8221; tab, specify any user agents, like mobile phones if a mobile theme is used.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20does%20speed%20matter%3F'>\nWhy does speed matter?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Search engines like Google, measure and factor in the speed of web sites in their ranking algorithm. When they recommend a site they want to make sure users find what they&#8217;re looking for quickly. So in effect you and Google should have the same objective.</p>\n<p>Speed is among the most significant success factors web sites face. In fact, your site&#8217;s speed directly affects your income (revenue) &mdash; it&#8217;s a fact. Some high traffic sites conducted research and uncovered the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google.com: <strong>+500 ms</strong> (speed decrease) -&gt; <strong>-20% traffic loss</strong> [<a href=\"http://home.blarg.net/~glinden/StanfordDataMining.2006-11-29.ppt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">1</a>]</li>\n<li>Yahoo.com: <strong>+400 ms</strong> (speed decrease) -&gt; <strong>-5-9% full-page traffic loss</strong> (visitor left before the page finished loading) [<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/yslow-20-presentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">2</a>]</li>\n<li>Amazon.com: <strong>+100 ms</strong> (speed decrease) -&gt; <strong>-1% sales loss</strong> [<a href=\"http://home.blarg.net/~glinden/StanfordDataMining.2006-11-29.ppt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">1</a>]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A thousandth of a second is not a long time, yet the impact is quite significant. Even if you&#8217;re not a large company (or just hope to become one), a loss is still a loss. W3 Total Cache is your solution for faster websites, happier visitors and better results.</p>\n<p>Many of the other consequences of poor performance were discovered more than a decade ago:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower perceived credibility (Fogg et al. 2001)</li>\n<li>Lower perceived quality (Bouch, Kuchinsky, and Bhatti 2000)</li>\n<li>Increased user frustration (Ceaparu et al. 2004)</li>\n<li>Increased blood pressure (Scheirer et al. 2002)</li>\n<li>Reduced flow rates (Novak, Hoffman, and Yung 200)</li>\n<li>Reduced conversion rates (Akamai 2007)</li>\n<li>Increased exit rates (Nielsen 2000)</li>\n<li>Are perceived as less interesting (Ramsay, Barbesi, and Preece 1998)</li>\n<li>Are perceived as less attractive (Skadberg and Kimmel 2004)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a number of <a href=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/psychology-web-performance/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">resources</a> that have been documenting the role of performance in success on the web, W3 Total Cache exists to give you a framework to tune your application or site without having to do years of research.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20w3%20total%20cache%20better%20than%20other%20caching%20solutions%3F'>\nWhy is W3 Total Cache better than other caching solutions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s a complete framework.</strong> Most cache plugins available do a great job at achieving a couple of performance gains. Total Cache is different because it remedies numerous performance reducing aspects of any web site. It goes farther than the basics, beyond merely reducing CPU usage (load) or bandwidth consumption for HTML pages. Equally important, the plugin requires no theme modifications, modifications to your .htaccess (mod_rewrite rules) or programming compromises to get started. Most importantly, it&#8217;s the only plugin designed to optimize all practical hosting environments small or large. The options are many and setup is easy.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20never%20heard%20of%20any%20of%20this%20stuff%3B%20my%20site%20is%20fine%2C%20no%20one%20complains%20about%20the%20speed.%20why%20should%20i%20install%20this%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve never heard of any of this stuff; my site is fine, no one complains about the speed. Why should I install this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Rarely do readers take the time to complain. They typically just stop browsing earlier than you&#8217;d prefer and may not return altogether. This is the only plugin specifically designed to make sure that all aspects of your site are as fast as possible. Google is placing more emphasis on the <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/site-speed-googles-next-ranking-factor-29793\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">speed of a site as a factor in rankings</a>; this plugin helps with that too.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in every web site owner&#8217;s best interest is to make sure that the performance of your site is not hindering its success.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20wordpress%20versions%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhich WordPress versions are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To use all features in the suite, a minimum of version WordPress 5.3 with PHP 7.2.5 is required. Earlier versions will benefit from our Media Library Importer to get them back on the upgrade path and into a CDN of their choosing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%27t%20minify%20work%20for%20me%3F'>\nWhy doesn&#8217;t minify work for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great question. W3 Total Cache uses several open source tools to attempt to combine and optimize CSS, JavaScript and HTML etc. Unfortunately some trial and error is required on the part of developers is required to make sure that their code can be successfully minified with the various libraries W3 Total Cache supports. Even still, if developers do test their code thoroughly, they cannot be sure that interoperability with other code your site may have. This fault does not lie with any single party here, because there are thousands of plugins and theme combinations that a given site can have, there are millions of possible combinations of CSS, JavaScript etc.</p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is to try auto mode, work with a developer to identify the code that is not compatible and start with combine only mode (the safest optimization) and increase the optimization to the point just before functionality (JavaScript) or user interface / layout (CSS) breaks in your site.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re always working to make this more simple and straight forward in future releases, but this is not an undertaking we can realize on our own.

Use Total Cache to accelerate your site by putting your content closer to your users with our many CDN integrations including Cloudflare, StackPath, AWS and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20an%20origin%20pull%20%28mirror%29%20cdn%3F'>\nHow do I use an Origin Pull (Mirror) CDN?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to your CDN providers control panel or account management area. Following any set up steps they provide, create a new &#8220;pull zone&#8221; or &#8220;bucket&#8221; for your site&#8217;s domain name. If there&#8217;s a set up wizard or any troubleshooting tips your provider offers, be sure to review them. In the CDN tab of the plugin, enter the hostname your CDN provider provided in the &#8220;replace site&#8217;s hostname with&#8221; field. You should always do a quick check by opening a test file from the CDN hostname, e.g. http://cdn.domain.com/favicon.ico. Troubleshoot with your CDN provider until this test is successful.</p>\n<p>Now go to the General tab and click the checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20configure%20amazon%20simple%20storage%20service%20%28amazon%20s3%29%20or%20amazon%20cloudfront%20as%20my%20cdn%3F'>\nHow do I configure Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon CloudFront as my CDN?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create an S3 account</a> (unless using origin pull); it may take several hours for your account credentials to be functional.

Now on the &#8220;Content Delivery Network Settings&#8221; tab enter your &#8220;Access key,&#8221; &#8220;Secret key&#8221; and enter a name (avoid special characters and spaces) for your bucket in the &#8220;Create a bucket&#8221; field by clicking the button of the same name. If using an existing bucket simply specify the bucket name in the &#8220;Bucket&#8221; field. Click the &#8220;Test S3 Upload&#8221; button and make sure that the test is successful, if not check your settings and try again. Save your settings.</p>\n<p>Unless you wish to use CloudFront, you&#8217;re almost done, skip to the next paragraph if you&#8217;re using CloudFront. Go to the &#8220;General Settings&#8221; tab and click the &#8220;Enable&#8221; checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality. Empty the cache for the changes to take effect. If preview mode is active you will need to &#8220;deploy&#8221; your changes for them to take effect.</p>\n<p>To use CloudFront, perform all of the steps above, except select the &#8220;Amazon CloudFront&#8221; &#8220;CDN type&#8221; in the &#8220;Content Delivery Network&#8221; section of the &#8220;General Settings&#8221; tab. When creating a new bucket, the distribution ID will automatically be populated. Otherwise, proceed to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AWS Management Console</a> and create a new distribution: select the S3 Bucket you created earlier as the &#8220;Origin,&#8221; enter a <a href=\"http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?CNAMEs.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CNAME</a> if you wish to add one or more to your DNS Zone. Make sure that &#8220;Distribution Status&#8221; is enabled and &#8220;State&#8221; is deployed.

For example, if your site used to be www.domain.com, and you decided to change it to domain.com, the result would either be many &#8220;broken&#8221; images or many unnecessary redirects (which slow down the visitor&#8217;s browsing experience). You can use this tool to correct this and similar cases. Correcting the URLs of your images also allows the plugin to do a better job of determining which images are actually hosted with the CDN.</p>\n<p>As always, it never hurts to back up your database first.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20comptatible%20with%20tdo%20mini%20forms%3F'>\nIs this plugin comptatible with TDO Mini Forms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Captcha and recaptcha will work fine, however you will need to prevent any pages with forms from being cached.

        "0.9.2.9": "<p>Thanks for using W3 Total Cache! This release addresses security issues for Cloudflare users as well as users that implement fragment caching via the mfunc functionality. For those using mfunc, temporarily disable page caching to allow yourself time to check the FAQ tab for new usage instructions; if you have a staging environment, that is the most convenient way to test prior to production roll out.</p>",
        "0.9.2.8": "<p>Thanks for using W3 Total Cache! The recent releases attempted to use WordPress&#039; built in support for managing files and folders and clearly has not worked. Since W3TC is a caching plugin, file management is a critical issue that will cause lots of issues if it doesn&#039;t work perfectly. This release is hopefully the last attempt to restore file management back to the reliability of previous versions (0.9.2.4 etc). We realize that having <em>any</em> problems is not acceptable, but caching means changing server behavior, so while this plugin is still in pre-release we&#039;re trying to focus on learning.</p>"
