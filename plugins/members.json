        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20was%20this%20plugin%20created%3F'>\nWhy was this plugin created?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the current user, role, and permissions plugins available.  Yes, some of them are good, but nothing fit what I had in mind perfectly.  Some offered few features.  Some worked completely outside of the WordPress APIs.  Others lacked the GPL license.</p>\n<p>So, I just built something I actually enjoyed using.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nHow do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most things should be fairly straightforward, but we&#8217;ve included an in-depth guide in the plugin download.  It&#8217;s a file called <code>readme.md</code> in the plugin folder.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/caseproof/members/blob/master/readme.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">view the readme</a> online.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='minimum%20php%20requirements.'>\nMinimum PHP requirements.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Members now requires PHP 5.6+</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20access%20the%20%22role%20manager%22%20features.'>\nI can&#8217;t access the &#8220;Role Manager&#8221; features.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the plugin is first activated, it runs a script that sets specific capabilities to the &#8220;Administrator&#8221; role on your site that grants you access to this feature.  So, you must be logged in with the administrator account to access the role manager.</p>\n<p>If, for some reason, you do have the administrator role and the role manager is still inaccessible to you, deactivate the plugin.  Then, reactivate it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='on%20multisite%2C%20why%20can%27t%20administrators%20manage%20roles%3F'>\nOn multisite, why can&#8217;t administrators manage roles?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have a multisite installation, only Super Admins can create, edit, and delete roles by default.  This is a security measure to make sure that you absolutely trust sub-site admins to make these types of changes to roles.  If you&#8217;re certain you want to allow this, add the Create Roles (<code>create_roles</code>), Edit Roles (<code>edit_roles</code>), and/or Delete Roles (<code>delete_roles</code>) capabilities to the role on each sub-site where you want to allow this.</p>\n<p><em>Note: This change was made in version 2.0.2 and has no effect on existing installs of Members on existing sub-sites.</em></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='help%21%20i%27ve%20locked%20myself%20out%20of%20my%20site%21'>\nHelp! I&#8217;ve locked myself out of my site!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please read the documentation for the plugin before actually using it, especially a plugin that controls permissions for your site.  We cannot stress this enough.  This is a powerful plugin that allows you to make direct changes to roles and capabilities in the database.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to stop by our <a href=\"https://memberpress.com/plugins/members/support/?utm_source=members_plugin&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=readme&amp;utm_content=support_page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support forums</a> to see if we can get your site fixed if you managed to lock yourself out.  I know that this can be a bit can be a bit scary, but it&#8217;s not that tough to fix with a little custom code.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
