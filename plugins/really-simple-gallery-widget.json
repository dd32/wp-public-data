        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Really Simple Gallery Widget is most easily installed automatically via the Plugins tab in your blog administration panel.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>really-simple-gallery-widget</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Head over to Appearance &rarr; Widgets to set up one or more Really Simple Gallery Widgets</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this work with the new-style galleries introduced in WP 3.5?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the time being, galleries that use the ids parameter (similar to the already-existing include parameter) will not influence the widget unless you copy-paste the list of IDs and use the Attachment IDs option. Old style galleries that would just use the <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode will work as expected, as will images attached/uploaded to a post. This has to do with how attachments work in WordPress, which is the basis for this plugin. New-style galleries no longer depend on attachments to a specific post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t images I&#8217;ve hotlinked or copy-pasted into my content appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This widget can only grab images that were uploaded into your Media Library. See the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Image_and_File_Attachments#Attachment_to_a_Post\" title=\"WordPress Codex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Codex</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is the wrong kind of link being used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The image is probably not associated with a post or page and will default to linking to the file if a link option is chosen. To associate (attach) an image with a post or page, go to your Media Library and click on the Unattached link next to the item to choose a post to attach it to. See the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Image_and_File_Attachments#Attachment_to_a_Post\" title=\"WordPress Codex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Codex</a> for more information. The link behavior can be altered via filter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get the ID for the post or page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way is to mouseover or click an edit link for the post or page in question. The ID number will appear in the URL; e.g. <code>http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=41&amp;action=edit</code> indicates that the ID of the post or page you want to reference is 41.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is the anchor link not working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The anchor link relies on the ID that WordPress automatically generates when you insert an image with a caption. If you inserted the image manually or without a caption, the anchor won&#8217;t jump you to the spot in the page. The ability to specify an anchor may be added at a later time, or you can just add the ID (attachment_##) to the img tag.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I selected a registered size but the images are showing up huge or in the wrong size.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The images may be missing the thumbnails of that size and by default will pull the full size image instead. Try using Viper007Bond&#8217;s fantastic <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" title=\"Regenerate Thumbnails\" rel=\"ugc\">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> plugin to create new versions for any new or changed image sizes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I make the widget look prettier?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://helen.wordpress.com/2011/02/styling-the-really-simple-gallery-widget/\" title=\"Styling the Really Simple Gallery Widget\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Styling the Really Simple Gallery Widget</a> for more information and some examples of what you might do.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
