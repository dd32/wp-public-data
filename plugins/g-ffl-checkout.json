        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20this%20plugin%20better%20than%20the%20alternatives%3F'>\nWhy is this plugin better than the alternatives?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was built by a FFL, actively used by that FFL. I know what the industry needs, especially those first starting out with smaller budgets.</li>\n<li>The data services are built on state-of-the-art cloud-based technologies hosted on Amazon Web Services. This basically means that downtime will be minimal, and performance will be consistent.</li>\n<li>The plugin doesn&#8217;t require a Google Maps API key, which adds additional cost and complexity to the installation process of other plugins</li>\n<li>We maintain a database of signed FFL copies for dealers that perform transfers. While its still your responsibility to ensure that the firearms your mailing go to a willing and able transfer FFL, having these FFL&#8217;s on file and available for download is a big time saver in the fulfillment process</li>\n<li>The Order Details page provides you the ability to Upload FFL&#8217;s and also quickly check the ATF ezCheck site for the FFL the customer selected during checkout</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20flag%20a%20product%20as%20ffl%20required%3F'>\nHow do I flag a product as FFL required?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin provides two tools to do this, first you can check the &#8220;Requires FFL Shipment&#8221; checkbox on each individual product. This is located in the product data section. Secondly, on the main products list you can check 1-to-many products and use the bulk actions to set them all as FFL required products. In addition to these features, there is also a way to programmatically set products as FFL required. If you have questions about this option, please reach out to us.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",

There is an indicator in the list as to whether or not we have the signed copy of the FFL on file. If it's green, we do... otherwise it's red.
