On older installs, upgrading does not add the key, so this plugin was written to add the key transparently, or change the key.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are there any special requirements?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is not needed on older blogs (before 2.5). Also, brand new installs will add the key automatically, so it&#8217;s only needed then if you wish to change the key periodically.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where can I read more?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visit http://ActiveBlogging.com/info/how-to-change-wordpress-secret_key-plugin/</p>\n"
