You may also specify one of the supported languages by using the lang parameter &#8211; [code lang=&#8221;PHP&#8221;][/code]</p>\n<h4>How do I enable/disable line numbers?</h4>\n<p>Under the settings menu click on the Syntax Highlighter link. From there either select &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; to the Line Numbers option.</p>\n<h4>Characters are being converted to their HTML entities</h4>\n<p>This is because you have entered your code in Visual mode. You must enter your code in HTML mode.</p>\n<h4>This plugin breaks my XHTML validation.</h4>\n<p>This plugin encapsulates code using div tags. Div is a block element and cannot be placed inside an inline element. This is probably causing your validation to break. If you place [code] tags inline, you are placing them inside a</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>p&gt; which is an inline element. This causes your validation to break. Therefor you must place [code] tags on a line by itself. For example: BAD     This is hello world in PHP: [code][/code] GOOD     This is hello world in PHP:<br />\n    [code][/code]</p>\n"
