(If you want to search and add Pro icons in the Icon Chooser, you&#8217;ll need to use a Pro Kit.)</p>\n<p>Or you can <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">use the icon names in shortcodes or HTML</a>. When you use shortcodes, you add the name of the icon and a prefix, where <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the prefix is the style of icon</a> you want to use. Note that you don’t need to include the <code>fa-</code> part of the name. And if you don’t include any prefix, the icon will default to the Solid style.</p>\n<p>The shortcode for an icon looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[icon name=\"stroopwafel\"]\n\n[icon name=\"stroopwafel\" prefix=\"fal\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Get the details on all the shortcode options in the <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/wordpress#add-icons\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome WordPress docs</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also use basic HTML with <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">standard Font Awesome syntax</a>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;i class=\"fas fa-stroopwafel\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Using Pro Icons and Features</strong><br />\nTo use a Kit, create a <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/kits\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Kit on FontAwesome.com</a> and select &#8220;Pro icons&#8221; in the settings. Then grab your <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/account#api-tokens\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API Token from your Font Awesome account page</a> to add into the WordPress Kit settings.</p>\n<p>To add Pro icons with the CDN, you&#8217;ll need to add your domain to the list allowed domains on your <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/account/cdn\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome account CDN Settings page</a> and use shortcodes or HTML to add the icons into your content.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the Icon Chooser, you&#8217;ll need to use a Pro Kit. (The CDN can only search and add Free icons &#8211; use shortcodes or HTML to add Pro icons when using the CDN).</p>\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting with the Plugin</strong><br />\nFont Awesome icons are popular, so lots of themes and plugins also load Font Awesome, and sometimes their version can conflict with yours. So we created a way to help you find and prevent those conflicting versions from affecting your icons: <strong>The Conflict Detection Scanner</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the plugin seems to be set up correctly and your icons still aren’t loading and you&#8217;re not sure why, head over to the Troubleshoot tab, which has two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Detect Conflicts with Other Versions of Font Awesome</em> &#8211; which lets you start the conflict detection scanner to find versions of Font Awesome loading on your site.</li>\n<li><em>Versions of Font Awesome Active on Your Site</em> &#8211; which shows the results of the scanner and lets  you prevent any conflicting versions from loading other versions of Font Awesome on your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get more information about using the scanner for troubleshooting on the <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/wordpress#troubleshooting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome WordPress docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Configuring</h4>\n<p>The plugin is set to serve Font Awesome Free icons as a Web Font via the Font Awesome CDN by default. You can change the CDN settings right in the plugin. If you want just the basic Free icons, you probably don&#8217;t need to make any changes to the default configuration.</p>\n<p>You can get more information about all the available settings and troubleshooting on the <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome WordPress docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Upgrading from the Old Versions</h4>\n<p>If you used the old plugin or are still using Version 3 of Font Awesome, we&#8217;ve tried to smooth the upgrade path for you by keeping <code>[icon]</code> shortcode compatibility for Font Awesome 3 names used with the old plugin. But we plan to remove version 3 naming support from this plugin soon so don&#8217;t wait too long to update your code!</p>\n<h3>See Also</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/wordpress-fontawesome/blob/master/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">README</a> on GitHub has details for WordPress site owners and developers.</p>\n<p>And there are <a href=\"https://fortawesome.github.io/wordpress-fontawesome/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API docs</a> for developers.</p>\n",

        "changelog": "<h4>4.5.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the Icon Chooser to support all available family styles for the active version of<br />\nFont Awesome. The available family styles are dynamically loaded so that when new<br />\nfamily styles are introduced in new versions of Font Awesome, they will be immediately<br />\navailable in the Icon Chooser.</li>\n<li>Make the Icon Chooser available in the Full Site Editor.</li>\n<li>Change the format of some network requests in order to accommodate common Web Application<br />\nFirewall settings. This resolves a common cause of error messages, such as:<br />\n&#8220;Something has gone horribly wrong&#8221; in the Icon Chooser, or &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t save those changes&#8221; on<br />\nthe plugin&#8217;s settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the Icon Chooser to fix the use of Sharp Solid in more recent versions of Font Awesome,<br />\nand include Sharp Regular and Sharp Light.</li>\n<li>Add the &#8220;defer&#8221; attribute to script tags when in &#8220;Use a Kit&#8221; mode. This was already the behavior<br />\nunder &#8220;Use CDN&#8221; mode.</li>\n<li>Fix some deprecation notices for php 8.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Fix: escape shortcode attribute values.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase network request timeout to accommodate some slow-running Icon Chooser searches.<br />\nWe&#8217;ve recently added some new functionality to the Font Awesome API server. We&#8217;re in<br />\nthe process of optimizing it for performance. In the meantime, some icon searches that<br />\nreturn lots of search results are running slowly. Increasing the timeout<br />\nallows those searches to run longer before considering it an error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce support for Sharp Solid.<br />\nThe Icon Chooser now includes Sharp Solid among the available styles when using<br />\na Font Awesome Pro Kit.</li>\n<li>Introduce support for WordPress multisite. Allows installing the plugin network-wide<br />\nand configuring each site separately.<br />\nPrevious versions of this plugin were not compatible with multisite, though it was<br />\npossible to install and get partial functionality on multisite. However, this<br />\ncould also result in a confusing database state. If you&#8217;re running multisite,<br />\nit&#8217;s important that any installation of a previous plugin version is totally cleaned<br />\nup before trying to install this version. Upgrading on multisite without cleaning up<br />\nfirst will probably result in an error. A previous installation can usually be<br />\ncleaned up by deactivating and uninstalling it. Uninstall must be done by clicking<br />\n&#8220;Delete&#8221; on the deactivated plugin&#8217;s entry in the plugin list in the admin dashboard.<br />\nIt may also work to install the previous 4.2.0 version and then uninstall it, just<br />\nto get its cleanup code to run.<br />\nThis has no impact on sites that are not running in multisite mode. If you&#8217;re not<br />\nrunning multisite, upgrading to this version should be smooth and problem-free.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make Font Awesome 6 the default version on new activations.</li>\n<li>On the version selection dropdown, distinguish between the latest 5.x and the latest 6.x.</li>\n<li>Maintenance updates to JavaScript dependencies.</li>\n<li>Developers: the latest_version() method has been deprecated and replaced by two alternatives:<br />\nlatest_version_5() and latest_version_6().</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplified upgrade logic: makes the upgrade process on the first page load<br />\nafter upgrade quicker and smoother.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for using Font Awesome Version 6 Free with CDN. In order to use<br />\nVersion 6 Pro with this plugin, it&#8217;s still necessary to use a Kit,<br />\nsince Version 6 Pro is not available on the classic CDN.</li>\n<li>Renamed the &#8220;Version 4 Compatibility&#8221; option as &#8220;Older Version Compatibility&#8221;,<br />\nsince compatibility features may now involve both Version 4 and Version 5.</li>\n<li>Updated version of the conflict detection script used when configured for CDN.</li>\n<li>FIX: in some cases, when running the conflict detector on the back end,<br />\nthere was an error about an undefined variable called $should_enable_icon_chooser.<br />\nFixed.</li>\n<li>FIX: in some cases, when running php 8.0 or higher, there was an error related to<br />\ncalling method_exists(). Fixed.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> The v4_compatibility() method has been deprecated and will be removed<br />\nin a future release. It&#8217;s now just compatibility().</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> The preference named &#8220;v4Compat&#8221; in the array argument to the register()<br />\nmethod has been deprecated and renamed &#8220;compat&#8221;. Any uses of &#8220;v4Compat&#8221; are automatically<br />\ntranslated to &#8220;compat&#8221;.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> There are no breaking changes. Any code that uses the above deprecated<br />\nfeatures will continue to work the same without modification in this release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: add hash values to JavaScript chunk file names to resolve the problem where<br />\nsometimes an old cached version of a JavaScript file would load in the browser<br />\ninstead of the intended updated one. This caused some users to see a blank<br />\nsettings page after upgrading from a previous version of the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: When in the Classic Editor in WordPress 5, do not load block editor<br />\nscript dependencies that assign to the global wp.editor object.<br />\nThis prevents problems with other plugins on the page that may depend on that<br />\nglobal.</li>\n<li>FIX: When in the Classic Editor where multiple editor instances are present,<br />\nensure that the Add Font Awesome media button on each is wired up to<br />\nload the Icon Chooser on click, not just those buttons that were on the page<br />\nat the time this plugin&#8217;s initialization code is run.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: re-enable the Icon Chooser in the Classic Editor on WordPress 4.</li>\n<li>FIX: in some cases where the path to the plugin was a non-standard<br />\nlocation&#8211;such as when installed via composer&#8211;the admin settings page and<br />\nIcon Chooser would not load correctly. Fixed.</li>\n<li>FIX: the global version of the lodash JavaScript library was again being overwritten<br />\nby the version used by this plugin. Fixed.</li>\n<li>The Icon Chooser&#8217;s integration with the Block Editor (Gutenberg) has been disabled<br />\nfor WordPress 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3, due to incomptabile JavaScript libraries.<br />\nAll other features of the plugin work normally on those versions, including<br />\nIcon Chooser integration with the Classic Editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: In scenarios where both Gutenberg (Block) and TinyMCE (Classic)<br />\neditors were being loaded onto the same page, the Gutenberg editor was not<br />\ndisplaying properly.<br />\nNow, in that multi-editor situation, the Icon Chooser integration is only enabled<br />\nfor the block editor.<br />\nIn those cases, you can still use icon shortcodes or HTML in<br />\nthe TinyMCE editor boxes; those editors just won&#8217;t have the &#8220;Add Font Awesome&#8221;<br />\nmedia button for opening the Icon Chooser.<br />\nThe Icon Chooser is still available from the Classic Editor when the block editor<br />\nis not present on the page.</li>\n<li>FIX: In scenarios where there are multiple TinyMCE editor instances on the same page,<br />\nsuch as WooCommerce product editing pages, only the &#8220;Add Font Awesome&#8221; media<br />\nbutton on the first of those editors was working correctly. Now all of them work<br />\ncorrectly.</li>\n<li>FIX: In the Classic Editor, when other themes or plugins added media buttons after<br />\nthe &#8220;Add Font Awesome&#8221; button, those buttons were showing up as combined together<br />\nand not working properly. Now they&#8217;re separated and working great.</li>\n<li>The Icon Chooser integration for the Classic Editor in WordPress 4 has been temporarily<br />\ndisabled. Everything else works as before in WP4, just not the new Icon Chooser.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>OFFICIAL 4.0.0 STABLE RELEASE </li>\n<li>FEATURES: Includes all the features from the early 4.0.0 release candidates (details below)</li>\n<li>FEATURE: Visual icon chooser lets you search and easily insert the correct shortcode.</li>\n<li>Fixed regression on overriding global lodash version.</li>\n<li>Added PHP API method to get current Kit token.</li>\n<li>Removed the filter to process all shortcodes in widget text. This seems to have been<br />\nan overly eager approach on our part. If you want shortcodes to be processed<br />\nin widget text &#8211; all shortcodes, not just this plugin&#8217;s icon shortcode &#8211; you can<br />\nadd a line like this to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file:<br />\n  <code>add_filter( 'widget_text', 'do_shortcode' );</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc23</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>FIX: plugin now handles Kits with version &#8220;5.x&#8221; or &#8220;6.x&#8221;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FEATURE: shortcode supports attributes: style, role, title, aria-hidden,<br />\naria-label, aria-labelledby</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc22</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Metadata about available Font Awesome releases is now stored as a normal option<br />\nin the WordPress database, instead of as a transient. Thus, it does not expire<br />\nand does not disappear if the transient cache is purged.</p>\n<p>This is in part to avoid the scenario where a request to the Font Awesome API<br />\nserver may be required to refresh metadata in response to a front end page load<br />\nwhen that transient expires.</p>\n<p>Some site owners had occassionally experienced problems where a sudden burst of<br />\nrequests to the API server from many WordPress sites caused this plugin to fail<br />\nwhen making a request with an error like &#8216;An unexpected response was received<br />\nfrom the Font Awesome API server.&#8217; This change means that it is significantly<br />\nless likely that such a scenario will occur.<br />\n(Additionally, changes have been made on the API server, also making it<br />\nsignificantly less likely that this over-load failure will occur again.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Developers: the refresh_releases() API method has been deprecated to discourage<br />\nunnecessary blocking network requests to the API server.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc21</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>optimize normal page loads by loading much less metadata from the database (GitHub #96)</li>\n<li>move the Font Awesome settings link from the main admin nav menu back down under Settings, where it used to be</li>\n<li>update the version of the conflict detection script to one that also detects conflicting Kits</li>\n<li>minor maintenance changes to keep JavaScript dependencies up to date</li>\n<li>fix a bug involving the pseudo-elements setting when moving back and forth between using a Kit and using CDN (GitHub #82)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc20</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>developer-oriented update to support building themes that use this code as a composer package</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc19</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>another minor update with additional error logging</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc18</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>minor update with additional error logging</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0-rc17</h4>\n<p><strong>SECURITY:</strong> fixes a vulnerability in how API tokens were being stored, when configured to use a Kit. All users of 4.0.0-rc15 or 4.0.0-rc16 should update immediately.

Improves conflict detection, adds support for Kits and internationalization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Includes auto-upgrade logic so that most users can upgrade with no impact, except those that have &#8220;registered client&#8221; themes or plugins. Users who had previously enabled the &#8220;remove unregistered clients&#8221; option should verify that the auto-upgrade worked successfully &#8211; check that your icons are appearing correctly. If not, run the Conflict Scanner from the Troubleshoot tab.</li>\n<li>New conflict detection and resolution: The new conflict detection scanner can be enabled to more precisely discover conflicting versions of Font Awesome and provides more granular conflict resolution.</li>\n<li>Expanded error handling with detailed reports in the web console for more advanced diagnostics.</li>\n<li>Adds support for Kits.</li>\n<li>Adds comprehensive internationalization in both PHP and JavaScript.</li>\n<li>New design of the admin UI.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> Significant changes to the way the settings are handled internally: Font Awesome will always load in the way the WordPress admin chooses. Registered themes or plugins may register preferences (which are displayed to the admin), but the site admin will determine the configuration.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> Registered client plugins and themes need to be updated before they will work as expected.</li>\n<li><strong>Developers:</strong> The PHP API contains significant changes.

    "description": "<p>The official way to use Font Awesome Free or Pro icons on your site, brought to you by the Font Awesome team.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<p>Our official plugin lets you use Font Awesome the way you want:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Pro or Free icons.</li>\n<li>Leverage the latest release or a specific version of our icons.</li>\n<li>Choose the tech, either SVG or Web Font.</li>\n<li>Take your pick of loading your icons from our classic Font Awesome CDN, or use Font Awesome Kits &#8211; the easiest and most efficient way to use Font Awesome icons on the web.</li>\n<li>Turn on automatic compatibility for Font Awesome Version 4 if you &#8211; or your plugins &#8211; are still using Version 4 syntax.</li>\n<li>Troubleshoot and resolve issues when multiple versions of Font Awesome are loading on your site from other plugins/themes, which can cause unexpected icon display or technical issues.</li>\n<li>Make things even awesomer using icons from Font Awesome Version 6.</li>\n<li>Use your uploaded icons from your Pro Kits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Use</h3>\n<p><strong>Install and enable the plugin</strong><br />\n(See the Installation tab for details)</p>\n<p><strong>Add icons to your pages and posts</strong><br />\nAdding icons works in both the block editor and the classic editor.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve set up your plugin, you can search and add icons to your pages and posts by choosing the Font Awesome option in the format bar from any text block to open the Icon Chooser. (If you want to search and add Pro icons in the Icon Chooser, you&#8217;ll need to use a Pro Kit.)</p>\n<p>Or you can <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">use the icon names in shortcodes or HTML</a>. When you use shortcodes, you add the name of the icon and a prefix, where <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the prefix is the style of icon</a> you want to use. Note that you don’t need to include the <code>fa-</code> part of the name. And if you don’t include any prefix, the icon will default to the Solid style.</p>\n<p>The shortcode for an icon looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[icon name=\"stroopwafel\"]\n\n[icon name=\"stroopwafel\" prefix=\"fal\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Get the details on all the shortcode options in the <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/wordpress#add-icons\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome WordPress docs</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also use basic HTML with <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/referencing-icons/basic-use\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">standard Font Awesome syntax</a>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;i class=\"fas fa-stroopwafel\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Using Pro Icons and Features</strong><br />\nTo use a Kit, create a <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/kits\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Kit on FontAwesome.com</a> and select &#8220;Pro icons&#8221; in the settings. Then grab your <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/account#api-tokens\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API Token from your Font Awesome account page</a> to add into the WordPress Kit settings.</p>\n<p>To add Pro icons with the CDN, you&#8217;ll need to add your domain to the list allowed domains on your <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/account/cdn\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome account CDN Settings page</a> and use shortcodes or HTML to add the icons into your content.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the Icon Chooser, you&#8217;ll need to use a Pro Kit. (The CDN can only search and add Free icons &#8211; use shortcodes or HTML to add Pro icons when using the CDN).</p>\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting with the Plugin</strong><br />\nFont Awesome icons are popular, so lots of themes and plugins also load Font Awesome, and sometimes their version can conflict with yours. So we created a way to help you find and prevent those conflicting versions from affecting your icons: <strong>The Conflict Detection Scanner</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the plugin seems to be set up correctly and your icons still aren’t loading and you&#8217;re not sure why, head over to the Troubleshoot tab, which has two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Detect Conflicts with Other Versions of Font Awesome</em> &#8211; which lets you start the conflict detection scanner to find versions of Font Awesome loading on your site.</li>\n<li><em>Versions of Font Awesome Active on Your Site</em> &#8211; which shows the results of the scanner and lets  you prevent any conflicting versions from loading other versions of Font Awesome on your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Get more information about using the scanner for troubleshooting on the <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/wordpress#troubleshooting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome WordPress docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Configuring</h4>\n<p>The plugin is set to serve Font Awesome Free icons as a Web Font via the Font Awesome CDN by default. You can change the CDN settings right in the plugin. If you want just the basic Free icons, you probably don&#8217;t need to make any changes to the default configuration.</p>\n<p>You can get more information about all the available settings and troubleshooting on the <a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Font Awesome WordPress docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Upgrading from the Old Versions</h4>\n<p>If you used the old plugin or are still using Version 3 of Font Awesome, we&#8217;ve tried to smooth the upgrade path for you by keeping <code>[icon]</code> shortcode compatibility for Font Awesome 3 names used with the old plugin. But we plan to remove version 3 naming support from this plugin soon so don&#8217;t wait too long to update your code!</p>\n<h3>See Also</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/FortAwesome/wordpress-fontawesome/blob/master/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">README</a> on GitHub has details for WordPress site owners and developers.</p>\n<p>And there are <a href=\"https://fortawesome.github.io/wordpress-fontawesome/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API docs</a> for developers.</p>\n",
