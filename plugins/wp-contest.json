        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need a developer to help setup this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, as long as you know how to create pages and use shortcodes on your WordPress site you are ready to go.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you provide instructions on how to setup this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can access our documentation anytime. It includes step by step instructions on how to install, setup and run your contest – and there’s video!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I create the contest pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add the plugin’s shortcodes to your pages. If you’re running multiple programs you can include the contest’s ID in the plugin as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many contests can I run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the free version you can only run 1 contest at a time. Pro users can run unlimited contests.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What kind of contest can I run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP CONTEST is very flexible. Contestants can upload files or link to their entries and voting criteria is totally customizable – allowing you to run any sort of contest as long as the entry can be uploaded or linked to. Some examples are photography, writing samples, short films, web design, graphic design, science experiments, joke telling, magic tricks …</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to charge contestants to enter my contest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Pro users can choose to either run free or paid contests. The free plugin does not include the option to charge contestants.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do contestants pay for their entries?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently contestants can only pay via PayPal. You will need a PayPal account in order to charge for entries. While you are testing your contest you can also use a PayPal Sandbox app.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who can vote?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can either invite contestants, or allow contestants to register themselves. You can either require contestants to register as a “contestant” user type (automatically created when you install the plugin) or allow any logged in user to submit entries.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is an elimination round?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Pro version of the plugin allows you to run elimination and/or voting rounds. Elimination rounds allow judges to eliminate entries with a simple “No” vote. You can set the minimum number of “No” votes an entry must have to be eliminated. You can either stop there, or then start a voting round with customizable criteria on a 1-10 scale.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Am I able to limit the number of entries that can be submitted to a contest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can set a limit on the number of entries for a contest.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
