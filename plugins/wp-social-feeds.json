There are no any modules or extensions that generate automatic or manual feeds that can be maintained by the people having not much technical knowledge of wordpress coding. Among the thousands reasons of choosing this wordpress plugin we are mentioning a few of them below.<br />\n** Is there any demo? **</p>\n<h4> Demo link <a href=\"https://socialfeeds.leaddevs.com/my-youtube-feeds/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a> </h4>\n<p>**Youtube feed **<br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8b0b3y78OQs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n\n<h4>Can I display multiple Youtube feeds on my site or on the same page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can display multiple Youtube feeds by using our built-in shortcode options, for example: [Youtube-feeds cols=4].</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any security issues with using an Access Token on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. The Access Token used in the plugin is a “read only” token, which means that it could never be used maliciously to manipulate your Youtube account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the difference between Free and Pro Version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Free version include all the major functions but Pro version have some awesome functionality.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
