It&#8217;s like magic!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The player is based on the excellent open source http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/ library. Basically it just plays music through that but reloads the content and menu areas of the page via ajax when a link is clicked. Then it uses html5 push.state to ohange the url.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My page reloads to something really weird, what&#8217;s happening?!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have javascript content within a post/page then when it loads dynamically it might produce strange results -nothing damaging but can be odd. Luckily people rarely put javascript inside their posts&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
