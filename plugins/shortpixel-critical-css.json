This makes the pages load faster.</li>\n<li>The plugin starts generating the CCSS for each visited page and retrieves it from the ShortPixel Critical CSS Service. This is done using WP CRON jobs that run in the background without user intervention and without slowing down the website.</li>\n<li>The edited pages will have the CCSS automatically generated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The CCSS plugin can be configured to keep Critical CSS rules based on the page URL or for each page template. This can help optimize the number of CCSS files needed.</li>\n<li>Additional flexibility: the website administrator can manually configure additional Critical CSS rules to be included in the generated Critical CSS.</li>\n<li>Our plugin integrates with WP Rocket and Elementor, if they are present, in order to leverage the cache support and deliver Critical CSS more effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin was forked from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-criticalcss/\" rel=\"ugc\"> WP Critical CSS</a> plugin, modified to use ShortPixel&#8217;s Critical CSS service and enhanced with new features.</p>\n<p>Currently, the plugin while in its BETA version, is 100% free to use.
