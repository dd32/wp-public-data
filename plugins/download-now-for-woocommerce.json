There is an option in the plugin settings if you would like to include paid items that are on sale for free, by default they aren&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>However, the plugin works right out of the box as it should, and only requires customising if you want to.</p>\n<p>Rather than the <em>Add to Cart</em> button showing on product pages, site visitors will be presented with a download button, or for multiple files on a single product a set of links to each individual file will show. You can customise the experience for your visitors with several display options from links, to buttons, and even checkboxes. Once clicked the file will be securely downloaded automatically. For multiple files, the plugin dynamically creates a zip file that includes all the files for that product, and downloads that instead.</p>\n<h3>Customisation</h3>\n<p>The plugin can be customised in several ways including how the download buttons or links are presented, their appearance, should users be logged in, and more. Check out the plugin settings page for everything.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Full supporting documentation is included with the plugin, available on the plugin settings page. There&#8217;s a user guide, explanation of every setting, and FAQ with support forum links.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20version%20of%20woocommerce%20is%20supported%3F'>\nWhat version of WooCommerce is supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Free Downloads WooCommerce</strong> only supports WooCommerce version 3.0 and above, but should work with any version above 2.6.14.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20support%3F'>\nHow can I get support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Free Downloads WooCommerce</strong> comes complete with a full guide and explanation of the plugin settings. These are available on the plugin settings page. If you need more help, please feel free to post in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/download-now-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20files%20downloaded%3F'>\nHow are files downloaded?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is the plugin uses a safe and secure form on the front-end which requests the file. A second round of security checks is performed, and if everything is ok the file is downloaded using the WooCommerce downloader; as well as using the download method you set for WooCommerce <strong>(Force Downloads, X-Accel-Redirect/X-Sendfile, or Redirect)</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20the%20dynamically%20created%20zip%20files%20handled%3F'>\nHow are the dynamically created ZIP files handled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The product files must have been uploaded to your WordPress site, for example using the WooCommerce <strong>Choose File</strong> option, otherwise the ZIP file will be empty. They will not be included if they are external links.</p>\n<p>Once created with either all of the files for a product or a selection of the files, it is temporarily saved in a folder on your server. Every hour that folder is emptied. If you deactivate this plugin, that folder and its contents will be removed.</p>\n<p>If you use external file links it is recommended that you use the <strong>Links Only</strong> display method, if you have products with multiple files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20the%20full%20links%20to%20files%20visible%20to%20a%20user%3F'>\nAre the full links to files visible to a user?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on your WooCommerce settings.</p>\n<p>If you use the <strong>Force Downloads</strong> or <strong>X-Accel-Redirect/X-Sendfile</strong> download methods (found in the WooCommerce settings, Products, Downloadable Products) for your store downloading, the file paths and URLs will be hidden. If there are multiple files downloaded as a dynamically created ZIP file, regardless of setting, the URLs will be hidden.</p>\n<p>If you use the <strong>Redirect</strong> download method, the full URL may be visible for single files. For example, a PDF. This is the same as it would be without this plugin.</p>\n<p>If in doubt and you&#8217;re worried test it yourself on your own site, or please don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/download-now-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20woocommerce%20memberships%20and%2For%20subscriptions%20supported%3F'>\nAre WooCommerce Memberships and/or Subscriptions supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The official Memberships and Subscriptions plugins from Woo are supported. If you have a free product that requires a user have a membership to purchase, that free product will only be available to download if the user is a member.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20other%20plugins%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat other plugins are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Free Downloads WooCommerce</strong> should be compatible with most plugins. If you have a problem please get in touch and we will include support if possible. Some plugins are only supported in the Pro Edition of Free Downloads WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of explicitly supported plugins:<br />\n* WooCommerce Memberships<br />\n* WooCommerce Subscriptions<br />\n* TI WooCommerce Wishlist<br />\n* WooCommerce Quickview by IconicWP<br />\n* WooCommerce PDF Watermark (Pro Edition)<br />\n* Paid Member Subscriptions by Cozmoslabs (Pro Edition)<br />\n* Woocommerce Products List by NitroWeb (Pro Edition)</p>\n</p>\n\n",

There is an option in the plugin settings if you would like to include paid items that are on sale for free, by default they aren&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>However, the plugin works right out of the box as it should, and only requires customising if you want to.</p>\n<p>Rather than the <em>Add to Cart</em> button showing on product pages, site visitors will be presented with a download button, or for multiple files on a single product a set of links to each individual file will show. You can customise the experience for your visitors with several display options from links, to buttons, and even checkboxes. Once clicked the file will be securely downloaded automatically. For multiple files, the plugin dynamically creates a zip file that includes all the files for that product, and downloads that instead.</p>\n<h3>Customisation</h3>\n<p>The plugin can be customised in several ways including how the download buttons or links are presented, their appearance, should users be logged in, and more. Check out the plugin settings page for everything.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Full supporting documentation is included with the plugin, available on the plugin settings page. There&#8217;s a user guide, explanation of every setting, and FAQ with support forum links.</p>\n",
