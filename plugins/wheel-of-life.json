        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20wheel%20of%20life%3F'>\nWhat is Wheel of Life?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Wheel of Life is an assessment tool used in life coaching to help people assess and manage their life priorities. It&#8217;s a diagram with six spokes, each representing a different area of life: health, wealth, relationships, personal growth, contribution and fun/leisure.</p>\n<p>The idea is to score how satisfied you are with each area on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the highest. This gives you a good overview of where you&#8217;re doing well and where you could use some improvement.</p>\n<p>The Wheel of Life coaching tool can be a helpful tool in setting goals and creating a plan to achieve them. It&#8217;s also a useful way to check in with yourself periodically to see how you&#8217;re doing.
