It provides 4 custom breakpoints, preview mode and possibility to add different values per each resolution. All blocks have special optimized mobile layouts. Also, you can shift your regular columned design to smart scroll on mobiles to generate Application-style design.</p>\n<h4>DYNAMIC LOADING</h4>\n<p>We understand that you may want to keep your current page editor, but in the same time you want to use some features from Greenshift. For this purpose, we added possibility to convert blocks and pages to shortcode. You can use them directly in your plugin or custom pages. And even more, we added possibility to load blocks dynamically when they are in view, or by click/hover. This can save page perfomance on heavy pages.</p>\n<h4>Highest web vitals score</h4>\n<p>We believe that Greenshift is most optimized plugin for web vitals. It&#8217;s because plugin uses unique conditional asset loading. All blocks are divided on style chunks which are loaded only when you use them on page. All dynamic libraries have no jquery dependencies. All styles are loaded inline in head section of page to prevent CLS and incompatibilities with cache plugins. Reusable blocks, Widget and Template environments are supported.</p>\n<h4>TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH GREENSHIFT ADDONS</h4>\n<p>All our core features are free and will be free always. We don&#8217;t sell any premium versions and don&#8217;t limit functionality. In the same time, you may be interesting in extra blocks depending on your type of site. Check full list of addon&#8217;s <a href=\"https://greenshiftwp.com/block-gallery/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blocks for wordpress</a></p>\n<h4>ANIMATION ADDON</h4>\n<p>You can add any custom animation in core version, but Animation addon will give you more options based on popular GSAP library.

It&#8217;s because plugin uses unique conditional asset loading. All blocks are divided on style chunks which are loaded only when you use them on page.

Reusable blocks, Widget and Template environments are supported.</p>\n<h4>TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH GREENSHIFT ADDONS</h4>\n<p>All our core features are free and will be free always.
