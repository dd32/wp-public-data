        "description": "<p>The MSTW Coaching Staffs plugin manages coaching staff rosters for sports teams. The plugin supports multiple coaches, staffs, and teams. It provides several views of staffs including coaches table (screenshot-1), a coaches gallery (screenshot-2), and single coach profiles (screenshot-3). Samples of all of the above displays are available on the <a href=\"http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/dev\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shoal Summit Solutions Plugin Development Site</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin is designed to handle some challenges unique to high school coaching staffs, where coaches often coach two (or more) teams in different roles. For example, one coach can be the Head Coach of the Junior Varsity team and the Offensive Line coach for the Varsity team. That coach can be shown as the first coach on the JV staff and somewhere lower on the Varsity staff listings. Here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by adding the Coaches using the Coaching Staffs -&gt; All Coaches -&gt; Add New Coach admin page. (screenshot-4 and screenshot-5)</li>\n<li>Next add the Coaching Staffs, using the Coaching Staffs -&gt; Staffs admin page. (screenshot-6)</li>\n<li>Finally add the Staff Positions, using the Coach Staffs -&gt; All Staff Positions -&gt; Add New Staff Position admin page. (screenshot-7 and screenshot-8)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>It is important that you enter/add data in this order because the coach and staff must be entered before they can be associated with a staff position.</em></p>\n<p>To display a staff table via the short code enter<br />\n    [mstw-cs-table staff=staff-slug]<br />\non the TEXT or HTML tab, NOT the VISUAL tab, of a page, post, or text widget.
