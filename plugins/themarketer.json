Simply log in and perform a test action, like placing a mock order, and the events should clear.</li>\n<li>The integration is incorrect or your product feed is invalid: If the product feed hasn’t been validated, any product-based events (everything except &#8220;View Homepage&#8221;) will appear as red. Double-check the product feed and integration.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20require%20an%20email%20opt-in%20confirmation%20for%20my%20forms%3F'>\nCan I require an email opt-in confirmation for my forms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely!
