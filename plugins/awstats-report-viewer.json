It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.<br />\nTake a look at this comparison table for an idea on features and differences between most famous statistics tools (AWStats, Analog, Webalizer,&#8230;).<br />\nAWStats is a free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.
