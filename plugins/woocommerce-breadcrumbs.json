It also gives you the ability to disable them completely so they no longer display.</p>\n<p>By changing the HTML surrounding your breadcrumbs, you’re able to provide better options for styling your breadcrumbs in different ways. For example, the default breadcrumbs simply display links with a separator character. Using WooCommerce Breadcrumbs, you can change them to display as an unsorted list of links instead.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This plugin wont actually style your breadcrumbs for you. It simply gives you the tools to change the HTML that wraps around your breadcrumbs.</p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Breadcrumbs gives you the following settings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Breadcrumb separator: This is the separator to use between each breadcrumb</li>\n<li>Wrap before: The opening HTML tag to wrap before all your breadcrumbs</li>\n<li>Wrap after: The closing HTML tag to wrap after all your breadcrumbs</li>\n<li>Before: The opening HTML tag to wrap before each individual breadcrumb</li>\n<li>After: The closing HTML tag to wrap after each individual breadcrumb</li>\n<li>Home text: The text to use for the ‘Home’ breadcrumb</li>\n<li>Home URL: The URL that the ‘Home’ breadcrumb links to</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If need be, you can also disable the breadcrumbs completely by unticking the &#8216;Enable breadcrumbs&#8217; checkbox. This will stop the breadcrumbs from displaying on your site.</p>\n<p>If you notice there are a few less breadcrumb options on the settings page than you expected, then you&#8217;re mostly likely using a WooThemes Theme. WooTheme themes disable the WooCommerce breadcrumbs in favour of the WooFramework Breadcrumbs. The downside to this is that there aren&#8217;t quite as many options that can be changed with the WooFramework Breadcrumbs.</p>\n<p>To see some examples of how you can style your WooCommerce Breadcrumbs, check out the <a href=\"http://maddisondesigns.com/woocommerce-breadcrumbs/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin homepage</a>.</p>\n",
