Depending on your settings, it displays only the name or name + avatar image, if user didn&#8217;t set an avatar in the SMF forum, it displays a generic image you can specify (see the example image below). Support: http://www.longu.de/_smfgm_redirect.php</p>\n<p>The plugin adds a seperate configuration menu in the WP admin panel (called &#8220;SMF Groups&#8221;). You need to add the following data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the database connection details to your Simple Machine Forum database.</li>\n<li>Enter ID of the SMF member group you want to display in the widget.</li>\n<li>Modify the HTML code for the widget.</li>\n<li>If you want to display member avatars (from SMF), you NEED to modify the /attachments/.htaccess file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each field has an example what it should include.</p>\n<p>The field &#8220;Limit&#8221; determines how many mambers are listed in total. Dummy image is optional. Needs to be a http:// URL. If you set it, it uses this image if a user has no image set in his SMF profile.</p>\n<p>Important: SMF 2.0 adds a .htaccess file at &#8220;/forum/attachments/.htaccess&#8221;. This file blocks all requests from different domains. So if you want to use this widget to display a member group from a SMF forum from a different server/domain, you NEED to modify this .htaccess file (the needed steps are explained in the admin section of this widget).</p>\n<p>Feedback needed! This is a very early version of the plugin. If you like it, it can be improved a lot, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Links from each avatar to SMF profiles</li>\n<li>Links from each avatar to other profiles (like FB)</li>\n<li>More options for templating</li>\n<li>Tag option to displays one member or all members inside a blog entry/article</li>\n<li>Several predefined output settings</li>\n<li>Better caching/performance (though it should be suitable for your needs already)</li>\n<li>&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n",
