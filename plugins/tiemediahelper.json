        "faq": "\n<h4>The plugin sits there for ages and doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s working, honest. The problem is that the file search is quite intensive, especially if you have thousands of files in the search path. Kick it off and leave it running&#8230; it&#8217;ll get there eventually. In testing, the plugin ran successfully on sites with over 10,000 files. Patience, grasshopper. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin sits there for ages, then gives me a 404.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can happen if you have a ridiculous number of files in a directory and a wussy server. You can try running it on individual sub-folders (by entering the path on the options page) but if you have tens of thousands of files in a single folder, you&#8217;ll probably have to work around it by temporarily shuffling them around.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin timed out.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can happen if you have a lot of files &#8211; you&#8217;ll get the standard &#8220;Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded&#8221; error message if your server&#8217;s php settings are normal. Don&#8217;t worry. Just hit back and start the process again: it&#8217;ll whizz through the ones it&#8217;s done and carry on from where it left off.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin have any limitations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin may not find a duplicate copy of a file in a different folder. For example, if you have a file called &#8220;image.jpg&#8221; in your media library from 11/2013, the plugin will not add a record for a file called &#8220;image.jpg&#8221; in the wp-uploads/2013/10 folder.</p>\n<p>This is because of the ridiculously messy attachments setup for large images which means that multiple attachment records are created, each with multiple metadata records. It didn&#8217;t seem worth the effort to try to untangle such a mess just to catch a duplicate filename or two.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will the plugin attach images to their posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It has no way of knowing which posts they were associated with, if they ever were.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin actively maintained?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is. I would LOVE to hear your comments, see your reviews and listen to what you&#8217;d like added or changed. You can do that here on WP.org or at http://www.setupmyvps.com/tiemediahelper.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin take a long time to run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That will depend very much on how many images you have in your uploads folders. The plugin gives a simple running commentary, so at least you know it&#8217;s working and can see what it&#8217;s doing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there any documentation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;re reading it. The plugin code is also heavily commented to help you find your way. You can visit the plugin homepage at http://setupmyvps.com/tiemediahelper for thoughts and comments</p>\n</p>\n\n",
