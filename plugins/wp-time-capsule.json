        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://wptimecapsule.com/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Time Capsule</a> was created to ensure peace of mind with WP updates and put the fun back into WordPress. It uses the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect  changes and backs up just the changed files and db entries to your account.</p>\n<p>You need to sign up for an account on our website https://service.wptimecapsule.com to get a 30 days full featured trial.</p>\n<p> <br />\n<strong>With WP Time Capsule you can</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Backup in real-time</strong><br />\nYou can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. </p>\n<p><strong>Staging</strong><br />\nWith a single click staging it&#8217;s a breeze to test any change you are planning to do on your site. Test your updates on staging with a single click</p>\n<p><strong>Auto backup and update</strong><br />\nWe automatically backup before each update, if an update causes any undesired change. You are a click away from restoring.</p>\n<p><strong>Encrypted DB backups &amp; GDPR Compatible</strong><br />\nYou can encrypt your DB backups to add an extra layer of security and makes your backup GDPR compatible. </p>\n<p><strong>Clone/Migrate</strong><br />\nYou can now use the WPTC backup to clone or migrate your site to a new location at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>How is WP Time Capsule different than other backup plugins?</strong><br />\n<br />\nWPTC is unique in 4 ways &#8211;<br />\n1. It backs up and restores only the changed files &amp; DB and not the entire site every time.<br />\n2. The files &amp; DB are stored in your cloud storage app &#8211; Amazon S3, Wasabi, Backblaze, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br />\n3. We have used the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect changes and maintain file versions. So backups and restores are as reliable as they get.<br />\n4. Most importantly, you can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. </p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />\n<br />\n1. Sign up an account on our website https://wptimecapsule.com and you will get a 30 days full featured trial.<br />\n2. Install the plugin and login with your wptimecapsule.com account.<br />\n3. Next, connect the cloud app where you want to store the backup files. You can use Amazon S3, Wasabi, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br />\n4. Once you connect the cloud app, we will automatically begin backing up your complete website to your cloud app account.</p>\n<p>After the first full backup is taken, you can schedule a time for WPTC to backup your websites. We will take care of your backups from here on.<br />\nThis being done you will officially be <em>disaster-ready</em>. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><strong>Backup</strong>: Looks for files &amp; DB changes since the last backup and uploads only the changes. The data is then stored securely in your cloud app account.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Restore</strong>: Checks revision history and displays the same. You can restore the site to any point in time or restore specific files &amp; DB.</p>\n<p><strong>How is it better?</strong><br />\nBACKUP METHOD<br />\nTraditionally &#8211; Backups are compressed and zipped. The Bad: Heavy server resource consumption.<br />\nWPTC &#8211; No zipping. Changed files are directly dropped into your cloud account. The Good: <strong><em>Uses considerably less server resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>BACKUP FILE<br />\nTraditionally &#8211; Multiple zip files are created every time you backup. The Bad: Precious storage space is wasted.<br />\nWPTC &#8211; Backs up incrementally. No multiple copies of files. The Good: <strong><em>Uses far less disk space</em></strong></p>\n<p>RESTORE<br />\nTraditionally &#8211; Unzip backup and restore the whole site. The Bad: Consumes time and server resource.<br />\nWPTC &#8211; Restores only selected files. The Good: <strong><em>Faster restore and you can restore even if you don&#8217;t have access to your site or plugin.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://docs.wptimecapsule.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base</a><br />\nVisit us at <a href=\"https://wptimecapsule.com/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wptimecapsule.com</a></p>\n<p>Credits: Michael De Wildt for his WordPress Backup to Dropbox plugin based on which this plugin is being developed.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://wptimecapsule.com/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Time Capsule</a> was created to ensure peace of mind with WP updates and put the fun back into WordPress. It uses the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect  changes and backs up just the changed files and db entries to your account.</p>\n<p>You need to sign up for an account on our website https://service.wptimecapsule.com to get a 30 days full featured trial.</p>\n<p> <br />\n<strong>With WP Time Capsule you can</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Backup in real-time</strong><br />\nYou can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. </p>\n<p><strong>Staging</strong><br />\nWith a single click staging it&#8217;s a breeze to test any change you are planning to do on your site. Test your updates on staging with a single click</p>\n<p><strong>Auto backup and update</strong><br />\nWe automatically backup before each update, if an update causes any undesired change. You are a click away from restoring.</p>\n<p><strong>Encrypted DB backups &amp; GDPR Compatible</strong><br />\nYou can encrypt your DB backups to add an extra layer of security and makes your backup GDPR compatible. </p>\n<p><strong>Clone/Migrate</strong><br />\nYou can now use the WPTC backup to clone or migrate your site to a new location at ease.</p>\n<p><strong>How is WP Time Capsule different than other backup plugins?</strong><br />\n<br />\nWPTC is unique in 4 ways &#8211;<br />\n1. It backs up and restores only the changed files &amp; DB and not the entire site every time.<br />\n2. The files &amp; DB are stored in your cloud storage app &#8211; Amazon S3, Wasabi, Backblaze, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br />\n3. We have used the cloud apps&#8217; native file versioning system to detect changes and maintain file versions. So backups and restores are as reliable as they get.<br />\n4. Most importantly, you can backup your site in real-time which means you will now be able to revert your site to how it was just an hour ago. Also, you can change the backup interval to every 6 hours or 12 hours or daily. </p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />\n<br />\n1. Sign up an account on our website https://wptimecapsule.com and you will get a 30 days full featured trial.<br />\n2. Install the plugin and login with your wptimecapsule.com account.<br />\n3. Next, connect the cloud app where you want to store the backup files. You can use Amazon S3, Wasabi, Dropbox or Google Drive.<br />\n4. Once you connect the cloud app, we will automatically begin backing up your complete website to your cloud app account.</p>\n<p>After the first full backup is taken, you can schedule a time for WPTC to backup your websites. We will take care of your backups from here on.<br />\nThis being done you will officially be <em>disaster-ready</em>. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><strong>Backup</strong>: Looks for files &amp; DB changes since the last backup and uploads only the changes. The data is then stored securely in your cloud app account.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Restore</strong>: Checks revision history and displays the same. You can restore the site to any point in time or restore specific files &amp; DB.</p>\n<p><strong>How is it better?</strong><br />\nBACKUP METHOD<br />\nTraditionally &#8211; Backups are compressed and zipped. The Bad: Heavy server resource consumption.<br />\nWPTC &#8211; No zipping. Changed files are directly dropped into your cloud account. The Good: <strong><em>Uses considerably less server resources</em></strong></p>\n<p>BACKUP FILE<br />\nTraditionally &#8211; Multiple zip files are created every time you backup. The Bad: Precious storage space is wasted.<br />\nWPTC &#8211; Backs up incrementally. No multiple copies of files. The Good: <strong><em>Uses far less disk space</em></strong></p>\n<p>RESTORE<br />\nTraditionally &#8211; Unzip backup and restore the whole site. The Bad: Consumes time and server resource.<br />\nWPTC &#8211; Restores only selected files. The Good: <strong><em>Faster restore and you can restore even if you don&#8217;t have access to your site or plugin.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://docs.wptimecapsule.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base</a><br />\nVisit us at <a href=\"https://wptimecapsule.com/\" title=\"Incremental Backup for WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wptimecapsule.com</a></p>\n<p>Credits: Michael De Wildt for his WordPress Backup to Dropbox plugin based on which this plugin is being developed.</p>\n",
