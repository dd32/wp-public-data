A single item of such a content is generally called a post, although post is also a specific post type. Internally, all the post types are stored in the same place, in the wp_posts database table, but are differentiated by a column called post_type.</p>\n<p>WordPress 3.0 gives you the capability to add your own custom post types and to use them in different ways.<br />\n  <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More information in the Codex</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t the plugin activate ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have you read what it says in the beautifully red bar at the top of your plugins page ? As it says there, the Debug Bar plugin needs to be active for this plugin to work. If the Debug Bar plugin is not active, this plugin will automatically de-activate itself.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
