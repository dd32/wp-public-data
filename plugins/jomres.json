I think of Jomres as less a booking engine and more a toolkit, with a set of tools that my users can use to build their own unique online websites.

This means that you can use Jomres on any theme, not just Bootstrap themes. If you&#8217;re using a Bootstrap theme, you can still use the Bootstrap version of Jomres, but you don&#8217;t have to.</p>\n<h3>Demos</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress-portal.jomres.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See the Portal Demo here &#8211; a variety of bookable items, multiple owners</a></p>\n<p>License holders can download the &#8220;QuickStart&#8221; zip file that enables you to deploy a full installation of WordPress with everything already set up to exactly match the Demo.
