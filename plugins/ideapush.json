        "description": "<p>With IdeaPush you can add an awesome feature/idea request system to WordPress. Use IdeaPush to generate new ideas or get feedback from actual users and customers or use it as a support triage system or use it for something else!</p>\n<p>Watch the plugin walkthrough:</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFaGNbYUiIw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/ideapush-feature-requests/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo page here</a> and submit an idea for the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Rich and extensive notifications</h4>\n<p>Easily activate automatic notifications for the administrator, idea authors or voters for a range of actions. Use our simple but powerful shortcode generator to make your email subject and content dynamic, relevant and personalised.</p>\n<h4>Intelligent voting</h4>\n<p>Enable users or guests to vote on ideas with an up vote only or an up and down vote so poor ideas can be buried and good ideas can rise. Place a daily maximum voting limit on voting to prevent misuse. Set a vote threshold for your board so ideas automatically change status when the vote goal is reached.</p>\n<h4>Fast idea creation</h4>\n<p>With an accessible form users or guests can create new ideas and assign ideas tags and an attachment. Like votes, new ideas can have a daily limit so things don&#8217;t get out of control. Eliminate bot ideas with built-in honeypot and math problem protection. When new ideas are submitted, ideas can either be automatically published or get assigned a pending status for administrator approval. Upgrade to pro to show suggested ideas to users whilst they write a new idea to prevent duplication.</p>\n<h4>Easy to use and fast setup</h4>\n<p>The admin interface is well organised and provides extensive options for customising the plugin. Create a new board in seconds and add the board shortcode provided to any post or page.</p>\n<h4>Statuses to keep things organised</h4>\n<p>Statuses keep your ideas organised and logical within a typical development workflow. Ideas when created are set to open and are set to reviewed when the vote goal has been reached and can then be changed to approved or declined and then to in progress and completed. Ideas can be edited in the backend like any other WordPress post. Optionally, tags can be used as a secondary categorisation method to better manage ideas.</p>\n<h4>Beautiful, dynamic and intuitive user interface</h4>\n<p>Great attention to detail has been made to bring the frontend design to a professional level. IdeaPush is a dynamic Ajax powered interface so ideas move up and down as a vote gets cast. When ideas are sorted to show ideas by the most popular, recent, trending, your own ideas or ideas you have voted on, new ideas are fetched. Ideas can also be filtered by status or tags to create specific lookups of ideas.</p>\n<p>Or better yet, use our super powerful live search filter to search idea titles, content, authors and tags with search phrase highlighting.</p>\n<p>Each idea has its own page for sharing and SEO purposes and for administrators there are quick action buttons on the single idea page to bring idea triage to the frontend. Upgrade to pro to remove the single idea page.</p>\n<h4>Other things</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin tightly integrates with existing WordPress functions</li>\n<li>Translate certain things in the plugin settings and translate the rest using Poedit &#8211; German has already been done!</li>\n<li>Extension board and global options</li>\n<li>Enable or disable comments for ideas</li>\n<li>An array of action hooks for other developers to sink their teeth into</li>\n<li>You can choose to make a board available only to a certain user role or hide a board from WordPress search</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s mobile responsive</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Upgrade to pro</h4>\n<p>Upgrade to pro to unlock multiple boards and our powerful idea suggestion system to minimise duplicate ideas and so much more!</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HD18EijWSHo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h4>All pro features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to create multiple boards</li>\n<li>Idea and tag suggestion system when users are creating a new idea to minimise duplicate ideas and tags</li>\n<li>Shows related ideas on the single idea page</li>\n<li>A beautiful idea history timeline on the editing interface so you can see and track the status of and idea and how it has changed over time and the ability to add an internal note to an idea</li>\n<li>The ability to send an email to voters or the author of an idea with a custom and dynamic text</li>\n<li>Track the activity of your ideas and votes over time and by user via the reports menu item</li>\n<li>The ability to disable the single ideas page</li>\n<li>An awesome integration with Zendesk</li>\n<li>A simple but powerful integration with MailChimp</li>\n<li>Ability to create challenges</li>\n<li>Custom fields and multiple form settings including video field</li>\n<li>User idea editing and deleting</li>\n<li>Leaderboards</li>\n<li>An awesome integration with Jira</li>\n<li>Merge duplicate ideas</li>\n<li>Have multiple users on the same IP address</li>\n<li>Show images inline on the all ideas page</li>\n<li>Widgets!

The benefit of this is that if you are using Font Awesome 5 or above you will no longer have a clash with IdeaPush as this issue was becoming more and more common. Also it provides us with more flexibility in the future to manipulate icons however we want to rather then being stuck with a standard font library. So icons will look a little bit different now, but hopefully you like the change! On paper this version 6 may seem little but it has required a lot of effort and because a lot of people have made customisations to icons I wanted to make this a major release just as a signal that you might need to tweak things after updating if you have made customisations.</li>\n<li>Improved styling</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New setting on &#8220;Idea Form&#8221; tab to set the max upload size for images</li>\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.2.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now finally change the default status and showing filter for ideas! There are 2 new board settings so you can easily change the defaults for these board header filters woohoo!</li>\n<li>More efficienct coding in the header section of the idea table</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed login form on the single idea idea page where form placeholder text would not show</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing of PHP error caused by privacy confirmation message in admin settings</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Important update for compatibility with WordPress 5.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased permissions for idea manager role</li>\n<li>Minor bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for people who want to have an empty option at the start of custom fields from not displaying in the custom fields area</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes caused in version 5.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fixes caused in version 5</li>\n<li>Some improved translation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New widgets including a widget to show the leaderboard, a widget to display tags and a widget to display the idea form for a particular board! </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.46</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New settings for tag page (please see new tab in plugin settings &#8220;Tag Page&#8221;) to provide more flexibility as tags are not necessarily associated to boards and this work removes PHP errors that may show in logs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.45</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor arrangement of code to minimise errors</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.44</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to new user role idea push manager, so they can now change the status and boards of ideas</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.43</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can now add a privacy checkbox onto the idea form to comply with EU privacy laws.

When a user is assigned to this role they can view and create ideas from the backend and change plugin settings but they can&#8217;t do anything else! To activate this new role please deactivate the plugin and then activate it again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.37</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Renaming of tabs to improve plugin compatibility with other plugins</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.36</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removes IdeaPush user role on plugin deactivate</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.35</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Pro users can now update custom field values created by the plugin for an idea on the single idea edit page.

    "description": "<p>With IdeaPush you can add an awesome feature/idea request system to WordPress. Use IdeaPush to generate new ideas or get feedback from actual users and customers or use it as a support triage system or use it for something else!</p>\n<p>Watch the plugin walkthrough:</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFaGNbYUiIw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/ideapush-feature-requests/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo page here</a> and submit an idea for the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Rich and extensive notifications</h4>\n<p>Easily activate automatic notifications for the administrator, idea authors or voters for a range of actions. Use our simple but powerful shortcode generator to make your email subject and content dynamic, relevant and personalised.</p>\n<h4>Intelligent voting</h4>\n<p>Enable users or guests to vote on ideas with an up vote only or an up and down vote so poor ideas can be buried and good ideas can rise. Place a daily maximum voting limit on voting to prevent misuse. Set a vote threshold for your board so ideas automatically change status when the vote goal is reached.</p>\n<h4>Fast idea creation</h4>\n<p>With an accessible form users or guests can create new ideas and assign ideas tags and an attachment. Like votes, new ideas can have a daily limit so things don&#8217;t get out of control. Eliminate bot ideas with built-in honeypot and math problem protection. When new ideas are submitted, ideas can either be automatically published or get assigned a pending status for administrator approval. Upgrade to pro to show suggested ideas to users whilst they write a new idea to prevent duplication.</p>\n<h4>Easy to use and fast setup</h4>\n<p>The admin interface is well organised and provides extensive options for customising the plugin. Create a new board in seconds and add the board shortcode provided to any post or page.</p>\n<h4>Statuses to keep things organised</h4>\n<p>Statuses keep your ideas organised and logical within a typical development workflow. Ideas when created are set to open and are set to reviewed when the vote goal has been reached and can then be changed to approved or declined and then to in progress and completed. Ideas can be edited in the backend like any other WordPress post. Optionally, tags can be used as a secondary categorisation method to better manage ideas.</p>\n<h4>Beautiful, dynamic and intuitive user interface</h4>\n<p>Great attention to detail has been made to bring the frontend design to a professional level. IdeaPush is a dynamic Ajax powered interface so ideas move up and down as a vote gets cast. When ideas are sorted to show ideas by the most popular, recent, trending, your own ideas or ideas you have voted on, new ideas are fetched. Ideas can also be filtered by status or tags to create specific lookups of ideas.</p>\n<p>Or better yet, use our super powerful live search filter to search idea titles, content, authors and tags with search phrase highlighting.</p>\n<p>Each idea has its own page for sharing and SEO purposes and for administrators there are quick action buttons on the single idea page to bring idea triage to the frontend. Upgrade to pro to remove the single idea page.</p>\n<h4>Other things</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin tightly integrates with existing WordPress functions</li>\n<li>Translate certain things in the plugin settings and translate the rest using Poedit &#8211; German has already been done!</li>\n<li>Extension board and global options</li>\n<li>Enable or disable comments for ideas</li>\n<li>An array of action hooks for other developers to sink their teeth into</li>\n<li>You can choose to make a board available only to a certain user role or hide a board from WordPress search</li>\n<li>It&#8217;s mobile responsive</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Upgrade to pro</h4>\n<p>Upgrade to pro to unlock multiple boards and our powerful idea suggestion system to minimise duplicate ideas and so much more!</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HD18EijWSHo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h4>All pro features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to create multiple boards</li>\n<li>Idea and tag suggestion system when users are creating a new idea to minimise duplicate ideas and tags</li>\n<li>Shows related ideas on the single idea page</li>\n<li>A beautiful idea history timeline on the editing interface so you can see and track the status of and idea and how it has changed over time and the ability to add an internal note to an idea</li>\n<li>The ability to send an email to voters or the author of an idea with a custom and dynamic text</li>\n<li>Track the activity of your ideas and votes over time and by user via the reports menu item</li>\n<li>The ability to disable the single ideas page</li>\n<li>An awesome integration with Zendesk</li>\n<li>A simple but powerful integration with MailChimp</li>\n<li>Ability to create challenges</li>\n<li>Custom fields and multiple form settings including video field</li>\n<li>User idea editing and deleting</li>\n<li>Leaderboards</li>\n<li>An awesome integration with Jira</li>\n<li>Merge duplicate ideas</li>\n<li>Have multiple users on the same IP address</li>\n<li>Show images inline on the all ideas page</li>\n<li>Widgets!

So icons will look a little bit different now, but hopefully you like the change! On paper this version 6 may seem little but it has required a lot of effort and because a lot of people have made customisations to icons I wanted to make this a major release just as a signal that you might need to tweak things after updating if you have made customisations.</li>\n<li>Improved styling</li>\n</ul>",
