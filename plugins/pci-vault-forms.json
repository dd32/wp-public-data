        "description": "<p>Securely <a href=\"https://docs.pcivault.io/developers/capturing-card-data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">capture payment card data</a> from your site using PCI Vault. PCI Vault is a vendor neutral PCI DSS compliant environment.</p>\n<p>Data captured with this plugin will be sent to PCI Vault&#8217;s DSS compliant database directly, and will not be present on your own server. This allows you to securely capture and <a href=\"https://pcivault.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tokenize credit card</a> data without being PCI DSS compliant.</p>\n<h4>How it Works</h4>\n<p>The plugin comes with a short code that loads PCI Vault&#8217;s own <a href=\"https://api.pcivault.io/pcd/how-to-capture-and-tokenize-payment-card-data.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Payment Card Data (PCD) form</a>, and makes all the necessary requests to the <a href=\"https://api.pcivault.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PCI Vault API</a> in order to get the form working. You can read more on the API side of things <a href=\"https://docs.pcivault.io/developers/capturing-card-data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Take note that this includes 2 paid API requests: 1 when the form loads, and 1 when the data is being sent to PCI Vault.</p>\n<p>To use this plugin, add your authorisation details, and the user/passphrase for a key, in the PCI Vault Options menu. You can then load the capture form anywhere in your site by using the <code>pcivault_capture</code> shortcode.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode Attributes</h4>\n<p>All valid short code attributes are imported directly into the javascript that renders the form. The security of these attributes are the responsibility of the site, and not PCI Vault.</p>\n<p>Every attribute must be a valid Javascript expression. We recommend to use function calls that return the values you want the attributes to have, this will grant extra flexibility and avoid issues with WordPress&#8217;s sanitisation.</p>\n<p>The attribute options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>success_callback: A JS function to call if the card was successfully stored.</li>\n<li>error_callback: A JS function to call if the card was not successfully stored.</li>\n<li>extra_data: Extra data to store along with the card, must be a valid JS object. This is where using a JS function call really helps.</li>\n<li>show_card: A true/false value on whether or not to show the card on the form.</li>\n<li>disable_luhn: A true/false value on whether to disable validation on all form fields.</li>\n<li>force_keypad: A true/false value on whether to force the user to use a randomised on-screen keypad for entering card numbers. This helps to protect you from key-loggers.</li>\n<li>field_options: A configuration object for specifying which of the form fields to show or validate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on these fields, please check the documentation for PCI Vault&#8217;s <a href=\"https://api.pcivault.io/pcd/how-to-capture-and-tokenize-payment-card-data.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Payment Card Data (PCD) form</a>.</p>\n<h4>PCI Vault</h4>\n<p>All of the magic behind this plugin happens on PCI Vault&#8217;s environment.</p>\n<p>This plugin sends an authenticated request to PCI Vault, retrieving a <a href=\"https://docs.pcivault.io/developers/capturing-card-data/#step-1-create-a-unique-endpoint\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">unique capturing endpoint</a>.</p>\n<p>This request includes your authentication details, and the key/passphrase pair specified in the PCI Vault Options menu.</p>\n<p>This plugin also loads a <a href=\"https://api.pcivault.io/pcd/how-to-capture-and-tokenize-payment-card-data.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hosted PCD form</a> from PCI Vault.</p>\n<p>You need to be a customer of PCI Vault for this plugin to work. You can <a href=\"https://pcivault.io/#pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">view our pricing</a> and <a href=\"https://pcivault.io/register\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">register an account</a>.</p>\n<p>Also have a look at our <a href=\"https://pcivault.io/terms/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms of Service</a> and our <a href=\"https://pcivault.io/privacy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\n",
