At present there are no plans to try and make it work with Jetpack based on how it functions. Perhaps this will change in the future, but for now I don&#8217;t anticipate anything different.<br />\nAdditionally, this plugin requires the permalink structure be changed from the default.

I have no general timeline at the moment, but this is in a very early stage of development so anything could change.</p>\n",
