        "description": "<p>Using GlobalizeIt, your website becomes editable for globalization.  Any translators from around the world, yours, ours or those of a third party, need only go to your website, login,  double-click on a line of text on your website, translate it directly inline on the site,  and then publish the changes immediately in order to translate your site into any language.  No coding needed.  It&#8217;s a professional website translation made as easy as it gets.<br />\nBut translation is only half the story.  GlobalizeIt allows you to perform marketization as well.  You can visually select any segment of the site and conditionally suppress it or alter it for a given market &#8211; ie a given country or target language .   You can visually replace images and styles,  change the font sizes in certain areas and make containers stretch to accommodate longer text.  All without any programming.</p>\n<h4>AI and Human Translation</h4>\n<p>You can auto-translate individual areas of text,  or the whole thing, which will use Google Translate&#8217;s translation engine, and then fix up the mistakes.  Or you can start with human translation from the beginning &#8211; your choice.</p>\n<h4>SEO Optimization</h4>\n<p>We inject information to let Google know how to find all the translated versions of a given page, and let you import and alter meta tags and titles, for SEO optimization.  People from other countries will be able to search for content in their language, and your pages will come up.</p>\n<h4>Enterprise Level Translation</h4>\n<p>We can handle huge retail websites with tens of thousands of product pages,  receiving very high traffic.  We have unique ways of allocating and distributing content files, as well as placing those files on an edge-caching node very close to your end-user, so that despite any megabytes of text on a large website, the experience for your users going to any given page is always lightening-fast.  We have ways that allow searches and sorts to work on the translated text of underlying products, as well as ways to integrate email translation with our tools.</p>\n<h4>Your Choice of Translators</h4>\n<p>You can choose to use our translators, your own translators, bilingual people in your company, your users, translators in a 3rd party translation company, or direct integration with crowd-sourcing mass translation services like Gengo.</p>\n<h4>DOM Listener</h4>\n<p>Our DOM Listener listens to javascript-initiated changes on the page and translates them on the spot with human-translated strings, before they appear in the original language.</p>\n<h4>In Context and Strings List Views</h4>\n<p>You can translate and marketize a site directly on the page itself, or you can use the Strings List View &#8216;behind&#8217; the web page where you can work with a well-organized list of all strings that appear on that page.</p>\n",
