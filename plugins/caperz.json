These activities are added by the Caperz team, by the providers of the activities and by users. All activities are verified as being complete and correct before being shown on Caperz so you can be sure only validated data will be shown.</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m not seeing activities for my ZIP code</h4>\n<p>If there are activities in your area that you want to appear on your blog, just go to http://www.caperz.com, enter your zip code and see the complete list. If you want to add an activity, click on the &#8220;Add a Provider&#8221; button at the bottom of the search page, or choose a provider and &#8220;Add activity or series&#8221; to it.</p>\n<h4>Can I change the number of activities shown, or the order of the activities, etc?</h4>\n<p>We will be launching updates to the plugin often to allow for more customization. If you have any requests, please send them to us via http://www.caperz.us/contact.php and we&#8217;ll try to prioritize your request.</p>\n<h4>Can I change the colors of the widget?</h4>\n<p>Currently, the widget uses your blog&#8217;s theme colors but we hope to have a release soon that will allow you to change the colors.</p>\n",
