        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin package &#8216;flplaylist&#8217; to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress. A menu item called FlPlaylist will show up in the left menu.</li>\n<li>Go to menu FlPlaylist-&gt;Add New, provide a title, choose a few options, and add one or more web video URLs to create a video playlist.</li>\n<li>Publish the playlist. </li>\n<li>Use the shortcode beneath the Video URLs textbox in your post or page to embed the playlist.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Where do I upload my videos?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In v.0.1 you have to find your own content delivery service in order to use this plugin. A suggested service is Dropbox (free or paid) where you can upload your videos in the &#8216;Public&#8217; folder and sync them over the web. Then you can use the publicly accessible URLs that Dropbox provided in this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use audio files in the playlist?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry not right now. But if you find this is really what you need please make a feature request.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Flowplayer free to use for my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Flowplayer is an open-source software and is absolutely free to use. However, the free version of Flowplayer bears a Flowplayer logo on the video. In order to remove that logo you have to purchase a Flowplayer license key (see next question).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I remove the Flowplayer logo on the video?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to purchase a <a href=\"http://flash.flowplayer.org/download/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Flowplayer license key</a> and register that key for your WordPress site. Then go to the Configuration page of the Flowplayer Playlist plugin and save the key. The key you purchased can only be used for the website you registered (including subdomains) on the Flowplayer website so don&#8217;t worry that someone else might steal your key. Make sure to purchase the key for the Flash-based rather than the HTML5 version of Flowplayer.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin support iPad and iPhone?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin is Flash-based which is not supported by iOS devices. But future releases might add support for iOS devices.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
