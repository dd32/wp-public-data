It is possible to reduce your blog writing time to seconds if you wish.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20writerblok%20ai%20content%20generation%20plugin%20easy%20to%20use%3F'>\nIs the WriterBlok AI Content Generation Plugin easy to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve built writers block to follow standard user interface design in wordpress. You can easily use the plugin from the WordPress block editor sidebar that you are already familiar with.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20writerblok%20ai%20content%20generation%20free%3F'>\nIs the WriterBlok AI Content Generation free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin can be used for free without charge from WriterBlok. OpenAI charges a fee to use GPT-3, but they extend a generous amount of credits for you to use for free. These credits will give you plenty of time to evaluate the content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20get%20an%20openai%20key%3F'>\nWhere do I get an OpenAI Key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign up at the <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI API website</a></li>\n<li>Log into your account</li>\n<li>Click your profile image in the top left</li>\n<li>Then click &#8220;view api keys&#8221;</li>\n<li>Then create a new API key</li>\n<li>Be sure to save the secret key in a safe place as you will not be able to see it again once you leave the page</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20additional%20costs%3F'>\nAre there any additional costs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>OpenAI charges a fee but will also provide you with a credit when you create your account. This credit should be plenty enough to test the tool and get a feeling for how it will work. Additional charges are about 2 cents per thousand &#8220;tokens&#8221;. You can think of tokens as words, however some words will use more than a single token. See the <a href=\"https://openai.com/api/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI API pricing here</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20content%20produced%20by%20writersblok%20unique'>\nIs the content produced by WritersBlok unique\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically: yes. However, the model is trained on billions of data points collected from the internet and books. It is possible to generate somewhat similar content if using the same keywords. Anyone that claims the content is guaranteed to be 100% unique is not being genuine.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20additional%20features%20be%20added%3F'>\nWill additional features be added?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We plan to maintain and update this plugin regularly. The feature set available today will continue to evolve over time.
