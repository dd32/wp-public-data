        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.atarapay.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AtaraPay​</a> is a web and mobile tool used by seller and buyer for protection during any online or offline commercial transaction through funds held in escrow by a trusted third-party. The prevalence of the use of cash on delivery is a payment method that benefits only the buyer leaving eCommerce sellers with little option to collect payment before delivery. AtaraPay helps to resolve this by creating an escrow-based payment method, where buyer pays into escrow and seller is notified to make delivery. On successful delivery, the buyer inspects the goods or service and expects to accept or reject it using our mobile and web app.</p>\n<p>Deploying this extension onto your WordPress website (single or multi- vendor), provides a seamless and simple way of automating payment with our escrow solution. When a shopper gets to the checkout page, AtaraPay is listed as one of the payment options and selected for payment via credit or debit card, bank transfer and USSD. When payment is made, it is held in escrow on behalf of both seller and buyer until the buyer inspects and accepts that the order is in expected condition. For details on how our escrow solution works, please watch the ​<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ybsb-D1as8s\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AtaraPay escrow video</a>​.</p>\n<p>AtaraPay automates and extremely simplifies the escrow process. It also exposes escrow status APIs that enable seamless integration between AtaraPay and any delivery app service. It automates the delivery or cancellation processes making the escrow process very user friendly and effective. For details on our APIs, visit ​<a href=\"http://plugins.atarapay.com/docs/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AtaraPay API Documentation</a>​.</p>\n<p>AtaraPay will increase prepayment for your Magento store and improve the credibility of your business since shoppers are assured by your willingness to allow them inspect the goods before you are credited. Conversely, you are comforted knowing that the shopper has genuine intent to buy since funds are paid before delivery.</p>\n<h3>ACCOUNT &amp; PRICING</h3>\n<p>To use the extension, you have to sign up as an Individual or Business Seller on AtaraPay by clicking here &#8211;&gt; ​<a href=\"https://app.atarapay.com/#/register/seller\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AtaraPay Seller Registration</a> or from our mobile app on Play Store or App Store​ (search word &quot;atarapay&quot;). Setup or subscription fees are not applicable for using this extension. Visit the eCommerce Website Escrow Service section under the ​<a href=\"https://www.atarapay.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AtaraPay Pricing Page</a>​ for details on our simple pricing model which is essentially a transaction fee of 1.5% of the cart value or a maximum of NGN2,000.
