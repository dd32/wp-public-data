Hover your mouse over a product, and the ID number will be displayed directly below the product name next to the Edit links.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20options%20to%20the%20select%20menu'>\nHow do I add options to the select menu\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the Input Type column, choose Select from the dropdown menu. Then add the options as you want your customers to see them at checkout in the Select Options box directly below the menu. Enter one option per line. Do NOT use commas to separate your options.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20want%20to%20have%20an%20extra%20field%20at%20checkout%3F'>\nWhy would I want to have an extra field at checkout?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to have an extra field at checkout. Sometimes the default fields provided are not enough and there is extra information you need to collect from your customers.</p>\n<p>A few examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gift wrap options for a birthday, holiday, anniversary, etc.</li>\n<li>Allow customers to include a note with a gift.</li>\n<li>When customers need to provide a guest&#8217;s name if purchasing tickets to an event.</li>\n<li>To indicate food preferences or allergies when food is included in the item being purchased, such as when booking a trip, or event.</li>\n<li>Find out how your customers heard about your store.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
