        "description": "<p>Free mini-extension for <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce Composite Products</a> that allows you to create dynamic, multi-layer Composite Product images that respond to option changes. The mini-extension leverages <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/composite-products/composite-products-advanced-configuration/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Scenarios</a> to conditionally layer additional images over the main Composite Product image.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>The plugin introduces a new &#8220;Overlay Image&#8221; Scenario Action that lets you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose an image from your Media library.</li>\n<li>Define <strong>conditions</strong> for layering this image over the main Composite Product image.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach makes it possible to utilize either <strong>swapping</strong> or <strong>compositing</strong> techniques to conditionally modify the main product image.</p>\n<p>For more information and examples, check out the plugin&#8217;s repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/somewherewarm/woocommerce-composite-products-conditional-images\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: The code in this plugin is provided &#8220;as is&#8221;. Support via the WordPress.org forum is provided on a <strong>voluntary</strong> basis only. If you have an active subscription for WooCommerce Composite Products, please be aware that WooCommerce Support may not be able to assist you with this experimental plugin.</p>\n<h4>Image Swapping</h4>\n<p>If you have previously worked with Variable Products and Variation Images, chances are you are already familiar with this technique. Here&#8217;s the idea behind image swapping:</p>\n<p>The main product image is <strong>swapped</strong> with an image that depicts the chosen options as soon as the configuration of the Composite Product is complete.</p>\n<p>Instead of replacing the product images, the same effect can be achieved by covering the main product image with a fully opaque (non-transparent) image.</p>\n<h4>Image Compositing</h4>\n<p><strong>Compositing</strong> is the combination of multiple layers of images into a single image. The final composition creates the illusion that all stacked images are parts of the same scene. For this technique to work, each layered image must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some <strong>transparent</strong> areas that allow lower layers of the stack to be seen;</li>\n<li>some <strong>opaque</strong> areas that introduce new elements in the scene by covering the layers below; and</li>\n<li>possibly, some <strong>semi-trasparent</strong> areas that introduce new elements while partially allowing the layers below to be seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: When multiple <strong>Overlay Image</strong> Scenarios exist, each adds its own image to the main product image stack. The layering order of these conditional images depends on the relative position of their Scenarios: If Scenario A is positioned higher than Scenario B under <strong>Product Data &gt; Scenarios</strong>, then the image added by Scenario A will appear higher in the stack than the image added by Scenario B.</p>\n<h4>Swapping vs Compositing</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Swapping</strong> technique is a viable choice if the number of Component Options is relatively low, as it requires you to <strong>capture one picture</strong> and <strong>create one Scenario</strong> for every possible configuration. Its main advantage over the <strong>Compositing</strong> technique is that it allows you to obtain a natural-looking result, even if you don&#8217;t have advanced image processing skills.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Compositing</strong> technique is often a better choice if the number of possible configurations is high, as it requires you to create one &#8220;compositable&#8221; image for each Component Option. However, specialized knowledge and tools are required to produce a natural-looking result. For this reason, the Compositing technique is often preferred when 3D product models are available, as 3D modelling software can speed up the production of &#8220;compositable&#8221; images.</p>\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>The product image cannot be opened in a lightbox once the mini-extension has stacked additional images over it.</li>\n<li>The image zooming feature included with WooCommerce is not compatible with the swapping/compositing techniques introduced by the mini-extension. When a Composite Product includes Scenarios with the <strong>Overlay Image</strong> Scenario Action, the image zooming feature of the Composite Product is disabled.</li>\n<li>The plugin works with themes that declare support for the <code>wc-product-gallery-slider</code> feature.</li>\n</ol>\n",
