With Ziteboard, you have infinite space to work on with your team in real-time regardless the device you use – a zoomable, vector-based, shared online whiteboard, which works on any device without needing to download anything. This combination of existing services in a single product is only available through our technology. Google Drive has the solution for documents and spreadsheets, and Ziteboard has it for visual communication.</p>\n<p>Public speakers, freelancers, designers, developers, teachers, managers, consultants as well as creative agencies use this infinite canvas to collaborate and discuss daily, to brainstorm and to see the big picture, a system design or a workflow. Using Ziteboard results in shorter and more effective meetings and better communication. Customer feedback states its quality in complementing both PowerPoint and Prezi presentations.</p>\n<p>Design any workflow, wireframe, prototype. <a href=\"https://ziteboard.com/whiteboard-collaboration-tool/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Explain, sketch, teach</a> anything. Do all this without downloading or installing anything and do it for free forever on any device.<br />\nUse this visual collaboration platform just as tens of thousands of remote teams, developers, designers do for meetings, project planning or customer communication.</p>\n<p>Boost any meeting, brainstorm, presentation, <a href=\"https://ziteboard.com/math-tutoring-whiteboard-collaboration/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tutoring or training</a>.
