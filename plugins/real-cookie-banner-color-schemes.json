Real Cookie Banner is quite complex with a lot of design options. If you want to assign a set of colors to the buttons and links you have to go through many sections with a lot settings. There is no option to change for example all button colors at once. This is what Color schemes does. It offers a single section only for the color settings. There you can setup a primary color, a secondary color, text colors and link colors. Color schemes changes the colors from the assigned objects. If you want to change a single color afterwards, you can easily do that inside the standard sections from Real Cookie Banner.</p>\n",
