However this plugin has been created<br />\nto make it easy for developers to extend it and make it work with other languages. This means that in the future, hopefully,<br />\nmore languages will be supported.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to write a summarizer for my language, how can I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You are more than welcome to extend the summarizer to handle more languages. Read the section <code>How to adapt the plugin<br />\nto summarize documents in other languages (for developers)</code> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
