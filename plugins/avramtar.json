        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload contents of <code>avramtar.zip</code> to <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Enjoy your new plugin</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>I have activated plugin but nothing happens?</h4>\n<p>Your theme might be incompatible with WP hooks so it won&#8217;t display AVrAmTAR avatars. In other words, you need to modify your theme so it can show avatars. You can do that in few simple steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open <code>/wp-content/themes/YOURTHEME/header.php</code> file and find &lt;head&gt; tag (it might be &lt;head something something..&gt;. </li>\n<li>Add this line BELOW &lt;head&gt; tag: &lt;?php avramtar_addcss(); ?&gt;</li>\n<li>If you want avatars to be automatically resized (recommended) then add following line below previous line: &lt;?php avramtar_addjs(); ?&gt;</li>\n<li>Save and close header.php file, then re-upload it.</li>\n<li>Open <code>/wp-content/themes/YOURTHEME/comments.php</code> file and find: &lt;?php comment_text() ?&gt;</li>\n<li>Add this line ABOVE it: &lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.avramtar.com/&#8221; title=&#8221;AVrAmTAR avatar&#8221;&gt;&lt;img src=&#8221;&lt;?php echo avramtar_wp(); ?&gt;&#8221; class=&#8221;avramtar&#8221; alt=&#8221;AVrAmTAR avatar&#8221; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</li>\n<li>Save and close comments.php file, then re-upload it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How to change dimensions of avatars?</h4>\n<p>Open <code>/wp-content/plugins/avramtar/avramtar_wp.js</code> and around line 9 find &#8220;var _resizeWidth  = 65;&#8221; Change the number (default: 65) to the width (in pixels) you need. The height of each avatar will be automatically resized to constraint proportions of image.</p>\n<p>If you want to define height of avatars and width to be automatically resized, then change value of _resizeWidth to &#8216;auto&#8217; (with apostrophes) and change value of _resizeHeight to the height (in pixels) you want (w/out apostrophes).</p>\n<p>If you want to define both width and height (not recommended) then change both values for _resizeWidth and _resizeHeight to the values (in pixels) you want (w/out apostrophes).</p>\n<p>After that, save and re-upload file avramtar_wp.js</p>\n<h4>How to change default avatar?</h4>\n<p>Open <code>/wp-content/plugins/avramtar/avramtar.php</code> and around line 33 find &#8220;<code>function avramtar_wp($default = '') {</code>&#8221;<br />\nand then insert full URL to your custom avatar between apostrophes. You will get something like <code>function avramtar_wp($default = 'http://mydomain.net/default-avatar.gif') {</code></p>\n<p>Then save and re-upload file avramtar.php</p>\n<h4>This plugin messes up my blog in IE6!?</h4>\n<p>Yes, I know, in most cases it does mess up blog in IE6. That&#8217;s because of tableless design of your blog, and IE just can&#8217;t handle tableless design without support for CSS2. So, enable CSS2 in IE6. How? Easy! Use set of javascripts found here (http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/) and add them to the header of your blog and everything should be fine.</p>\n<h4>&#8230;but, WP 2.5+ already has avatars&#8230;?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it does have avatars powered by Gravatar. But this plugin was made before WP 2.5 and it enables dynamic avatars from www.avramtar.com &#8211; with each refresh you get different avatar. That&#8217;s more fun \ud83d\ude42</p>\n"
