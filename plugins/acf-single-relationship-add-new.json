        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I need this plug-in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply, it provides a method to add new relationship items while editing a post or page, so you don&#8217;t have to leave your current screen to get a new item to show up.<br />\nEven if you were to add in a new window, the new item may not show up in the window you are working on. It is just a time saver, plain and simple.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why did you use Colorbox instead of Thickbox built into the WordPress Admin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The desire was to use Thickbox initially, but WordPress administration does some controlling of the size of the thickbox for the media upload and overriding these defaults<br />\nwould be problematic for site I was working on at the time and presumably other sites as well.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed post type not updating afer new version of ACF installed. New ACF version split files out and changed the manner of the javascript calls.<br />\nThis version should work for both old and new releases of ACF.</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<p>Fix bug when WordPress is installed in a subdirectory rather than the root. Thanks to Scott Nath for the fix.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Initial Release</p>\n"
