Both sites will check that the other site&#8217;s key is identical to their own key before they authorize syncing.</p>\n<p>On the target site you will need to enable Syncing (Write Permission) and on the source site you will need to enable Pushing (Read Permission).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How are the different site URLs handled?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As the sync process occurs, the source data is run through conversion filters which replace all instances of the source site&#8217;s URL with the target site&#8217;s URL.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WordSync doesn&#8217;t sync my data correctly!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordSync is still in ALPHA and as such we still need to iron out all the different syncing scenarios and it is impossible to be able to test all eventualities. If you find a bug, please open a support ticket on our GitHub page or even better, submit a pull-request which fixes the issue to our GitHub repo.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do both sites need to be online for syncing to work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but the source site needs to be accessible from the internet. So you can sync your localhost with a source site on the internet, but a site on the internet would not be able to sync with your localhost unless you set up your home internet to allow public connections to your localhost server.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
