        "faq": "\n<h4>What are all the shortcode parameters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Normaly you don&#8217;t need to change anything after the address has been protected.<br />\nHowever, depending on your current theme you might want to adjust the protected<br />\nemail address to fit the height of other text on your website.<br />\nWe give you flexibility to adjust the vertical alignment by adding inline_css parameter to the short code.<br />\nFor example:<br />\n&#8211; If text appears to be above the line, use inline_css=&#8221;padding-top:2px&#8221; to move the address 2 pixels lower.<br />\n&#8211; If line-spacing under the line with the email address appears to be greater than between other lines, use<br />\ninline_css=&#8221;margin-bottom:-4px&#8221; to reduce the height of the line with the email address by 4 pixels.<br />\nDefault value for bottom margin is &#8220;-3px&#8221; and it matches most of cases we tested the plugin with.<br />\nTypical short code looks like: [bg-hide-email-address]email@domain.com[/bg-hide-email-address]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use Hide Email Address to protect something other than email addresses?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, go ahead. Although we did not test such use cases extensively, we don&#8217;t see why not.<br />\nGet in touch with us in case there is something you tried and it did not work for you.<br />\nWe will address your issue as soon as possible.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
