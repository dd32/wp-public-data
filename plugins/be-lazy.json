Instead, these non-critical resources are loaded at the moment of need.»</em><br />\n&#8211; Jeremy Wagner, Google Developer</p>\n<p>In other words:<br />\nLazy loading images makes them being loaded asynchronously which makes it possible to load them conditionally (e.g. when they are within the visitors&#8217;s viewport). In doing so, you will prevent your visitors from downloading images they would never see anyway.</p>\n<h3>What are the advantages?</h3>\n<p>The main advantages for your visitors are:</p>\n<h4>1. Reduced page load time</h4>\n<p>Having to initially load less resources, naturally reduces the loading duration. This will be more noticeable the more images you have on your website and may have a critical impact on your visitors&#8217;s experience as well as your SEO ranking.</p>\n<h4>2. Smaller page size</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that your visitors will not scroll down to the very bottom of the page and therefore not load all images. Having to load a few images less might not be relevant on unlimited connections. For visitors browsing your website on limited plans however, you&#8217;ll prevent them from wasting their data allowances. Again, this is a factor influencing your SEO ranking.</p>\n<h3>Browser support</h3>\n<p>Be Lazy uses a polyfill for browsers not supporting the IntersectionObserver API by default. As a result, pretty much any browser is supported.</p>\n<p>✔ Google Chrome<br />\n✔ Mozilla Firefox<br />\n✔ Opera<br />\n✔ Microsoft Edge<br />\n✔ Microsoft Internet Explorer (7+)<br />\n✔ Safari (6+)<br />\n✔ Android Browser (4.4+)</p>\n",
