Crucially, the plugin delivers authentication with no third-party involvement or tracking between accounts. And when it comes to biometrics, FIDO and WebAuthn standards prevent this information from being stored and matched in servers – it never leaves the user’s device do not allow for any biometric data to be captured.</p>\n<h4>Browsers Supports</h4>\n<p>Passwordless WP is currently supported in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari web browsers on iOS 14 and BigSur, as well as Windows 10 and Android platforms.</p>\n<p>Passwordless WP requires HTTPS and SSL secure connection or localhost/127.0.0.1 environment.
