If in some file before the compression there were errors, then you need to find this file and fix it. To do this, open the browser console and fix the errors.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you provide plugin customization services for my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can order a paid plugin setting for your site. The cost is negotiated for each site separately. If you need assistance in setting up the plugin, please write to e-mail: info@anira-web.ru</p>\n</p>\n\n",
