If you are struggling figuring them out, you may need to speak with your LDAP administrator. I realize this is an obnoxious response, but there is no good, fool proof way to help you discover these settings. A good place to start, if you&#8217;re feeling daring, might be to use ADSIEdit for Windows and Active Directory, or GQ for Linux and OpenLDAP.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%27s%20still%20not%20working%2C%20what%20other%20things%20can%20i%20try%3F'>\nIt&#8217;s still not working, what other things can I try?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are confident your settings are correct and it still does not work, it may be time to check for port or firewall issues. If your LDAP server is running on a non-standard port or an obsolete version of the LDAP protocol you are going to have issues. Port 389 is the port this plugin, and nearly every other LDAP enabled software expects. They are also expecting protocol version 3. If you are using an old version of LDAP or running a non-standard port you may need to modify the code that the plugin runs or update your LDAP installation.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I can&#8217;t be relied upon to assist with these types of requests. I chose not to support these scenarios because they are infrequent and because they confuse everyone else.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%27s%20still%20not%20working%21%20how%20can%20i%20get%20help%3F'>\nIt&#8217;s still not working!
