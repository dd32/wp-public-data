This has a button to disable comments on old pages, but that is mainly for people who just forgot to install this to begin with.  It&#8217;s best to use this from the start and include it in your new-site setup routine.  This is targeted toward CMS users and Web Designers.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this different from the old plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only a Little.  If you just install it and leave the settings alone, it will continue to work the way you are familiar.  You may be interested in the mass-disable function on the settings page for when you already have comments on your pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set the preference to turn the default comment status for pages off or on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is located under Settings-&gt;Page Comments.  Enjoy!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is &#8216;Legacy Mode&#8217; for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is provided as a backup method for some themes or wordpress customizations prohibit the normal method of operation. If the plugin is not working, try legacy mode ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the mass-page-comment toggle link affect my posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  This only affects pages, regardless of the Page Comment Default checkboxes above.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility: Changed the way pre_option comment status is filtered to improve compatibility with other plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Added wp-recommended security catch to stop direct-access of plugin primary php file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Scripts only load when really needed, and using proper wp practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made confirmation dialog more verbose.</li>\n<li>Fixed mass-page toggle problem for users with custom db structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaced shaky Javascript hack with more integrated wp-php functions.</li>\n<li>Added Settings Page</li>\n<li>Added more prominent donate link ðŸ™‚</li>\n<li>Retained original functionality as &#8216;legacy mode&#8217;</li>\n<li>Added mass comment-disable for all pages.</li>\n<li>Made plugin into Object Class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version.
