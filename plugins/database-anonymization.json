        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20for%20all%20wordpress%20tables%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work for all WordPress tables?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does. Most transformations require that the table has a primary key of one column, except the all-purpose transformations <strong>One value</strong> and <strong>Empty</strong>. These can be used on any table.</p>\n<p>Transformations may have additional requirements with regard to the column length and type.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20cope%20with%20tables%20in%20wordpress%20that%20can%20basically%20contain%20any%20kind%20of%20data%3F'>\nHow does the plugin cope with tables in WordPress that can basically contain any kind of data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has special features to process meta data, JSON and serialized arrays stored in WordPress database tables.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20does%20the%20predefined%20fake%20data%20set%20originate%20from%3F'>\nWhere does the predefined fake data set originate from?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most lists originate from <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Chat GPT</a>, generated from a US / European perspective.<br />\nThe non-existing IBANs originate from <a href=\"http://randomiban.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Random Iban Generator</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20predefined%20fake%20data%20set%20used%20for%20anonymization%3F'>\nCan I change the predefined fake data set used for anonymization?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. In this Free version, it is not possible to customize this data. You need the Enterprise edition to do that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20transformation%20rules%3F'>\nCan I export transformation rules?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this Free version, it is not possible to export or import transformation rules.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20write%20my%20own%20rules%20for%20data%20stored%20by%20plugins'>\nDo I have to write my own Rules for data stored by plugins\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this Free version, you have to write those rules yourself. It&#8217;s not complicated, but it can take some time. The Enterprise edition has built-in rules for common plugins (see features above).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20transformation%20rules%20stored%3F'>\nWhere are the transformation rules stored?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These are stored in the WordPress options table.

As of version 2.0, this plugin can be used on live sites (production environments).<br />\nIt will anonymize a copy of the production database as a file that you can download.<br />\nYou can then import this file into another (dev / test) environment.</p>\n<p>On dev/test environments, this plugin will anonymize the database in place.<br />\nYou should <em>never</em> configure the plugin to anonymize data directly in a production database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20compliancy%20guaranteed%3F'>\nIs compliancy guaranteed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, most certainly not. This plugin can support you and your organization in becoming or staying compliant.<br />\nIt remains the responsibility of you and your organization to configure this plugin, to run it and to delete any back-ups that remain.<br />\nNext to that, there are many more aspects to data protection compliancy than PII anonymization of non-production databases.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
