        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20are%20decentralized%20identities%20%28dids%29%3F'>\nWhat are Decentralized IDentities (DIDs)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Decentalized IDentities are files that contain identifying information and public keys used to encrypt or sign tokens or content. Virtual Public Squares use the W3C Decentralized IDentity standard to attach provenance to content for distribution. Specifically, Virtual Public Squares use the <code>did:psqr</code> method.</p>\n<p>Further information on the standards is available at https://vpsqr.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20did%3Apsqr%20identity%3F'>\nHow do I create a did:psqr identity?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can generate DID:PSQR docs using the NodeJS command &#8220;psqr&#8221; (https://www.npmjs.com/package/psqr).<br />\nInstall &#8220;psqr&#8221; with the command</p>\n<pre><code>npm i -g psqr\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then run</p>\n<pre><code>psqr identity:create did:psqr:{domain}/author/{name} --name=\"Full Name\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The identity and public keys are visible with this command</p>\n<pre><code>psqr identity did:psqr:{domain}/author/{name} --all --verbose\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save the <code>didDoc</code> section as a JSON file.</p>\n<p>Note that your private keys are stored in your home directory.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20upload%20an%20identity%20document%3F'>\nHow do I upload an identity document?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Log in as an Admin and navigate to the user settings page.</p>\n<p>For each user that doesn&#8217;t have an identity document associated with them yet there should be an &#8220;Upload&#8221; button in the &#8220;DID&#8221; column. (&#8220;DID&#8221; means Decentralized IDentity.)</p>\n<p>Click the upload button and a modal dialog appears to select a file from your computer.</p>\n<p>Selection the appropriate json file and then click &#8220;Upload&#8221; in the modal.</p>\n<p>If there are any issues with the identity, like it is invalid or for a different person, a red alert section is displayed describing the issue. You can select another document and attempt it again.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20virtual%20public%20square%20content%20be%20deleted%3F'>\nCan Virtual Public Square Content be Deleted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Virtual Public Squares support two levels of content deletion &#8211; soft and hard deletes. Soft deletes are requested, and hard deletes are strongly recommended, typically for legal reasons. Those operating Virtual Public Squares are expected to delete any copies of content in either delete list.</p>\n<p>The internet is forever, though, and it is not possible to ensure that every copy of a portable file has been deleted. Provenance travels with the content, and is thus also potentially preserved by someone, somewhere.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
