        "faq": "\n<h4>Why Would I Want This?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you would like to create a widget from custom field text, this plugin is probably about the simplest way to do just that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it support multiple instances of the Widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet. However, it was designed to place the widget in the same place on different pages, and then use the custom field values to change it dynamically, depending on which post you were looking at.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which Custom Field values does the plugin respond to?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only &#8216;posty&#8217; and &#8216;posty-title&#8217;. The value of &#8216;posty-title&#8217; will be used to title the widget, and the value of &#8216;posty&#8217; will be used as the body. The custom field names should not include the single quotes (obviously).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to help with development of this Plugin!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The project is now hosted on <a href=\"http://github.com/xentek/posty-widget\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>.
