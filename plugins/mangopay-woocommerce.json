        "description": "<p>MANGOPAY is a payment solution which allows marketplaces to process third-party payments and collect their commissions in a secure and compliant environment. Our wordpress plugins enable an easy and fast integration to create a marketplace from start to finish and process payments.<br />\nPlugged to WC Vendors and WooCommerce’s plugins, the MANGOPAY WooCommerce plugin gives the ability to marketplaces hosted on WordPress to accept worldwide credit/debit card payments. It enables the management of vendors’ commissions within the wordpress interface, including payouts, transfers, and platform fees collection.</p>\n<p>Some key features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-currency support</li>\n<li>Handle international and local payment methods</li>\n<li>Seamlessly escrow and split funds between users</li>\n<li>Safeguard transactions with our fraud prevention tools and built-in anti-fraud engine</li>\n<li>White-label payment page</li>\n<li>PCI DSS, DSP2 and AML4 compliant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information please visit <a href=\"https://mangopay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MANGOPAY.COM</a></p>\n<h4>Plugin usage</h4>\n<p>The MANGOPAY plugin simply connects your WordPress with MANGOPAY’s API. The payment workflow is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1 : Vendors sign-up to the marketplace. An associated user is created in MANGOPAY’s environment.</li>\n<li>Step 2 : Vendors complete their profile with the right verification documents. The documents are verified by MANGOPAY’s compliance team. </li>\n<li>Step 3 : Products are assigned to vendors.</li>\n<li>Step 4 : An order is placed. E-money is stored in the buyer’s e-wallet.</li>\n<li>Step 5 : Vendors mark each product as dispatched.</li>\n<li>Step 6 : The marketplace operator marks the order as completed. Funds are now transferred from the buyer’s e-wallet to the vendor’s e-wallet. Marketplace commissions are collected here. </li>\n<li>Step 7 : The marketplace operator initiates the vendor payout. Funds are paid from the vendor’s e-wallet to his bank account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Documentation</h4>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://mangopay.com/mgp-wp-documentation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">document</a> will guide you through 3 plugin setups which will enable your marketplace to accept worldwide credit/debit card payments, manage vendors, payouts, transfers, and platform fees.</p>\n",

    "description": "<p>MANGOPAY is a payment solution which allows marketplaces to process third-party payments and collect their commissions in a secure and compliant environment. Our wordpress plugins enable an easy and fast integration to create a marketplace from start to finish and process payments.<br />\nPlugged to WC Vendors and WooCommerce’s plugins, the MANGOPAY WooCommerce plugin gives the ability to marketplaces hosted on WordPress to accept worldwide credit/debit card payments. It enables the management of vendors’ commissions within the wordpress interface, including payouts, transfers, and platform fees collection.</p>\n<p>Some key features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-currency support</li>\n<li>Handle international and local payment methods</li>\n<li>Seamlessly escrow and split funds between users</li>\n<li>Safeguard transactions with our fraud prevention tools and built-in anti-fraud engine</li>\n<li>White-label payment page</li>\n<li>PCI DSS, DSP2 and AML4 compliant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information please visit <a href=\"https://mangopay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MANGOPAY.COM</a></p>\n<h4>Plugin usage</h4>\n<p>The MANGOPAY plugin simply connects your WordPress with MANGOPAY’s API. The payment workflow is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1 : Vendors sign-up to the marketplace. An associated user is created in MANGOPAY’s environment.</li>\n<li>Step 2 : Vendors complete their profile with the right verification documents. The documents are verified by MANGOPAY’s compliance team. </li>\n<li>Step 3 : Products are assigned to vendors.</li>\n<li>Step 4 : An order is placed. E-money is stored in the buyer’s e-wallet.</li>\n<li>Step 5 : Vendors mark each product as dispatched.</li>\n<li>Step 6 : The marketplace operator marks the order as completed. Funds are now transferred from the buyer’s e-wallet to the vendor’s e-wallet. Marketplace commissions are collected here. </li>\n<li>Step 7 : The marketplace operator initiates the vendor payout. Funds are paid from the vendor’s e-wallet to his bank account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Documentation</h4>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://mangopay.com/mgp-wp-documentation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">document</a> will guide you through 3 plugin setups which will enable your marketplace to accept worldwide credit/debit card payments, manage vendors, payouts, transfers, and platform fees.</p>\n",
