        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20postmark%3F'>\nWhat is Postmark?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Postmark is a hosted service that expertly handles all delivery of transactional webapp and web site email. This includes welcome emails, password resets, comment notifications, and more. If you&#8217;ve ever installed WordPress and had issues with PHP&#8217;s mail() function not working right, or your WordPress install sends comment notifications or password resets to spam, Postmark makes all of these problems vanish in seconds. Without Postmark, you may not even know you&#8217;re having delivery problems. Find out in seconds by installing and configuring this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20my%20wordpress%20site%3F'>\nWill this plugin work with my WordPress site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin overrides any usage of the wp_mail() function. Because of this, if any 3rd party code or plugins send mail directly using the PHP mail function, or any other method, we cannot override it. Please contact the makers of any offending plugins and let them know that they should use wp_mail() instead of unsupported mailing functions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20cost%20me%20money%3F'>\nDoes this cost me money?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This Postmark plugin is 100% free. All new Postmark accounts include thousands of free email sends. Beyond your first free email sends, they will cost only $1.50 per 1000 sends with no monthly commitments and no expirations.</p>\n<p>Postmark will send you multiple warnings as you approach running out of send credits, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about paying for credits until you absolutely need them.</p>\n<p>Sign up for your free Postmark account at http://postmarkapp.com and get started now.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
