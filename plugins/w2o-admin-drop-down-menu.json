        "description": "<h3>THE POPULAR HORIZONTAL DROPDOWN MENU FOR WORDPRESS ADMIN</h3>\n<p>W2O Admin Dropdown Menu is a simple horizontal dropdown menu for WordPress Admin that eliminates the left menu and saves screen space. All the left menu links of wp admin are available in the form of horizontal dropdown menu (or say floating menu bar). It does not add additional horizontal dropdown menu like other plugin does. It simply uses the WordPress top menu bar (admin bar) to create the horizontal dropdown menu eliminating the admin&#8217;s left menu section. The beauty lies in the simplicity, isn&#8217;t it!</p>\n<h4>MAJOR FEATURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsive horizontal dropdown menu. Auto adjustable when there are many menus and overflows down.</li>\n<li>Uses WordPress default dashicons as menu icons (for parent menus). Also retains the original image as icon (like SVG, PNG) used by 3rd party plugins for their parent menu. But the plugin itself does not use any extra image. It maintains originality! </li>\n<li>Uses the selected WordPress Admin Color Scheme for its menu bar color, menu icons (dashicons) color, font color etc. Thus we call it &#8220;WordPress environment friendly&#8221; menu.</li>\n<li>Retains WordPress original &#8220;admin bar menu toggle&#8221; mechanism for Mobile devices.</li>\n<li>Finally, no headache to setup/configure any additional settings. Just install the plugin, activate it, and enjoy!!!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>ADDITIONAL FEATURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>With version 3.0 (and onwards), &#8220;W2O Admin Dropdown Menu&#8221; is compatible with &#8220;Admin Menu Editor&#8221; plugin as well. It works perfectly with the latest version of &#8220;Admin Menu Editor&#8221; plugin.</li>\n<li>Like before a feature to display &#8220;ICONS ONLY&#8221; as parent menus still exists in the plugin. To use this feature you simply need to set the value of &#8216;wpiconsonly&#8217; to 1 (i.e. from &#8216;wpiconsonly&#8217; =&gt; 0 to &#8216;wpiconsonly&#8217; =&gt; 1) in &#8220;core.php&#8221; at line number 261 (fyi, &#8220;core.php&#8221; resides inside your &#8220;/wp-content/plugins/w2o-admin-drop-down-menu/core/&#8221; directory).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like this plugin then why don&#8217;t you drop an email at shishir.adhikari@gmail.com saying &#8220;I loved it&#8230;&#8221;. I would really appreciate that.</p>\n",
