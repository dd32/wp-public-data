        "description": "<p>This plugins shows much more useful data than the default MemberPress reports. You can see how many of each membership (product) sold, payments made, coupons used, refunds given, and many other useful product sales data. Everything is also organized into a visual bar chart as well as data table.</p>\n<p>I built my own reports plugin because I got sick of waiting for MemberPress to update their default reports function. Currently, the default reports focus too much on transactional data like ‚Äúcompleted, pending, failed, refunded‚Äù, instead of more important sales data. I‚Äôve spoken to their founder and devs over the years, begging for certain features and laying out UI designs but they never got around to it. They&#8217;re too busy creating integrations to help attract new buyers, rather than making existing ones happier.</p>\n<p>The FREE version is already much better than the default MemberPress reports function (more sales data, and better report visualization). And the PRO version has even more awesome features&#8230;see below.</p>\n<h3>FREE FEATURES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More date ranges</strong> &#8211; the default MemberPress reports only show Month, Year, All-Time.
