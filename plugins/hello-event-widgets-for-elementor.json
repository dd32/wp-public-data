However, the Hello Event plugin provides many shortcodes that can be used on non-elementor pages. But doing this does not provide the same WYSIWYG experience as with Elementor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20more%20documentation%3F'>\nWhere can I find more documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Documentation is available at the plugin page: (https://www.tekomatik.com/plugins/hello-event-widgets-for-elementor)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20a%20demo%20site%3F'>\nWhere can I find a demo site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A basic demo site that shows the Hello Event plugin in action is available here: <a href=\"https://hello.tekomatik.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://hello.tekomatik.com&#8221;</a>. On this site, events are either shown with the default presentation provided by Hello Events, or in some examples using Elementor and the Hello Events Elementor Widgets.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
