        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions?<br />\nYes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 5.4!<br />\nIt also works great with WP 3.2 &#8211; and also should with WP 3.1 &#8211; but we only tested extensively with WP 3.3 and 3.2. So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.</li>\n</ol>\n",
