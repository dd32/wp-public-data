        "description": "<p>In addition to adding numerous extremely useful widgets for developers and users alike, this plugin is a system written on a PHP 5 object oriented structure. In short, it is built for modification and extension. It wraps the WordPress Widget API to allow for an alternative, and in my opinion more robust method to hook into and use it. Widgets are WordPress&#8217;s version of user interface modules. They already support an administrative and client-side view. This system simply leverages that with a higher potential in mind.</p>\n<p>This plugin started as a collection of widgets that I developed over time and used in numerous projects. I eventually merged them into one conglomerate which is now known as the &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; plugin. Currently I do not have extensive documentation on the plugin functionality and code-base yet.</p>\n<p>A Quick summary is that this plugin in its current state is a PHP widget class manager, as well as a collection of useful widget classes that build on each other for extended functionality. When the plugin is first activated, the widget classes included are not registered automatically, and will not appear within your WordPress widgets administration page. To activate your desired widgets you must go to the &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; Registration page. From there you can read a short description before registering anything.</p>\n<p>This plugin also comes with an Export and Import page. You will notice this functionality is very useful in backing up your current data of all your widgets and &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; settings. I felt this was a major necessity since while using &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; these little pieces of data suddenly turn into major aspects in the whole of your website. I needed to give an acceptable method of retrieving, backing up, and restoring that data if something bad happens.</p>\n<p>A quick summary of the most useful of the widgets included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Widget Group: Use this widget to create a new widget group, as a widget? Yes&#8230; this is where it gets interesting.</li>\n<li>Query Posts: A Widget than can create and use a sub-query or use the current global query and output the results in a view template.</li>\n<li>Context: More basic options that would be good for any widget, but this widget is specifically used for controlling where widgets appear.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Widgets</h3>\n<p>These are the widgets that come with this plugin. No widget here is pre-registered, this is to let you register them as needed. Each widgets builds on another&#8217;s functionality, and you may view the hierarchy from within the &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; registration page.</p>\n<h4>Widget Base</h4>\n<p>The base for &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; and not much on its own, it can still serve as a useful dynamic element.</p>\n<h4>Context</h4>\n<p>More basic options that would be good for any widget, but this widget is specifically used for controlling where widgets appear.</p>\n<h4>View</h4>\n<p>Use the view template control system and pass custom parameters to display data in any desired format.</p>\n<h4>Content</h4>\n<p>Use this widget to enter any data (ex: text/HTML/XML/JavaScript) and optionally access it within in a view template.</p>\n<h4>Date</h4>\n<p>Use this widget to select a view template and handle any arbitrary date.</p>\n<h4>Widget Group</h4>\n<p>Use this widget to create a new widget group, as a widget? Yes&#8230; this is where it gets interesting.</p>\n<h4>Query Posts</h4>\n<p>A Widget than can create and use a sub-query or use the current global query and output the results in a view template.</p>\n<h4>QP Extended</h4>\n<p>This is an extended version of the Query Posts widget with a controlled form.</p>\n<h4>Twitter</h4>\n<p>Use this widget to retrieve statuses from a specified twitter account.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>extensible-widgets</code> directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; administration page to configure settings and to register desired widgets</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why PHP 5?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is what the codebase is written for, it is not going to change. Sorry, welcome to the future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What exactly is an extensible widget&#8217;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is a PHP widget class built within the parameters of the &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; framework for widgets. Any extensible widget can be extended, but retain the functionality of all the parent classes that it may extend. &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; also provides administration to allow for users to control this functionality within the UI of that widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is widget registration?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The term &#8216;registered widget&#8217; is not necessarily what is added to your widgetized areas. Instead this is like the blue-print for those instances. When you register a widget, what you are doing is allowing for instances of that widget to be created and added to your areas from that registered blue-print. Beware! When you unregister a widget, all instances that were added across all widgetized areas automatically disappear. You can get them back, but I don&#8217;t suggest unregistering something unless you are really sure you want to.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do the widgets depend on each other, do I need to activate one with another?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, and no. They do depend on each other, but this is on the PHP side of things, and in no way important to the registration of the widgets in the administration pages. Basically you can register the &#8216;Widget Group&#8217; widget, without having to register the &#8216;Widget Base&#8217; widget, or any other of it&#8217;s PHP dependencies.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; right for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Honestly this is a pretty advanced plugin that I would say is mostly for developers. Though I am trying to make it easier for developers to control the capabilities of the widget included with &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; to make it less developer centric on a per user basis (role/capability level).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217; right for my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Numerous times I need a way to put the same content in different places around my site. This content is usually represented as posts, pages, or basically anything. I developed this plugin as the answer to this problem, using the already built WordPress Widgets framework. Widgets made sense to use because of their very nature. If you are looking to answer a lot of these same problems I was having, then this plugin will serve you well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about the data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you start using this plugin, you will notice that widgets will become a major part in the whole of your website. Because of this fact, I included Import/Export functionality for the settings of &#8216;Extensible Widgets&#8217;, and all of your widget data from WordPress itself.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
