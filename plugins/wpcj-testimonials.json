        "description": "<p>This plugin helps you manage a list of testimonials that you can place anywhere in your blog using shortcodes, php calls or widgets.</p>\n<p>Optionally, you can specify what &#8220;product&#8221; a given testimonial is refering to so basically you can use this plugin to present testimonials about different products or services.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>The easiest way to install it is using the WordPress build-in installation feature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for wpCJ Testimonials</li>\n<li>Click on Install</li>\n<li>Then click on Activate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you prefer to use the old fashion way then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the plugin zip file, </li>\n<li>Uncompress it anywhere in your hard disk and then </li>\n<li>Upload it to your plugin directory.</li>\n<li>Visit the Plugins page of your WordPress installation, </li>\n<li>Locate wpCJ Testimonials in the plugin list and * Click on Activate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you have activate it, a new option is added to your WordPress Settings module named wpCJ Testimonials and a new widget as well.</p>\n<p>In the plugins page, you will find four options to set:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Template:</strong> This setting is used to specify the &#8220;layout&#8221; of a testimonial. You can use a pure HTML template or, much better, a CSS powered template. It&#8217;s up to you, just be sure to include the pseudo-tags that the plugin provides ([CLIENT] [COMPANY] [LCOMPANY] [WEBSITE] and [TESTIMONIAL]).</li>\n<li><strong>Link Attribute:</strong> You can specify if the links that the plugin create based on the website of the clients, will have the attribute rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; or not.</li>\n<li><strong>Max. Size for images:</strong> (still not used but) It specify the maximum weight in KB that an image can be.</li>\n<li><strong>Zap Me!:</strong> It just tell the plugin that you want to completelly uninstall the plugin so the next time it gets deleted, it delete any trace of the plugin from your WordPress installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have set the configuration settings of the plugin, it will allow you to introduce the testimonials.</p>\n<p><strong>Handling Testimonials</strong></p>\n<p>The Manage Testimonials page have two section: An upper section where you add or edit testimonials and a lower section showing the current list of testimonials.</p>\n<p>There are two mandatory fields for any testimonial: Client and Testimonial.</p>\n<p>Optionally you can especify the client&#8217;s company, its website and an image.</p>\n<p>There is a field named &#8220;Product&#8221;. This field is useful if you want to store different testimonials for different products or services. All you have to do is especify a unique &#8220;product key&#8221; for every object you want to store testimonials to. Or leave it blank if they are not useful to you.</p>\n<p>If you need to edit a testimonial, click on the Client Name in the Testimonial List and then proceed to edit it. Click on Save Changes when you are done and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p><strong>Showing Testimonials</strong></p>\n<p>wpCJ Testimonials allows you to show your testimonials in every possible way allowed by WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shortcodes:</strong> If you need to add a list of testimonials to any post or page, use the shortcode [wpcjt]. It has three optional parameters: limit, product and id. Limit define the number of testimonials to be show (default 1), Product defines the criteria to use when the plugin choose the testimonials to show and ID a certain testimonial to show (or the latest $limit testimonials if you use &#8216;last&#8217; as id. I.e.- <strong>[wpcjt limit=&#8221;3&#8243; product=&#8221;wpCJ&#8221;]</strong> or <strong>[wpcjt limit=&#8221;3&#8243; id=&#8221;last&#8221;]</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>Widgets:</strong> If you need to show a testimonial box in any of your sidebars, just add a wpCJ Testimonials widget to it. This widget needs three parameters: Title, Number of Testimonials, Product and ID. They are pretty self-explanatories&#8230; or not?</li>\n<li><strong>PHP Calls:</strong> Just in case you need to add testimonials to your themes, we have provided an option to do so. Just add the following code to your theme: <strong><code>&lt;?php if ( function_exists('wpcjt') ) wpcjt($limit,$product,$limit); ?&gt;</code></strong></li>\n</ul>\n",
