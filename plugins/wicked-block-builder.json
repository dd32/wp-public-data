        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20there%20documentation%3F'>\nIs there documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!  You can <a href=\"https://wickedplugins.com/support/wicked-block-builder/?utm_source=readme&amp;utm_campaign=wicked_block_builder&amp;utm_content=documentation_faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">view the documentation here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20block%20pattern%3F'>\nHow do I create a block pattern?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When editing a page, select the blocks that you want to convert to a pattern, click the three dots in the toolbar that appears above the blocks, and select &#8216;Save as pattern&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20know%20html%20or%20css%20to%20use%20wicked%20block%20builder%3F'>\nDo I have to know HTML or CSS to use Wicked Block Builder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no programming or HTML editing required but a basic understanding of HTML and CSS will go a long way.  Blocks are created by dragging and dropping HTML elements to form the HTML structure of your block.  So it does help to have a basic understanding of how HTML tags work and are nested.  You don‚Äôt need to know CSS to create a block but you‚Äôll be able to take your blocks farther and make them look better with a little bit of knowledge.  The good news is that both are easy to learn!  If you‚Äôre just getting started, check out <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/58-html-css-the-very-basics/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HTML &amp; CSS ‚Äì The VERY Basics</a> from css-tricks.com.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20seeing%20%E2%80%9Cthis%20block%20contains%20invalid%20or%20unexpected%20content%E2%80%9D%20when%20my%20block%20is%20loaded%20in%20the%20editor%3F'>\nWhy am I seeing ‚ÄúThis block contains invalid or unexpected content‚Äù when my block is loaded in the editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This happens when the HTML of your block has unexpectedly changed.  This can happen for a number of reasons including: you made changes to the structure of your block; the HTML of the block was changed after it was saved (for example, perhaps a filter ran that added an extra HTML attribute to one of your tags).  You can <a href=\"https://wickedplugins.com/support/wicked-block-builder/troubleshooting/this-block-contains-unexpected-or-invalid-content/?utm_source=readme&amp;utm_campaign=wicked_block_builder&amp;utm_content=invalid_content_faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">read more about how to troubleshoot this issue in the documentation</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20limit%20to%20the%20number%20of%20blocks%20i%20can%20create%3F'>\nIs there a limit to the number of blocks I can create?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you can create as many blocks as you want.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20blocks%20keep%20working%20if%20i%20deactivate%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWill my blocks keep working if I deactivate the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not really.  Your blocks will still appear on the front-end; however, if you used the styled editor in the block builder to add your block‚Äôs CSS, your blocks will not appear correctly.  Also, you will see an error if you try to edit a page containing one of your blocks.  If you just need to deactivate Wicked Block Builder temporarily though, your blocks will still be there when you reactivate the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20export%20and%20import%20blocks%3F'>\nCan I export and import blocks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, blocks can be exported and imported by going to Wicked Block Builder &gt; Home.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20blocks%20be%20synced%20to%2Ffrom%20json%3F'>\nCan blocks be synced to/from JSON?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Simply create a folder named wbb-json in your theme and make sure the folder is writable.  Blocks will automatically be saved to JSON when the wbb-json folder exists.  <a href=\"https://wickedplugins.com/support/wicked-block-builder/json-sync/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about syncing blocks to JSON in the documentation</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
