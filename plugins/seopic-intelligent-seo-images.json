        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20seopic%3F'>\nWhat is Seopic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Seopic is a free WordPress plugin that optimizes your images for search engines. It automatically generates <strong>optimized file names</strong> for your images and updates the path of your images in the post or page content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20seopic%20easy%20to%20use%3F'>\nIs Seopic easy to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Seopic requires no technical knowledge or experience with SEO to use. Simply install the plugin, and let Seopic handle the rest.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20seopic%20work%3F'>\nHow does Seopic work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Seopic renames your images when <strong>the alt text is edited or added</strong> to a default WordPress media block, such as <strong>Image</strong>, <strong>Gallery</strong>, <strong>Cover</strong>, or <strong>Media &amp; Text</strong>. It also supports <strong>Featured Images</strong> of posts. The original image is saved in the media library, and a new copy of the image with a newly generated, optimized file name is created. Seopic then automatically updates the path of your optimized image in the post or page content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20seopic%20support%20all%20image%20formats%3F'>\nDoes Seopic support all image formats?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Seopic supports all popular image formats, including <strong>JPEG</strong>, <strong>SVG</strong>, <strong>WEBP</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong>, <strong>GIF</strong>, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20file%20format%20seopic%20generates%3F'>\nWhat is the file format Seopic generates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses for the file name format the alt text of the media, ending with a random 14 chars. For example, if your media has alt text <strong>&#8220;Grassy hills near mountains&#8221;</strong> then the generated file name can have format <strong>grassy-hills-near-mountains-bmu7yhxaluhkhm.jpg</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20benefits%20of%20using%20seopic%3F'>\nWhat are the benefits of using Seopic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Seopic improves your search engine rankings by optimizing your images for search engines, increasing your visibility and driving more traffic to your website. It also saves you time by <strong>automating the image optimization process</strong> and is easy to implement and manage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20still%20access%20my%20original%20images%20after%20using%20seopic%3F'>\nCan I still access my original images after using Seopic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Seopic <strong>saves the original images</strong> in your media library, so you can still access them if needed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20it%20take%20longer%20to%20rename%20images%20with%20seopic%3F'>\nWhy does it take longer to rename images with Seopic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The time it takes to rename images with Seopic depends on two factors: <strong>the number of images</strong> in a post or page, and <strong>the size of the image files</strong>. If a post or page contains a large number of images or if the image files are large in size, it may take longer to rename all of the images. However, Seopic is designed to be fast and efficient, and in most cases, the image renaming process should be quick and seamless.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20seopic%20regularly%20updated%3F'>\nIs Seopic regularly updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Seopic is updated regularly to stay ahead of the latest SEO trends and algorithms, ensuring that your images are always optimized for the best possible results.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
