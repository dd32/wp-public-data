If interested in new features, please upgrade into this compatible replacement: https://wit.rs/wp-plugins/wit-custom-output<br />\nAfter uninstalling the WPCHTMLP and installing WIT Custom Output, your old custom pages will still work, but with better interface, more features and regular updates.</p>\n<p>WP Custom HTML Pages plugin has two functionalities:</p>\n<p>1 &#8211; Create a custom HTML document output at a custom permalink address, completely bypassing WordPress templating. This is useful in cases when you just want to output some HTML without uploading the page to the server.</p>\n<p>2 &#8211; Create a shortcode which outputs your custom HTML.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Download from the repository (by searching for \\&#8221;WP Custom HTML Pages Milos Stojanovic\\&#8221;) and activate.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: Why would I need this plugin just to show an HTML page?<br />\nA:  So you can easily display your custom HTML pages without bothering to upload the page to the server. It is useful in cases when you don\\&#8217;t have access to your hosting FTP server, or if .htaccess rules are giving you trouble to link to the page. Also, you get a pretty URI to the page rather than having to link directly to the .html document.</p>\n<p>Q: Does WP Custom HTML Pages work with multisite WordPress?<br />\nA:  It does, as of version 0.6.</p>\n<p>Q: Can this plugin do this or that..<br />\nA:  WITCO, the new release, probably can, as many of its options are built based on previous user requests. On the other hand, if all you need is a tiny plugin that will output some custom HTML, you may want to stick with WPCHTMLP.</p>\n<p>Q: Is this plugin a security concern?<br />\nA:  The WPCHTMLP plugin is by itself is as secure as the WordPress installation it is hosted on. However, if the website gets hacked, or you allow strangers to add custom pages, the plugin may become a point of phishing attacks or other hacking mischiefs.</p>\n<p>Upgrade to WITCO questions:</p>\n<p>Q: If I replace this plugin with WIT Custom Output, will my old pages and settings be preserved?<br />\nA:  Yes, just go to WPCHTMLP Settings and make sure that &#8220;Completely remove database tables..&#8221; is set to OFF, then uninstall WPCHTMLP and install WITCO.</p>\n<p>Q: If I had custom changes in code implemented in WPCHTMLP, how hard would it be to implement the same changes in WITCO?<br />\nA:  Depends, WITCO is a new plugin built on different code base, yet some pieces of code are similar. But then again, some of the features you implemented may be available in WITCO out of the box. If you wish to transfer your changes, hire a coder or contact us. If you code the features yourself, and don&#8217;t like OOP frameworks, it may be a better choice to stick with WPCHTMLP.</p>\n",
