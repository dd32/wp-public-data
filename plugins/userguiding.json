        "installation": "<h4>Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your site. To do a manual install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu, click Add New, click Upload (top links) and finally select the downloaded file.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Do we collect critical information?<br />\nWe do not collect information about you or your server.</p>\n<p>Do my users have to install anything?<br />\nNo, only the guide creators have to download our Chrome extension.</p>\n<p>Does UserGuiding have mobile support?<br />\nCurrently, no. We plan to support mobile browsers and devices in 2020.</p>\n<p>Does UserGuiding load before or after my website&#8217;s content?<br />\nUserGuiding loads after your website&#8217;s content and works asynchronously. So it won&#8217;t make your website work slower.</p>\n<p>Can I create multilingual onboarding flows with UserGuiding?<br />\nYes! You can create &#8220;themes&#8221; with UserGuiding for different languages and segment &amp; target correct people with their browser language.</p>\n",
