What gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are at least three reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>To see the better metabox, the logged-in user must have the <code>edit_others_posts</code> capability.  If you can&#8217;t edit other people&#8217;s posts, you shouldn&#8217;t be able to change a post&#8217;s author, right?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You need to choose the post types where the plugin should be enabled.  <strong>None are enabled by default.</strong>  If a post type hasn&#8217;t been enabled, it will use the default metabox.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve enabled a post type to use the better metabox, but still only see authors, select additional user roles to make sure they&#8217;re included in the dropdown.  This is especially useful for custom roles you&#8217;ve created.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I exclude certain users without using roles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t support that directly, but there is a filter (<code>bam_wp_dropdown_users</code>) that works just like the core <code>wp_dropdown_users</code> filter to let you edit its HTML before output.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
