        "faq": "<h4>How do I get help or support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>In short, very easily. But before you read any further, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.vicchi.org/2012/03/31/asking-for-wordpress-plugin-help-and-support-without-tears/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Asking For WordPress Plugin Help And Support Without Tears</a> before firing off a question. In order of preference, you can ask a question on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/wp-nokia-auth?forum_id=10\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress support forum</a>; this is by far the best way so that other users can follow the conversation. You can ask me a question on Twitter; I&#8217;m <a href=\"http://twitter.com/vicchi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@vicchi</a>. Or you can drop me an email instead. I can&#8217;t promise to answer your question but I do promise to answer and do my best to help.</p>\n<h4>Is there a web site for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>Absolutely. Go to the <a href=\"http://www.vicchi.org/codeage/wp-nokia-auth/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Nokia Auth home page</a> for the latest information. There&#8217;s also the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-nokia-auth/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress plugin repository page</a> and the <a href=\"http://vicchi.github.com/wp-nokia-auth/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source for the plugin is on GitHub</a> as well.</p>\n<h4>Nokia Maps? Really?</h4>\n<p>Yes. Really. At the time of writing (April 2012) 196 countries, 75M Places, 2.4M map changes a day. That sort of really. All available through a set of developer friendly APIs.</p>\n<h4>OK. Nokia Maps. I get it. But why register?</h4>\n<p>The Nokia Location APIs work if you don&#8217;t register. But they work even better and you can do even more if you do register. Take transactional limits. Unregistered users of the Location APIs get 1 million transactions over a lifetime. 1 million sounds a lot but it soon mounts up. Registered users get 2 million transactions. <em>Per month</em>. <a href=\"http://www.developer.nokia.com/Develop/Maps/Quota/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plus a whole lot more</a>.</p>\n<h4>Why are you so pro Nokia Maps?</h4>\n<p>A disclaimer is in order. I work for Nokia&#8217;s Location &amp; Commerce group, that produces Nokia Maps. I see what goes into the map and what gets displayed. I&#8217;m very pro Nokia Maps for just this reason.</p>\n<h4>I want to amend/hack/augment this plugin; can I do the same?</h4>\n<p>Totally; this plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLV2). See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt for the full license terms.</p>\n",
