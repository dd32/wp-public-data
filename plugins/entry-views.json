        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uzip the <code>entry-views.zip</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Upload the <code>entry-views</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>\n<li>Activate <em>Entry Views</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin was originally created as a script for use with some of my themes.  However, it&#8217;s not a good idea to package something like this with a theme because it&#8217;d stop working when switching between themes.  Therefore, the script was ported over into a plugin for everyone to use, regardless of the theme they&#8217;re using.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As soon as you install and activate the plugin, it&#8217;ll start tracking post views immediately.  From that point, you can use the &#8220;Entry Views&#8221; widget in one of your theme&#8217;s sidebars to display the most viewed posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I show the view count for each post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can certainly do this.  It will require editing your theme&#8217;s templates and inserting a simple line of code within The Loop.  You&#8217;ll need to enter the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if ( function_exists( 'ev_post_views' ) ) ev_post_views(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>What post types does this plugin support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, it supports the following post types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post</li>\n<li>Page</li>\n<li>Media/Attachment</li>\n<li>Portfolio Item &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-portfolio\" rel=\"ugc\">Custom Content Portfolio Plugin</a></li>\n<li>Restaurant Item &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant\" rel=\"ugc\">Restaurant Plugin</a></li>\n<li>Recipe &#8211; Upcoming recipe plugin</li>\n<li>Literature &#8211; Upcoming literature/writing plugin</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Will you add support for other post types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I definitely will.  If you give me the name of the post type or of the plugin that you use, I will be more than happy to add support for it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add support for a custom post type?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can absolutely do this.  If you&#8217;re registering the post type yourself, simply add support for <code>entry-views</code> in your <code>supports</code> array.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re adding support for a post type that you&#8217;re not registering, add the following code to your plugin file or theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>add_action( 'init', 'my_register_post_type_support' );\n\nfunction my_register_post_type_support() {\n    add_post_type_support( 'your_post_type_name', 'entry-views' );\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>What features do you plan to add in the future?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One feature I&#8217;d like to add is to the admin area.  It&#8217;d be neat to show each post&#8217;s views on the edit posts screen and even allow you to sort the posts by number of views.</p>\n<p>Other features are really up to you all.  If you have a feature request, please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you help me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I cannot provide free support for this plugin to everyone.  I honestly wish I could.  My day job requires too much of my time for that, which is how I pay the bills and eat.  However, you can sign up for my <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support forums</a> for full support of this plugin, all my other plugins, and all my themes for one price.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
