This makes it impossible for a person to accidentally break your site&#8217;s layout of functionality by putting a post in multiple categories.</p>\n<p>If you have many contributors and don&#8217;t have the resources for a thorough editorial flow with checks and rechecks, the plugin is an easy quick way to make sure your standard is maintained without taking a lot of time correcting mistakes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin live-swaps check boxes for radio button before the pages are sent to users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any options?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not currently. If they ever make sense — if for example we were to add the option to use it one all hierarchical taxonomies — it may possibly get one.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
