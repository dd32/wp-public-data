        "description": "<p>So you’ve got an amazing book, and you want an easy way to market it on your web site?  Now you can!  The TotallyBooked plugin helps you present your books to readers in a classy, appealing way, while also supporting the book buyers and local bookstores who carry your book.</p>\n<h3>HOW IT WORKS:</h3>\n<p>Add your books to the TotallyBooked plugin, then organize them by genre, series, or even by author (if you have a co-writer).</p>\n<p>Find the direct links to your book for eleven major online booksellers (Amazon, Audible, Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-A-Million, Christianbook, Google Play, Indiebound, iTunes, Kobo, Smashwords, and Sony Reader Store) and paste them in our link boxes.</p>\n<p>Wondering why we’ve included all these sellers rather than just an Amazon button?  Because book buyers at some of these sellers will refuse to stock your books, if you don’t have a link to their site included on yours.  We want to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.</p>\n<p>Have an affiliate account at one or more of these sites?  No problem.  Build your affiliate link in the bookseller’s system first, then paste it into the applicable box in our system, and start earning affiliate credit immediately.</p>\n<p>Once you’re done, our plugin generates a gorgeous Buy this Book section, with all your bookseller links displayed.</p>\n<p>And that’s not all.  We’ve heard first-hand stories from authors about local bookstores refusing to host book-signing events, because that author only included links to online retailers on their site.  To protect you from that, our system also generates a local bookstore search, connected directly to Google maps.   This shows your support for local bookstores, and helps readers find a nearby store where they can buy or request your title.</p>\n<p>Last, our system automatically generates a page for each of your books, plus a page for each series, and page for each genre.</p>\n<h3>WHAT IF I ALREADY HAVE BOOKS PAGES ON MY SITE?</h3>\n<p>Many authors have already created pages on their web site for their books.  We know you’ve worked hard to build your existing pages, and we don’t think you should have to delete them all, just to use our system.   Plus, deleting your existing pages will break any inbound links to those pages from reviewers, book bloggers, etc, and generate 404 page errors for the search engines.  THAT is never a good thing.</p>\n<p>Besides the auto-generated pages the plugin creates, our system also allows you to embed your books via shortcode, on your existing pages.  You can embed your books by series, by genre, or book by book, on any of your existing pages or in a blog post.</p>\n<p>Ready to get started?  Click the download button now.  Have comments or feature requests?  <a href=\"http://www.tigerstrikemedia.com/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">We’d love to hear from you</a>.  Oh, and our premium version of this plugin is releasing soon.  Watch this space for details.</p>\n<h3>Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>You can use the following shortcodes to display your books on your site.</p>\n<p>You can also display a gallery of a genre with the shortcode (You can grab this directly from the genre list page)<br />\n    [tb_genre_gallery slug=&#8221;the-genre-slug&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Or a series with the shortcode (You can grab this directly from the series list page)<br />\n    [tb_series_gallery slug=&#8221;the-series-slug&#8221;]</p>\n<p>You can display a book anywhere on your site like this (You can grab this directly from the book edit page)<br />\n    [tb_book id=&#8221;ID&#8221;]</p>\n<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>\n<p>We have developed Totally Booked from the ground up to be friendly and easy to use for both developers (Or your web guy) and authors who have better things to do (like writing the next national bestseller!) than to mess with plugins and settings on their website for hours or days on end.</p>\n<p>Out of the box it just works (If it doesn&#8217;t, please <a href=\"http://www.tigerstrikemedia.com/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Let Us Know</a>) but if you want to change things, you can by taking advantage of the following advanced functionality.</p>\n<h3>Templating</h3>\n<p>Advanced users or WordPress programmers can completely template the entire frontend output of the plugin.</p>\n<p>Simply create the following directory in your current theme: <code>THEME_PATH/plugins/totally-booked/</code></p>\n<p>Into that, copy the file you need to modify into the above directory from the <code>totally-booked/templates</code> directory in the plugin directory, ensuring you keep the directory structure in the plugin.</p>\n<p>EG: Say you wanted to modify the <code>gallery.php</code> file, you would need to copy that file to <code>THEME_PATH/plugins/totally-booked/loops/gallery.php</code>.</p>\n<p>Ensuring that you never modify the plugins files will make sure that your changes are not lost when you need to upgrade the plugin.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ul>\n<li>Download the zip</li>\n<li>Upload to the wp-content/plugins directory on your site</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the plugins page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like some help to install the plugin and would like a professional to integrate it with your theme and make any tweaks to the layout, Please <a href=\"http://www.tigerstrikemedia.com/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact Us</a> and we can arrange installation and integration from as little as $35 AUD.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Other plugin developers make authors pay for these features.  Why are you giving this plugin away for free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’ve worked with the author community for years, and we think authors are awesome.  We want to see them succeed, and believe in paying it forward.  We are releasing a paid version of our plugin that has even more features, but we believe every author should have the basics included in our free version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why have you included so many online booksellers?  Isn’t that overkill?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’ve included multiple online retailers, because book buyers at some of these sites will refuse to stock your books if you don’t have a link to their site included on yours. We want to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have an affiliate account with Amazon (or one of the other booksellers you’ve included), will it work with your system?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely.  Build your affiliate link in the bookseller’s system first, then paste it into the applicable box in our system, and start earning affiliate credit immediately.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I already have books pages on my site.  Do I have to delete them to use your system?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all! Deleting your existing pages will break any inbound links to those pages from reviewers, book bloggers, etc, and generate 404 page errors for the search engines.  THAT is never a good thing.</p>\n<p>Besides the auto-generated pages the plugin creates, our system also allows you to embed your books via shortcode, on your existing pages.  You can embed your books by series, by genre, or book by book, on any of your existing pages or in a blog post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to link to other resources for my book (discussion guide, interview, video trailer, etc) can I do that with your plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You bet.  We offer a Reader Extras section, where you can add as many additional links as you need.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I’ve added all my books to TotallyBooked, but I want to change the books’ display order on my pages. Is this possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. We’ve set up our system to work seamlessly with the Simple Page Ordering plugin (you can find it here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/) which will give you everything you need to make this happen. Install Simple Page Ordering to your plugins folder, then go to your Books page within the TotallyBooked system, and drag and drop your books into the order you’d like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I love your system, but I’d really like to change the way the book cover, reader extras, links, etc. display on my site.  Can I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You bet you can! To customize the layout, use the templating functionality we’ve built-in to the system. (Note: Some coding expertise is required for these changes, so if code is not your forte, ask your web manager or favorite programmer for help). Instructions for templating the plugin layout can be found <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/totally-booked/other_notes/#Advanced-Usage\" rel=\"ugc\">Here</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
