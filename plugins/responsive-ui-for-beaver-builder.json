You can control these via the &#8216;Advanced&#8217; tab in row, column and module settings in the &#8216;Visibility&#8217; section. Which is great, but the only problem is you can&#8217;t then see which elements are hiding and showing until you click on each of their settings.</p>\n<p>In order to see which modules, columns and rows are showing/hiding, edit any page with Beaver Builder and you will see the &#8220;UI&#8221; button appear in the top bar. Click on that to see which elements you have with Visibility settings and which devices they are set to.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
