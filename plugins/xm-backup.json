        "faq": "\n<h4>The backups aren&#8217;t emailed to me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Switch to FTP delivery instead of using the email option. FTP is the best way to deliver large files and the<br />\nemail options should really only be used for small new blogs, or if you ONLY backup a small WordPress database<br />\n(less than 1 Mb in size).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I get errors creating the ZIP file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need of course to have PHP compiled with ZIP. Ask your web hoting provider to compile PHP with ZIP for you<br />\nor check out this blog post from <a href=\"http://www.xaviermedia.com/webbing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Xavier Media&reg;</a> where it&#8217;s showed how you can do it on your own server using<br />\ncPanel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I get maximum memory allocated error! Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have too little memory in your server to do a backup of that many/large files. This is usually a problem for people<br />\nhosting on a shared hosting account where the hosting company is using a cheap server with little memory. Select fewer<br />\nfiles to backup, or switch to only backup the database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My mailbox gets full!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this is a problem if you have large files emailed to you. Try cleaning up the old backups, or switch to FTP<br />\ndelivery of the backups.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I suggest a new feature or report a bug?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit our support forum at http://www.xavierforum.com/php-&amp;-cgi-scripts-f3.html</p>\n</p>\n\n",
