To avoid pushing a new<br />\nplugin version every week or two, a remote repository is maintained with up-to-date chalkboard gags<br />\n(within a week or two).</p>\n<p>If this remote repository is ever down for any reason, the plugin also includes a local<br />\ndatabase with all of the chalkboard gags up to the most recent release of the plugin.</p>\n",

Please disable or uninstall <strong>Hello Dolly</strong> before using this plugin for best results.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> No longer using Pastebin to handle updates. Pulling updates directly from WP.org plugin repository.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Updated to WordPress 4.0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Plugin now better handles downtime for remote retrival of chalkboard gags.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Very minor change to help better debug any potential issues that users may have.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Plugin now utilizes a WordPress core wrapper function (<code>wp_remote_get</code>) to <strong>reliably</strong> retrieve<br />\nthe remote chalkboard gags without breaking.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> A few minor changes were made to how the chalkboard gags are stored, making the plugin faster.</li>\n<li><strong>Change:</strong> The alert that <strong>Hello Dolly</strong> is active was removed. User can decide whether they want both running or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Plugin now performs <strong>much</strong> more efficiently by storing most up-to-date.<br />\nchalkboard gags in your local database. A daily update checks for more Chalkboard Gags to display.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Plugin now alerts user on activation if <strong>Hello Dolly</strong> is active (since the two<br />\nplugins do not look good running side-by-side).</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> This release also provides much cleaner code for anyone interested in looking<br />\nat the backend.</li>\n<li><strong>Bug Fix:</strong> Minor typo corrections in readme and plugin documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial Release:</strong> Supports display of random Chalkboard Gag within the admin panel <strong>and</strong> through<br />\nuse of the <code>[simpsons]</code> shortcode in any page or post.</li>\n</ul>\n"
