        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pretty much just like an <a href=\"http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/image/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ACF Image Field</a>. There&#8217;s a few differences, like not returning just an ID (there&#8217;s no point without positions), but the basics are the same.</p>\n<p>Make sure the Preview Size and Return Size are of a similar ratio. And make sure the image parent has a height.</p>\n<p>Image tag returns some additional markup on images:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;img class=\"js-focal-point-image\" src=\"img.png\" alt=\"image alt\" data-focus-left=\"0.12\" data-focus-top=\"0.11\" data-focus-right=\"0.40\" data-focus-bottom=\"0.98\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Image object now has a few more values too:</p>\n<pre><code>'focal_point'   =&gt; array(\n    'class'     =&gt; 'js-focal-point-image',\n    'top'       =&gt; $value['top'],\n    'left'      =&gt; $value['left'],\n    'right'     =&gt; $value['right'],\n    'bottom'    =&gt; $value['bottom']\n)\n\n\n'class' refers to the class that Responsify.js is called on. This needs to be on the image tag to work.\n\n'top', 'left', 'right' and `'bottom'` refer to the `data-focus` attributes used to control focal point. \n</code></pre>\n<p>Build image as per above tag. Responsify is called on load and resize automatically on <code>img.js-focal-point-image</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are the images returned huge?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the image is wrapped inside an element that has a height and hasn&#8217;t had it&#8217;s <code>overflow: hidden</code> overridden (by <code>!important</code>). And that the image hasn&#8217;t had it&#8217;s <code>max-width: none</code> overridden.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are the images returned small?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure the return image size (set when creating a Focal Point field) isn&#8217;t set to a small image size. Larger images work better.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are the images not stretching to fill it&#8217;s container?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Responsify.js tries it&#8217;s best to fit as much of the photo in the container as it can, whilst keeping the focal point a priority, and also keeping ratios correct. This means that at some sizes/ratios your image will be displayed too small for it&#8217;s container, try changing container size or image size. Or use <code>background-size: cover</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are the images not scaling?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because for this to work, the image needs to move around within a container. Which means we need to hide the containers overflow. Which means we need to set a height. This is not made for wysiwyg style images, it&#8217;s for banners, sliders, fullpage, fixed height sections, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is the focus area not lining up correctly when I view the page/post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that the preview size and the return size are the same ratio. It&#8217;s relatively accurate when they&#8217;re close, but for best results they should be the same. And make sure any image sizes aren&#8217;t differing their crops.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
