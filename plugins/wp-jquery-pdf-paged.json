        "installation": "<p>The easiest way to install is from within WordPress using the Plugin/Add New feature, or if you wish to manually install:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin.</li>\n<li>Upload the entire <code>wp-jquery-paged</code> directory to your plugins folder.</li>\n<li>Click to Activate the plugin in your WordPress Dashboard&#8217;s Plugin page.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How to add a pager to a page or post</h4>\n<p>Currently there are a few ways to go about adding a pager to a post.  The end goal is to use a shortcode that specifies the IDs of the images you&#8217;d like in your booklet, in order, similar to the following:</p>\n<pre><code>[wp-jquery-paged ids=\"21,26,27\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you happen to know the IDs of your images, you&#8217;re all set to handcraft your shortcode and you can be on your way.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know your image IDs, we&#8217;ll show you how to get them in WordPress 3.5, along with a little cheat that can make constructing your shortcode a bit easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Placing Your Shortcode Manually</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Browse to, or create the post in which you&#8217;d like to embed the booklet.</li>\n<li>Using WordPress&#8217;s Media manager to upload your images.  Click the Add Media button above the post.</li>\n<li>Upload all of the images you&#8217;d like to show in your booklet.</li>\n<li>In the WordPress editor, place in your shortcode.</li>\n<li>Save the post.</li>\n<li>View the post to make sure your booklet is loading as expected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Finding Image IDs in WordPress 3.5</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>After you&#8217;ve uploaded media, visit the media gallery in the WordPress Dashboard.  You can do this by either clicking Media/Library in WordPress main navigation, or by clicking the <em>Add Media</em> button when viewing a page or post.</li>\n<li>Click on the image you want.  The sidebar with <em>Gallery Settings</em> will pop up on the right side.</li>\n<li>Hover your mouse over the <em>Edit Image</em> link.</li>\n<li>Look in your browser&#8217;s status bar for the link to the image.  It might look something like: <code>yourdomain.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=21&amp;action=edit&amp;image-editor</code></li>\n<li>Find the post number (in the above case, the &#8217;21&#8217;) &#8211; that&#8217;s your image ID.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Placing Your Shortcode &#8211; Cheat</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Follow steps 1 through 3 above in <em>Placing Your Shortcode Manually</em></li>\n<li>Click the Create Gallery link in the upper left of the Insert Media screen.</li>\n<li>Click on each image that will comprise your booklet.</li>\n<li>Click the Create Gallery button.  This will take to <em>Edit Gallery</em> where you can edit the gallery order.</li>\n<li>If needed, drag and drop your images to match the order you&#8217;d like them to appear in your booklet.</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve got your images uploaded and ordered, click the Insert Gallery button.  This will insert a normal WordPress gallery into your post.</li>\n<li>In the WordPress editor, switch to HTML view.  You&#8217;ll see the shortcode generated by the gallery.  It should look something like <code>[gallery ids=\"21,26,27\"]</code></li>\n<li>In this shortcode, change the word <em>gallery</em> to <em>wp-jquery-paged</em>.  Now your shortcode should look more like <code>[wp-jquery-paged ids=\"21,26,27\"]</code></li>\n<li>Save your post.</li>\n<li>View the post to make sure your booklet is loading as expected.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Your instructions are tailored for WordPress 3.5+, does the plugin still work with 3.4?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s backwards compatible.  In WP 3.4, you can assign the images an order to control their order, or you can simply specify their order in the shortcode per installation instructions!</p>\n<p>Oh, and why the heck don&#8217;t you upgrade to WordPress 3.5 already?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I upload PDFs instead of images</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can, but it won&#8217;t work. ðŸ™‚  The &#8216;pages&#8217; of your booklet are comprised of ordered images only.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will you add X feature?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe.
