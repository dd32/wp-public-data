As example, a CSV file is included with the plugin.</p>\n<h3><strong>Some considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>Plugin will automatically detect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charset and set it to <strong>UTF-8</strong> to prevent problems with non-ASCII characters.</li>\n<li>It also will <strong>auto detect line-ending</strong> to prevent problems with different OS.</li>\n<li>Finally, it will <strong>detect the delimiter</strong> being used in CSV file</li>\n</ul>\n",
