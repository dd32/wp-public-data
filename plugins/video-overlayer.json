In the Video Overlay admin page you can either select an alternate image or select &#8220;Custom&#8221; and<br />\nthen add a direct link to your custom overlay image.</p>\n<p>You can also just set Video Overlay to make your iFrame video embeds fully responsive, leaving off the overlay image.<br />\nThis is ideal for basic Responsive Video Embed functionality.</p>\n<h4>Removing the Video Overlayer plugin</h4>\n<p>To remove the Video Overlayer plugin just go to the Plugins page in your dashboard<br />\n(or the Network Admin dashboard if you&#8217;re running a multi-blog setup) and click<br />\nthe &#8220;Delete&#8221; link.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Does Video Overlayer work with ALL iFrame video embeds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, no (YouTube, Vimeo, Viddler and Screenr iFrame Video Embeds are supported), but any non-supported iFrame video embeds can easily be added!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you exclude certain WordPress Pages or types of Pages from Video Overlayer?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can use the following function as an example:</p>\n<p>add_filter( &#8216;video_overlayer_exclusions&#8217;, &#8216;custom_video_overlayer_exclusions&#8217; );<br />\nfunction custom_video_overlayer_exclusions() {<br />\n    if( is_page( &#8216;About&#8217; ) ) {<br />\n        return 1;<br />\n    } else {<br />\n        return 0;<br />\n    }<br />\n}</p>\n<p>You would just paste the above PHP code into your Themes&#8217;s functions file and then adjust it according to your needs. The above code, for example,<br />\nwould exclude the Video Overlayer functionality from a page named &#8216;About&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
