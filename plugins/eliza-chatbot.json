To recognize Weizenbaum&#8217;s work, I thought that ELIZA deserves a place here, alongside other plugins.</p>\n<h4>Technical Details</h4>\n<p>This plugin functions offline and maintains user privacy by not collecting any data. It&#8217;s based on the original &#8216;ELIZA&#8217; script, as published in Weizenbaum&#8217;s 1966 paper &#8220;ELIZA &#8211; A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man and Machine&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Personal Motivation</h4>\n<p>I also have a personal motivation for building this app. The German version of ELIZA was the first chatbot I&#8217;ve encountered in the &#8217;90s.

This experience laid the foundation for my own project, which I started in 1996, and it has shaped my R&amp;D career in AI.</p>\n<h4>AI for Personal Development</h4>\n<p>In 2023, I discovered a new avenue that allows me to combine my desire to help people grow with my interest in developing conversational AI as an experimental means to study the human mind and psychology.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%3F'>\nWhy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since 1966, ELIZA not only tells a story about computers or AI, but even more — it shows us, humans, in a new kind of interactive mirror and has been a source of self-reflection on our beliefs, emotions, and what constitutes a human and what does not. It also showcases the genius of its authors in the ratio of how much can be achieved by so little code. Reflecting on that small program and its impact, how does the comparison with modern data and compute giant &#8220;chatbots&#8221; look like? That&#8217;s how ELIZA remains a great source of reflection on the progress we experience.</p>\n<p>Beyond these ephemeral reasons, it is used for teaching Python and basic Natural Language Processing concepts at a University.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
