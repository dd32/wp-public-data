CHMOD is the permission settings for files and folders. If you&#8217;ve received a warning of this, the CHMOD on the upload directory is too low.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It says I have no resized images, but I do</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please note this is a new plugin (rewritten summer 2017), this plugin was developed and tested in only two server environments &#8211; variables on your setup may of not been considered while developing.
