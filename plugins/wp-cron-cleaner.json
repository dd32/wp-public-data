WordPress itself uses some scheduled tasks to perform some regular actions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20mean%20%22orphan%20scheduled%20tasks%22%3F'>\nWhat does mean &#8220;orphan scheduled tasks&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As you know, not all plugins care about the housekeeping of your site. Some scheduled tasks may not be removed even if the responsible plugins are deleted from your WordPress installation. These tasks are called &#8220;orphan scheduled tasks&#8221;. Hence, deleting these unnecessary tasks may help in cleaning your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20safe%20to%20clean%20a%20scheduled%20tasks%3F'>\nIs it safe to clean a scheduled tasks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It should be noted that cleaning scheduled tasks is safe as long as you know what tasks to clean. If your are not sure, it is better to not clean any task.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20multisite%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is compatible with multisite. It should be noted that only the main site can view and clean tasks in the whole network. Other sites in the network cannot perform these tasks. We have opted for this philosophy because we are sure that only the super administrator can perform such actions. Your network is precious!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20cleans%20itself%20after%20the%20uninstall%3F'>\nDoes this plugin cleans itself after the uninstall?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We do clean-up of your WordPress site, it will be a shame if the plugin does not clean itself after an uninstall! Of course yes, the plugin cleans itself and removes any data used to store its settings once uninstalled.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
