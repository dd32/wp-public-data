You can also set the insertion into &#8220;By Page and Category&#8221; or set it to &#8220;All Article&#8221; to display the plugin on all article post except on pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the use of &#8220;Database Configuration&#8221; Tab?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On that tab you can uninstall and re-install the plugin&#8217;s own table that stores the data of rated post if you don&#8217;t want to go on phpMyAdmin to delete manually all the data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How did the Rate This Page plug-in calculate the Average Rating in the rating report tab?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plug-in Average Rating formula:<br />\nIf there are (5) people voted for trustworthy and rated 5.0, then the average rating is 5.0 because, the article&#8217;s trustworthy is weighted by the number of people&#8217;s ratings.<br />\nNow, if there are (5) people voted for trustworthy that rated 5.0, and another one person voted 1.0 rating, then the average rating is 4.3.</p>\n<p>In short:<br />\nTotal number of rating&#8217;s Trustworthy, Objective, Complete and Well-written (of certain article post) is divided by the number of people who rated the article = Average Rating.</p>\n<p>Highest and Lowest Rated posts/pages will be intentified if the average is 3.5 above and 3.5 below.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the syntax for shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use [rate_this_page] syntax if you want to use shortcode for the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to activate Top Rated Widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to Appearance-&gt;Widgets and drag the widget named &#8220;RTP Top Rated&#8221; into sidebar panel. That&#8217;s it it and you&#8217;re done.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
