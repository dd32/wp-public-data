Geniuses that we are, we called it &#8220;Add a Comparison&#8221; because that is exactly what the plugin helps you do.

One click and the chart will be added to your blog post. WordPress does not allow iFrames (like YouTube embeds) to be viewed inside the editor but rest assured it&#8217;s there.

We are working on expanding the feature set so that the service automatically pulls in content from Wikipedia if it&#8217;s not available on Diffen.
