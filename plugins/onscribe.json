You can register any time by visiting: http://onscri.be</p>\n<h4>Can I customize my buttons?</h4>\n<p>Yes, in the meta box there are options that affect the appearance of the buttons.</p>\n<h4>Who is Onscribe?</h4>\n<p>Onscribe is created by a small startup in San Francisco called K&amp;D Interactive. They are a collective of experienced developers, quite independent, with humble beginnings and proud of fighting against the current to provide online services that serve the people.</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work with WordPress versions less than 3.9?</h4>\n<p>This plugin was developed to work with WordPress &gt;3.9 but there is a good chance it will work on previous versions 3.x. Although we haven&#8217;t tested it, the plugin is using standard methods well established before v3.9. Use at your own risk.</p>\n",
