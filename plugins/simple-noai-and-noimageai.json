The technology used to ask bots to skip your site is the same technology used to ask that of search engine crawlers. Badly behaved bots can (and often will) entirely bypass these rules and access your website anyway. Please do your due diligence to ensure you are protecting sensitive assets and data. May I suggest using Glaze for protection on your images?</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply activate the plugin for the noai and noimageai to be added to the header of your entire site and the robots.txt file will be appended with appropriate crawler blocks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20uninstall%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to uninstall the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply deactivate and delete the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
