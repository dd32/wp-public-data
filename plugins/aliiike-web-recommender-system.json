        "installation": "<p>Two different approaches require a bit different installation procedure and<br />\nhave different prerequisites. First, I describe the simpler, content based<br />\napproach installation.</p>\n<p>I. Content based</p>\n<p>This approach is currently supported on MySQL database only. In case you use it<br />\nthe installation procedure is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin and unpack it to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Should you face problems when creating the fulltext index on database, try to<br />\nrun manually the following SQL query:</p>\n<p>CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX <code>comparator</code> ON <code>wp_posts</code> (<code>post_title</code>, <code>post_content</code>)</p>\n<p>II. Collaborative filtering</p>\n<p>This approach logs the visits on your site on aliiike.com server. Logging<br />\nand recommending requires an account ID therefore:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have to register and create an account for your site on aliiike.com.</li>\n<li>Download the plugin and unpack it to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Insert an account id and secret key in the recommender settings page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In both approaches you Customize the look and feel via &#8216;Plugins&#8217; | &#8216;Aliiike Recommender&#8217; menu.</p>\n",
