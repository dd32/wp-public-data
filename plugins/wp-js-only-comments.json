        "faq": "<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>Most SPAM is sent using scripts that post directly to your blog software without loading your blog in a browser and so, without running Javascript. By only allowing comments posted with Javascript, you will not even see all those spam comments.</p>\n<h4>I still get SPAM, what to do?</h4>\n<p>Usually you will still get some SPAM comments for Cialis or Viagra etc. Add these words in your Blacklist in the WordPress Admin page / Settings / Discussion</p>\n",
