Look in the same directory as the<br />\nimage was uploaded.

(There is a<br />\ntrac item open to ask WordPress to work it out:<br />\nhttps://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12518<br />\nbut in the meantime you need to alter the client or manually alter<br />\nyour WordPress installation as described in the trac item).</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
