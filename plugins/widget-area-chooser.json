Adding a widget now scrolls the page up to the sidebar to make sure its in view.</p>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Replaced the select with a list of sidebars. Cleaned up the javascript and squashed a few bugs with the help of the great azaozz. Now, when you choose a sidebar, it will open and highlight the new widget.</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>You can add widgets to open widget areas, and it should save. Otherwise, you&#8217;re out of luck.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>Starting development with a concept UI. Nothing actually works, yet.</p>\n"
