An example use case might be in the footer of a website that contains social bookmarking links, each link could show the name of the social media website and a small icon next to it just by entering your information into the WordPress &#8216;Links&#8217; tab. Achieving this goal is possible with a little core manipulation but we thought it would be more productive to simply install a plugin and not worry about the next WordPress update.</p>\n<p>The plugin code itself is just a re-functioning the current &#8216;wp_list_bookmarks&#8217;. By altering the &#8216;link_image&#8217; output to display the &#8216;link_name&#8217;, its possible to achieve the desired effect. The biggest benefit of this plugin is that a User is allowed to display their Bookmarks in three separate formats: text-only, image-only and a combination of both.</p>\n<p>Please note that as of WordPress 3.5 the &#8216;Links&#8217; manager has been deprecated and removed from the Dashboard. If you currently have links this option will still be available. If not, we recommend the &#8216;Link Manager&#8217; plugin from WordPress which is required to run PictureBook.
