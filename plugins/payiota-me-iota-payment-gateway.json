As of v1.0.5 , you are not required to set your IPN URL in the PayIOTA interface page to the same URL that you see on the settings page &#8211; custom IPN URL&#8217;s are now supported by PayIOTA.</li>\n<li>Test it!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: What is the maximum amount of time an invoice lasts?<br />\nA: 1 week. After that our service will not check the address anymore to prevent overloading our server and the node it is checking from. You can issue an update of the invoice with the &#8216;update&#8217; API call.</p>\n<p>Q: How can I use currency different than USD?<br />\nA: Add the 3 letter currency code in the plugin&#8217;s settings. Don&#8217;t forget to also change your WooCommerce currency settings!</p>\n",
