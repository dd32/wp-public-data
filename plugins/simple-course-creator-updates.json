With it, you can create a timeline of updates from your courses and display them anywhere on your WordPress site with a shortcode. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>News sites can easily post updates to stories broken apart into multiples posts</li>\n<li>Course creators can use it to tease previews of their full course</li>\n<li>Developers can use it to document the progress of their work on their blog, or as a changelog</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See SCC Updates in action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>None. If your site is using SCC Updates, <a href=\"http://kolakube.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">send me an email</a> and I may showcase it here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Templates and styling are handled out of the box, but SCC Updates is very simple to customize both with the shortcode and template files/stylesheets.</p>\n<p>Follow Simple Course Creator Updates development on <a href=\"https://github.com/alexmangini/simple-course-creator-updates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a></p>\n",

You can set a custom title by filling in the Post Listing Title field on the course&#8217;s edit screen.</p>\n<p>The same process applies to the course description, except you&#8217;d fill in the Description text box on the course edit screen.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I add my own styles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can override the default styles the SCC Updates plugin outputs by following these simple steps:</p>\n<p>NOTE: It is highly encouraged you only make these changes using a child theme. If you use a parent theme, and then update it, you will lose all customizations you made with this plugin.

Following a nearly identical process as above, editing the template file can be done by following these simple steps:</p>\n<p>NOTE: It is highly encouraged you only make these changes using a child theme.
