It essentially lets you create folders to categorize your media, making it much easier to find what you need.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20it%20is%20useful%3F'>\nHow it is useful?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AIO Media Library Manager tackles the chaos of the default WordPress media library by letting you create folders. Here&#8217;s how it streamlines your workflow:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bloggers:</strong>  Imagine a folder for each blog post where you store all the images and documents related to that specific post. No more hunting through hundreds of random files!</li>\n<li><strong>Photographers:</strong>  Create folders based on shoot themes (weddings, portraits, landscapes) and subfolders by date or client. Find any photo in seconds! </li>\n<li><strong>Ecommerce Sites:</strong>  Organize product images by category (clothing, electronics etc.) and even sub-categorize by brand. Effortlessly swap product images without confusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Real-time Examples:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Uploading Photos for a New Blog Post:</strong> With AIO, you can directly upload photos to a dedicated folder named &#8220;New Blog Post&#8221; within the media library. No need to sort them later.</li>\n<li><strong>Managing Client Photos:</strong> As a photographer, create a folder for &#8220;Client John Smith&#8221; with subfolders for &#8220;Engagement Shoot&#8221; and &#8220;Family Portraits.&#8221; Quickly access all photos for the client.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding Product Images on an Ecommerce Site:</strong>  Create a folder named &#8220;Products&#8221; with subfolders for &#8220;T-Shirts,&#8221; &#8220;Jeans,&#8221; and &#8220;Shoes.&#8221; Within &#8220;T-Shirts,&#8221; you can have subfolders by brand. Easy to update product images and maintain a clean website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> AIO integrates with popular page builders, so you can browse and manage your media folders directly within the page builder interface, saving you time and frustration.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
