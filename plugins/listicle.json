This lets you generate listicles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle).  &#8220;In journalism and blogging, a listicle is a short-form of writing that uses a list as its thematic structure, but is fleshed out with sufficient verbiage to be published as an article. A typical listicle will prominently feature a cardinal number in its title, such as &#8220;10 Ways to Warm Up Your Bedroom in Winter&#8221;,[1] or &#8220;25 Hairstyles of the Last Hundred Years&#8221;,[2] with subsequent subheadings within the text itself reflecting this schema.

The post within which you are placing this listicle will show this excerpt.  This is the \"italics\" tag. You can generate this using the WordPress WYSIWYG \"tinyMCE\" by clicking the \"i\" in the editor.  Or, in HTML view you probably know what to do.  There should only be one.       &lt;/em&gt;\n\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The text inside the strong / bold tags become the headline of the post generated by listicle.&lt;/strong&gt;  The text inside the list item, also available from the WYSIWYG becomes the content of the list item post.  If there is no headline specified using the \"b\" tag&lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;bold and strong should be interchangeable&lt;/b&gt; If there is no strong tag listicle will use the name attribute from the listicle shortcode to generate a numbered sequence of titles for the list item posts.  For example, this list item would be titled: sample listice for readme - 2.  Note: Semantically, strong is the preferred option.&lt;/li&gt;\n\n    &lt;li&gt;Listicle will generate list item \"listicle\" posts for each list item.  You can have as few as one. You can delete listicles by removing the list item from the list and publishing the post.&lt;/li&gt;\n\n\n[/listicle]\n</code></pre>\n",
