        "description": "<p>Wavatars is a plugin that will generate and assign icons to the visitors leaving comments at your site. The icons are based on email,<br />\nso a given visitor will get the same icon each time they comment.  It livens up comment threads and gives people memorable &#8220;faces&#8221; to<br />\naid in following conversations.  It&#8217;s also fun.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wavatars can generate 956,384 different shapes in 57,600 different color combinations for a total of 55,087,718,400 (55 billion)<br />\nunique Wavatars.  Yeah, you should have plenty.  You&#8217;ll run out of human beings (or hard drive space) long before you run out of<br />\nWavatars.</li>\n<li>The icons are generated on-the-fly.  You can adjust the desired size of the icons.</li>\n<li>For easy deployment, icons will automatically precede the commenter&#8217;s name.  You can set HTML to come directly before and after the<br />\nicon (to put it inside of a &lt;DIV&gt; tag, for example) or you can control the placement of the icons manually if you don&#8217;t mind adding<br />\na single line of PHP to your theme.</li>\n<li>Wavatars are based entirely on email and are thus very portable.  The same email will result in the same Wavatar, even on different<br />\nsites, so users will have the same icon on all Wavatar-enabled sites.  (Assuming, or course, that there are other Wavatar-enabled<br />\nsites.  I don&#8217;t know if anyone will want this plugin or not.)</li>\n<li>This plugin also supports <a href=\"http://site.gravatar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravatars</a>.  If you like, it can show the Gravatar for a given user<br />\n(if available) and fall back on their Wavatar only if they don&#8217;t have a Gravatar set up.  This means users can choose to set up a unique<br />\nicon for themselves, and if they don&#8217;t, they will be assigned a unique Wavatar.  This is a great system that lets people personalize if<br />\nthey want, yet still provide a decent icon for the lazy or apathetic.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Revision History</h3>\n<h3>Version 1.1.3</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bad encoding which would prevent wavatars from appearing if the rating was NOT blank. If the admin does not specify a rating, the rating field is omitted.</li>\n<li>Fixed a typo on the admin panel.</li>\n<li>The wavatar url is now URL encoded.</li>\n<li>The image tag no longer uses the pointless &#8220;border tag, and it is now properly closed.</li>\n<li>Removed extra (pointless, harmless) repeated calls to strtolower ().</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to Gavin Lambert for many of these changes.</p>\n<h3>Version 1.1.2</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made several small changes to comply with the changes at gravatars.com.  Appended .jpg to the $md5 hash, switched to using the new (shorter) field names.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where the plugin was inserting wavatars in places it shouldn&#8217;t, such as RSS comment feeds and in sidebar wigits.  The auto-placement will now ONLY place<br />\nicons when viewing a single post or a page.</li>\n<li>When placing icons manually within their theme, users should use <code>wavatar_show($comment-&gt;comment_author_email)</code> as opposed to<br />\nwavatar_show($comment_author_email), as the eariler versions directed.  The latter will work in some situations but fail in others, and so the former is more correct.<br />\nThe readme and the admin panel have been updated to reflect this.</li>\n<li>The admin panel will now list how many wavatars are in the cache.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 1.1.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug where setting AVATAR_SIZE to an odd number would cause PHP to pass floating-point values to imagefill (), which is not a good idea.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where gravatars were always requested at 60&#215;60, instead of the size defined in the admin panel.</li>\n<li>Added the function wavatar_get (email, size), which will return the url of the requested avatar instead of displaying it.  This can be useful if you want to use the<br />\nimage in other ways, such as making it the background of an HTML element.  You could also use this if you need to display the image in a rectangular area instead of a square.</li>\n<li>Added option for controlling the rating of gravatars. (G, PG, R, X)</li>\n<li>Added options for how to handle users who leave the email field blank.  You can choose to give them a wavatar anyway, to give them a blank image, or show no image at all.</li>\n<li>The link back to the wavatars homepage in the footer is now actually a link and not just text.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Advanced Tricks</h3>\n<h4>Using wavatar_show ()</h4>\n<p>If you place Wavatars by calling wavatar_show () manually, note that you can also specify an optional &#8220;size&#8221; argument to override the<br />\ndefault. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>wavatar_show($comment-&gt;comment_author_email, '160');\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would cause the Wavatar to be 160&#215;160 pixels, even if the default was set to some other value.  You could do this to make admin icons<br />\nlarger, for example.</p>\n<h4>Using wavatar_get ()</h4>\n<p>If wavatar_show () STILL doesn&#8217;t give you enough control, you can call:</p>\n<pre><code>wavatar_get(email, size);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And it will return the URL to the created image without writing anything to the page.</p>\n<h4>Random Wavatar Field</h4>\n<p>Put this code in your theme:</p>\n<pre><code>for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100; $i++)\n    wavatar_show ($i);\n</code></pre>\n<p>It will generate a field of 100 random wavatars, which is amusing.  This is how I generated the wavatar screenshot.  It&#8217;s also a great way to quickly<br />\ntest you source images if you&#8217;re editing the composite parts to make new wavatar types.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shamusyoung.com/files/wavatars1-0-0.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Download</a> the plugin.\n</li>\n<li>Copy it onto your website in the wordpress `/plugins` folder.  Then enable the plugin.  That&#8217;s it. Wavatars will<br />\ninstantly appear for all posts (even old ones) on your blog.  If you don&#8217;t like how the image looks within your theme, read on&#8230;\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The administration panel is under Options &raquo; Wavatars.  You can adjust the size of the Wavatars, and assign HTML to come before and<br />\nafter each image to help nudge it into place.  Each image is also set with the CSS &#8220;wavatars&#8221; class.  On my own site, I don&#8217;t have any<br />\nHTML prefix or suffix, and instead just added these lines to my CSS:</p>\n<pre><code>.wavatar {\n    float:             left;\n    padding:           3px;\n    background:        #fff;\n    margin-top:        -25px;\n    margin-left:       -25px;\n    margin-right:      5px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If that still doesn&#8217;t give you enough control over wavatar placement and you don&#8217;t mind editing your theme, just turn off automatic<br />\nplacement and add the line <code>wavatar_show($comment-&gt;comment_author_email);</code> to your comment loop wherever you want the image to appear.</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary.  How it will look depends largely on your current theme.</p>\n<p>Note that the plugin requires that your install of PHP support the GD library.  If it doesn&#8217;t, the Wavatars won&#8217;t show up and you&#8217;ll get<br />\na warning in the Wavatar admin panel.  You can still use this plugin to display Gravatars, even if the GD library isn&#8217;t available.</p>\n"
