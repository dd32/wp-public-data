This includes making a copy of your current .htaccess file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20is%20the%20time%20delay%20provided%20by%20the%20plugin%20%3F'>\nHow long is the time delay provided by the plugin ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin gives you a 300 second delay.

What should I do ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, deactivate the plugin. This will delete the code from the .htaccess file. This should solve the problem if it is the WP Maximum Execution Time Exceeded plugin.</p>\n<p>If you still have problems after deactivating the plugin, deactivate all plugins. Then activate your plugins one-by-one to find the plugin causing the problem.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20deactivated%20all%20my%20plugins%20and%20i%20am%20still%20having%20a%20problem%20with%20my%20website.'>\nI deactivated all my plugins and I am still having a problem with my website.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this case, use your backup .htaccess file. Replace the existing .htaccess file to fix the problem. Activate your plugins one-by-one to ensure the problem does not recur.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20my%20wordpress%20installation%20completely%20crashes%20%3F'>\nWhat if my WordPress installation completely crashes ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this case, use your backup files and reload your website and database. WordPress crashing has very specific causes. Read Codex <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Common_WordPress_Errors/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Common WordPress Errors</a> to trouble shoot your website.</p>\n<p>To further trouble shoot, examine your theme, plugin configuration and check for malware and malicious code left by hackers.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
