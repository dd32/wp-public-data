The reasons are as follows:<br />\n‍<br />\n1. <strong>USDC for Volatility:</strong> Payments are best done in low-zero volatility assets to avoid losses i.e. a T-shirt sold for $10 worth of crypto should not turn to $5 worth of crypto when redeeming for USD. <a href=\"https://www.circle.com/en/usdc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">USDC is the most trusted stable-coin</a> with the price pegged to the dollar i.e. Each USDC is worth $1.00 and is always redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars via Centralised Exchanges such as Coinbase and FTX.<br />\n‍<br />\n2. <strong>Solana for Cost and Speed: Solana is one of the fastest blockchains with one of the lowest costs, which makes it ideal for users to use in payments.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20seed%20phrase%20and%20why%20do%20i%20need%20it%3F'>\nWhat is a seed phrase and why do I need it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>BizFirst creates a semi-custodial wallet for your safety where you also get access to your Seed Phrase.  A seed phrase is a sequence of 12 words that gives you,  access to the cryptocurrency that you have received. This can be imported to any Solana Wallet to access your USDC.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
