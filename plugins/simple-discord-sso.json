Complete with a customizable login button,<br />\nor you can code your own and unhook this one.</p>\n<h4>Important Caching Information</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses a custom rewrite rule for the login button. You may want to ensure the <code>/discord-login</code> path in your WordPress<br />\ninstallation is not cached.</p>\n<h4>Saved User Data</h4>\n<p>When logging in, if the user does not have an account one is created for them automatically using their Username and Discriminator<br />\nfield. The default scope is <code>identify email</code> which allows your site to store their discord information to your database for<br />\nother discord-related usage.</p>\n<p>The following fields are saved to the <code>simple_discord_sso</code> user meta key for all discord users:<br />\n* <strong>id</strong>: the user&#8217;s id<br />\n* <strong>avatar</strong>: the user&#8217;s <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">avatar hash</a><br />\n* <strong>discriminator</strong>: the user&#8217;s 4-digit discord-tag<br />\n* <strong>public_flags</strong>: the public <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-user-flags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">flags</a> on a user&#8217;s account<br />\n* <strong>flags</strong>: the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-user-flags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">flags</a> on a user&#8217;s account<br />\n* <strong>banner</strong>: the user&#8217;s <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#image-formatting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">banner hash</a><br />\n* <strong>accent_color</strong>: the user&#8217;s banner color encoded as an integer representation of hexadecimal color code<br />\n* <strong>locale</strong>: the user&#8217;s chosen language option<br />\n* <strong>mfa_enabled</strong>: whether the user has two factor enabled on their account<br />\n* <strong>premium_type</strong>: the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#user-object-premium-types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">type of Nitro subscription</a> on a user&#8217;s account<br />\n* <strong>verified</strong>: whether the email on this account has been verified<br />\n* <strong>hash</strong>: Just an MD5 hash which is used to determine if these fields should be updated on every login.</p>\n<p>Various actions and filters are available, should you want to expand on these fields ( if new fields are added ) just look over<br />\nthe <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Discord User Resource</a> for more fields.</p>\n<h4>Actions/Filters</h4>\n<p>Various actions and filters are available from changing the redirect URL after login, changing the scope of the discord request,<br />\nor even halting the login ( and maybe redirecting after ) depending on the user&#8217;s discord information. Or, even if you want, you can<br />\nlisten for the login and hook into right before the redirect. The goal with the slew of actions and filters is to allow developers<br />\nto customize the plugin how they see fit.</p>\n<p>Think we need more? Awesome, open a ticket on the <a href=\"https://github.com/JayWood/jw-discord-sso\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a> &#8211; the plugin is actively maintained so I&#8217;d be happy to help out.</p>\n",

Alternatively you can use the query parameter instead <code>/?discord=1</code>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
