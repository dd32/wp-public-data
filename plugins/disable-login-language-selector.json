        "description": "<p>WordPress 5.9 added a new language selector to allow users to switch languages from a dropdown on the login screen if more than one language is enabled on your WordPress installation. This plugin provides a quick and easy way to prevent this language selector from appearing.</p>\n<p>It is a very simple plugin which is provided for ease of use: you need only to install and activate the plugin and it will prevent the language dropdown from appearing on the login screen of your site.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can also achieve the same effect by adding the following line of code to the <code>functions.php</code> file in your theme:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'login_display_language_dropdown', '__return_false' );\n</code></pre>\n",

If you don&#8217;t want this language selector to be visible then using this plugin will stop it from appearing.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why you may have more than one language active on your website but do not want the language selector to be visible to site users:</p>\n<p>Perhaps you have a custom language selector in place already as part of an existing theme or plugin, so the WordPress language selector is not required.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps as is common, WordPress was installed with the default language set as English (United States). In these cases enabling a subsequent language would result in there being more than one language active, for example English (United States) and English (UK), therefore enabling the language selector regardless of whether you want to have multiple language options available to site users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20installed%20the%20plugin%20but%20i%20still%20see%20the%20language%20selector'>\nI have installed the plugin but I still see the language selector\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check that the plugin has been correctly uploaded, installed and activated.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
