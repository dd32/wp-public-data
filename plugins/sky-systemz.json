        "faq": "\n<dt id='when%20will%20i%20typically%20receive%20deposits%3F'>\nWhen will I typically receive deposits?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sky offers next day funding, so Sky Paymentz customers will receive any payments made on Monday by 9:00 PM ET on Tuesday. Any payments during the weekend will be received on Tuesday.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20process%20payments%20immediately%20after%20registration%3F'>\nCan I process payments immediately after registration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. After completing the 5 minute registration process you can immediately start processing payments by using the Sky Systemz mobile application (App Store) ( Google Play) or by logging into SkySystemz.com you can take a manual payment. You will then receive an email and phone call from your dedicated account manager to assist with any hardware purchases and the setup of your Sky account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20need%20to%20create%20an%20account%3F'>\nWhat do I need to create an account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sky asks basic business and personal questions during registration, such as name, address, EIN, and banking information. It takes approximately 5 minutes to complete our registration and begin processing payments. However, Sky uses next generation underwriting and verification technology to identify you as the business owner and to verify your business. If you do not answer questions accurately, we may ask additional questions or require documentation such as processing statements, drivers license, or business licenses for verification purposes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
