No need to edit your theme files!</p>\n<p>Aside from Header and Footer scripts, you can also use WPCode to insert custom PHP code snippets, JavaScript code snippets, CSS code snippets, HTML code snippets, and text snippets with full conditional logic support.</p>\n<p>We took the pain out of adding custom code snippets in WordPress and made it easy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have been using Insert Headers and Footers and it is such a useful tool. Super helpful and the very best of its kind. Highly recommend<br />\n  The_Gibble &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Quick Overview of WPCode from WPBeginner</h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fo-7MKRRUec?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Introducing New WPCode Pro</strong><br />\n  While WPCode Lite offers tons of powerful features for free, we listened to user feedback and created WPCode Pro with even more amazing features to improve your workflow. This includes smart conditional logic, saving code snippets to cloud library, code revisions, page-specific snippets, deeper integration with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, and so much more. <a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to purchase the best premium WordPress code snippet plugin now!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Future Proof Code Snippet Management</h4>\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/category/wp-tutorials/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress tutorial websites</a> ask you to add code snippets to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file. This makes managing code snippets messy, and it also prevents you from updating your theme.</p>\n<p>If you ever update your theme or switch to another theme, then you will lose all custom code functions that you added in your functions.php file.</p>\n<p>WPCode solves this by providing you an easy way to insert header and footer scripts along with other code snippets directly from your WordPress dashboard. These code snippets actually run as if they were in your theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<p>Our smart code snippet validation helps you prevent common code errors to ensure you never break your website when adding code snippets or header and footer scripts.</p>\n<p><strong>New WPCode Cloud Library</strong> even allows you to store all your custom code snippets in a cloud library, so you can easily re-use code snippets across multiple website projects and save time. You can keep your code snippets completely private or <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">share it with the community</a> to give back while boosting your social profile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This plugin allows me to not only add things to my site whenever needed, but it takes me only seconds to accomplish it.<br />\n  David Weber &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Full Code Snippets Library and Code Generators</h4>\n<p>Ever wanted a central place to find all the most popular WordPress code snippets that are tested and proven to work?</p>\n<p>When we started Insert Headers and Footers plugin, we did too. So we built a WordPress code snippets library right inside the WPCode plugin.</p>\n<p>You will find verified PHP code snippets for popular feature requests like disable REST API, disable XML-RPC, disable comments, allow SVG file uploads, disable Gutenberg, add Classic Editor, and more without installing separate plugins for each.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was very hesitant to get into any of the code for my website. Your plugin made it easy for me to do.<br />\n  Conbrio75 &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also built the ability to save your code snippets to <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPCode Cloud Library</a>, so you can easily re-use it on your other websites, client projects, or even share it with the larger community.</p>\n<p>WPCode Cloud Library helps you better organize your code snippets in one central location, so you can save more time and speed up your workflow when managing websites. No more wasting time looking for custom notes or Github gists.</p>\n<p>Aside from our growing code snippets library, we also have WordPress code generators to help you quickly get ready-to-use custom code using the latest WordPress coding standards and API&#8217;s.</p>\n<h4>Conditional Logic for Code Snippets + Code Insertion Priority</h4>\n<p>Our goal with WPCode was to create a WordPress code snippets plugin that&#8217;s both EASY and POWERFUL.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why aside from our global header and footer scripts, we added advanced features like conditional logic for code snippets and made it easy.</p>\n<p>Instead of learning WordPress conditional logic queries, you can use our beginner-friendly conditional logic user interface to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load code snippets for logged in users only</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets for specific user roles</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets only on specific page URLs</li>\n<li>Insert header and footer pixel scripts on specific pages</li>\n<li>Show code snippets based on type of page</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only on certain post types</li>\n<li>Load header and footer code snippet based on referrer source</li>\n<li>and more&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also added both automatic code insertion and manual code output using shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Our Auto Insert feature allows you to run the code snippet everywhere or choose from custom options like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run code snippet only on frontend</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only in WordPress admin area</li>\n<li>Add header and footer scripts sitewide</li>\n<li>Insert PHP code snippet before or after post content</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet before or after specific paragraph</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet on specific archive pages</li>\n<li>Insert code snippets after specific WooCommerce function (<a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Feature</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from that, we also added a visual code snippet priority system, so you can choose the order for your custom functions to avoid code conflict.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is such a useful plugin! It makes it so much easier to include things on your website!<br />\n  Understoryliving &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And for even more flexibility and customization, we have added the ability for you to add page-specific code snippets right from the WordPress classic editor as well as the Gutenberg editor. You can even load code snippets based on device type such as mobile only code snippets, desktop only code snippets, etc.</p>\n<h4>Import and Export Code Snippets</h4>\n<p>Managing multiple websites or developing in a staging environment?</p>\n<p>We offer an easy way to import and export your custom code snippets, functions, and header and footer scripts to help you save time.</p>\n<p>You can also save your code snippets to WPCode Cloud (Pro feature), so you can easily re-use the same code snippets across multiple websites. This also allows you to better organize your code snippets instead of wasting time searching for random Github gists.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Simple plugin I use in quite every site. Very useful to insert scripts and tags.<br />\n  tommasoperego &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Full WPCode Feature List</h4>\n<p>The simple interface of WPCode plugin (formerly known as Insert Headers and Footers) gives you one place where you can insert header and footer scripts as well as custom code snippets rather than dealing with dozens of different plugins.</p>\n<p>Below is a full list of WPCode features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick to set up</li>\n<li>Unlimited code snippets</li>\n<li>Simple to insert header and footer scripts globally</li>\n<li>Beginner Friendly Code Editor with Syntax Highlighter for PHP, JavaScript, and HTML</li>\n<li>Smart Code Validation to Prevent PHP Errors</li>\n<li>Insert header code and/or footer code using Conditional Logic</li>\n<li>Add <strong>Google Analytics</strong> code to header and footer</li>\n<li>Add <strong>custom CSS</strong> code to any theme</li>\n<li>Insert <strong>Facebook pixel</strong> code in header and footer</li>\n<li>Insert any code or script, including HTML and Javascript</li>\n<li>Insert PHP Code Snippets</li>\n<li>Ready-made Code Snippet Library</li>\n<li>Custom WordPress Code Snippet Generator</li>\n<li>Show or Hide PHP Code Snippets based on conditional logic</li>\n<li>Run PHP code and custom code snippets everywhere or in select areas using smart auto-insert rules.</li>\n<li>Manually insert PHP code snippets using shortcodes anywhere on website</li>\n<li>Add Rich Text Ads and Content Snippets automatically on posts &amp; pages.</li>\n<li>Export / Import Code Snippets</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong> Save snippets to Cloud Library &#8211; All your snippets stored in your private code snippet cloud.</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong> Deep integrations with Gutenberg, WooCommerce, and more.</li>\n<li>Device specific code snippets (such as load code snippets on mobile only, desktop only, etc)</li>\n<li>and more features coming soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>Insert Headers and Footers plugin was first created by <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Syed Balkhi</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPBeginner</a> team in 2011.</p>\n<p>It was later rebranded to WPCode in 2022 by Syed Balkhi to add powerful code snippets features that users were requesting for.</p>\n<h4>Branding Guideline</h4>\n<p>WPCode™ is a trademark of WPCode LLC.

No need to edit your theme files!</p>\n<p>Aside from Header and Footer scripts, you can also use WPCode to insert custom PHP code snippets, JavaScript code snippets, CSS code snippets, HTML code snippets, and text snippets with full conditional logic support.</p>\n<p>We took the pain out of adding custom code snippets in WordPress and made it easy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have been using Insert Headers and Footers and it is such a useful tool. Super helpful and the very best of its kind. Highly recommend<br />\n  The_Gibble &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Quick Overview of WPCode from WPBeginner</h4>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fo-7MKRRUec?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Introducing New WPCode Pro</strong><br />\n  While WPCode Lite offers tons of powerful features for free, we listened to user feedback and created WPCode Pro with even more amazing features to improve your workflow. This includes smart conditional logic, saving code snippets to cloud library, code revisions, page-specific snippets, deeper integration with popular plugins like WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, and so much more. <a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here to purchase the best premium WordPress code snippet plugin now!</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Future Proof Code Snippet Management</h4>\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/category/wp-tutorials/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress tutorial websites</a> ask you to add code snippets to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file. This makes managing code snippets messy, and it also prevents you from updating your theme.</p>\n<p>If you ever update your theme or switch to another theme, then you will lose all custom code functions that you added in your functions.php file.</p>\n<p>WPCode solves this by providing you an easy way to insert header and footer scripts along with other code snippets directly from your WordPress dashboard. These code snippets actually run as if they were in your theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<p>Our smart code snippet validation helps you prevent common code errors to ensure you never break your website when adding code snippets or header and footer scripts.</p>\n<p><strong>New WPCode Cloud Library</strong> even allows you to store all your custom code snippets in a cloud library, so you can easily re-use code snippets across multiple website projects and save time. You can keep your code snippets completely private or <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">share it with the community</a> to give back while boosting your social profile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This plugin allows me to not only add things to my site whenever needed, but it takes me only seconds to accomplish it.<br />\n  David Weber &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Full Code Snippets Library and Code Generators</h4>\n<p>Ever wanted a central place to find all the most popular WordPress code snippets that are tested and proven to work?</p>\n<p>When we started Insert Headers and Footers plugin, we did too. So we built a WordPress code snippets library right inside the WPCode plugin.</p>\n<p>You will find verified PHP code snippets for popular feature requests like disable REST API, disable XML-RPC, disable comments, allow SVG file uploads, disable Gutenberg, add Classic Editor, and more without installing separate plugins for each.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was very hesitant to get into any of the code for my website. Your plugin made it easy for me to do.<br />\n  Conbrio75 &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also built the ability to save your code snippets to <a href=\"https://library.wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPCode Cloud Library</a>, so you can easily re-use it on your other websites, client projects, or even share it with the larger community.</p>\n<p>WPCode Cloud Library helps you better organize your code snippets in one central location, so you can save more time and speed up your workflow when managing websites. No more wasting time looking for custom notes or Github gists.</p>\n<p>Aside from our growing code snippets library, we also have WordPress code generators to help you quickly get ready-to-use custom code using the latest WordPress coding standards and API&#8217;s.</p>\n<h4>Conditional Logic for Code Snippets + Code Insertion Priority</h4>\n<p>Our goal with WPCode was to create a WordPress code snippets plugin that&#8217;s both EASY and POWERFUL.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why aside from our global header and footer scripts, we added advanced features like conditional logic for code snippets and made it easy.</p>\n<p>Instead of learning WordPress conditional logic queries, you can use our beginner-friendly conditional logic user interface to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load code snippets for logged in users only</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets for specific user roles</li>\n<li>Load PHP code snippets only on specific page URLs</li>\n<li>Insert header and footer pixel scripts on specific pages</li>\n<li>Show code snippets based on type of page</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only on certain post types</li>\n<li>Load header and footer code snippet based on referrer source</li>\n<li>and more&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also added both automatic code insertion and manual code output using shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Our Auto Insert feature allows you to run the code snippet everywhere or choose from custom options like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run code snippet only on frontend</li>\n<li>Run code snippet only in WordPress admin area</li>\n<li>Add header and footer scripts sitewide</li>\n<li>Insert PHP code snippet before or after post content</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet before or after specific paragraph</li>\n<li>Insert code snippet on specific archive pages</li>\n<li>Insert code snippets after specific WooCommerce function (<a href=\"https://wpcode.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Feature</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from that, we also added a visual code snippet priority system, so you can choose the order for your custom functions to avoid code conflict.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is such a useful plugin! It makes it so much easier to include things on your website!<br />\n  Understoryliving &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And for even more flexibility and customization, we have added the ability for you to add page-specific code snippets right from the WordPress classic editor as well as the Gutenberg editor. You can even load code snippets based on device type such as mobile only code snippets, desktop only code snippets, etc.</p>\n<h4>Import and Export Code Snippets</h4>\n<p>Managing multiple websites or developing in a staging environment?</p>\n<p>We offer an easy way to import and export your custom code snippets, functions, and header and footer scripts to help you save time.</p>\n<p>You can also save your code snippets to WPCode Cloud (Pro feature), so you can easily re-use the same code snippets across multiple websites. This also allows you to better organize your code snippets instead of wasting time searching for random Github gists.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Simple plugin I use in quite every site. Very useful to insert scripts and tags.<br />\n  tommasoperego &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Full WPCode Feature List</h4>\n<p>The simple interface of WPCode plugin (formerly known as Insert Headers and Footers) gives you one place where you can insert header and footer scripts as well as custom code snippets rather than dealing with dozens of different plugins.</p>\n<p>Below is a full list of WPCode features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quick to set up</li>\n<li>Unlimited code snippets</li>\n<li>Simple to insert header and footer scripts globally</li>\n<li>Beginner Friendly Code Editor with Syntax Highlighter for PHP, JavaScript, and HTML</li>\n<li>Smart Code Validation to Prevent PHP Errors</li>\n<li>Insert header code and/or footer code using Conditional Logic</li>\n<li>Add <strong>Google Analytics</strong> code to header and footer</li>\n<li>Add <strong>custom CSS</strong> code to any theme</li>\n<li>Insert <strong>Facebook pixel</strong> code in header and footer</li>\n<li>Insert any code or script, including HTML and Javascript</li>\n<li>Insert PHP Code Snippets</li>\n<li>Ready-made Code Snippet Library</li>\n<li>Custom WordPress Code Snippet Generator</li>\n<li>Show or Hide PHP Code Snippets based on conditional logic</li>\n<li>Run PHP code and custom code snippets everywhere or in select areas using smart auto-insert rules.</li>\n<li>Manually insert PHP code snippets using shortcodes anywhere on website</li>\n<li>Add Rich Text Ads and Content Snippets automatically on posts &amp; pages.</li>\n<li>Export / Import Code Snippets</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong> Save snippets to Cloud Library &#8211; All your snippets stored in your private code snippet cloud.</li>\n<li><strong>New</strong> Deep integrations with Gutenberg, WooCommerce, and more.</li>\n<li>Device specific code snippets (such as load code snippets on mobile only, desktop only, etc)</li>\n<li>and more features coming soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<p>Insert Headers and Footers plugin was first created by <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Syed Balkhi</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPBeginner</a> team in 2011.</p>\n<p>It was later rebranded to WPCode in 2022 by Syed Balkhi to add powerful code snippets features that users were requesting for.</p>\n<h4>Branding Guideline</h4>\n<p>WPCode™ is a trademark of WPCode LLC.
