It does so by checking it for matches against the characters or words you have blacklisted in Settings-&gt;Discussion. Also on the Settings-&gt;Discussion page is a setting for the maximum allowed links that a comment can contain. This plugin will delete comments that have too many links. Spam can also be deleted if it has a url in the author url field. This is handy if you don&#8217;t have a author url form field in your comment form, and bots are submitting without using your form. Finally, spam can be deleted if there are any non US-en keyboard characters in any comment row. I don&#8217;t expect any foreign language characters on my blog, and while I know this setting may be a little harsh, it&#8217;s a spammy world out there, and sometimes ya gotta do what ya gotta do.</p>\n<p>This plugin adds a menu item in the Settings section of the admin area. Currently only three options are available:</p>\n<p>1) The frequency to run the automated process of removing spam. Default is twice a day.</p>\n<p>2) Whether or not to remove spam that has been submitted with the website field. Default is NO (unchecked).</p>\n<p>3) Whether or not to remove spam that has non US-en keyboard characters. Default is NO (unchecked).</p>\n",
