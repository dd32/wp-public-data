There, you can select the cookie expiration date of 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year on a per-account basis.</p>\n<p>After updating this setting, you <em>will</em> need to log out and back into WordPress for your new cookie expiration value to take effect.</p>\n<p>Enjoy your long cookie!</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Bumped required PHP version to 8.0.</p>\n<h4>2.0.3</h4>\n<p>@webaware has decided to help make this code less awful and submitted a pull request on GitHub. This release implements their improvements.</p>\n<h4>2.0.2</h4>\n<p>Sanitize. Not escape. Ack!</p>\n<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<p>Forgot to escape the lone <code>$_POST</code> in my code. Feel dumb about it. Fixed now tho.</p>\n<h4>2.0.0</h4>\n<p>Rewrite! Now, instead of forcing <em>everyone</em> to use the same login cookie expiration, Biscotti allows users to individually select their login cookie expiration on their profile page.</p>\n<h4>1.0.0</h4>\n<p>Initial release. Simple plugin that forced login cookie expiration for every user to 1 year.</p>\n"
