Note that it might work on<br />\nhigher versions&#8230; this is just the highest one you&#8217;ve verified.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stable tag should indicate the Subversion &#8220;tag&#8221; of the latest stable version, or &#8220;trunk,&#8221; if you use <code>/trunk/</code> for<br />\nstable.</p>\n<p>Note that the <code>readme.txt</code> of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so<br />\nif the <code>/trunk/readme.txt</code> file says that the stable tag is <code>4.3</code>, then it is <code>/tags/4.3/readme.txt</code> that&#8217;ll be used<br />\nfor displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk <code>readme.txt</code><br />\nis the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk <code>readme.txt</code> to reflect changes in<br />\nyour in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version<br />\nthat lacks those changes &#8212; as long as the trunk&#8217;s <code>readme.txt</code> points to the correct stable tag.</p>\n<p>If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify &#8220;trunk&#8221; if that&#8217;s where<br />\nyou put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
