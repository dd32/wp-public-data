However, you can put their CPM compensation to $0.  We purposely do not attract a lot of attention the the Author Profile tracking feature.  Maybe in a future release.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if I run minification?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We actually use CSS as part of our accuracy in counting page views.  Unfortunately, if you use CSS minification, we might not work properly with it.  We had to make some design choices and all of our sites are based off of frameworks with super clean CSS and we do not minify.  In fact, our past experiences with magnification corruption have just steered us clear of the topic all together.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
