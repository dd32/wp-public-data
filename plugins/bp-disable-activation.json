So, you should consider using other plugins and methods for preventing spammers from signing up on your site.  However, many people have seen spammers get through just fine even with email activation enabled.  Plus, some sites are designed so that email activation doesn&#8217;t matter.  Thus the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t want my users to automatically login?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Why don&#8217;t you?  Users will love that feature.  I&#8217;ll look at adding an option to turn this on/off.  Until then you can comment out those lines if you don&#8217;t want it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
