        "faq": "\n<h4>How to install this plugin and getting it working on my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all you&#8217;ll need yo install this plugin. Go to your plugins page on your WordPress dashboard and search for X-slider.<br />\nAfter installing you just need to set it in your theme.<br />\nOpen your favorite Text editor wherever you want to display it, for example, if you want to display on the top of every page,<br />\nopen your header.php theme and inside the  tag, insert the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php x_slider(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How to filter posts showing on slider?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP_Query</a> syntax on X-slider, so let&#8217;s say you want to only show slides for the &#8220;Featured&#8221; category,<br />\nyou should write:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php x_slider(array('category_name' =&gt; 'featured')); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to change the order, how to do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As already mentioned before, you can use <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP_Query</a> syntax for customizing your slider.<br />\nEx: Show only posts from &#8220;Featured&#8221; category ordered by date limiting to 5 slides max</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php x_slider(array('category_name' =&gt; 'featured', 'orderby' =&gt; 'date', 'order' =&gt; 'DESC', posts_per_page =&gt; 5)); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How to change the slider image dimensions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Accessing X_slider settings page right on the sidebar, click in &#8220;X-Slider Settings&#8221;, on the &#8220;Slider Upload Options&#8221;<br />\nsection you&#8217;ll be able to change the width and height settings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to change the slider timeout?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On settings page ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This slider is too ugly, how to customize it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can write your own CSS if you want to. The slider structure is very simple. Basically it&#8217;s a div with the x-slider class &#8220;.x-slider&#8221;<br />\nwith a UL and the slides are LI&#8217;s with a container wrapping a title, description and a button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i have multiple sliders on the same page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, just call <code>&lt;?php x_slider(); ?&gt;</code> as many times you want to.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
