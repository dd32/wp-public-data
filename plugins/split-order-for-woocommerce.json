Example: If an order has 4 products then the order is split into 4 different orders no matter what attribute is chosen.</p>\n<p>B) Split if attribute exists<br />\nWhen we enable this option, order splits only if any product contains a selected attribute. If an attribute is assigned to any of the products and now we choose to place an order by adding the product having assigned attribute and along with that some other products, then our order will be split according to the number of products present in the order placed.</p>\n<p>Like, if we have 6 products in order out of which two products have assigned attributes then the order will split in 6 different orders having different order ids. If none of the products in the order have the chosen attribute associated with them then the order won’t split at all.</p>\n<p>Like, in our previous example if none of the products out of 6 products has the desired attribute associated with them then there will be a single order having all the 6 products.</p>\n<p>C) Split according to attribute<br />\nIn this condition products having the same attribute will be clubbed into a single order and different orders will be created for different attributes also the products that do not have the chosen attribute associated with them will be clubbed into a single order.<br />\nLike, if an order has 6 products out of which 2 products have desired attributes associated with them and the rest four have no desired attribute, so now the order will be split into 2 different orders, one having products with desired attribute and one having products without the desired attribute.</p>\n<p>For more information, kindly visit our store website</p>\n</p>\n\n",
