        "faq": "\n<h4>FAQ</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Where do the images displayed come from?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images are based on the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; selected on the Edit Post screen. If the option is not displayed, click Screen Options in the top right of the Edit Post screen and check the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; checkbox.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I changed the size of the post scroll, but my images didn&#8217;t change size. What do I need to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any new image added to your site should have a thumbnail created in the correct new size. However, the old thumbnails will need to be regenerated. This can be done for all images on your site with the excellent <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" rel=\"ugc\">&#8220;Regenerate Thumbnails&#8221; plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What guidelines should I use when creating custom arrow images?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to figure this out is just to look at the images included with the plugin (wp-content/plugins/featured-posts-scroll/images), and format your images in the same basic manner. For the default arrow position (sides of the image), the arrow image should be 46&#215;100. For the alternate arrow position at the bottom of the scroll, the arrow image should be 48&#215;48. For the &#8220;no border&#8221; position, the arrow image should be 70&#215;120.</p>\n<p>For any configuration, the image should be split into four evenly sized quadrants. The top row is left/right arrows as they normally appear and the bottom row are the arrows as they appear when hovered over. The left column should be arrows pointing left, and the right column should be arrows pointing right.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting an error: &#8220;Call to undefined function has_post_thumbnail()&#8221;, and I can&#8217;t add a &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; to my posts.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This issue is typically caused by templates that don&#8217;t enable post thumbnails. If your template&#8217;s functions.php file does not contain this, you must add it:</p>\n<pre><code>add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I have the &#8220;Display Excerpts&#8221; option selected, but I&#8217;m not seeing anything</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will currently only display manually entered excerpts. Automatically generated excerpts will not be displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I save my settings, I get an error that says statics JS and/or CSS files can&#8217;t be saved. What can I do to fix this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you get this error, it means that the permissions on your server aren&#8217;t setup to let WordPress write directly to a file. To resolve this you&#8217;ll need to temporarily change the permissions on this plugin&#8217;s css and js directories, click &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; on the admin page, and then change the permissions back.</p>\n<p>You can change the permissions on your server either by using SSH or a config menu on your hosting service&#8217;s site (if they allow you to directly change permissions). With SSH access, navigate into the featured-posts-scroll directory and enter &#8220;chmod 777 css js&#8221;, click &#8220;Save Settings&#8221; on the admin page, and then change permissions back with &#8220;chmod 755 css js&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
