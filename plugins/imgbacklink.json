        "faq": "\n<h4>What exactly does this plugin do to my WordPress installation</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are no core file changes, this is purely a plugin that can easily be installed and uninstalled. There are no database changes or additions. This plugin does two things;<br />\n1. It loads the LinkMyPic javascript into your site which displays the box.<br />\n2. It adds a mouseup event into the image tags. You can see this after you add an image to your post, change to html view and you will see that a mouseup event has been added in the image source tags section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Images do not show on other web site</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not over-ride any hotlink protection yuo may have installed on wordpress or through your server management software such as cPanel. Either switch off your hotlink protection or if you know the other sites web address then whitelist it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the future hold for Imgbacklink</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When I get the time I plan on seeing if there&#8217;s a hook into the image editor screen so I can put in a tick box for you to choose if an individual image is covered by the plugin or not. At the moment all images you insert in a post or page is covered. To exclude an image you have to maunally change the code. It&#8217;s easy to do, after inserting the image into your page just change to html view and delete the mouseup event tag.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
