But in addition to that it solves another annoying issue with google pagespeed. Have you ever tried to increase your pagespeed score in google pagespeed insight? If you did, then you most likely ran into an annoying issue as part of the last few issues to solve. Google’s pagespeed bot will report in the Leverage browser caching section that http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js has an expiry date set to only 2 hours and thus prevent you from getting a Passed rule marker for the Leverage browser caching area.</p>\n<p>Most of us cannot avoid using google analytics for statistics on our website. But how can you control page expiry date on google server? You cannot. This is one of those stupid things we have to deal with. There are complex work-arounds for this. Like copying the analytics code to your own server and then run a cron job to update the analytics javascript every few hours. These work-arounds are usually quite complex and not recommended.</p>\n<p>QuantumCloud&#8217;s Google Analytics Tracker Plugin for WordPress is Google pagespeed friendly. The issue is overcome by not adding the analytics code in your source code when the plugin detects that it is google pagespeed bot that is requesting the page. The option is turned off by default.
