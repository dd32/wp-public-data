Second, make sure your server is up to modern requirements – we recommend PHP 7 or above.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20import%20failed%20or%20takes%20too%20much%20time%20to%20process%3F'>\nThe import failed or takes too much time to process?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can run the importer multiple times, as it will never import the same post twice. Once all episodes are imported, only future ones would be imported, assuming you selected the continuous import option. If you import a large feed while importing featured images, it may take several runs to fully complete, so make sure to run the import process several times until all episodes were imported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20podcast%20feeds%20from%20any%20host%3F'>\nDo you support podcast feeds from any host?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope.
