This plugin is an extension for WooCommerce which lets you sell printed smartphone cases with your own designs. Orders will be posted to Printeers automatically and shipments, product stocks and attributes are updated automatically.</p>\n<h4>Generating product variations</h4>\n<p>The most interesting feature is the Automatic Product Variations. There are so many different smartphone models and brands available that it is almost impossible to quickly setup your store and sell a case for them al. We have solved that problem. Printeers Print &amp; Ship makes it easy to generate product variations for every brand, phone model and case type. You can start selling your design on over 150 devices without much effort. Even the product images are rendered automatically. To make this a bit more visible, you can take a look at our showcase-website <a href=\"http://allinflavour.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All in Flavour</a>.</p>\n<h4>Automatic order processing through the order API using dropshipping</h4>\n<p>The plugin uses our order API. When your customer places an order and completes the payment, the order is automatically transferred to our system for printing and shipping. We print on demand phone cases. When we ship your order, the order status is changed automatically. Your customer receives an e-mail with a tracking code (if applicable) and shipping confirmation.</p>\n<h4>Price and stock imports</h4>\n<p>To make it even easier, the dropshipping-plugin also synchronizes pricing and product stocks. When your customer selects a product it will see the right price and the right stock levels. This means you will never by accident sell anything which is out of stock or sell something for the wrong price. We manage that for you.</p>\n",
