This is where my plugin comes into play.</p>\n<p>By using this, you get a proven plugin template for doing a daily gratitude journal, with the right blanks to fill in.  You just supply what you are grateful, using a theme<br />\nthat goes great with your personality.

The best way is to use the reposity, and let it do the installer for you.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want that route (for whatever reason)  you will need to manually upload it to the /wp-content/plugins directory, and unzip the file.</p>\n<p>Once that is done:<br />\n1. Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress<br />\n1. This plugin has it&#8217;s own settings page.<br />\n1. Go to the settings page, and update the options that you want, mainly what kind of text would you care for.<br />\n1. Go, start documenting what you are grateful for.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can multiple users use this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, they can.  Since this hooks into WordPress&#8217;s standard posts, anything that can be done on a post level, can be done on this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Please, give me something to put here.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>And I will update the readme for a good frequently asked question.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added in a new setting to allow the Gratitude Post to have a default visibility setting.  This is then carried over to doing a new Gratitude Journal.  Of course, the user can change it by changing the visibility before submitting the post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.0.0 Initial Release</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Not doing a point release, just ensured that activation does not produce the Number of Characters due to the wrong encoding.</li>\n</ul>\n"
