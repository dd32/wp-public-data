        "faq": "\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Extended Options keeps meta data and certain WordPress functionality tweaks consistent regardless of the active theme. In other words, you no longer need to edit the <code>header.php</code> file each time you change or upgrade your theme. Extended Options uses built-in WordPress functions to keep this information consistent regardless or your active theme.</p>\n<p>Extended Options also &#8216;tweaks&#8217; certain default WordPress behaviors, such as inserting the WordPress generator link, producing, allowing/disallowing the <code>www.</code> prefix in your URL, turning off author archives (i.e., if you have a single-author blog), automatically inserting certain discovery links for various protocols, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>That&#8217;s great. But I also have to edit the footer.php files for each of my themes. Can extended options also help me with my footer?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can insert your copyright, disclaimer, etc., regardless of your theme&#8217;s <code>footer.php</code> file automatically with Extended Options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Nice. What about the comment form? I usually put a comment license there.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can add your comment license with Extended Options regardless of your theme&#8217;s <code>comments.php</code> theme file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>And I don&#8217;t have to edit any of the theme files? Because that&#8217;s tedious stuff.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Well, probably not. See the <em>Use</em> section. A well-built theme will include the various hooks/actions necessary for Extended Options to operate properly. If your theme doesn&#8217;t include this, consider better themes and/or contact the theme author to correct these omissions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I will. By the way, I&#8217;m using one of your themes. Will they work with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Damn right they will. And thanks for using a <a href=\"http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/\" title=\"Themes for WordPress by plaintxt.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plaintxt.org theme</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I deactivated and then reactivated this plugin. Where did my settings go?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>They were deleted for ever and ever and ever. Upon deactivating, this plugins deletes all its stored data from your WordPress database. Tidy? Yes. A surprise just now? Definitely.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am confused by MicroID/OpenID/Geo Tags/favicons/robots/etc. Will you explain what they do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Links have been provided in the <em>Extended</em> options menu to sources that provide better information than I can. Nothing this plugin does can harm your blog in any way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have an OpenID and know my server and delegate URIs. What&#8217;s this stuff about a Yadis/XRDS URI?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t I just mention something about explaining? Sigh. This is a discovery link for second version of the OpenID protocol. You don&#8217;t need to supply this URI unless you know it. This particular meta link is optional even if OpenID is enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I already have a robots.txt file. Do I need to set robots meta links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not, unless your robots text file doesn&#8217;t specify search results and/or 404 pages (which it probably won&#8217;t). So those are two good options to enable even if you have a <code>robots.txt</code> file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if my robots.txt says it&#8217;s OK to visit a particular page, but then my robots meta link setting produces a nollow and/or noindex meta link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The page will not be indexed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>And what about if my robots.txt prohibits a robot/spider from visiting a page I say it can follow links and/or index?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The page will not be indexed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to put my favicon(s) in different location(s) than those available in the Extended Options menu. Can I?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. But you&#8217;ll need to add your own meta link and disable this option in the <em>Extended</em> options menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>That&#8217;s lame.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Except you probably shouldn&#8217;t keep your favicon any where else other than your root directory. And plus you can just use a base 64 encoded string for a favicon too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>That&#8217;s fun.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>After I enter some HTML code in to the the meta/comment/footer add-in fields and save, my HTML gets stripped out. What gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The user account you are logged in to while saving this code must have a user level that allows saving unfiltered HTML, i.e., administrator level. Otherwise, your code gets sanitized for security. If you can add HTML to a text widget, then you should be able to add code to these add-ins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about the various protocol (Atom, RSD, WLM) meta links? What happens if I disabled them all?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing, except you won&#8217;t be able to use third-party blog clients to post to your blog. And that&#8217;s about it. These discovery links won&#8217;t affect your visibility.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Oh. So I should probably just disable those, right?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you should.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;d like to modify this plugin in some way unavailable through its options menu. Will you help me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. I apologize as I am unable to help with modifications with any of my plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Thanks.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
