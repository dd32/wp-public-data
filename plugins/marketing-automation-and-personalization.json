It can involve many channels and tools, meaning high costs and learning curves and unharmonized, generic output.</p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert is a cross-channel marketing automation platform that unifies everything you need to build, run and measure smart web pages, emails and pop-ups.</p>\n<p>The ‚Äòsmart marketing‚Äô capacity in ConvesioConvert is made possible through industry-leading targeting accuracy and highly tailored content.</p>\n<h3>ConvesioConvert is best for&#8230;</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce customer acquisition cost via smart landing pages based on geolocation or referring source.</li>\n<li>Collect more leads by showing personalized coupons in on-exit pop-ups.</li>\n<li>Boost engagement with your web pages using personalized greetings, products and blogs based on customer history.</li>\n<li>Drive repeat sales with highly-personalized cross-selling emails.</li>\n<li>Re-engage abandoned carts better by showing cart items and discount coupons in the follow-up email.</li>\n<li>Measure the performance of every campaign by tailored metrics, uncover successful funnels in your website and decide what‚Äôs next</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who can use ConvesioConvert?</h3>\n<p>‚úî WooCommerce Stores<br />\n‚úî Marketing Agencies<br />\n‚úî Digital Marketers<br />\n‚úî Dropshippers<br />\n‚úî All WordPress Websites</p>\n<h3>What makes ConvesioConvert a game-changer?</h3>\n<p><strong>üí™ The only marketing automation tool to masterfully mix smart with omnichannel</strong></p>\n<p>No need for separate tools for email marketing, popup and web pages. ConvesioConvert is the only tool to operate in all of these touchpoints, helping you with less fragmentation, shorter learning curve and lower costs.</p>\n<p><strong>üí™ Most advanced targeting and segmentation</strong></p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert offers the most extensive segmentation criteria with 100+ filters. The similar solutions in WordPress solutions are not even close to this depth of segmentation and targeting. The closest competitor outside WordPress space would be Drip, which is email-only, offers limited segmentation and no web page personalization capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>üí™ Pricing</strong></p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert offers a noticeably lower price point based on your usage compared to other tools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All features are included in all plans and tiers</li>\n<li>No extra fees or extensions for SMTP email delivery</li>\n<li>No extra fees for geolocation targeting</li>\n<li>No extra fees for server storage</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4 pillars of smart marketing in ConvesioConvert</h3>\n<p><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Target Smarter With Best-In-Class Segmentation:</strong></p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert collects and unifies 360¬∞ customer data from different channels based on 100+ filters including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Site activity: landing &amp; visited Pages, average time spent, visit count &amp; dates, &#8230;</li>\n<li>Shopping behavior: viewed &amp; purchased products, total spent, order count and dates, &#8230;</li>\n<li>RFM values (recency, frequency and monetary) and overall RFM score</li>\n<li>Email behavior: number of opens and clicks, specific campaign engagement, &#8230;</li>\n<li>Referring source: domain, UTMs, geolocation, &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create segments with any combinations of these metrics or use pre-made segments such as active customers, bounced visitors, cart abandoners or returning users as well as loyalty-based (RFM ) segments such as loyalist, promising, disengaged, &#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Highly-Targeted Web Pages, Emails, Pop-Ups</strong></p>\n<p>Create and serve tailored marketing campaigns for every audience segment including tailored webpages, emails, pop-ups and more, all from one powerful dashboard.</p>\n<p>Create one-off or recurring automations with single or multiple conditions and actions.</p>\n<p>Threefold automation technology (trigger, audience, action) combines real-time behavior (such as placing an order, requesting refund, abandoning a cart,..) with historical records (such as lifetime time spent, total number of visits,&#8230;) to create super-rich marketing campaigns with laser-precision targeting.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, use these premade automation recipes to form your marketing arsenal in minutes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Black Friday email</li>\n<li>Returning user discount pop-up</li>\n<li>Cart abandoner follow-up</li>\n<li>Regionally personalized landing page</li>\n<li>New customer welcome email</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Marketing Content: 100% Visual, Zero Coding, Highly Personalized</strong></p>\n<p>Faster growth starts with relevancy.</p>\n<p>Use a drag &amp; drop builder to build highly-personalized emails, pop-ups and webpages or get started with ready-made marketing templates for every purpose (nurturing, customer loyalty, customer retention and more).</p>\n<p>Use dynamic content modules such as dynamic product list, blog list and keywords to hyper-personalize content and skyrocket engagement with your campaign. For example, display:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abandoned cart items in your follow-up email</li>\n<li>Related cross-sell items on the homepage based on last purchase</li>\n<li>Discounted products inside a pop-up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use 30+ dynamic keywords to personalize your marketing content even further.</p>\n<p><strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ Track, Attribute &amp; Optimize: Your Entire Analytics in One Place</strong></p>\n<p>This is not your usual Google Analytics report! ConvesioConvert marketing and attribution is efficient, comprehensive and value driven.</p>\n<p>The ConvesioConvert Reports page provides a general performance report on website engagement, sales, customers and emails with tailored KPIs and comparison charts to measure growth in the time frame of your choice.</p>\n<p>Additionally, campaign analytics reports are centrally organized to show engagement and conversions by that campaign separately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-ups: views, sign-ups, sales</li>\n<li>Smart web pages: Impressions, sign-ups, revenue</li>\n<li>Email campaigns: opens, clicks, revenue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Powerful attribution reports also measure sign-ups and sales referred from domains, UTMs and geolocations.</p>\n<h3>How ConvesioConvert compares</h3>\n<p>Using too many tools on marketing instead of your business?

It can involve many channels and tools, meaning high costs and learning curves and unharmonized, generic output.</p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert is a cross-channel marketing automation platform that unifies everything you need to build, run and measure smart web pages, emails and pop-ups.</p>\n<p>The ‚Äòsmart marketing‚Äô capacity in ConvesioConvert is made possible through industry-leading targeting accuracy and highly tailored content.</p>\n<h3>ConvesioConvert is best for&#8230;</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce customer acquisition cost via smart landing pages based on geolocation or referring source.</li>\n<li>Collect more leads by showing personalized coupons in on-exit pop-ups.</li>\n<li>Boost engagement with your web pages using personalized greetings, products and blogs based on customer history.</li>\n<li>Drive repeat sales with highly-personalized cross-selling emails.</li>\n<li>Re-engage abandoned carts better by showing cart items and discount coupons in the follow-up email.</li>\n<li>Measure the performance of every campaign by tailored metrics, uncover successful funnels in your website and decide what‚Äôs next</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who can use ConvesioConvert?</h3>\n<p>‚úî WooCommerce Stores<br />\n‚úî Marketing Agencies<br />\n‚úî Digital Marketers<br />\n‚úî Dropshippers<br />\n‚úî All WordPress Websites</p>\n<h3>What makes ConvesioConvert a game-changer?</h3>\n<p><strong>üí™ The only marketing automation tool to masterfully mix smart with omnichannel</strong></p>\n<p>No need for separate tools for email marketing, popup and web pages. ConvesioConvert is the only tool to operate in all of these touchpoints, helping you with less fragmentation, shorter learning curve and lower costs.</p>\n<p><strong>üí™ Most advanced targeting and segmentation</strong></p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert offers the most extensive segmentation criteria with 100+ filters. The similar solutions in WordPress solutions are not even close to this depth of segmentation and targeting. The closest competitor outside WordPress space would be Drip, which is email-only, offers limited segmentation and no web page personalization capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>üí™ Pricing</strong></p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert offers a noticeably lower price point based on your usage compared to other tools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All features are included in all plans and tiers</li>\n<li>No extra fees or extensions for SMTP email delivery</li>\n<li>No extra fees for geolocation targeting</li>\n<li>No extra fees for server storage</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4 pillars of smart marketing in ConvesioConvert</h3>\n<p><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Target Smarter With Best-In-Class Segmentation:</strong></p>\n<p>ConvesioConvert collects and unifies 360¬∞ customer data from different channels based on 100+ filters including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Site activity: landing &amp; visited Pages, average time spent, visit count &amp; dates, &#8230;</li>\n<li>Shopping behavior: viewed &amp; purchased products, total spent, order count and dates, &#8230;</li>\n<li>RFM values (recency, frequency and monetary) and overall RFM score</li>\n<li>Email behavior: number of opens and clicks, specific campaign engagement, &#8230;</li>\n<li>Referring source: domain, UTMs, geolocation, &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create segments with any combinations of these metrics or use pre-made segments such as active customers, bounced visitors, cart abandoners or returning users as well as loyalty-based (RFM ) segments such as loyalist, promising, disengaged, &#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Highly-Targeted Web Pages, Emails, Pop-Ups</strong></p>\n<p>Create and serve tailored marketing campaigns for every audience segment including tailored webpages, emails, pop-ups and more, all from one powerful dashboard.</p>\n<p>Create one-off or recurring automations with single or multiple conditions and actions.</p>\n<p>Threefold automation technology (trigger, audience, action) combines real-time behavior (such as placing an order, requesting refund, abandoning a cart,..) with historical records (such as lifetime time spent, total number of visits,&#8230;) to create super-rich marketing campaigns with laser-precision targeting.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, use these premade automation recipes to form your marketing arsenal in minutes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Black Friday email</li>\n<li>Returning user discount pop-up</li>\n<li>Cart abandoner follow-up</li>\n<li>Regionally personalized landing page</li>\n<li>New customer welcome email</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Marketing Content: 100% Visual, Zero Coding, Highly Personalized</strong></p>\n<p>Faster growth starts with relevancy.</p>\n<p>Use a drag &amp; drop builder to build highly-personalized emails, pop-ups and webpages or get started with ready-made marketing templates for every purpose (nurturing, customer loyalty, customer retention and more).</p>\n<p>Use dynamic content modules such as dynamic product list, blog list and keywords to hyper-personalize content and skyrocket engagement with your campaign. For example, display:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abandoned cart items in your follow-up email</li>\n<li>Related cross-sell items on the homepage based on last purchase</li>\n<li>Discounted products inside a pop-up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use 30+ dynamic keywords to personalize your marketing content even further.</p>\n<p><strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ Track, Attribute &amp; Optimize: Your Entire Analytics in One Place</strong></p>\n<p>This is not your usual Google Analytics report! ConvesioConvert marketing and attribution is efficient, comprehensive and value driven.</p>\n<p>The ConvesioConvert Reports page provides a general performance report on website engagement, sales, customers and emails with tailored KPIs and comparison charts to measure growth in the time frame of your choice.</p>\n<p>Additionally, campaign analytics reports are centrally organized to show engagement and conversions by that campaign separately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pop-ups: views, sign-ups, sales</li>\n<li>Smart web pages: Impressions, sign-ups, revenue</li>\n<li>Email campaigns: opens, clicks, revenue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Powerful attribution reports also measure sign-ups and sales referred from domains, UTMs and geolocations.</p>\n<h3>How ConvesioConvert compares</h3>\n<p>Using too many tools on marketing instead of your business?
