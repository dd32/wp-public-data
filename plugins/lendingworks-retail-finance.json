        "description": "<p>Lending Works matches investors directly with borrowers who want to spread the cost of their purchase. By cutting out the old financial institutions, we help your customers buy more for less. There are no hidden fees for you or customers. Just simple, flexible finance on purchases from £50 to £25,000. Lending Works isn’t like old fashioned financial services companies. We seamlessly connect people that want to invest their money with sensible borrowers who want to get a better rate on their personal loan, so both get a better deal. Rather than focusing exclusively on profits, we focus on being fair, transparent and honest. These values not only make us proud of the way we treat our customers, but also help us to set a new standard in financial services. This extension will add a new payment option, Lending Works Retail Finance, to your checkout. This allows customers to apply directly to Lending Works for finance when making a purchase, and if approved, proceed with the order in minutes.
