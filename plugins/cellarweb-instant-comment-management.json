        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20this%3F'>\nWhat is this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you moderate comments from the front end, all you normally see is the Edit link next to the comment. That brings you to the Admin, Comment Edit screen, where you can select Pending, Spam, etc, and then click the Update button. Or you can move it to the trash. Then back to the comment list screen, scroll down to find the next one on the list, and repeat.</p>\n<p>A lot of clicks to perform simple functions.</p>\n<p>This plugin shows extra links next to the Edit link: Spam, Trash, or Delete. One click for one action, and the comment goes away. And you are still in the same spot in your comment list. Much faster and easier!</p>\n<p>Only the admin (or those with Edit Comment role) will see those extra links. Regular visitors will just see the comment list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20other%20security-related%20plugins%3F'>\nDo you have other security-related plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yep!  One of our favorites will block all comment spam &#8211; and another that blocks bots from contact forms. It&#8217;s very effective. We put it on one site that was getting a lot of comment spam, and now there is none. Not one. And we don&#8217;t get any contact form spam on sites that use the technique.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;Block Comment Spam Bots&#8221;, and can be found in the WP plugin repository. And there&#8217;s a link to it (and other plugins we&#8217;ve done) on this plugin&#8217;s Settings/Information page.  The Contact Form bot-blocker is called &#8220;FormSpammerTrap&#8221;, and is available at <a href=\"https://www.FormSpammerTrap.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.FormSpammerTrap.com</a> .</p>\n<p>Check out all our plugins at <a href=\"https://cellarweb.com/wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://cellarweb.com/wordpress-plugins/</a> .</p>\n</p>\n\n",
