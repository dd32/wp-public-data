        "faq": "\n<h4>Why is the coordinator portion behind the admin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I felt the creation or modification of a challenge was an administrative function and so it deserved to be behind the<br />\nadmin dashboard.  If you want to allow another user on your site to create or modify a challenge, they will have to have<br />\nthe &#8216;manage_options&#8217; permission set.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if I initially set a challenge for approval required, then change it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The challenge will automatically approve all pending participants and any future participants will automatically be approved</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Once the challenge is over what happens?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need to visit the Point Tracker -&gt; Participants page to see who has the most points</p>\n</p>\n<h4>A participant entered some wrong information, what do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can either delete it yourself or if they visit the View My Activity page (/my-activity/?chal={linkcode}), they will be able to delete it themselves</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is a &#8220;hidden&#8221; activity?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is an activity that will not be scored.  The points will be defaulted to 0.  They will also not be displayed on any public displays other than the challenge form asking the user for their answer.  They are ideal for collecting information like feedback that you don&#8217;t necessarily want to reward.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is an activity &#8220;group&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Activity groups allow you to group the activities into sections with a header.  This allow the participants to more easily find the questions they are wanting to answer.  They are optional.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I create a custom page</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve created a challenge, copy/paste the unique code for the challenge into a new shortcode <code>[challenge chal={challenge code you copied}][/challenge]</code>, then publish the page.  You can also create custom pages for the My Activity and Leader Board pages using their respective shortcodes (<code>[my_activity chal={code}][/my_activity]</code> and <code>[leader_board chal={code]][/leader_board]</code>).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;d like a leader board</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One will be available in Point Tracker Pro at https://wppointtracker.com/point-tracker-pro/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
