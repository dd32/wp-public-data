        "faq": "\n<h4>What are some of the use cases for Simple Post Inserter?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Simple Post Inserter by nature is designed to be flexible. This means that the admin will have complete<br />\n    control over what is displayed. This could be just some text or some html containing an embedded video. It is up to the<br />\n    discretion of the admin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I style my embedded HTML?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Yes, styling can be done through inserting an inline style script with the HTML or by using already defined elements<br />\n    within your theme. If you are the sits developer you can declare the class, label of the element inside the settings page<br />\n    and retroactively add the style into your style.css file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My content is not displaying where I requested it to show, what is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. The display filters for Simple Post Inserter follow a general hierarchy. If a post ID is entered into the settings<br />\n    it will ignore your filters for post type and categories and only apply to that post ID. Then the category will be checked,<br />\n    then the post type.</p>\n<pre><code>In addition there should be error messages thrown if you enter an invalid slug into one of the filters. This will not stop the\nplugin from working, but the filter will be ignored. \n\nIf your content is still not displaying and you are unsure why. Submit a ticket to the developer through [contact](https://codexi.io/contact)\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add multiple inserts per post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. At this time, no that is not possible with this plugin. It may or may not be implemented in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I insert my content to the top or bottom of a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Use the insert paragraph setting. Set the value to 0 to put it on top of all of the post paragraphs.<br />\n    Set the value to a high number, that exceeds the total amount of paragraphs in any of your posts to put it at the bottom.<br />\n    i.e. &#8220;999&#8221; should be a large enough number to put it on the bottom of most if not all posts (assuming you do not have very long content).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The middle option isn&#8217;t working correctly, what is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. The middle option counts all the paragraph tags in the post. Sometimes there are paragraph tags that are empty for whatever reason.<br />\n    Go to the page and inspect it to see all the paragraph tags and what they are holding, you may find paragraphs that are holding nothing.</p>\n<pre><code>The middle option also does not account for the length of each paragraph, or other pieces of content such as images, headings, etc.\nWhich will likely make it seem that the content you inserted isn't directly balanced in the middle. There may or may not be future updates\nto balance based of other parameters, such as character count.\n\nLastly, for posts with odd numbered amounts of paragraphs the content will have a tendency toward the bottom based on the rounding used.\nFor example a post with 7 paragraphs will have 4 on the top of your content and 3 on the bottom.\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
