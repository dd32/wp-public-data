This is then used to suggest other posts, pages or content on your site that visitors may like. You will have seen something similar on sites where they say &#8220;You may also like&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Other visitors were interested in&#8230;&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Some key features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As it works by examining the URL, it will work with all content types in all languages which users may visit, for example articles, products, pages, blog posts, courses, photo galleries etc.</li>\n<li>No visitor statistics or data leaves your website.

They are only accessed by site administrators when they view the statistics tab inside the plugin settings area. Both of these javascript libraries are obfuscated to make the files smaller and faster to load. They are:<br />\n* Chart.js &#8211; https://www.chartjs.org &#8211; MIT License &#8211; Full source available from: https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js<br />\n* Vis.js (network) &#8211; https://visjs.org &#8211; APACHE 2.0 License &#8211; Full source available from: https://github.com/visjs/vis-network</p>\n<p>The plugin also talks to my server in order to check if the Pro licensed features should be unlocked and to download updated block-lists for search engine bots and bad IP addresses. The information it passes to the server is:<br />\n* A unique ID number for your website (containing no personal or private information)<br />\n* The host URL of your website in case the website or plugin gets re-installed so it can retrieve your unique ID number.</p>\n<p>Communication with my server occurs once when the plugin is activated, then twice a day.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20there%20anything%20i%20need%20to%20do%20before%20i%20install%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nIs there anything I need to do before I install the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ALWAYS make a backup of your website before making changes or installing new plugins, just in case. Even better, copy your website to a test server and try out the plugin there first. There should not be any issues and the plugin is easy to uninstall if needed, but it is better to be safe than sorry. As long as you are running WordPress as the content management system driving your website and are able to install custom plugins, it should work. You can try the plugin for free to ensure you are happy before registering it and paying for the PRO features. As WordPress is so flexible and there are is so much customisation possible I cannot guarantee it will work on every instance, and cannot be held responsible for any issues that arrise.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20it%20be%20told%20to%20only%20suggest%20some%20content%20and%20not%20others%3F'>\nCan it be told to only suggest some content and not others?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. In the settings for the plugin you can set what must appear in the URL for it to be included in the neural network, for example if you only want it to learn and suggest about blog articles you may want it to only monitor URLs which contain &#8220;/article/&#8221; or &#8220;/blog/&#8221;. For an online shop, you might want to only monitor and suggest products which all live under &#8220;/product/&#8221;. If there are particular pages or parts of your site that you don&#8217;t want it to know about then you can add those too. You can even get it to strip out certain variables which appear in the URL such as search terms or ID numbers, or all GET variables. It is quite flexible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20search%20terms%20and%20other%20variables%20in%20the%20url%3F'>\nWhat about search terms and other variables in the URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can tell it to strip all GET variables from the URL if you wish, or just certain ones. By default, WordPress tends to add search terms to the URL using an &#8220;s&#8221; variable so just that can be removed if you like. If you are using permalinks for your URLs and not replying on ID numbers added as GET variables to the URL then I recommend stripping all GET variables.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20time%20limit%20for%20the%20free%20version%20of%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nIs there a time limit for the free version of the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can use the free version for as long as you like but it does have limits on the amount of content and links it will use to build the neural network. This might be enough for smaller sites and should be enough for you to try the plugin and ensure it works fully before you decide if you want to purchase the PRO version. You get some other benefits from registering too, such as the automatic updating and detecting of search engine spiders and bad IP addresses, plus email support if you need it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20pro%20version%20a%20subscription%20service%3F'>\nIs the PRO version a subscription service?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there is no subscription needed. Unlocking the PRO features is a one-time fee for the lifetime of the product.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20it%20suggest%20links%20on%20other%20websites%3F'>\nWill it suggest links on other websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin only learns from URLs accessed on your website, and will only form links to other URLs within your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20send%20data%20to%20you%20or%20share%20information%20with%20anyone%20else%3F'>\nDoes the plugin send data to you or share information with anyone else?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It checks in with my server to see if you are a PRO user, but no visitor data or statistics leave your server and nothing is shared with any third parties. Security and privacy is very important.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20change%20the%20permalink%20structure%20or%20urls%20in%20my%20website%3F'>\nWhat if I change the permalink structure or URLs in my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is smart enough to know if pages or posts etc. are no longer there (e.g. deleted) and will not recommend them any more, but it cannot know if something has moved. This is why it is important to ensure your website URLs are formatted how you want them to be before switching on &#8220;Learning Mode&#8221;. You can wipe the Neural Net and start again if needed from the settings area (under the &#8220;Reset&#8221; tab) but there is no way to undo a reset. The brain will be washed clean!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20use%20chatgpt%20or%20google%20gemini%20etc.%20for%20it%27s%20artificial%20intelligence%3F'>\nDoes it use ChatGPT or Google Gemini etc. for it&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Those are LLMs (Large Language Models) and aren&#8217;t required for a single, specialised task like this. The machine learning system built for this plugin is unique and entirely self-contained within the plugin so there is no need to use any external services.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20easy%20is%20it%20to%20set%20up%3F'>\nHow easy is it to set up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Very easy. Once installed you simply need to ensure you enter some key bits of information in the plugin settings area so it doesn&#8217;t start learning about parts of your website you do not want it to suggest. Once you are happy it will only collect visits for the relevant parts of your website, turn on &#8220;Learning Mode&#8221; and it will start to make the neural net. The more visitors your site gets, the more links it will create and the more accurate it&#8217;s suggestions will become. I recommend leaving it learning for a while before getting it to suggest links to visitors. You can see how the neural network is progressing by looking at the &#8220;Statistics&#8221; tab in the plugin settings. You can leave the learning mode on while it is making suggestions, or turn it off if you feel it has learned enough.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20insert%20the%20suggested%20links%3F'>\nHow do I insert the suggested links?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Insert the shortcode [rpnnrecommend] where ever you want it to list some suggested links. By default it will show 3 suggestions with thumbnails of their featured image. You can adjust how it appears by adding parameters like [rpnnrecommend total=&#8221;6&#8243; thumbnails=&#8221;false&#8221; class=&#8221;recommendedlist&#8221; title=&#8221;You might like&#8230;&#8221;] which would suggest six items the visitor might be interested in, without featured image thumbnails, and assign the CSS class called &#8220;recommendedlist&#8221; to it. You can insert the shortcode into template files using the PHP command echo do_shortcode(&#8220;[rpnnrecommend]&#8221;);</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20some%20visits%20registering%20and%20appearing%20in%20the%20graphs%3F'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t some visits registering and appearing in the graphs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The first page viewed by new visitors will get stored but will not create a synapse/path as they have not viewed any other page yet. Every visitor session lasts a maximum of 1 hour. If they return to your website after an hour, it classes it as a new session.</p>\n<p>If you think visits to multiple pages are not being recognised, your server may have some kind of aggressive caching switched on so the visitor is seeing a cached version of the pages rather than it triggering a new view. Check your caching settings or consult your hosting provider if unsure.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20your%20background%20and%20why%20did%20you%20write%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat is your background and why did you write this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have been writing software for decades and spent 20 years working in education. I have written software for many industries including education, automotive, child safety, medical and gaming. Artificial Intelligence and especially neural networks have been an interest of mine for some time. I have built a few for specialist tasks and as I build websites and cloud based applications I thought a WordPress plugin would be very useful for my clients and anyone else with a WordPress website.<br />\nThe neural network is based on the model in my book, &#8220;Make Independent Computer Games&#8221; available from Amazon:<br />\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CNMFHZ6Z<br />\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNMFHZ6Z</p>\n</p>\n\n",
