Customer is redirected to E-Billing portal which displays instructions for paying per wallet provider. Once the payment is validated by the operator or the bank, E-Billing is automatically notified and in return notifies the merchant of the validation of the payment. This plugin automates all this notification process.<br />\nThis plugin comes with 3 deployment modes: LAB, STAGING, and PROD. By default, LAB Mode is active. It is highly recommended to test your integration in E-Billing LAB environment before you move to STAGING or PROD.</p>\n",
