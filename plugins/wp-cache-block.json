        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>wp-cache-block</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Add cache block areas to the slower parts of your theme.  See below.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Adding a cache block only requires wrapping the section of content you want to cache in a couple of lines of code.  The key is make sure that the cache block is uniquely idtentified based on the content it will render.</p>\n<p>For simple content that is the same on every page:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if(wp_cacheblock_start('my-content')) : ?&gt;\n//the content you want to cache\n&lt;?php endif; wp_cacheblock_end(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Content that varies based on page, user, etc, will need to use key builders.  Key builders are simple classes that help make a unique key for the block of content based on different parameters.</p>\n<p>For caching the_loop in index.php you&#8217;ll need to add a Query_Unique_Key_Builder which creates a key based on passed in query_var keys:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php $key_builders = array(new Query_Unique_Key_Builder( array ('paged') ) );\n&lt;?php if(wp_cacheblock_start( 'index-loop', array('key_builders'=&gt; $key_builders) ) ) : ?&gt;\n  //the post loop\n&lt;?php endif; wp_cacheblock_end(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>To cache the comment output, you can use the Pending_Comment_Unique_Key_Builder so users with pending comments will get their own cached page.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php $key_builders = array( new Pending_Comment_Unique_Key_Builder() );\n&lt;?php if(wp_cacheblock_start('index-loop', array('key_builders'=&gt; $key_builders) ) ) : ?&gt;\n  //the comment loop\n&lt;?php endif; wp_cacheblock_end(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having to render complex data per user, the Per_User_Unique_Key_Builder will help create a unique key per user for the content:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php $key_builders = array( new Per_User_Unique_Key_Builder() );\n&lt;?php if(wp_cacheblock_start('index-loop', array('key_builders'=&gt; $key_builders) ) ) : ?&gt;\n  //the user specific content\n&lt;?php endif; wp_cacheblock_end(); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not.  Full page rendering is the best solution for most sites.  This plugin is really only useful for sites that have a great deal of user specific content areas that causes full page caching to no longer be an option.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
