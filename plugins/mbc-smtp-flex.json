        "faq": "\n<h4>How to I fix a connection failure problem?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin is unable to connect to your server, ensure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your server&#8217;s outbound ports allow traffic over your SMTP port</li>\n<li>Try to ping the SMTP host directly from your server if you have SSH available</li>\n<li>Consider a CNAME wrapper to the host if your hosting company is blocking that domain</li>\n<li>Check whitelist/blacklist options with SMTP server host and whitelist your server IP if possible</li>\n<li>Ensure OpenSSL is available on the server (OPENSSL_VERSION_TEXT) if you are using ssl or tls for connection security</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How to I configure this for Amazon SES?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To configure the plugin for Amazon Simple Email Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup your domain with Amazon SES and ensure the DNS settings are entered to validate the domain (we recommend using Route 53 to simplify the process)</li>\n<li>If you are new to Amazon SES, you need to force both the sender and recipient while in sandbox mode to a verified address</li>\n<li>In order to get out of sandbox mode, you need to request a quota limit change, with the request to allow to valid recipients. Please read this article for more information: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html</li>\n<li>For TLS connections, use port 587 and for SSL use port 465</li>\n<li>When you are out of the sandbox mode, you can deselect the force recipient option and test to an arbitrary email address</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
