        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20cmp%3F'>\nDo I need a CMP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Short answer: Probably yes. Long answer: If your company is based in the EEA (European Economic Area) or if you are dealing with customers/visitors from this area and show them advertising, it is very likely that you will collect and/or process personal data such as IP-addresses. Therefore, according to GDPR, you need to make sure that the visitor is informed and you need to ask the user for consent. In order to do this you will need a CMP.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20does%20this%20become%20necessary%3F'>\nWhen does this become necessary?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>GDPR is &#8220;active&#8221; since 25. of May 2018. From this day on you will probably need a CMP.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20obtain%20consent%20from%20my%20visitors%3F'>\nHow do I obtain consent from my visitors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By integrating our CMP into your website ðŸ˜‰ Our CMP will display a message to visitors and ask them to give consent. We will then store this choice and make it available to your advertisers and other vendors (tools) so that they know if/how they can work with personal data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20cmp%20block%20advertisers%20from%20my%20page%20do%20not%20have%20consent%3F'>\nWill the CMP block advertisers from my page do not have consent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, our CMP offers a solution to block advertisers/codes that do not have consent from the visitor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20complicated%3F'>\nIs it complicated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! In the simplest case you only have to integrate a code into your website &#8211; that&#8217;s all!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='your%20question%20is%20missing%20here%3F'>\nYour question is missing here?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any question that you think is missing here?
