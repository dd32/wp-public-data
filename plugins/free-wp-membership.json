This plugin is based on that original source tree. (Thus why it starts on version 1.1.4)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When is feature &#8220;X&#8221; going to be done?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I work on Free WP-Membership as time permits, so the best answer I can give is &#8220;When it&#8217;s done&#8221;. With that said it is open source and you can contribute to it. To do so simply fork the project on <a href=\"https://github.com/Foran/free-wp-membership\" title=\"Fork Me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a> and submit a pull request with your changes.<br />\nNow while I don&#8217;t have any specific dates things will be done, I am keeping a current list of the sequence things are planned to be done at <a href=\"http://free-wp-membership.foransrealm.com/Issues.html\" title=\"Current Issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issues</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Foran/free-wp-membership/issues\" title=\"Current Issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is currently being worked on?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"http://free-wp-membership.foransrealm.com/Issues.html\" title=\"Current Issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Issues</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/Foran/free-wp-membership/issues\" title=\"Current Issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a> pages for the most current list of items.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
