        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to <code>/wp-content/plugins/mcavoy</code> or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Eww, this plugin adds a new database table? Can&#8217;t I put the data somewhere else?</h4>\n<p>Absolutely! Creating a new database table isn&#8217;t ideal in a lot of situations, so McAvoy has been built from the ground-up to be flexible in the way the data is handled.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to send the data to something like <a href=\"https://www.firebase.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Firebase</a>, you can easily do so by creating a new callback attached to the <code>mcavoy_save_search_query</code> action:</p>\n<pre><code>    /**      * Save a search query to Firebase.      *      * @param string $term     The search term.      * @param array  $metadata Meta data that should be saved with the query.      */     function save_search_query_to_firebase( $term, $metadata ) {         // do something with this data!     }     add_action( 'mcavoy_save_search_query', 'save_search_query_to_firebase', 10, 2 ); </code></pre>\n<h4>What&#8217;s all this about requiring at least PHP 5.3?</h4>\n<p>McAvoy has been written using <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP Namespaces</a>, which is super common in the larger PHP community but rather rare in WordPress (as WordPress strives to support as many people as possible). For most users, this minimum requirement shouldn&#8217;t be of any concern (after all, <a href=\"http://php.net/supported-versions.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">security patches stopped being delivered for PHP 5.3 in mid-2014</a>).</p>\n<p>If you <strong>are</strong> affected, however, I urge you to <em>please</em> upgrade your server (or change hosts) as soon as humanely possible. Besides the obvious benefits of having current security patches, newer versions of PHP are more performant than ever.</p>\n<h4>Who the heck is McAvoy?</h4>\n<p>This plugin was designed to answer five questions about your site&#8217;s audience, specifically those searching on it: &#8220;who&#8221;, &#8220;what&#8221;, &#8220;when&#8221;, &#8220;where&#8221;, and &#8220;why.&#8221; Those even somewhat familiar with journalism probably recognize the importance of those five questions, and as such I found it fitting to name the plugin after a journalist. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Edward R Murrow</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Walter Cronkite</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Rather\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dan Rather</a> were all contenders, but ultimately <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(U.S._TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ACN Anchor Will McAvoy</a> won out.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>For a complete changelog, please see <a href=\"https://github.com/stevegrunwell/mcavoy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">McAvoy&#8217;s GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<h4>0.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the <code>mcavoy_searches</code> table schema to accommodate more searches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with WordPress Multisite wherein McAvoy would not properly set up the <code>DatabaseLogger</code> dependencies when network activated.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed cross-site scripting (XSS) bug where search terms weren&#8217;t automatically escaped.</li>\n<li>Fixed fatal error (<code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function McAvoy\\Admin\\get_logger()</code>) when deleting saved queries that resulted as a side-effect of namespace juggling.</li>\n<li>Added method access modifiers to the <code>ListTable</code> class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial public release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
