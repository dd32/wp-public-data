No need to hand-code your recipes into a sophisticated recipe structure when the ZipList Recipe Plugin will do all the heavy lifting for you, enhancing the findability of your recipe website.</p>\n<p>If youâ€™re familiar with the open-source <a href=\"http://recipeseo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RecipeSEO</a> plugin built by Allison Day, youâ€™ll quickly note that the ZipList Recipe Plugin is an extension of this plugin.</p>\n<p>Among the new features added by ZipList are:</p>\n<p><strong>Works with WordPress 4.0.1:</strong> Updated for full compatibility with WordPress 4.0.1.</p>\n<p><strong>Schema/Recipe Support:</strong> Automatically integrate Schema.org&#8217;s Recipe mark-up into your recipe posts to make them more findable by search engines.</p>\n<p><strong>Recipe Image Support:</strong> Add images within the plugin to appear with your recipe or in your Google Rich Snippet.</p>\n<p><strong>Copy/Paste Ingredients:</strong> Simply cut a block of ingredients and paste them into one field. No need to add each ingredient one by one into separate fields.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto-Populate Recipe Name:</strong> The recipe name is automatically replicated inside the plugin, taking the name from the post name, which further enhances SEO.</p>\n<p><strong>Add Links to Ingredients or Instructions:</strong> Attach affiliate links or links to related recipes from the Ingredients, Instructions or Summary fields with ease. No other plugin enables you to do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Bold and Asterisk Styling:</strong> Add bold or italicized styling to words or phrases within the Ingredients, Instructions, Summary and Notes sections.</p>\n<p><strong>Modified Image Display:</strong> Add a recipe image to the plugin so that it displays in a userâ€™s recipe box, but then choose to hide it from view on your recipe post and/or print view.</p>\n<p><strong>Incorporate Images into Instructions:</strong> Now you can easily add step-by-step images to your instructions (or ingredients) from within the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes Field:</strong> Add notes to your recipes, such as optional ingredients, required kitchen tools and equipment and/or additional instructions (e.g., freezing, microwave, etc.)</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Printing Capabilities:</strong> Add a copyright statement or URL to appear at the bottom of your printed recipes. Also, display a permalink at the bottom of printed recipes so users can easily find individual recipes on your website.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Paragraph Support in Summary Section:</strong> Users can now add multiple paragraphs to the Summary field within the plugin.</p>\n<p>The ZipList Recipe Plugin is very easy use, however we also provide enhanced <a href=\"http://marketing.ziplist.com.s3.amazonaws.com/plugin_instructions.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">step-by-step instructions</a>. Please note that the ZipList Recipe Plugin is no longer actively maintained and may not be updated in the future.<br />\nThe save recipe button, recipe box and shopping list features are no longer available or supported in the plugin.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>You can download and install the ZipList Recipe Plugin using the built-in WordPress plugin installer. If you download the ZipList Recipe Plugin manually, make sure it is uploaded to &#8220;/wp-content/plugins/ziplist-recipe-plugin/&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Activate the ZipList Recipe Plugin in the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; admin panel using the &#8220;Activate&#8221; link.</p>\n<p>To use the plugin, click the little ZipList Recipe icon on the &#8220;Edit Post&#8221; pages, right next to the other editor toolbar buttons at the top of the text editor box. Then enter the details about your recipe into the appropriate boxes, and then click the &#8220;Add Recipe&#8221; button. This will save your recipe, and insert it into your blog post.</p>\n<p>The ZipList Recipe Plugin is very easy use, however we also provide enhanced <a href=\"http://marketing.ziplist.com.s3.amazonaws.com/plugin_instructions.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">step-by-step instructions</a>.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What happened to the Save Recipe button that was on my recipes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The save recipe button, recipe box and shopping list are no longer available in the plugin, however, the plugin will continue to display your recipes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I edit a recipe with the ZipList Recipe Plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting with version 2.4, you&#8217;ll want to click the spoon and fork icon on the visual editor toolbar to both create and edit a recipe. You no longer need to click on the image placeholder within the blog post to edit a recipe.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the plugin to add multiple recipes to one post or page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There should only be one recipe per post or page. The plugin does allow for compound recipes which is one way to include multiple lists of ingredients in your post (e.g., for a salad and a salad dressing).Simply enter your instructions for the main recipe, then start the next line with an exclamation point to create a label, like &#8220;!For the Salad Dressing&#8221;. Then, add the instructions for the secondary recipe. Starting with version 2.4, we no longer support multiple ZipList-formatted recipes within a single post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I use ZipList&#8217;s plugin, where are the recipes stored?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With the ZipList Recipe Plugin, your recipes are stored safely in a separate DB table in your main WP database. The recipe table is named wp_amd_zlrecipe_recipes and you can take a look at it yourself using any WordPress database tools at your disposal.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens to my recipes now that ZipList has gone away</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is &#8220;nothing&#8221;! ðŸ™‚ The ZipList Recipe Plugin simply takes the recipe information from your own database and displays it with SEO annotation. It does this without any connection or communication with the ZipList service and is completely independent. You will continue to enjoy SEO-friendly display of your recipes without any connection to ZipList. Please note that the ZipList Recipe Plugin is no longer actively maintained and may not be updated in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do you put a placeholder image into my Edit Post page, instead of my actual recipe?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because of the way the WordPress text editor works, if you decide to add or remove something from your recipe using the text editor, it can very easily mess up the markup of the code &#8211; so the ZipList plugin prevents that from happening by not allowing you to edit the recipe in the text editor.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
