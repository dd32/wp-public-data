Feel free to leave a message on the &#8220;Support&#8221; tab of the plugin page, and I&#8217;ll follow up as soon as possible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My forms are no longer submitting, with this plugin installed. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure that you have updated to the latest version of Contact Form 7. Success Page Redirects only supports versions 3.9.0 or higher. If everything is up to date and you&#8217;re still experiencing problems, please post a message on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/contact-form-7-success-page-redirects\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my forms no longer using Ajax, when I install this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to ensure that all forms are submitted properly, and that users can be redirected to success pages from some of your forms, I have had to disable Contact Form 7&#8217;s JavaScript for all forms. This means that you won&#8217;t be able to use Ajax to submit forms. In future updates, I hope to change this functionality, so that Ajax is only disabled for the forms that have a redirect page defined. Please note that disabling CF7&#8217;s JavaScript does not affect your forms&#8217; ability to send messages properly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
