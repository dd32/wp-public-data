Also drops unneeded references.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update for WordPress 3.3&#8217;s rewrite rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-add the <code>save_post</code> filter after fixing the slug incase multiple posts are updated in one pageload.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 2.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Recoded for WordPress 3.0+. WordPress now won&#8217;t let you manually enter a numeric slug &#8212; it will prefix &#8220;-2&#8221; onto the end of it so that the page is viewable. This new plugin version works around it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
