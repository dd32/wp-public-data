We use Stripe Checkout to make our customer checkout process as simple as possible to give you a better chance at converting a lead into a sale! After clicking on your custom WPMerchant Buy Button, your customer can purchase a single product, multiple products, or a product bundle.  As such, your customers can check out much faster than on competing e-commerce plugins &#8211; which means the money gets into your pocket fast.</p>\n<h4>Live Demos</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WPMerchant Buy Button &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.wpmerchant.com/pricing?ref=wpmerchant_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPMerchant.com/pricing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.templatelauncher.com/services?ref=wpmerchant_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TemplateLauncher.com/services</a>.

You can connect to Stripe (a payment processor) by simply finding your API keys and adding them to WPMerchant&#8217;s settings page. And, you can connect to MailChimp (a mailing list/newsletter provider) using your username and password instead of searching for API Keys (leave that junk to us!).</p>\n<p>Again, Collect Money with a WPMerchant Buy Button in just <a href=\"https://www.wpmerchant.com/install\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">3 easy steps</a>:<br />\n1) Connect to Stripe (Payment Processor)<br />\n2) Create a Product<br />\n3) Add the WPMerchant Buy Button to your post or page</p>\n<p>If you already have a Stripe account, this can take you 1 minute or less to set up (<a href=\"https://www.wpmerchant.com/1-minute-setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">don&#8217;t believe us &#8211; check it out</a>). If you don&#8217;t have a Stripe account, it will likely take you around 5 minutes to set up.</p>\n<p>If you want to subscribe a user to your MailChimp Mailing List on successful purchase, connect to MailChimp as well.</p>\n<h4>Simplicty in Everything</h4>\n<p>We try to simplify the whole process; from connecting to Stripe (payment processor) and MailChimp (mailing list providers), to creating products, to managing products, to managing orders, to analyzing sales, to increasing sales, etc.  We want to make your life easier than all of the other eCommerce plugins and platforms out there.  We are always striving to simplify; <a href=\"http://www.wpmerchant.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shoot us over any ideas you may have</a>.</p>\n<h4>Fully Integrated Payment Processor</h4>\n<p>We want your site to be taken seriously and to look as professional as possible.  Therefore, while our competitors offer product checkout through offsite payment providers like PayPal for free, we are providing you with a FREE fully integrated and simple payment processor in Stripe Checkout.  This means that your customers never leave your site; which makes it incredibly easy for them to purchase your product(s) immediately.</p>\n<h4>Mailing List Integration</h4>\n<p>When a product is purchased, your customer is charged for that product and is automatically subscribed to the MailChimp list that you provide.</p>\n<h4>Growth Tips</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re passionate about helping you find leads and convert those leads into sales. We&#8217;ll share our tips and tricks to getting more traffic to your site and to analyzing that traffic to get more sales.  In addition to extensive experience building websites (on WordPress and in custom environments) for clients and for ourselves, we founded a company called <a href=\"https://www.templatelauncher.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TemplateLauncher</a> that focuses on building high end landing pages for LeadPages.net customers.  We want to help anyone improve their sales funnel to get more leads and to get more sales.

We use Stripe Checkout to make our customer checkout process as simple as possible to give you a better chance at converting a lead into a sale! After clicking on your custom WPMerchant Buy Button, your customer can purchase a single product, multiple products, or a product bundle.  As such, your customers can check out much faster than on competing e-commerce plugins &#8211; which means the money gets into your pocket fast.</p>\n<h4>Live Demos</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WPMerchant Buy Button &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.wpmerchant.com/pricing?ref=wpmerchant_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPMerchant.com/pricing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.templatelauncher.com/services?ref=wpmerchant_plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TemplateLauncher.com/services</a>.

You can connect to Stripe (a payment processor) by simply finding your API keys and adding them to WPMerchant&#8217;s settings page. And, you can connect to MailChimp (a mailing list/newsletter provider) using your username and password instead of searching for API Keys (leave that junk to us!).</p>\n<p>Again, Collect Money with a WPMerchant Buy Button in just <a href=\"https://www.wpmerchant.com/install\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">3 easy steps</a>:<br />\n1) Connect to Stripe (Payment Processor)<br />\n2) Create a Product<br />\n3) Add the WPMerchant Buy Button to your post or page</p>\n<p>If you already have a Stripe account, this can take you 1 minute or less to set up (<a href=\"https://www.wpmerchant.com/1-minute-setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">don&#8217;t believe us &#8211; check it out</a>). If you don&#8217;t have a Stripe account, it will likely take you around 5 minutes to set up.</p>\n<p>If you want to subscribe a user to your MailChimp Mailing List on successful purchase, connect to MailChimp as well.</p>\n<h4>Simplicty in Everything</h4>\n<p>We try to simplify the whole process; from connecting to Stripe (payment processor) and MailChimp (mailing list providers), to creating products, to managing products, to managing orders, to analyzing sales, to increasing sales, etc.  We want to make your life easier than all of the other eCommerce plugins and platforms out there.  We are always striving to simplify; <a href=\"http://www.wpmerchant.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shoot us over any ideas you may have</a>.</p>\n<h4>Fully Integrated Payment Processor</h4>\n<p>We want your site to be taken seriously and to look as professional as possible.  Therefore, while our competitors offer product checkout through offsite payment providers like PayPal for free, we are providing you with a FREE fully integrated and simple payment processor in Stripe Checkout.  This means that your customers never leave your site; which makes it incredibly easy for them to purchase your product(s) immediately.</p>\n<h4>Mailing List Integration</h4>\n<p>When a product is purchased, your customer is charged for that product and is automatically subscribed to the MailChimp list that you provide.</p>\n<h4>Growth Tips</h4>\n<p>We&#8217;re passionate about helping you find leads and convert those leads into sales.
