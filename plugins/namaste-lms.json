        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20any%20documentation%3F'>\nDo you have any documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, check the Help page under the Namaste! LMS menu (once the plugin is installed). You will find links to the online documentation, list of all shortcodes, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20rename%20the%20url%20slugs%20from%20%22namaste-course%22%20and%20%22namaste-lesson%22%20to%20something%20else%3F'>\nCan I rename the URL slugs from &#8220;namaste-course&#8221; and &#8220;namaste-lesson&#8221; to something else?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can set your custom URL slugs in the Namaste Settings page</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20namaste%21%20lms%20support%20scorm%20or%20tin%20can%20api%3F'>\nDoes Namaste!

So these links come from your theme and we can&#8217;t control them from the plugin. You can create custom post templates in your theme for the Namaste! LMS course and lesson pages. Copy single.php into single-namaste_lesson.php and remove the next / previous links in it. Then copy the file also as single-namaste_course.php if you want to use the same design for the course pages. More information about creating custom post type templates is available <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Type_Templates\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to display links precisely to next / previous lesson in a course you should use the shortcodes [namaste-next-lesson] and [namaste-prev-lesson] or their Pro alternatives. Have a look at the Help page under your Namaste! LMS menu for more information on these shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20add%20a%20hierarchical%20breadcrumb%20navigation%3F'>\nHow to add a hierarchical breadcrumb navigation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the shorthocde [namaste-breadcrumb]. The shortcode allows passing a custom separator like this: [namaste-breadcrumb separator=&#8221;/&#8221;].<br />\nIf you want to add the breadcrumb navigation to the theme see how to do it <a href=\"https://blog.calendarscripts.info/hierarchical-breadcrumb-navigation-in-namaste-lms/\" title=\"How to add breadcrumb navigation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
