Generally, posts and pages support it but it can be turned off in code.</li>\n<li>The Excerpt field is not being displayed. To see it, click on Screen Options button on the top right corner of the classic editor post edit screen and then enable it.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this work with Gutenberg / the block editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure does, but a little differently.
