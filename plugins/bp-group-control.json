To add a new user, click &#8220;add.&#8221; To add an existing user, click &#8220;add existing.&#8221; You can get to these screens when you are creating a new group as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the email message that gets sent when I add some one?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This functionality isn&#8217;t really available, however, you can change the language of the message directly in the plugin at line 477 of bpgc-core.php. Remember that if you do this and then upgrade to the next version of bp-group-control (which will let you create your own template), it will erase your changes.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
