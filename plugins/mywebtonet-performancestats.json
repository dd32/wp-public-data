Fetching from the Google<br />\napis network gives you the nearest server, and will give more accurate results.

The network tests are not yet shown in the<br />\ngraphs, we are working on this ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Results:<br />\nAfter the sequence of tests has finished, the results will be displayed for you to evaluate. MySQL results can<br />\nvary depending on the type of connection your webserver has to the MySQL server. If a &#8220;local socket&#8221; connection<br />\nis used a typical result for the MySQL query test is 0.05-0.25 seconds. Web hosting providers with dedicated MySQL<br />\nservers will show a slower time/queries per second, as a TCP/IP connection to the MySQL server is made instead of<br />\na local socket connection.</p>\n<p>There are many factors that will determine how fast your website will run. This plugin does not test<br />\nfor how many hits/requests per second your provider allows to your website, file system performance is not tested<br />\neither.
