        "description": "<p>Category Featured Images Extended (CFIX) can ensure that posts, category archive pages, widgets and other elements of your site will always display a thumbnail or featured image&#042; when called upon to do so by themes, templates, and plugins.</p>\n<p>If a featured image has been individually set for a post, it will be used. If a featured/thumbnail image has not been set for a post, CFIX will first try to supply an image from one of the post&#8217;s categories or tags. It will use a Yoast SEO &#8220;Primary&#8221; Category&#8217;s image if available. If no category or tag image is found, the plugin will look for a parent category with an image. Finally, if no linked or related post, category, tag, or parent category image is found, a particular fallback tag or category image can be used if set as &#8220;global fallback.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This plugin was initially based on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/category-featured-images/\" rel=\"ugc\">&#8220;Category Featured Images&#8221;</a> (CFI) by Mattia Roccoberton. If you already have been using CFI, when you install this extended version, your already saved category image settings will be preserved and copied.</p>\n<p>In CFI</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a post does not have its own featured image, a category featured image will be used if available.</li>\n<li>If a post has more than one category with a featured image, the first available category image will be used.</li>\n<li>If none of the post&#8217;s categories has a featured image, a parent category&#8217;s featured image will be used if available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In CFIX</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(New since 1.2) You can also set tag images. </li>\n<li>You can designate categories or tags whose images will be avoided: This feature may be helpful when numerous posts use the same general category, and you wish to force the use of a more specific image.</li>\n<li>You can also designate a category or tag whose image will be used as a last fallback when no regular featured image, category image, or parent category image is available. This feature may be helpful especially if your installation features many top-level categories, and you either do not wish to find images for each and every one, or you just haven&#8217;t done so yet. (One way to combine this feature and the previous one would be to designate the same category for <em>both</em> avoidance and last resort: The plug-in would always look for a more specific, not-to-be-avoided category, but fall back to the more general category otherwise.)</li>\n<li>When a post has multiple category or tag images available, either the most recently added category or tag will be used. (This behavior is modifiable via hook or filter).

Why Aren&#8217;t My Fallback Images Showing Up on a Few/Some/All Posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Assuming that you&#8217;ve cleared any caches that might be affecting display, and that you&#8217;ve properly added the relevant category images, one possibility is that your post data (&#8220;Post Metadata&#8221;) was corrupted or incompletely inserted during a restore, import, or other operation, and that WordPress wrongly thinks that your posts have thumbnail or featured images when they don&#8217;t really. Many relatively well-tested, widely and even very widely in use WordPress plug-ins and functions will produce this &#8220;thumbnail false positive&#8221; behavior.</p>\n<p>CFIX has been written to provide a thumbnail image even in such cases, but please <a href=\"http://ckmacleod.com/wordpress-plugins/category-featured-images-extended/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact the developer</a> if you encounter such an outcome, as the plug-in is still new, and use cases are still being assembled. For instructions on Flushing Bad Thumbnail Data see <a href=\"http://ckmacleod.com/wordpress-plugins/category-featured-images-extended/advanced/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CFIX Advanced Topics</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2. Is CFIX causing a performance hit at my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CFIX WILL add some overhead, especially if your layout features large numbers of posts calling for thumbnails or featured images that have not been set, requiring the plug-in to work overtime to find fallbacks. Slowed page loads should be mitigated with proper use of good caching applications &#8211; which you ought to be using in any event, especially if utilizing image-rich multi-post displays, and depending on the plug-in to provide a large number of substitute images.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
