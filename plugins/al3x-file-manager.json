Files are displayed in a jQuery powered filetree.<br />\nNow with public download area, public downloads are not session bound.<br />\nYou can even tell wp which subdirectory of the public folder should be used as root-directory.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I embed download area into my post or page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To embed download area into a post or page, simply insert one of the following placeholders into your post or page:</p>\n<p>Placeholder: [[afm_page]]<br />\n  This will display the login screen for users in your post or page, and if logged it will display download filetree.</p>\n<p>Placeholder: [[afm_public:/]]<br />\n   This will display the public download area in your post or page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Protection against hot-linking seems not to work, what is wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This feature depends on two different things.<br />\nFirst if the bad guy doesn&#8217;t know the actual location of your files, he can access them only through the<br />\ndownload function of the plugin.<br />\nIn this case downloads are session bound if not public. So if files are accessible through the script, then<br />\nmaybe you are still logged in as an wp-administrator or files are inside the public directory. In both cases<br />\naccess limitation through a session are bypassed.<br />\nBut if the bad guy does know the location of your files, which is very likely because this plugin is open<br />\nsource, then files are protected by the use of a .htaccess file.<br />\nSo if files are accessible through the actual location, then there seems to be a problem with a configuration<br />\ndirective of the webserver your wordpress runs on. Most likely the ability to override directives through a<br />\n.htaccess file is disabled. In that case, please consult your webservers administrator.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many instances of subdirectories are possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin script itself does not set a limit to the numbers of subdirectories or the depth of subdirectories.<br />\nHow ever keep in mind, each depth of subdirectory is indented in the filetree, so at a certain depth it would<br />\nlook plain ugly.<br />\nAn other thing to consider is, the functions recursivly browse through all subdirectories, and the deeper you<br />\ngo, the slower it will get. Just KISS (Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I.e. have two seperate public download trees?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!<br />\nSimply replace the slash ( / ) in [[afm_public:/]] with the path of directory you would like to display. That<br />\nis the subpath inside your public directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do you change the names of my files and directories?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To escape encoding problems the plugin allows only alphanumeric characters and the underscore (as a<br />\nreplacement for no alnum chars) in filenames, based on the server &#8216;locale&#8217; settings. That is why diacritic<br />\nletters which you may deem alphanumeric fail to match critiria and are replaced as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there other icons that I may use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The safest way to change icons used in the filetree, is to simply exchange the image files in<br />\n[path/to/wp-content/plugins]/al3x-file-manager/images/ with your own, and don&#8217;t change the script.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is there no internationalization (i18n) support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Now that public download area is implemented, this is on the top of my ToDo list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Cool, what else is on your ToDo list?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Features I thought of myself and which I would like to see in this plugin are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>download statistics</li>\n<li>user groups, that is one download area for a group of users</li>\n<li>user registration for one of these groups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you can think of more, pls let me know at http://www.al3x.de/file_manager/.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Hey Pal! How do I get rid of this annoying donation note on every page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try clicking on it! Trust me, it won&#8217;t bring you to any other donation page, it will just drop it!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Dude, I love your plugin and hate to get it for free, how do I give you my money?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You shouldn&#8217;t, but I&#8217;d be thankful if you do.<br />\nJust go to http://www.al3x.de/file_manager/ and hit the donate button.<br />\nThanks a lot.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
