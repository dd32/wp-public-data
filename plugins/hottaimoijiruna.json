        "faq": "\n<h4>Can you alter the format of the returned date string?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, but you will be able to soon.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every minute hottaimoijiruna makes a call to the server and gets the current time.  It uses SACK, an AJAX Kit by <a href=\"http://www.twilightuniverse.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gregory Wild-Smith</a>, that comes built in with WordPress 2.0</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t work!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it does!  See <a href=\"http://jamietalbot.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.  Have you activated the plugin?  Are you using WordPress 2.0 or else have SACK installed?  Have you called   Have you got Javascript enabled?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it work with WordPress 1.x?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For 1.2.x &#8211; no &#8211; it needs the templating system in 1.5+ to put javascript into a post or page.  For 1.5+, probably, but it needs the SACK kit that is in 2.0.  If you &lt;a href=http://twilightuniverse.com/resources/code/sack/&#8221;&gt;download SACK and put it in the wp-includes/js/ directory, it should work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it break if the user doesn&#8217;t have Javascript?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope.  It should degrade nicely, and just leave the default text (or nothing).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will it break if the XML call fails?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope.  It should degrade nicely, and say &#8220;clock disabled&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this run on every WordPress page and post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope, only on pages where you call hottaimoijiruna(), and it will quit before the first call if there is a problem.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you have an example?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have a look at my <a href=\"http://jamietalbot.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">About Page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s with the stupid name?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hottaimoijiruna is Japanese and it roughly means, &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch the potato that was dug up&#8221;.  It is what some Japanese people think you are saying when you say &#8220;What time is is now?&#8221;  Try saying it fast and you&#8217;ll understand.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>So it&#8217;s kind of a joke?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Kind of.  Did you laugh?</p>\n</p>\n\n",
