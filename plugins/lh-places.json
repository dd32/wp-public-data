Use your imagination</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20geolocation%20shortcode%3F'>\nHow do I use the geolocation shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Place the short code [lh_places_geolocate] anywhere in the your post_content.m The shortcode has one optional parameter call url. This is the url that the browser will request, when making its geolocated search. By default this will be the blog url but if you wish to search a custom post type then use the url of the custom post type archive.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20include%20maps%20of%20places%20on%20the%20front%20end%3F'>\nHow do I include maps of places on the front end?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Place the shortcode [lh_places_geomap] into your post_content. The shortcode takes two options &#8216;p&#8217; which is the post id of the place you wish to display or &#8216;post_parent&#8217; which is the post id of the parent place of a set of places you may wish to display. Please don&#8217;t use both.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20post%20types%20can%20be%20linked%20to%20places%3F'>\nWhat post types can be linked to places?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>by default posts and pages can have a place attached (se the post edit screen). To add (or remove) an additional post type you can use the lh_places_from_posttypes filter which takes and returns the eligible post types. See plugin source.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
