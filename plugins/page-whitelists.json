You&#8217;re also welcome to <a href=\"https://github.com/corvidism/page-whitelists\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fork it on GitHub</a> and base your own plugin on it.</p>\n<p>Page Whitelists is an administration tool that can be used to allow selected users to edit only certain pages, leaving the rest inaccessible. Using this plugin, you can let user edit only a single page (or a handful of them), while the rest of the content is out of sight. Typical use cases would be a dynamic, shortcode-heavy sites with content that still needs to be edited by inexperienced users (i.e. an &#8216;About us&#8217; section), or a company website whith multiple administrators each maintaining their own section.</p>\n<p>To use this plugin, you create &#8220;whitelists&#8221; and assign them to users and/or roles. Each whitelist can also alow/deny users to create additional pages. Every page, user and role can belong to multiple whitelists. The user sees only the pages they are allowed to edit &#8211; reducing confusion and clutter on the Page listing.</p>\n<p>This plugin was written as a light-weight replacement for the whitelisting functionality of Role Scoper.</p>\n<h3>4.0.2</h3>\n<p>NOTICE: This plugin is no longer in active development.</p>\n<h3>4.0.1</h3>\n<p>Version upgrade error &#8211; this is the working version.</p>\n<h3>4.0.0</h3>\n<p>Major version upgrade.</p>\n<h3>3.0.3</h3>\n<p>Fixes a compatibility bug between NextGen Gallery and strict whitelists.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What happens when user is assigned more than one whitelist?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whitelists are additive &#8211; every user has access to all pages in all whitelists they&#8217;re assigned to. &#8216;Strict&#8217; whitelists have priority &#8211; once a user is assigned to a whitelist that disables creation of new pages, they are not allowed to do so (even if other whitelists are &#8216;non-strict&#8217;).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I set up Page Whitelists, but my users still can&#8217;t access Pages. What&#8217;s happening?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is most likely caused by a missing capability &#8216;edit-pages&#8217;. Page Whitelists is substractive, so the user must have access to all pages first. This can happen if you previously used another access manager, especially Role Scoper, and it didn&#8217;t reset the capabilities properly when uninstalling.<br />\nYou can fix that easily with any plugin that can edit user roles (for example <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">User Role Editor</a>).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Advanced: I need the most recent code of this plugin. Where can I find it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/corvidism/page-whitelists\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/corvidism/page-whitelists</a> Like many other WP plugin developers, I primarily use git for versioning, so this is the most recent version of the plugin. If you ever wanted to make modifications to the code, I recommend using files from the Github repo.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
