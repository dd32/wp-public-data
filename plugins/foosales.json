It functions as a WooCommerce point of sale layer, making it possible to process orders in real time while maintaining a centralized architecture. When you process an order through FooSales POS, the order data is sent directly to your WooCommerce store in real time. FooSales leverages the many strengths of WooCommerce which includes secure, regularly audited code and an extensive ecosystem. Furthermore, all your store, customer and order data remain on your web server and is never transmitted or stored on any third-party servers, including our own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more</a></p>\n<h4>Omnichannel Platform</h4>\n<p>Since FooSales POS is built from the ground up as a WooCommerce point of sale system, it can be accessed from multiple devices and is available as a web app and native tablet apps (iPad &amp; Android tablet) which all share the same intuitive interface.

Orders can be filtered in the WooCommerce back-end so you can tell which orders were placed on your online store and which came through the FooSales POS. The orders screen is packed with critical product and customer information where you can print receipts for past orders, issue refunds, review daily totals and troubleshoot issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/sales/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more</a></p>\n<h4>Capture Payments</h4>\n<p>Capture payments with our WooCommerce Square and Stripe payments integration. Use Square and Stripe Terminal reader hardware to process payments in person with our seamless WooCommerce Square and Stripe integration or manually process cards over the phone. If you don&#8217;t use Square or Stripe, card payments can be manually processed using any third-party card reader of your choice and set to &#8220;Card Payment&#8221; at checkout. The payment type can also be set to &#8220;Cash&#8221;, &#8220;Direct Bank Transfer&#8221;, &#8220;Check&#8221;, &#8220;Cash on Delivery&#8221; and &#8220;Other Payment Method&#8221; or you can create your own custom payment methods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/payments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more</a></p>\n<h4>Add Customers</h4>\n<p>Create profiles for your customers so that you can learn more about their shopping habits and view contact info and order history at a glance. Customer data is automatically synced with your WooCommerce store so that their order history can be referenced or tracked. Guest checkout is also supported so customers can remain anonymous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/customers/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more</a></p>\n<h4>Multi-language</h4>\n<p>The FooSales POS apps support 9 different languages so you can use FooSales POS in the language you feel most comfortable in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/languages/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more</a></p>\n<h4>Hardware Integration</h4>\n<p>FooSales POS integrates with many popular printers, barcode scanners and other devices. This allows you to turn your WooCommerce powered store into an enterprise-level retail platform for a fraction of the cost of a traditional POS solution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/hardware/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Find out more</a></p>\n<h4>How do I get started?</h4>\n<p>Step 1: Install the WordPress plugin</p>\n<p>Install the FooSales POS plugin directly from your WordPress admin area by clicking &#8216;Add New&#8217; in the Plugins menu, then search for &#8220;FooSales&#8221; OR manually <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/foosales/\" rel=\"ugc\">download the plugin</a> from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Step 2: Link your store to a 7-day free trial account</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/signup/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Create a FooSales account</a> which will allow you to access all the FooSales POS features on any computer, iPad or Android tablet.</p>\n<p>Step 3: Connect the FooSales POS apps to your store</p>\n<p>Download the free FooSales POS <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/foosales-for-woocommerce/id1251207715\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">iPad</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foosales.FooSales\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Android tablet</a> apps or visit <a href=\"https://web.foosales.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">web.foosales.com</a> in your web browser and enter your WooCommerce store details to connect securely. FooSales POS can only access a website URL that is linked to your account so it&#8217;s very important that you enter the correct web address. Installation is quick and easy.</p>\n<h4>Support</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ask us a question</a></p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.3 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3.1.0 </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles all the file transfers. To do an automatic installation of FooSales POS, login to your WordPress admin area, navigate to the Plugins menu and click &#8216;Add New&#8217;.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;FooSales&#8221; and click &#8216;Search Plugins&#8217;. Once you&#8217;ve found the FooSales POS plugin, you can view details about it such as release information, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the FooSales POS plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work seamlessly, but as always though, please ensure that you back-up your website just in case.</p>\n<p>If for some reason you encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update, you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks and clicking &#8216;Save&#8217;. That should revert things back to normal.</p>\n",

WooCommerce currently integrates with over 100 different payment gateways.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20languages%20do%20the%20foosales%20apps%20support%3F'>\nWhat languages do the FooSales apps support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The FooEvents apps currently support: English, Afrikaans, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20process%20card%20payments%20through%20foosales%20pos%3F'>\nCan I process card payments through FooSales POS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FooSales POS currently offers a direct integration with Square Readers and the Square point of sale app (Square POS) to process payments. FooSales also supports Stripe Terminal readers and manual card entries. If you don&#8217;t use Square or Stripe, card payments can be manually processed using any third-party card reader of your choice and set to &#8220;Card Payment&#8221; at checkout. The payment type can also be set to &#8220;Cash&#8221;, &#8220;Direct Bank Transfer&#8221;, &#8220;Check&#8221;, &#8220;Cash on Delivery&#8221; and &#8220;Other Payment Method&#8221; or you can create your own custom payment methods.</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/payments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FooSales Payments help document</a> to learn more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20square%20and%20stripe%20terminal%20card%20reader%20models%20are%20supported%20in%20foosales'>\nWhich Square and Stripe Terminal card reader models are supported in FooSales\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The current list of supported card reader models can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/features/hardware/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Hardware page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20buy%20square%20and%20stripe%20terminal%20card%20readers%3F'>\nWhere can I buy Square and Stripe Terminal card readers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can purchase Square Readers directly from Square or from select online and physical retailers in the countries where Square is available such as Amazon.</p>\n<p>Stripe Terminal readers must be ordered directly from Stripe through your Stripe dashboard (Note: model availability differs by region).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20accept%20credit%20card%20payments%20over%20the%20phone%3F'>\nCan I accept credit card payments over the phone?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can process card transactions directly within the FooSales apps by selecting the Square Manual Payment or Stripe Manual Payment option and entering your customer&#8217;s card details manually. With this option you do not require the customer&#8217;s physical card or reader hardware to process the payment. You can also use any other payment method to process the order over the phone and complete the order in FooSales with the selected payment type.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20foosales%20pos%20just%20a%20plugin%3F'>\nIs FooSales POS just a plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FooSales POS is an app based WooCommerce POS and is available on iPad, Android tablet and a web app. The apps connect directly to your WooCommerce store using a lightweight WordPress plugin. Our native apps provide various benefits that simply cannot be achieved using plugin based POS solutions. These include offline mode, more reliable hardware integration, built-in camera support for barcode scanning, and greater choice of supported printers and card readers. That said, we also offer a web app so you get the best of both worlds.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20makes%20foosales%20pos%20different%20from%20other%20pos%20systems%3F'>\nWhat makes FooSales POS different from other POS systems?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most traditional point of sale systems are stand-alone systems and are not designed to natively work with WooCommerce. They rely on bridging plugins to sync product catalogs between WooCommerce and their own catalog management systems. FooSales on the other hand is an WooCommerce first platform. FooSales POS connects directly to WooCommerce and uses it as a central database. This means you won&#8217;t have any syncing issues and your data is always secure and up to date, no matter how many stores or devices you connect.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20run%20the%20foosales%20pos%20web%20app%20on%20my%20own%20domain%3F'>\nCan I run the FooSales POS web app on my own domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can but you will need to purchase the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/foosales-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FooSales for WooCommerce</a> extension which is sold exclusively on the WooCommerce Marketplace.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20foosales%20support%20products%20that%20are%20sold%20in%20decimal%20quantities%20%28length%2C%20weight%20etc.%29%3F'>\nDoes FooSales support products that are sold in decimal quantities (length, weight etc.)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! FooSales has built-in functionality that allows you to sell products using decimal quantities but this needs to first be configured in FooSales. You can even sell regular products alongside products that use decimal quantities. Please refer to this <a href=\"https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/products/decimal-quantities/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help document</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20charge%20for%20technical%20support%3F'>\nDo you charge for technical support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support is free, however, the only support channel that we currently offer is via email. Our support team is distributed across a few different time zones and we only communicate in English at present.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20safe%20and%20private%20is%20my%20data%3F'>\nHow safe and private is my data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FooSales POS is ultra-secure since it does not store any of your store data on our servers. All of your data remains on your own website, tablet or computer. FooSales POS simply connects to your website, pulls your product catalog, and sends new orders back to your site. FooSales POS also complies with the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for added peace of mind.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20the%20foosales%20pos%20setup%20process%20take%3F'>\nHow long does the FooSales POS setup process take?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Setup only takes a minute. Install the FooSales POS plugin, link your websites URL to a FooSales account and start selling.</p>\n<p>We recommend visiting the <a href=\"https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/getting-started/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Started</a> page which will guide you through the entire setup process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20run%20foosales%20pos%20on%20any%20computer%3F'>\nCan I run FooSales POS on any computer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The FooSales POS web app runs in most modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20difficult%20is%20it%20to%20setup%20foosales%20pos%20as%20i%27m%20not%20very%20technical%3F'>\nHow difficult is it to setup FooSales POS as I&#8217;m not very technical?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The FooSales POS setup process is very easy. The most technical part is installing the FooSales POS WordPress plugin and connecting your WooCommerce store to FooSales POS. The FooSales POS WordPress plugin can be installed directly from your WordPress admin area by selecting &#8216;Add New&#8217; in the Plugins menu and then search for FooSales POS. You can also download and install the plugin manually if you prefer.</p>\n<p>We recommend visiting the <a href=\"https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/getting-started/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Started</a> page which will guide you through the entire setup process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20foosales%20pos%20without%20woocommerce%3F'>\nCan I use FooSales POS without WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not at the moment. FooSales POS is a WooCommerce point of sale platform. It is specifically designed and built for the WooCommerce platform.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20a%20foosales%20account%20allow%20me%20to%20access%20foosales%20pos%20on%20all%20supported%20platforms%20or%20are%20there%20hidden%20fees%3F'>\nDoes a FooSales account allow me to access FooSales POS on all supported platforms or are there hidden fees?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An active FooSales plan gives you access to FooSales POS on all platforms for the same price (web, iPad &amp; Android tablet).</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing</a> page for current plans and pricing information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20foosales%20pos%20to%20manage%20multiple%20woocommerce%20websites%3F'>\nCan I use FooSales POS to manage multiple WooCommerce websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, depending on the plan you&#8217;re on.</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pricing</a> page for current plans and pricing information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20foosales%20pos%20have%20a%20plugin%20privacy%20policy%3F'>\nDoes FooSales POS have a Plugin Privacy Policy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we have a separate <a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FooSales Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foosales.com/foosales-plugin-privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FooSales Plugin Privacy Policy</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20foosales%20pos%20store%20my%20data%20or%20transmit%20it%20to%20any%20third-parties%3F'>\nDoes FooSales POS store my data or transmit it to any third-parties?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FooSales POS connects directly to your WooCommerce database using our secure REST API which fetches your store data (customers, products and orders). None of this information is saved or passed on to any third-party servers, including our own.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce handles all the ecommerce functionality and payment processing in exactly the same way as your online store. The only customer data that we store on our side is related to your actual FooSales POS account and billing details (i.e. name, billing address, website store URL, email address and password).</p>\n<p>FooSales POS complies with the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for added peace of mind.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20install%20foosales%20pos%3F'>\nHow do you install FooSales POS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply visit the <a href=\"https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/getting-started/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Started</a> page which will guide you through the entire setup process.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
