Then the theme switcher will be available to the specified set of users in frontend. All other visitors cannot see the theme switcher and the wordpress instance will still use the current theme until you explicitly switch over to the newly fixed duplicated theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who can switch the theme in the frontend?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either admin user or the user whose  ip is listed in whitelisted IP addresses list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does Whitelisted IP Addresses mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ajax theme switcher will be available to these IP addresses which get whitelisted in backend.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What should I do after the I finishing modifying the duplicated theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you make sure you have fixed all issues with duplicated theme then just choose the duplicated theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why theme duplication feature doesn&#8217;t work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure your theme directory is writable to web server user or the target directory doesn&#8217;t exist in the system.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about bug report and support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please drop us a line at wp-support@xhtmlweaver.com</p>\n</p>\n\n",
