        "installation": "<p>The easiest method is to use <code>Plugins &gt; Add New</code> in your blog&#8217;s Administration menu. Search for &#8220;dlb&#8221; and click on the <code>Install now</code> link under <em>dlb&#8217;s Send-A-Link</em>. Then click the <code>Activate Plugin</code> link.</p>\n<p>The manual method requires several steps: (1) Download the zip file to your computer. (2) Unzip the file. (3) Upload the <code>dlbs-send-a-link</code> folder to your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory. (4) Go to <code>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</code> in your blog&#8217;s Administration menu and click the <code>Activate</code> link under <em>dlb&#8217;s Send-A-Link</em>.</p>\n<p>Customization of <em>dlb&#8217;s Send-A-Link</em> is further described in the FAQ. Generally, it will be necessary to copy <code>dsl-page.html</code>, <code>dsl-templates.html</code>, and <code>dsl.css</code> from the plugin folder to your theme folder. Modify <code>dsl-page.html</code> to match the structure of your theme&#8217;s <code>page.php</code> file. Modify <code>dsl-templates.html</code> to reflect the URL of your blog. Modify <code>dsl.css</code> to match the look &amp; feel of your blog.</p>\n<p>You need to register at http://captchas.net (It&#8217;s free!) to obtain your own <code>Username</code> and <code>Secret Key</code>. Copy file <code>dsl-captcha.php</code> from the plugin folder to the theme folder. Change the values of <code>$id</code> and <code>$key</code> from &#8220;demo&#8221; and &#8220;secret&#8221; to your own <code>Username</code> and <code>Secret Key</code> respectively.</p>\n<p>Finally, insert the shortcode <code>[dsl-link]</code> in your posts/pages wherever you want to show a link or icon to your visitors offering the opportunity to send a message. In your templates, insert the function <code>dslLink()</code>, typically as: <code>if( function_exists('dslLink') ) { echo dslLink(); }</code>. See FAQ to customize it.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I change the wording and styles in the email message and on the *Send-A-Link* pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most of the visible elements are defined in the template and CSS files. You can make your modifications to a <em>copy</em> of them stored in your theme folder so that they are retained when you upgrade to a new version of <em>Send-A-Link</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the template and style file names?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The input form template is <code>dsl-page.html</code>. The confirmation page and email message templates are in file <code>dsl-templates.html</code>. The CSS styles are in file <code>dsl.css</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the icon and text in the link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The parameters for shortcode <code>[dsl-link]</code> and function <code>dslLink()</code> are as follows: <code>show</code> can be &#8220;icon&#8221;, &#8220;text&#8221;, or &#8220;both&#8221; to display only the icon, only the text or both; <code>iconfile</code> is the name of your icon file, with a path relative to the plugin folder; <code>text</code> is shown as a tooltip and on the link if <code>show</code> is either &#8220;text&#8221; or &#8220;both&#8221;. In the shortcode, enter them like this: <code>[dsl-link show=\"both\" text=\"Your Text\" iconfile=\"myIcon.gif\" ]</code>. In the function, enter them like this: <code>dslLink( array( \"show\" =&gt; \"both\" , \"text\" =&gt; \"Your Text\" , \"iconfile\" =&gt; \"myIcon.gif\" ) )</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change to wording on the form&#8217;s submit button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can only be changed in file <code>dsl.php</code>. Search for the definition of <code>DSL_SUBMIT_BUTTON_VALUE</code>. This change will need to be made again after an upgrade to a new version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the maximum number of characters allowed in names and comments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can only be changed in file <code>dsl.php</code>. Search for the definitions of <code>DSL_MAX_COMMENT_CHARS</code>, <code>DSL_MAX_NAME_CHARS</code>, and <code>DSL_MIN_NAME_CHARS</code>. These changes will need to be made again after an upgrade to a new version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the minimum time between sends?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can only be changed in file <code>dsl.php</code>. Search for the definition of <code>DSL_MIN_SEND_INTERVAL</code>. This change will need to be made again after an upgrade to a new version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the wording in the error messages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this version of the plugin, the error messages must be changed by editing file <code>dsl.php</code>, which is heavily commented to make it easier to navigate and alter the code. A future release will make this easier by using the WordPress localization system. These changes will need to be made again after an upgrade to a new version.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
