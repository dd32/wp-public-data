Key features of the information provided by the widget include: a local COVID-19 infection rate and rank; a visual representation of growth, flattening, and deceleration rates; along with an integrated infected cases recent history chart.</p>\n<p>Your web page visitors will be able to determine safety levels in a particular local area.

A square banner of this size can easily fit most websites. In addition, the true graphic resolution for generated widget images is 1000×1000 pixels. We do not recommend going above 500×500 pixels size in order to take advantage of retina display screen benefits. This plugin can be used at user’s own discretion in smaller sizes such as 200×200 pixels or less.
