        "faq": "\n<h4>Why should I use Prodibi WP Plugin instead of other Plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are the only one to deal with your full resolution images and to allow you to integrate and display them easily and without making a compromise with performance.<br />\nFor instance on new screens, your usual HD images start to look blurry simply because there are not enough pixels to display.<br />\nYour colors might be wrong too. You can do simple tests to see the difference; there is no reason you lose over 90% of your pixels online!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does Prodibi work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a blend of Swiss magic and quality applied to your images. Most of it happens at the time of the upload so that you don&#8217;t need to worry about anything.<br />\nYou will have the best quality and the performance on the web and mobile thanks to our image solution.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the zoom work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have a lightning fast zoom to the full size of your images, no matter its size. The zoom itself depends on the resolution of the screen of the viewer and the resolution of your picture.<br />\nFor the best result, make sure to upload the maximum resolution you have!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Prodibi a new file format?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. When you download a picture from Prodibi, it remains like it was uploaded initially.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does Prodibi get to be so fast?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are obsessed by speed and user experience! We have several innovative tricks we use to make it super fast on the web and mobile, and no matter the size of your photos.<br />\nWe also use several top-tier global CDNs we hand-picked to efficiently deliver your images around the world, so when a viewer checks one of your images,<br />\nthe picture will be delivered from a server that is closest to their physical location.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the best input image format?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The best size quality compromise is jpeg converted in sRGB with sRGB profile included, at full resolution and quality around 90%.<br />\nYou can use also TIFF 8bits or 16bits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the max resolution supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can upload any file size between 0 mpx to 1Gpx on the free plan. and up to 3Gpx in the premium plans.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I upload GIF, 360 images, VR panorama to Prodibi?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet. But we are looking to add support for these types of files in the future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to worry about my privacy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, your contact information, private data, and of course, photos, are yours and yours alone.<br />\nYou will receive company and product updates by emails, but you can opt out at any time. Learn more about our TOS.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are my photos secured from stealing with Prodibi?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Prodibi images are more secure than normal images by nature because only the parts and resolution needed is streamed to the viewer.<br />\nThe original image is never sent. Your HD file is stored on our secured server that only you can access, and right click is disabled.</p>\n<p>If you need more security, you can enable URL encryption, image encryption, and stealth mode (it requires https).<br />\nUrl and images encryption will make it difficult for an attacker to automate the download of parts.<br />\nStealth mode makes images invisible when an attacker tries to get them from a debugger.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I host any images on Prodibi?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Prodibi offers a complete image display solution for JPEG, RAW, PSD, and TIFF format, and we are looking to support more formats very soon.<br />\nNote that you can not use Prodibi to manage illegal or highly controversial content.<br />\nIf you&#8217;re uncertain whether your files fall into this category, you may want to read our TOS and our CDN partner&#8217;s Acceptable Use Policy.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I host videos on Prodibi?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet. But in the future yes!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to have coding skills to use Prodibi?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all, you can check our Youtube tutorial videos to learn how to use Prodibi, but it is as easy as it can be!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you have a demo?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course!
