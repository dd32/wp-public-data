Enabling/disabling the password protection to wp-login.php, WordPress admin pages, and/or the whole site.<br />\n2. Modifying the existing users: you can change any .htaccess user&#8217;s password and remove the users.<br />\n3. Adding a new .htaccess user.</p>\n<p>Note that you have to have at least one user to be able to enable any of the options: otherwise you would be locked out!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20plugin%20is%20giving%20a%20warning%20that%20some%20of%20the%20files%20need%20to%20be%20writable%20for%20it%20to%20work%2C%20what%20does%20this%20mean%3F'>\nThe plugin is giving a warning that some of the files need to be writable for it to work, what does this mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since the plugin is protecting your site via modifying .htaccess and .htpasswd files, it works only if these files are writable by WordPress. If the files don&#8217;t exist, you can just create empty writable files to the location brought out in the plugin&#8217;s warning. You can also see from there which files are already writable and which not.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20forgot%20my%20password%2C%20and%20got%20locked%20out%20from%20the%20site%21%20what%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nI forgot my password, and got locked out from the site! What can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For accessing your site again, you have to modify two files:<br />\n1. .htaccess file in your WordPress root directory (the directory where the file wp-config.php is located);<br />\n2. .htaccess file in your WordPress wp-admin folder</p>\n<p>From both files, delete everything BETWEEN these two lines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li># BEGIN ZOTYA htaccess protect</li>\n<li># END ZOTYA htaccess protect</li>\n</ul>\n<p>IMPORTANT: Before modifying either of the files, make a copy of them!</p>\n<p>For accessing the files, either use FTP or log in to your web hosting service provider, usually they also enable direct file modification.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
