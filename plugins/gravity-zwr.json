Enter your <a href=\"https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/server-to-server-oauth-app/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Server OAuth App</a> Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. These apps are free to create, take only 5 minutes, and don&#8217;t need to be published. Fill in all three fields and hit Save.</li>\n<li>Follow the directions on the Zoom API docs carefully. Youâ€™ll need to edit roles in Zoom settings and create the app. Your user role and app must have the <code>meeting:write:admin</code> and <code>webinar:write:admin</code> scopes.</li>\n<li>Ensure the Server-to-Server OAuth App in Zoom is <em>active</em> before using this addon.</li>\n<li>For the form you&#8217;d like to use for registrations, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Zoom Webinar</strong>. Add a new feed, give it a name, choose the meeting type, enter your Meeting ID, and match registration fields accordingly. First name, last name, and email are required fields.</li>\n<li>Enable registrations on your meeting if using that instead of webinars.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>We strongly encourage enabling logging in Gravity Forms settings when testing this add-on.</em></p>\n<h3>Constants</h3>\n<p>By default, this plugin will ask for your Account ID, Client ID &amp; Secret in the Gravity Forms settings. Users wanting more control can specify these as constants: <code>GRAVITYZWR_ACCOUNT_ID</code>, <code>GRAVITYZWR_CLIENT_ID</code>, and <code>GRAVITYZWR_CLIENT_SECRET</code>.</p>\n<h3>Payments</h3>\n<p>This add-on supports delayed payment through the Gravity Forms PayPal add-on. Charge for registrations via PayPal, processing the Zoom Registration feed only upon successful payment. <a href=\"https://docs.gravityforms.com/setting-up-paypal-payments-standard/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more here.</a></p>\n<h3>Migrating from Old Plugin</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses the same text domain as the other one by Michael Bourne, so all of the settings and webinar feeds that you previously set up will remain. All you need to do is install and activate this plugin while the other one is activated. No need to set everything up again. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<h4>Where can I request features and get further support?</h4>\n<p>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.gg/3HnzNEJVnR\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Discord support server</a></p>\n",
