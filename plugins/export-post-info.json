        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20make%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you make this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We couldn&#8217;t find a plugin that would give us the functionality we were looking for:<br />\n1) Export publish date.<br />\n2) Export word count.<br />\n3) Easy translation of the plugin into other languages. So far English and Spanish translations are included.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20have%20to%20setup%20a%20random%20string%20for%20the%20name%20of%20the%20export%20csv%20file%3F'>\nWhy do I have to setup a random string for the name of the export CSV file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Other plugins always export the file with the same name and in the same folder so it&#8217;s easy to access this file. We don&#8217;t want that this file can be easily found, so we decided to let you setup a random string to make the file name harder to guess.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20export%20post%20info%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20database%3F'>\nDoes Export Post Info make changes to the database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It created an entry in the options table where the random string is stored.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20check%20out%20if%20the%20plugin%20works%20for%20me%3F'>\nHow can I check out if the plugin works for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install and activate. Go to settings / Export Post Info. Save random string. And download CSV file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20remove%20export%20post%20info%20to%20csv%3F'>\nHow can I remove Export Post Info to CSV?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can simply activate, deactivate or delete it in your plugin management section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20php%20version%20do%20i%20need%3F'>\nWhich PHP version do I need?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.5 and greater. WordPress itself <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\" rel=\"ugc\">recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater</a>. If you&#8217;re using a PHP version lower than 5.5 please upgrade your PHP version or contact your Server administrator.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20known%20incompatibilities%3F'>\nAre there any known incompatibilities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. On a multi-language site the export will not work correctly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20wpml'>\nIs this plugin compatible with WPML\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but only the posts of the main language are exported. Post in secondary languages are not exported at this moment. We are working on this because we would like to have this feature but for us it isn&#8217;t easy to code.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20server%20requirements%3F'>\nAre there any server requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin requires a PHP version 5.5 or higher and we recommend using PHP version 7.3 or higher.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20make%20use%20of%20export%20post%20info%20to%20csv%20yourself%3F'>\nDo you make use of Export Post Info to CSV yourself?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course we do. That&#8217;s why we created it. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n\n",
