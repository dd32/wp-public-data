        "description": "<p>This plugin makes your BuddyPress community private. You can control which areas of your site are accessible to logged out users in two ways, &#8220;restrict site access, but allow some public pages&#8221; or &#8220;allow site access, but restrict some private pages&#8221;. This plugin also can block widgets from logged out users and block all RSS feeds.</p>\n<p>In the default mode (restrict access, but allow some public pages), logged out users only have access to your homepage, or access to a list of pages/areas that you&#8217;d like to make public. Logged in members have full site access.</p>\n<p>If you visit the community when you&#8217;re logged out and you&#8217;re visiting a private page, then you&#8217;re redirected to a landing page of your choice (defaults to the homepage).</p>\n<p>You can set uris that are accessibly to non-logged in users using a special config php file &#8211; no database calls are needed.</p>\n<p>In the alternative mode (allow site access, but restrict some private pages), logged out members have full site access, but you are able to make some pages/areas of your site private &#8211; so only logged in members are able to view them. This is the opposite to the default mode.</p>\n<p>In the default mode, the plugin blocks all of your widgets from being visible to logged out users. This stops possible private information from being seen when non-logged in users visit your site.<br />\nYou can change the config file so that some of your widgets are still displayed. In the alternative mode, all widgets are shown but you&#8217;re able to block widgets that should only be displayed to members.</p>\n<p>Also, all RSS feeds are blocked by default too.</p>\n<p>You might also like to change these setting in your WordPress and BuddyPress settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BP Setting: Hide admin bar for logged out users? = YES</li>\n<li>WP Setting: Membership &#8211; Anyone can register? = NO</li>\n<li>WP Privacy Settings: Site Visibility = I would like to block search engines, but allow normal visitors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the FAQs or the example config file in the download for more information on configuring this plugin.</p>\n<p>You can see an example of this plugin working in the default mode here: http://www.englishpubpool.co.uk/bppc_test/about/</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please note, this plugin requires PHP 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to ensure that users don&#8217;t stay logged into your site after a set period of inactivity (for security reasons), then you could use this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inactivity Auto Sign Out plugin: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/inactivity-auto-sign-out-plugin/</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t my config file working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>99% of the time is because you didn&#8217;t save the config file in the correct place.</p>\n<p>You MUST save the file in a new directory, not in this plugin&#8217;s folder structure, but in the main plugins folder.</p>\n<pre><code>// You MUST save the file here:\n/wp-content/plugins/buddypress-private-community-config/mm-buddypress-private-community-config.php\n\n// NOT HERE:\n/wp-content/plugins/buddypress-private-community/mm-buddypress-private-community-config.php\n\n// NOR HERE:\n/wp-content/plugins/buddypress-private-community/buddypress-private-community-config/mm-buddypress-private-community-config.php\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is to ensure that your config setting are not deleted when you update the plugin in the future.</p>\n<p>See &#8220;How can I override the default settings?&#8221; for information about the setting that you can change.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I override the default settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can create your own config file (that won&#8217;t be overwritten when you update this plugin) that stores your preferred settings.<br />\nTo stop this file from being overwritten when you update the plugin, you have to create a new folder, called &#8220;buddypress-private-community-config&#8221;, in the WP wp-content/plugins/ directory (NOTE: this is not in the wp-content/plugins/buddypress-private-community folder to avoid overriding the file on update) and create a file called &#8220;mm-buddypress-private-community-config.php&#8221; in the new folder.<br />\nBecause the file is in a seperate folder to the plugin, the config file won&#8217;t be overwritten when you update the plugin later. Also, this method means no database calls are needed to run this plugin. So, it should be a fast plugin.</p>\n<p>Here is an example config file, that should be saved in the new config directory. It might look confusing at first, but in most cases you only need to use some of these settings as required.

The wildcard character * allows all activation codes to be accepted as valid URIs.\n);\nMM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$REDIRECT_TO_URL       = site_url() . '/my-landing-page';\n//MM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$REDIRECT_TO_URL     = site_url() . '/register'; // This would redirect all logged out users to your registration page.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just add something like the above to your config file and all should work fine.</p>\n<p>Note that, if BuddyPress changes its activate URI in the future, then of course this code would also have to be updated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I allow a widget to be displayed to logged out users?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can be done by adding the widget&#8217;s id string to the ::$ALLOWED_WIDGET_IDS array. E.g.</p>\n<pre><code>// This line will let the widget with id=calendar-2 to be displayed when logged out users visit your site.\nMM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$ALLOWED_WIDGET_IDS        = Array('calendar-2');\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can find the widget&#8217;s id by looking at your site&#8217;s source HTML. The widget id should be shown in the widget&#8217;s main div. E.g.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div id=\"calendar-2\"&gt;\n    // calendar widget!\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can add more widget ids easily:</p>\n<pre><code>MM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$ALLOWED_WIDGET_IDS        = Array('calendar-2', 'calendar-3', 'hallooo-widget-2');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similarly, you can hide widget in the alternative mode in a similar way &#8211; e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>// Used in alternative mode only. (::MODE_BLOCK_NONE_AND_NOT_ALLOW_SOME_URIS)\nMM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$NOT_ALLOWED_WIDGET_IDS    = Array('private-widget-2', 'top-secret-widget-1');\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the redirect hook for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The redirect hook is used to redirect a logged out member to a private page they tried to access when logged out. The redirect happens after they login.</p>\n<p>This is important for when a member gets an email with a link to somewhere on the community that is private. If the member clicks on this link and isn&#8217;t yet logged in, then they will be redirect to the default landing page.</p>\n<p>When this happens, you notice that the redirect hook can be seen in the url, and it points the page that the member tried to access. Now, when the user successfully logs in, the plugin automatically handles a redirect to the page that the user originally tried to access.</p>\n<p>This means the user doesn&#8217;t have to go back to their emails and find the link again as the redirect is handled for them.</p>\n<p>You can change the key word/string used as the hook in the config file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How private will my BuddyPress community really be?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, access to your community through PHP pages will be blocked to logged out users, but your images and uploaded files will still be accessible via their URLs as no PHP code is blocking access to jpgs, xls. etc&#8230;<br />\nYou&#8217;d need to take other security measures if you want to protect your uploaded files.</p>\n<p>But, as it&#8217;s a private community, non-members won&#8217;t know the URLs to these uploaded files &#8211; so they should be fairly safe from the outside world.</p>\n<p>You might like to look into .htaccess configurations for extra security of your uploads.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the redirect hook in the URL used for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When a logged out user tries to access a page that is private, they will be redirected to the default redirect URL with an extra redirect query hook in the URL to the private page.</p>\n<p>This means that the private page&#8217;s URI is stored in the URL for later reference. If the user now logs in to the site, they will be automatically redirected to the private page they just tried to access.</p>\n<p>This is great for when you&#8217;re sent a link to a private page in the community, but you&#8217;re not logged in yet. You simply log in through the BuddyPress login form and you&#8217;ll be taken to the page you wanted to see straight away.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin with PHP 4?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry, this plugin only works with PHP 5. WP and BP and moving to PHP 5 only, so we currently have no plans to make this plugin available for PHP 4.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting a parse error!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you can a parse error like below:</p>\n<pre><code>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in mm-buddypress-private-community.php on line 39\n</code></pre>\n<p>This normally means you&#8217;re not running PHP 5. This plugin requires PHP 5.</p>\n<p>If this wasn&#8217;t the problem, then you should try installing the plugin again. I&#8217;ve had one report where re-installing the plugin after getting this error fixed the bug &#8211; maybe from a bad download or something.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting an infinite redirect loop error!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This normally means your config file isn&#8217;t set up correctly.</p>\n<p>You must make sure that your redirect url is a public page. E.g. here is a simple config file:</p>\n<pre><code>// Here we make a BP page called 'welcome' th default redirect page, and make this a public page to avoid an infinite redirect loop.\nMM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$WP_SUB_FOLDER         = 'my-community';\nMM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$ALLOWED_URIS          = Array('/contacts', '/about', '/welcome');\nMM_BUDDYPRESS_PRIVATE_COMMUNITY::$REDIRECT_TO_URL       = site_url('welcome');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the redirect URL is set to the &#8216;welcome&#8217; page. This page must be in the ::$ALLOWED_URIS, as can be seen above.</p>\n<p>If the &#8216;/welcome&#8217; URI is removed from the ::$ALLOWED_URIS array, then an infinite redirect will occur.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>IMPORTANT! BREAKABLE UPDATE: Changed how sub-directory installations are handled.

You can control which areas of your site are accessible to logged out users in two ways, &#8220;restrict site access, but allow some public pages&#8221; or &#8220;allow site access, but restrict some private pages&#8221;. This plugin also can block widgets from logged out users and block all RSS feeds.</p>\n<p>In the default mode (restrict access, but allow some public pages), logged out users only have access to your homepage, or access to a list of pages/areas that you&#8217;d like to make public. Logged in members have full site access.</p>\n<p>If you visit the community when you&#8217;re logged out and you&#8217;re visiting a private page, then you&#8217;re redirected to a landing page of your choice (defaults to the homepage).</p>\n<p>You can set uris that are accessibly to non-logged in users using a special config php file &#8211; no database calls are needed.</p>\n<p>In the alternative mode (allow site access, but restrict some private pages), logged out members have full site access, but you are able to make some pages/areas of your site private &#8211; so only logged in members are able to view them. This is the opposite to the default mode.</p>\n<p>In the default mode, the plugin blocks all of your widgets from being visible to logged out users. This stops possible private information from being seen when non-logged in users visit your site.<br />\nYou can change the config file so that some of your widgets are still displayed. In the alternative mode, all widgets are shown but you&#8217;re able to block widgets that should only be displayed to members.</p>\n<p>Also, all RSS feeds are blocked by default too.</p>\n<p>You might also like to change these setting in your WordPress and BuddyPress settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BP Setting: Hide admin bar for logged out users? = YES</li>\n<li>WP Setting: Membership &#8211; Anyone can register? = NO</li>\n<li>WP Privacy Settings: Site Visibility = I would like to block search engines, but allow normal visitors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the FAQs or the example config file in the download for more information on configuring this plugin.</p>\n<p>You can see an example of this plugin working in the default mode here: http://www.englishpubpool.co.uk/bppc_test/about/</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please note, this plugin requires PHP 5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to ensure that users don&#8217;t stay logged into your site after a set period of inactivity (for security reasons), then you could use this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inactivity Auto Sign Out plugin: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/inactivity-auto-sign-out-plugin/</li>\n</ul>\n",
