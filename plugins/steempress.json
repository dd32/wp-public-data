        "faq": "<p>For all the questions related to Hive please see:<br />\nhttps://hive.blog/faq.html or https://hive.io</p>\n\n<h4>What&#8217;s the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress is the blogging platform on which you run steempress.<br />\nWordpress.com is a business providing hosting for wordpress blogs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a wordpress.com business account ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you can use any web hosting provider to host your blog and use steempress.<br />\nWordpress.com is providing a free hosting service but to use plugins you have to upgrade to the highest plan which is<br />\nvery expensive compared to other plans.</p>\n<p>We recommend the webhosting plan from ovh : https://www.ovh.com/ but you are free to use any other host.</p>\n<p>We also recommend you to pick the &#8220;one click wordpress install&#8221; option which will directly install wordpress on your<br />\nserver.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What kind of server do I need</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It all depends on your blog and how much it&#8217;ll be visited, but you really shouldn&#8217;t need a lot of data.</p>\n<p>For instance the &#8220;personal&#8221; plan on ovh with 100gb of disk space is more than enough for most of the use cases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a domain name</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Although having one is way better for your SEO. And generally more pretty.</p>\n<p>Nobody says &#8220;hey have you heard of 173.245.234.11 ?&#8221; they say &#8220;hey have you heard of mysuperblog.com ?&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use a free domain or a subdomain ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I protect the SEO of my website/will the SEO of my blog be affected ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The delay feature allow you to publish first on your blog and then publish to hive after a few days/hours/minutes (you decide the delay). Which means that google and other search engines will index your blog first and tag hive.blog as a duplicate. And so your blog&#8217;s seo ranking won&#8217;t be hurt.<br />\nWe recommend a 7 days delay for maximum security.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I did not get a vote on my article, is something wrong ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will not automatically get a vote, consider a vote as a tip for producing good content with us. You don&#8217;t expect<br />\na tip, but you are happy when you get one. The same mentality applies.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who do I talk to about business and parnerships ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Find @fredrikaa on the official steempress discord and talk to him</p>\n<p>the discord can be found here : https://discord.gg/W2KyAbm</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who do I talk to about technical details, bugs etc ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>don&#8217;t talk to @howo directly unless it&#8217;s a very specific and urgent problem, instead feel free to use the<br />\nhelp and suggestion channels.</p>\n<p>Still on the discord : https://discord.gg/W2KyAbm</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I published my post on wordpress but it was not published on hive what&#8217;s up ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check the plugin settings to make sure that you have set everything correctly. you should see</p>\n<p>&#8220;Connectivity to the hive server : Ok<br />\nUsername/posting key : Ok<br />\n&#8220;</p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s ok, look at the delay, did you put any delay ? And is that delay over ?</p>\n<p>If all of that checks, then something went wrong, come in the #help channel and we&#8217;ll figure it out.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this on my phone</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We got that question a lot so I feel like we need to answer it.</p>\n<p>No. You need a wordpress blog which needs to be hosted. So you can buy hosting with your phone and manage it<br />\nstill from your phone but you&#8217;ll have to go by the &#8220;hosting&#8221; section and get a blog there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>At what percentages are the beneficiaries set  ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>15%</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Benefactor rewards</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like most other apps on hive, including esteem, dtube, dsound, dmania and zappl to name a few, Swe use benefactor rewards to help run and develop SteemPress. The benefactor reward is currently set to 15%. To compensate, SteemPress is able to support original authors who post quality content with our hive account @steempress-io.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
