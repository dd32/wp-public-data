Just put shortcodes where you want dynamic content, then your user&#8217;s url variable will be correlated with a specific dataset, and they&#8217;ll see your custom targeted data.</p>\n<p>An example: Let&#8217;s say you are running a pay-per-click campaign for two of your products. You can create the destination url for the click ads, and include a variable that will indicate which product the user is interested in. In this case, the variable is &#8220;sixpack,&#8221; but you can just as easily use numbers as real words.</p>\n<p>Have Lots of Cats?<br />\nOur six pack kitten carriers are super cool<br />\nand covered in awesomesauce.<br />\nhttp://kittencarrierz.com/?product=sixpack</p>\n<p>When DynaPosty recognizes the url variable, it will inject the associated content (that you have already created) into every page where you have added shortcodes.</p>\n<p>So, to you, the admin, a post headline might look like this:</p>\n<p>Welcome to KittenCarriers! We&#8217;re currently running a special on [product], offering [discount] on all items shipped before [date]!</p>\n<p>However, with the magic of DynaPosty and the content you&#8217;ve created, the user will see:</p>\n<p>Welcome to KittenCarriers! We&#8217;re currently running a special on Kitten Six Packs, offering 15% on all items shipped before Friday!</p>\n<p>Pretty darn slick, wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>\n<p>Also, just in case you were wondering, there&#8217;s also a default dataset, so that if the user somehow wanders to that page without a url variable or a cookie, they will see a generic version of the headline, like this:</p>\n<p>Welcome to KittenCarriers! We&#8217;re currently running a special on all cat products, offering free shipping on all items shipped before Friday!</p>\n<p>If you have LOTS of campaigns running and you have a .csv (comma separated values) file containing all your value sets and shortcode values, you can upload.</p>\n<p>We think this is pretty neat. Hopefully, you do, too.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>Licensed under the GNU General Public License<br />\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007<br />\nFull text available at: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt</p>\n<h3>Contact</h3>\n<p>hello@mobiah.com</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Step 1: Download the plugin files from mobiah.com/dynaposty/download/ or from wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dynaposty<br />\nStep 2: Upload the wp-dynaposty folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory<br />\nStep 3: Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Q: What url variable should I use?</p>\n<p>A: This depends on your traffic sources. Google AdWords, for example, has some default variables that you can use here just as easily. Similarly, you can add create your own, simply by adding a ? to an existing url.  The basic format is this: ?content=variable.  In practice, you would probably want to define &#8220;content&#8221; as something relevant to your goal, like &#8220;product&#8221; or &#8220;source&#8221; and then the &#8220;variable&#8221; would be either a name or a number that correlates with a dataset in your dynamic content.</p>\n<p>Q: What are the limits of use?</p>\n<p>A: Right now, there are no limits of use. There may be a day when we charge for especially heavy usage or something like that, but not now.</p>\n<p>Q: What happens if the user doesn&#8217;t have a cookie or url variable but gets to a page with DynaPosty shortcodes?</p>\n<p>A: DynaPosty requires that you establish default values for each shortcode that you create. That way, if any user doesn&#8217;t have a cookie or url variable, they will still see content that makes sense and is complete.</p>\n<p>Q: I see a grid of text.  What do I do?</p>\n<p>A: Any field you see in the grid which is not bold, is editable.  Just click it to edit.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the first row blue?</p>\n<p>A: The blue row is the Default row. The &#8220;Default Values&#8221; row is what will will be replaced when DynaPosty doesn&#8217;t recognize the URL Variable Value, or the URL Variable just isn&#8217;t in the URL at all. For that reason, you can not delete this row.</p>\n",
