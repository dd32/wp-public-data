        "description": "<p>Map Posts allows you to add location as post metadata and insert a map directly in the post, without ever leaving the editor.<br />\nNo plugin configuration is required; simply install, activate and within the post editor define a location and insert a map.</p>\n<h4>WordPress 5.0 and Gutenberg Compatibility</h4>\n<p>Map Posts Free, as of version 1.2.2, works best with the Classic Editor enabled (meaning the Classic Editor plugin has been installed<br />\nand activated). It will also work with the Gutenberg editor, with the exceptions noted below. Map Post shortcodes can be<br />\nadded in any block that allows text to be manually typed in; Map Post map insertion buttons are available if a classic editor block<br />\nis added (in Gutenberg editor click Add (block); scroll down to Formatting tab and expand; select the Classic block).</p>\n<h4>Post Map</h4>\n<p>There are 2 types of map that can be inserted. The first (Post Map) displays only one marker, which is the current location<br />\nassociated with the post. Note that Map Posts automatically adds a location to every post, defaulting to co-ordinates of 0.00,<br />\n0.00 (the intersection of the Equator and the prime meridian). Post Maps are typically inserted to display<br />\na location that is related to the post.</p>\n<p>To actually insert the map, there are two options. If using the visual editor (or Classic Block), simply place the cursor in the<br />\ncontent area where you would like to insert the map, then click the Insert Post Map button. Alternatively you can simply type in the<br />\nPost Map shortcode, which is <strong>postmap</strong>. The second option can be done in visual or text editor mode.</p>\n<h4>All Posts Map</h4>\n<p>The second type of map is called the All Posts Map. This map inserts a marker for every post that is published (not saved as<br />\na draft) and has a custom location (it has co-ordinates other then 0.00,0.00). Insert this map if you want to display<br />\nall post locations in relation to one another.</p>\n<p>To actually insert the map, either use the Insert All Posts Map button from the visual editor toolbar, or type in the<br />\nshortcode <strong>allpostmap</strong>  (in either visual or text editor mode).</p>\n<h4>Adding Location</h4>\n<p>To update the location, find the Define Map configuration panel within the post editor and expand it if necessary. If it is<br />\nnot visible open the WordPress editor screen options and ensure Define Map is listed and is checked.</p>\n<p>Locations can be updated by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clicking on Map</li>\n<li>Dragging the Marker</li>\n<li>Typing in the Latitude and Longitude Manually</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Co-ordinate Units</h4>\n<p>Map Posts uses latitude and longitude co-ordinates in decimal degree (DD) units. This means it will not recognize<br />\nco-ordinates in the format of degrees, minutes and seconds (DMS)or with N,S,E or W abbreviations indicating hemisphere.<br />\nIf you intend to provide co-ordinates manually but they are in a non-supported format, there are a number of online<br />\nconverters available:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://geoinfo.sdsu.edu/hightech/LM3/dd1.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Geoinfo San Diego State University</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/degrees-minutes-seconds-to-degrees.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RapidTables</a></p>\n<p>or Google:</p>\n<p>convert degrees minutes seconds to decimal degrees</p>\n<h4>Map Configuration</h4>\n<p>You can further customize your map appearance by defining a width, height and initial zoom level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Map Width &#8211; as a percentage of width available, from 10 to 100 (default &#8211; 75%)</li>\n<li>Map Height &#8211; in pixels, from 10 to 10 000 (default &#8211; 300px)</li>\n<li>Initial Map Zoom &#8211; from 0 (world) to 18 (highest) &#8211; (default &#8211; 0)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: Map configuration applies to all maps (Post Map or All Posts Map) inserted in the post. Each post retains its own<br />\nconfiguration.</p>\n<h4>Preview Map</h4>\n<p>A preview map is used as a visual means to verify post location is correct. It shows the most recently successfully<br />\nsaved location and the currently configured initial zoom level. The preview map height and width is fixed and<br />\ndoes not reflect custom map configuration. To verify the suitability of a customized height or width, insert a map<br />\nin the post and view it in preview mode.</p>\n<h3>Preview Map in WordPress 5.x using Block (Gutenberg) Editor</h3>\n<p>Map Posts Free was originally built for the classic WordPress editor (WordPress versions 4.x and earlier). It is not yet<br />\nup to full block editing standards. As a consequence, the map configuration panel continues to function (values entered<br />\nwill be saved whenever the post is Saved as Draft, Published or Updated); the preview map however will not update until<br />\nthe browser is refreshed (or a new edit session started).</p>\n<p>To verify map configuration is successfully applied it is therefore recommended to insert a Post Map in the content<br />\nand preview the page; or refresh the browser page and verify the preview map updates correctly.</p>\n<h4>Saving Configuration</h4>\n<p>Location and map configuration is applied whenever a post is updated (when the Save As Draft, Publish or Update button<br />\nis clicked, depending on post status). If no data validation errors occur, the values entered will be saved to the<br />\ndatabase and map configuration updated. It is possible for changes to be only partially saved &#8211; if any configuration<br />\nfails, it will revert to its last saved value and a message will be provided to the user.</p>\n<h3>Saving Configuration in WordPress 5.0 using Gutenberg Editor</h3>\n<p>Saving configuration entered through the metabox works normally however the fields do not update fully until the next<br />\ntime the editor is loaded. This means that if you update configuration information and click Save as Draft, Update or<br />\nPublish, fields will show the last user entered information however you will not see the user message updated to indicate a<br />\nsuccessful save or not. If there were input validation issues, error messages will not appear until the next time the post<br />\nor page is edited.</p>\n<h4>Layer Control</h4>\n<p>The public map (but not the preview map used for configuration) includes a layer control that allows map viewers<br />\nto select which base map to use (options include Standard, Humanitarian and Black and White OpenStreetMap;<br />\nBlack and White High Contrast, Natural Terrain and Artistic Map (from Stamen)).</p>\n<p>There are also some transparent layers than can be overlain the base maps; these include Trails and Topographic<br />\nrelief. For the All Posts Map only, all the post locations are collected in a single layer and can be hidden or<br />\nmade visible from the control as well.</p>\n"
