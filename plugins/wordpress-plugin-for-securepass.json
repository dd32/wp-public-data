The variable $radius_host contains the primary<br />\nRADIUS server of SecurePass, located in Switzerland (Lugano).<br />\nA secondary RADIUS is available in Italy (Milan), if you prefer this<br />\nlocation change $radius_host to &#8216;radius2.secure-pass.net&#8217;.</p>\n<p>WARNING!!! Before activating this plugin, create an user in wordpress that<br />\nmatches a username in SecurePass and grant full administrative powers.<br />\nThis because the admin user will be no longer checked locally. In case you<br />\nwon&#8217;t be able to login anymore, a workaround is moving the securepass plugin<br />\ndirectory to another directory name, ex: &#8220;mv securepass securepass.old&#8221;.</p>\n",
