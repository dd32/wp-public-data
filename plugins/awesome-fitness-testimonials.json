If you use visual composer plugin, you will need to switch back to the WordPress editing mode first.</p>\n<p>Your shortcode will look similar to:</p>\n<p>[fitness-testimonials id=&#8221;1&#8243; limit=&#8221;10&#8243; excerpt=&#8221;true&#8221; javascript=&#8221;true&#8221; random=&#8221;true&#8221; like_button=&#8221;top&#8221; ]</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>id</code> is your testimonial group ID number (Required)</li>\n<li><code>limit</code> sets a maximum number of testimonials to display (Optional)</li>\n<li><code>excerpt</code> plugin uses a short testimonial instead of the full version if found (Optional)</li>\n<li><code>javascript</code> testimonials will be generated by Javascript, which prevents search engines from caching your content if you need to use for SEO (Optional)</li>\n<li><code>random</code> testimonials will be displayed in an random order (Optional)</li>\n<li><code>like_button</code> adds (Optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also embed it manually in your PHP file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php do_shortcode(' [fitness-testimonials id=\"xx\"] '); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I add the video?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can simply add/insert it into the WordPress text editor box.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the template design?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have simple options under the &#8220;Style&#8221; tab as well as “Advanced” tab for more advanced users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the shortcode outside the post editor, such as in theme or template files, or in widgets?</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Can I upload multiple images? More than two?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently you can only add up to 2 images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize the look of a single testimonial page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can copy <code>single-testimonial.php</code> from the fitness-testimonials/includes/ folder to your own theme folder and make any edits there.
