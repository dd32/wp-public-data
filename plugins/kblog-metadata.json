This<br />\nprovides greater clarity on who posts are written by, and how they should be<br />\ncited. Readers can download the citation as a BibTeX file. Another widget<br />\nprovides deep links through to Web Archives, allowing readers to check old<br />\nversions of posts.</p>\n<p>It is part of the Knowledgeblog project (http://knowledgeblog.org), which is<br />\ndeveloping plugins to improve WordPress as a tool for academic publishing,<br />\neither for individual authors, or for conferences and workshops publishing<br />\nproceedings to the web. As well as this file, additional documentation is<br />\navailable at<br />\n<a href=\"http://process.knowledgeblog.org/category/kblog-metadata\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">process</a>.</p>\n<p>It is often useful to embed bibliographic metadata, describing the author(s),<br />\ntitle and publication date into a web page. There are a variety of different<br />\nways of doing this, described in a variety of different specifications and/or<br />\nstandards. These vary widely in their formality, uptake and age, as well as<br />\nclarity with which the specification is written.</p>\n<p>The practical upshot of this is that automatic capture of metadata which<br />\nenables tools such as Greycite (http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org) and various<br />\nbibliographic software to work is a somewhat ad hoc affair. Sometimes it<br />\nworks, sometimes it does not. Rather than requiring users to add a separate<br />\nplugin for each of these specifications, kblog-metadata takes the approach of<br />\nadding metadata in as many formats as possible, in the hope that, for any<br />\ntool, at least one will work.</p>\n<p>Kblog Metadata enhances the ability of WordPress to expose and edit<br />\nbibliographic metadata of academic posts.

We<br />\ncurrently support three independent standards which are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>COinS (http://ocoins.info).</li>\n<li>Meta tags as suggested by Google Scholar.</li>\n<li>Open Graph Protocol (http://ogp.me) </li>\n</ol>\n<p>These will be automatically added to add pages and posts on installation of<br />\nthe plugin. The metadata is taken either from the user profile, the WordPress<br />\nmetadata, or from Kblog Author metadata.</p>\n<h3>Kblog Table of Contents</h3>\n<p>The table of contents functionality comes in two forms: one designed for<br />\nembedding in an existing page, and one for computational consumption. To add a<br />\ntable of contents to a page add a &#8220;shortcode&#8221; to your post contents.</p>\n<p>&#091;kblogtoc&#093;</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is also possible to retrieve a simple HTML or plain text<br />\nrepresentation of the table of contents from (http://blogurl/?kblog-toc=txt)<br />\nor (http://blogurl/?kblog-toc=html). Author information comes from<br />\nKblog Author.</p>\n<p>You can specify the default category for the table of contents from the<br />\nSettings Menu, or accept the default which is to show them all.</p>\n<h3>Kblog Authors</h3>\n<p>Academic writing is more often multi-author than not, yet this is poorly<br />\nsupported within WordPress. While there are existing co-author plugins these<br />\noften require assigning multiple user accounts, one per author, even though<br />\nmany authors will never login to WordPress. Within Kblog Authors you can add<br />\n&#8220;display authors&#8221;, totally independently from WordPress accounts. They will<br />\nappear on Kblog Table of Contents and in metadata generated by Kblog Headers.</p>\n<p>Authors can be added either on the &#8220;Edit Post&#8221; page of WordPress, or through<br />\nthe use of an &#091;author&#093; shortcode within the document content. Authors<br />\nspecified within the post content take precedence.</p>\n<h3>Kblog Title</h3>\n<p>Authors may wish to alter the apparent title of their blog for a post or a<br />\ngroup of posts. For example, I may wish to publish a paper that I have written<br />\nfor a conference on my own blog, but wish the metadata to refer to the<br />\nconference. Alternatively, as with<br />\n<a href=\"http://bio-ontologies.knowledgeblog.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bio-ontologies</a> I may wish to host<br />\nmultiple meetings on a single website (one per year, for instance), and have<br />\nthe year, or meeting number, appear in the metadata. Kblog Title allows both<br />\nof these uses, by allowing the user to set the container name (&#8220;blogname&#8221;)<br />\neither for an individual post, or using an Event tag.</p>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>kblog-metadata includes the HumanNameParser from Jason Priem<br />\n(http://jasonpriem.org/human-name-parse/) which is licensed under the MIT<br />\nLicense.</p>\n<h3>Copyright</h3>\n<p>This plugin is copyright Phillip Lord, Newcastle University and is licensed<br />\nunder GPLv2.</p>\n",
