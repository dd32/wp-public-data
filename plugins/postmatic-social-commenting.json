        "description": "<p>Postmatic Social Commenting takes a lighter weight approach than traditional Social Login plugins.</p>\n<h4>The big difference</h4>\n<p>No WordPress users are created. Nobody is logged in. This is not social <em>login</em>, it is social <em>commenting</em>. That means it is simple, lean, and whoopingly fast.</p>\n<h4>How it works</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Users click the social network icon of their choice when they want to leave a comment.</li>\n<li>The social network asks their permission to share their name, profile image, and email address with your site.</li>\n<li>If they agree a standard WordPress cookie is added to their browser and the comment form is ready for their reply. When they return to your site they are already authorized. Nice.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>The usual. Install. Activate. Head for Settings &gt; Postmatic Social Commenting</p>\n<p>Like most all social plugins, this thing takes some work to get up and running. We wish it were otherwise.</p>\n<p>You must create an app for each network. We&#8217;ve included some fantastic tutorials and videos to help you through the process. It&#8217;s not difficult work, but it&#8217;s not exactly fun. Luckily you only have to do it once and then it&#8217;s high fives from all of your commenters. Forever.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can my users log in using this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Proudly, no. This isn&#8217;t a heavy weight <em>social everything</em> kind of plugin. No users. No logins. No sharing (no sharing!). If you want your users to be able to comment without filling out a name, email, and website this is your plugin is your new best friend. If you want more than that try WordPress Social Login.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to generate api keys for each network I want to use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, sorry. You will have to create new apps, configure them, and get keys. We&#8217;ve taken the pain out of it though by including a bunch of videos and tutorials to walk you through it. You&#8217;ll find them on the setting screen for each network.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the social network icons or placement?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You certainly can via css. We don&#8217;t offer any options in the plugin settings yet though. The default style which we have included is simple, elegant, and works well with any theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If a user connects with their social profile can they still subscribe to comments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Totally. When the user connects with their social network we grab their email address so it can be passed along to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postmatic\" rel=\"ugc\">Postmatic</a>. This is not true of Twitter (which doesn&#8217;t offer email addresses) but if they connect with Twitter and then check the box to subscribe to other comments we&#8217;ll prompt them for their email address.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed stuborn stylesheet from 1.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved layout compatability with Epoch</li>\n<li>Fontawesome is not loaded unless needed</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New layout to play nicely with 4.4</li>\n<li>Accessibility and semantic improvements</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in which Postmatic subscriptions would happen by mistake</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug in which <a href=\"https://github.com/postmatic/postmatic-social/issues/49\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">email addresses would get funky</a> when connecting with Twitter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a seriously serious bug in which Akismet would get very upset with social comments.
