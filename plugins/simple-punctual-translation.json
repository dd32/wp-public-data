        "faq": "\n<h4>What differences between the 2 translation engines ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For this plugin, we did not impose an architecture defined for the translation engine, so we proposed an automatic or manual mode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Automatic mode</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The automatic mode is rather aimed at the general public, because no change is necessary in the source code. The idea is that, when sailing on the German version of a page, WordPress retrieves data from the original page, and our plugin is automatically injected the contents of German 3 fields, title, content and extract .<br />\nThis means that the German version in automatic mode will keep, if your theme display it, publication date, comments, author, tags and categories of the original post.<br />\nThis mode is quite sufficient to use the basic translation plugin on content types native, it is compatible to 99% on the existing WordPress installations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Manual mode</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This second mode is much more powerful than the first. The manual mode does not modify any data from the initial query of WordPress, so no modification is made on the theme, your content will not even be translated! To switch language, we were inspired by functions of WordPress Mu allowing switch between blogs, either <code>switch_to_blog()</code> and <code>restore_current_blog()</code>.<br />\nAnd we have created 2 functions <code>switch_to_language()</code> and <code>restore_original_language()</code>.</p>\n<p>The first function <code>switch_to_language()</code> toggles the content in the translated version, while the second function <code>restore_original_language()</code> allow to restore the original language of the content.</p>\n<p>Example :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nthe_title(); // Title in English\n\nswitch_to_language();\n the_title(); // Title in French\nrestore_original_language();\n\nthe_title(); // Title in English\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pair of functions allows developers to be extremely precise about which fields to translate. This mode in my opinion, should be widely preferred because it is clean, it does not interact with the original application of WordPress. Nevertheless, there are some flaws such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The title page&#8217;s HTML is not translated</li>\n<li>Plugins breadcrumb does not take into account the translation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are mainly defects on the SEO aspect, and indeed on this first version of the plugin that we have worked the functional aspect. We rely on community feedback to improve the plugin &#8230;</p>\n</p>\n\n",
