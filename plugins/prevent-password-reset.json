        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>prevent-password-reset</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Go to your user profile in the admin to select whether to prevent password resetting.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I needed a way to disable password resets for specific administrators on my site but leave this functionality open for the other 1,000s of users.  So, I chose to make this an option on a per-user basis.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once installed, a checkbox gets added to the &#8220;Personal Options&#8221; section of each user&#8217;s profile page in the WordPress admin.  Anyone who can edit the user may check this box to disable password resets for that individual user.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I forgot my password. What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to do this is to log into your hosting account via FTP.  Proceed to your plugins directory and delete the <code>prevent-password-reset</code> folder.  This should allow you to reset passwords for any user account via the &#8220;lost password&#8221; form.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have this type of access, you need to talk to a site administrator who does to have them update your password.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h3>Version 0.2.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed license from GPL v2-only to GPL v2+.</li>\n<li>Added plugin row meta for the plugin.</li>\n<li>Dropped the MO and PO files in favor of a POT file for translators.</li>\n<li>Added a <code>readme.md</code> file since this plugin is now on GitHub.</li>\n<li>Updated this <code>readme.txt</code> file.</li>\n<li>Updated this plugin for the mere purpose of updating. WordPress.org has created a stigma around plugins that don&#8217;t get updates every so often by putting a big warning box at the top of the plugin&#8217;s page.  Basically, it&#8217;s telling users to beware!  Of course, this is just ridiculous, particularly when talking about a plugin that most likely will never need an update (like this one).  Some plugins are simply &#8220;set and forget&#8221; forever.  But, because of how WordPress.org treats these types of plugins, lumping them into a &#8220;bad plugin&#8221; pool with plugins that actually do need updates, I&#8217;m forced to create a rather useless update to this plugin.  Update if you wish; it&#8217;s not actually necessary.  It&#8217;s just necessary for me to update the plugin in order for it to not be de-listed from the WordPress.org search results.  Good day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Version 0.1.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin launch.  Everything&#8217;s new!</li>\n</ul>\n"
