A visitor can supply either the post&#8217;s password or the master post password to access the content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20require%20a%20password%20for%20posts%20that%20didn%27t%20already%20have%20a%20post%20password%20configured%3F'>\nWill this require a password for posts that didn&#8217;t already have a post password configured?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. It only affects posts that already have a post password.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20remove%20or%20change%20the%20password%20for%20passworded%20posts%20to%20the%20master%20post%20password%3F'>\nDoes this remove or change the password for passworded posts to the master post password?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Any explicitly set post password remains unchanged and functional. The master post password is saved separately from posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20have%20multiple%20password%20protected%20posts%20listed%2C%20do%20i%20need%20to%20provide%20the%20master%20post%20password%20for%20each%20one%20to%20view%20them%20all%20%28a%20bit%20redundant%20since%20i%20obviously%20know%20the%20master%20post%20password%20and%20it%20applies%20to%20all%20of%20them%29%3F'>\nIf I have multiple password protected posts listed, do I need to provide the master post password for each one to view them all (a bit redundant since I obviously know the master post password and it applies to all of them)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, if you provide the master post password for one post, it&#8217;ll automatically be applied to all passworded posts until the site&#8217;s browser cookies expire.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20change%20the%20master%20post%20password%3F'>\nWhat happens if I change the master post password?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Other than the obvious (the master post password has a new value), all existing users of the old master post password will expire when a browser attempts to view a passworded post. The visitor will have to provide the original post password(s) or the new master post password. If a visitor accessed a passworded post using the post&#8217;s explicitly set post password, then they will not be affected by a master post password change.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20master%20post%20password%20stored%20securely%3F'>\nIs the master post password stored securely?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. As is the case for post passwords in WordPress, the master post password is stored in the database as plaintext. That is, unless the master post password is set by a constant, in which case it is never stored in the database and only in the given .php file (typically wp-config.php, where other site passwords are defined).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20see%20the%20setting%20on%20the%20%22reading%20settings%22%20admin%20page%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I see the setting on the &#8220;Reading Settings&#8221; admin page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Are you logged in as an administrative user who can access the &#8220;Settings&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Reading&#8221; admin page? Is the plugin installed and activated?</p>\n<p>Assuming those are true, have you set a master post password via the <code>C2C_MASTER_POST_PASSWORD</code> constant? If so, the admin setting will not be displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20include%20unit%20tests%3F'>\nDoes this plugin include unit tests?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20localizable%3F'>\nIs this plugin localizable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20gdpr-compliant%3F'>\nIs this plugin GDPR-compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin does not collect, store, or disseminate any information from any users or site visitors.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
