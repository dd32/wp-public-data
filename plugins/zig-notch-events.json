Organize VIP meetings between companies and c-level executives, or send attendees with the most significant buying intent to virtual stands and earn affiliate commissions. Want to create recurring income? You get your own virtual ad space for sponsors with the highest bids. They can pay on a monthly basis directly to your account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20maximum%20attendees%20can%20i%20have%20per%20event%3F'>\nHow many maximum attendees can I have per event?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can have anywhere between 1-20.000 active members in your events. They will not only be attending events but also engage, connect, interact with sponsors and virtual stands, and create workshops and 1-on-1 meetings. In the meantime, you will monetize from almost any step taken on your platform.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20zignotch%20for%20future%20events%3F'>\nCan I use ZIGnotch for future events?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use any attendees in relation to future industry event you need to organize, and create an entire engaging community out of ZIGnotch.

We charge ONLY for monthly subscriptions, and we will not take ANY commission fees off anything you make. Unlike most of our competitors, you are allowed to monetize in whichever way you can, keeping 100% of the profits in the meantime. Everything you can sell in-app is entirely up to you.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
