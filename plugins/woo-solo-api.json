        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20php%207.3%20required%3F'>\nWhy is the PHP 7.3 required?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PHP 7.4 is in the end of life(https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) phase. You should really move on to PHP 8.</p>\n<p>If you have older PHP versions, you are not only doing a disservice to the planet, you&#8217;re also harming your own site speed and security. You can always ask your hosting provider to fix this for you, or if you have control over cPanel on shared hosting, you are likely to be able to update PHP version yourself. Just make sure you tick all the required PHP<br />\nextensions (https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20didn%27t%20receive%20an%20invoice%20when%20testing%20the%20plugin.%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI didn&#8217;t receive an invoice when testing the plugin. What&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Give it a minute, scroll your site. The API communication happens using WP cron, which depends on the site activity to work. You can always check the &#8216;Solo API order details&#8217; tab in the settings to see if there was some error from the API.<br />\nIf that fails, turn on the debug mode (https://wordpress.org/support/article/debugging-in-wordpress/) and try to test again. If there was a fatal error it should be shown in the logs.</p>\n<p>In the version 3 of the plugin, for every failed request you&#8217;ll be able to see the error and try to rerun the call towards the API.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20plugin%20doesn%27t%20work%20with%20xyz%20plugin'>\nThis plugin doesn&#8217;t work with XYZ plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Could be. I didn&#8217;t test it out with every plugin in the wild. That takes time. And money. In the near future I might be able to do some paid work, but that will depend on many things.</p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t try to guilt-trip me to work on your site specific issues. I will try to help to the best of my abilities.<br />\nBut the plugin is free, so don&#8217;t expect me to work miracles. Also, don&#8217;t expect me to<br />\ndrop everything just to work on your issue. If I don&#8217;t answer in a day or two, be patient. I have a private life as<br />\nwell (shocker, I know) 😀</p>\n<p>If you want me to add a new feature to the plugin you can contact me and pay me to work on the feature you need. My rate is 50€/hr.</p>\n<p>Note that some features are not possible to make within this plugin. For instance, some apps and plugins will utilize WooCommerce REST API endpoints to trigger orders. Their API is poorly written, and when you do these kind of actions, the hooks that will look if something changed won&#8217;t get triggered, which means this plugin cannot know of the order status. It is what it is. I could make some kind of listener/cron jobs to manually check these things, but this is a paid feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20how%20the%20email%20looks%2C%20or%20customer%20notice%3F'>\nCan I modify how the email looks, or customer notice?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure you can, besides actually adding things in the settings of the plugin you can modify certain things using these hooks:</p>\n<p>Overwrite the checkout request for specific payment cases</p>\n<p>This filter is used if you have globally selected the API request to happen on<br />\nmanual status change of the order, but you want to allow some payment gateways to<br />\nexecute on the checkout.</p>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('woo_solo_api_overwrite_request_on_checkout', 'my_payment_processor_overwrite', 10, 2);\n\nfunction my_payment_processor_overwrite($sendControl, $order) {\n  // Say we want to allow api call on checkout for direct bank transfer (bacs),\n  // and all others on status change.\n\n  // Check the payment gateway from the order.\n  $paymentMethod = $order-&gt;get_payment_method();\n\n  // Check if the current payment method is the one you want to overwrite.\n  if ($paymentMethod === 'bacs') {\n    return 'checkout';\n  }\n\n  // Default fallback.\n  return $sendControl;\n}\n\n\n\n@param string $sendControl Type of send control.

I called this the refactor, because the basic functionality of the plugin remained the same. But in all reality, this was a total plugin rewrite. You&#8217;ll need to make sure you have PHP 7.3 installed on your server.</p>\n<p>The options remained the same, so none of the settings on an already existing version should disappear. Plugin will<br />\n need to be disabled and then enabled again once updated, so that the database table can be created.</p>\n<p>There is one bug that is coming from the fact that the new settings page is built using Gutenberg blocks. Due to a<br />\n nature of translations and how they work in GB, and the fact that I&#8217;m relying on webpack to bundle my assets. The<br />\n  translations are not working properly. There is an issue opened in WP-CLI (<a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/i18n-command/issues/200\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">make-json does not work for .jsx files<br />\n  </a>), but so far we don&#8217;t have a fix for this. Once the fix comes<br />\n   out I&#8217;ll update the plugin&#8217;s translation files. The plugin&#8217;s .po file is fully translated to Croatian, but we need a json file as well for the JavaScript translations.</p>\n<p>The options page has been revamped and is built using Gutenberg components. So that&#8217;s nice.</p>\n<p>Api calls towards Solo service are now run as a background process. So don&#8217;t be alarmed if the order doesn&#8217;t appear<br />\n immediately, or if the Solo invoice/order doesn&#8217;t come immediately to the customer. Give it some time, and rummage<br />\n  around a bit, to trigger WordPress cron 😀</p>\n<p>A lot of issues were fixed. The plugin should be more stable and work better now.</p>\n<p>Added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tests &#8211; several acceptance tests and integration tests using wp-browser</li>\n<li>Added several rest routes for internal use\n<ul>\n<li>Account Details &#8211; fetches orders from SOLO API (for testing if api calls work)</li>\n<li>Order Details and its collection &#8211; details about orders fetched from the database</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Added new database for sending orders to API\n<ul>\n<li>We need to keep track if the order was sent or not, and it&#8217;s better to have a table with this information in it. We can update it when the API request is made, and when the process for triggering user email happens. This gives us more control later on if we need to debug something (missing emails, missing requests, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Add privacy related functionality\n<ul>\n<li>This functionality hooks into WP&#8217;s own core privacy functionality.

With queueing calls we are less likely to trigger API throttling from<br />\nthe Solo Api. Oftentimes there would be no orders created in the Solo service, and the user would be none the wiser<br />\nwhat happened. By queueing we avoid this throttling.

    "upgrade_notice": {
        "Version 2 update": "<p>This is a very big update. I called this the refactor, because the basic functionality of the plugin remained the same. But in all reality, this was a total plugin rewrite.</p>\n\n<p>The options remained the same, so none of the settings on an already existing version should disappear. Plugin will\n need to be disabled and then enabled again once updated, so that the database table can be created.</p>\n\n<p>There is one bug that is coming from the fact that the new settings page is built using Gutenberg blocks. Due to a nature of translations and how they work in GB, and the fact that I&#039;m relying on webpack to bundle my assets. The translations are not working properly. There is an issue opened in WP-CLI (https://github.com/wp-cli/i18n-command/issues/200), but so far we don&#039;t have a fix for this. Once the fix comes out I&#039;ll update the plugin&#039;s translation files. The plugin&#039;s .po file is fully translated to Croatian, but we need a json file as well for the JavaScript translations.</p>\n\n<p>The options page has been revamped and is built using Gutenberg components. So that&#039;s nice.</p>\n\n<p>Api calls towards Solo service are now run as a background process. So don&#039;t be alarmed if the order doesn&#039;t appear immediately, or if the Solo invoice/order doesn&#039;t come immediately to the customer. Give it some time, and rummage around a bit, to trigger WordPress cron :D</p>\n\n<p>A lot of issues were fixed. The plugin should be more stable and work better now.</p>\n\n<p>&#039;&#039;&#039;Hrvatski prijevod&#039;&#039;&#039;:</p>\n\n<p>Ovo je veoma veliki update dodatka. Funkcionalnosti dodatka su ostale iste, ali je način na koji dodatak radi veoma izmjenjen. Da bi plugin radio, vaš server mora podržavati PHP 7.3 ili 7.4.</p>\n\n<p>Prilikom updatea, trebat ce te ga onemogućiti i ponovo omogućiti, da biste kreirali novu tablicu u bazi, koja služi za provjeru jesu li se račun/ponuda poslali na Solo servis. Nemojte deinstalirati dodatak, jer to ce maknuti sve podatke koje imate spremljene (sve opcije).</p>\n\n<p>Postoji jedan bug koji je posljedica toga kako se kod pakira i činjenice da se koriste Gutenberg komponente kod kreiranja stranica opcija plugina. Iako prijevod postoji (.po i .mo file sa prijevodima su uključene u plugin), način na koji Gutenberg kontrolira prijevod, znači da trenutno ne može dohvatiti te prijevode (https://github.com/wp-cli/i18n-command/issues/200). Stoga će opcije dodatka biti na engleskom jeziku, dokle god se taj problem ne riješi.</p>\n\n<p>Također, api pozivi prema Solo servisu se izvršavaju kao pozadinski procesi. To znači da kupac neće odmah dobiti e-mail s računom/ponudom koja je generirana na Solo servisu, nego će se to desiti nakon 15ak do 30ak sekundi. Pošto se koristi WordPressov cron za tu funkcionalnost, bitno je da netko bude prisutan na stranici i da se navigira po njoj (ili u adminu ili na frontu). To je jednostavno kako WordPressov cron funkcionira. Razlog zašto su se ti pozivi morali napraviti kao pozadinski procesi, jest to da Solo API ima zaštitu od napada napravljenu da se unutar 15 sekundi ne smiju desiti dva API poziva, inače bit takvi pozivi bili odbačeni, i korisnik ne bi dobio PDF račun ili se ne bi kreirala ponuda/račun na Solo servisu.</p>\n\n<p>Osim toga, dosta problema je riješeno sa ovim updateom, CorvusPay i Braintree integracije su prepoznate i rade sa dodatkom.</p>",
        "1.9.4 Version privacy fix": "<p>Pre 1.9.4 update the offers were saved to a <code>wp-content/uploads/ponude</code> folder and sent to clients. An oversight on my part was not counting on the GDPR and the people&#039;s privacy. It was an honest mistake. And one I learned about because one of my client notified me about that due to the fact that his customer could see hers personal information coming from the sent pdf&#039;s.\nBecause of that fact I will no longer force the plugin to save the pdf&#039;s. Once they were sent to the customer the plugin will delete them from the server.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caution</strong></p>\n\n<p>The new update will delete your old offers, so if you want to save them, you need to do that manually before a new offer is sent.</p>\n\n<p>Then you should go to https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals and request google to remove the search results for your invoices or offers.</p>\n\n<p>I am truly sorry for this oversight, it wasn&#039;t done with intention.</p>",
        "1.5 Currency rate update": "<p>The 1.5 update fixed the currency rate. I parsed the results from https://www.hnb.hr/tecajn/htecajn.htm and created my own currency rate array. I also tested it with included taxes and it seems to be working ok. If for any reason the taxes are not being calculated or pulled in the solo api, there must be some third party plugin that is messing stuff up. Be mindful of that.</p>",
        "1.4 Tax and tax rates fixes": "<p>The 1.4 update fixed a lot of issues with the taxes, and tax rates. Although this has been fixed, the taxes probably won&#039;t be picked up by the SOLO API if you set the option in the WooCommerce to include taxes in the price of the product. This is why you should separate the two. Also when creating a shipping tax class, be sure to create it as a separate class, and leave the standard tax class for the product. So for instance the product will have a standard tax of 5%, and the shipping can have a separate class with tax rate of 25% (be sure to tick the shipping checkbox in this class).\nThe including prices will be fixed in the next update.</p>",
        "1.3 Taxes fixes": "<p>The 1.3 update removed the predefined tax rates from the plugin, and is instead using WooCommerce taxes.\nThis means that you can have different tax for the item, and different for the shipping. Word of caution though, the Croatian law has predefined taxes of 0, 5, 13 or 25%. So in case you put the tax for the item and shipping anything other than that, the tax rate will be sent as 0 - so that your SOLO invoice or offer will pass, but with 0 tax rate.</p>\n\n<p>Also be sure to separate those two taxes. For instance you can set the item tax rate as a standard tax rate, and then the shipping tax can be set as a reduced tax rate, and then just set the Shipping tax class to reduced tax rate in the WooCommerce options. If you put everything as a standard one, the tax rates will get mixed and the end price won&#039;t be correct (not sure how else to handle this since WooCommerce has a weird tax system).</p>"
