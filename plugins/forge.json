That&#8217;s why we have created <a href=\"http://forgeplugin.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Forge</a>, a front-end page builder that allows you to create stunning websites the easy way.</p>\n<p>Forge lets you use a drag &amp; drop interface to create and move content around as you please.

They were bloated, slow, unstable, and made a mess of your content. Forge is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, while keeping your WordPress site healthy. The interface of our <a href=\"http://forgeplugin.com/?utm_source=repository&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=freeversion\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">drag and drop builder</a> is made to be efficient, and does not get in the way between you and your pages.</p>\n<h4>Create Landing Pages Easily And Effortlessly</h4>\n<p>Use Forge with ANY WordPress theme to create custom landing pages from scratch. Break free from the content area, and build entire layouts using only drag and drop. All of this, at the touch of a button.</p>\n<h4>Smart, Responsive Content Out Of The Box</h4>\n<p>Anything you create with Forge scales down to pixel perfect dimensions. Create intricate layouts full of columns and images that look amazing in every single screen, and impress your visitors like no other. You will be amazed at how easy it is.</p>\n<h4>A New Way To Publish Content</h4>\n<p>Forget about having to save every little change you make to your pages. Forge will preserve your changes in real time, so you can stop working and go back any time you want. Also, your changes will not go live until you are ready to publish, so you can plan and prepare your content with ease. No more rushing to create that homepage!</p>\n<h4>Extensible and Customizable</h4>\n<p>Forge is made to be highly customizable, and you can create new elements on your own thanks to its multiple APIs. If you know how to develop with WordPress, you will find extending Forge a breeze.</p>\n<h4>Other Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Drag and Drop Page Builder</li>\n<li>Create Full-screen landing pages</li>\n<li>Work in real time</li>\n<li>Fully responsive layouts &amp; designs</li>\n<li>Parallax backgrounds</li>\n<li>Action History &#8211; Revert any changes and see your progress</li>\n<li>Import &amp; Export &#8211; Migrate content between websites and pages</li>\n<li>Compatible with 99% of all WordPress themes</li>\n<li>Lightning fast to use, with shortcuts and keyboard actions</li>\n<li>Use the content of your posts along with builder layouts</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pro Version Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Templates &#8211; Save pieces of layout and reuse them with ease</li>\n<li>Premade Layouts &#8211; Deploy entire pages in 2 clicks</li>\n<li>Call To Action Buttons</li>\n<li>Content sliders that can hold anything</li>\n<li>Image Galleries &#8211; In grid and masonry format</li>\n<li>Accordions</li>\n<li>Use native WordPress widgets</li>\n<li>Video Embeds</li>\n<li>Testimonials &amp; Team Profiles</li>\n<li>Navigation Menus</li>\n<li>Custom Post Listings</li>\n<li>Login Form &amp; Registration Form</li>\n<li>Embed Google Maps</li>\n<li>Pricing Tables</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Quickstart</h4>\n<p>First, install and activate the Forge plugin.
