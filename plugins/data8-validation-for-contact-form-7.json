        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20the%20email%20validation%20level%3F'>\nHow do I change the email validation level?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the plugin configuration page, enable the Email validation option by selecting a level at which to validate email fields. Fields of type &#8217;email&#8217; in Gravity Forms and Contact Form 7 will be automatically validated. To gain further control over individual elements, the level of validation can be overridden as follows:</p>\n<p>In Contact Form 7, the email validation level can be changed using the level option, e.g.<br />\n[email* your-email level:Address]</p>\n<p>In Gravity Forms, the email validation level can be changed by adding a &#8220;d8level_Address&#8221; CSS class to the Custom CSS Class setting.</p>\n<p>The following are valid email validation levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Syntax &#8211; validates the syntax of the email address (lowest)</li>\n<li>MX &#8211; validates the domain name (right hand part) the email address (default)</li>\n<li>Server &#8211; validates the mail servers for the domain are alive</li>\n<li>Address &#8211; validates the full email address (highest)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20data8%27s%20phone%20validation%20service%20validate%20mobile%20and%20landline%20telephone%20numbers%3F'>\nWill Data8&#8217;s phone validation service validate mobile and landline telephone numbers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Simply enable the Phone validation option on the plugin configuration page and the appropriate validation will be applied to any &#8216;tel&#8217; fields. The service includes both UK landline and mobile validation. You will need credits for the Data8 Phone Validation service to use this option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20enter%20international%20telephone%20numbers%3F'>\nHow do I enter international telephone numbers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Phone Validation service will validate the entered number using the rules appropriate for the country indicated in the telephone number using standard international dialling rules. For example, if a number is entered with a &#8220;+1&#8221; or &#8220;001&#8221; prefix, it will be validated as a US number, or if &#8220;+44&#8221; or &#8220;0044&#8221; is used it will be validated as a UK number.</p>\n<p>If no international prefix is specified, it will be validated according to the rules for a default country. The default is United Kingdom (GB), however this can be changed globally using the Default Country Code option under the Phone Validation section, or set individually on each field as follows:</p>\n<p>In Gravity Forms, add the &#8220;d8country_XX&#8221; CSS class to the Custom CSS Class setting, e.g. d8country_US</p>\n<p>In Contact Form 7, use the &#8220;country&#8221; tag, e.g.:<br />\n[tel* your-tel country:US]</p>\n</p>\n\n",
