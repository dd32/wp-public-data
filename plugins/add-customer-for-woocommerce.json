        "description": "<p>This plugin is designed to simplify the process of creating new users/customers. It&#8217;s particularly useful if you receive client orders via phone or email and want to integrate these orders into WooCommerce for stock and order management.<br />\nThe plugin adds a checkbox at the end of the billing address form. When this box is checked, it creates a new user with the role &#8220;customer.&#8221; If an email is not provided, the plugin generates a unique one using your site’s domain as the email domain and the customer&#8217;s name as the local part (e.g., firstname.lastname@your-site.com). You have the option to customize this auto-generated email format.</p>\n<p>By default, the newly created user does not receive any emails during account creation, though they will probably on order updates.</p>\n<p>In the settings menu, there are options to:<br />\n&#8211; Check the box by default<br />\n&#8211; Send login credentials to the new customer</p>\n<p>There are also additional options:<br />\n&#8211; Update new customer information by default<br />\n&#8211; Link customer orders<br />\n&#8211; Define the user role individually<br />\n&#8211; Set the user role for new customers<br />\n&#8211; Customize the auto-generated email format<br />\n&#8211; Edit the email subject for accounts created<br />\n&#8211; Change the sender&#8217;s email address</p>\n<p>Settings Menu:<br />\nWooCommerce -&gt; Add customer settings</p>\n<p>Required Plugins: WooCommerce 4.7.0 or higher<br />\nRequired PHP extension: Intl</p>\n<p>If you like the plugin, please leave some stars or buy me a coffee. Thank you!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/add-customer-for-woocommerce directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the ‚Plugins‘ screen in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Enjoy</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>What role will the new user have?<br />\n&#8211; By default, the new user will have the &#8220;Customer&#8221; role. You can select a different default role from any available roles in the options menu.</p>\n<p>What happens if an email already exists?<br />\n&#8211; A new user will not be created. The plugin will assign the order to the existing user with that email.</p>\n<p>How can I link guest orders to users?<br />\n&#8211; Activate the option &#8220;Link customer orders&#8221; to associate guest orders with existing users.</p>\n<p>Does the new user receive a notification about the created account?<br />\n&#8211; No, not by default. This can be enabled on the settings page. An email will then be sent to the customer with login credentials, including a random password.</p>\n<p>Can I change the email template for the new customer?<br />\n&#8211; Yes, you can. Copy &#8220;new-account.php&#8221; from &#8220;wp-content/plugins/add-customer-for-woocommerce/templates/email&#8221; to &#8220;wp-content/themes/[your-theme/child-theme]/woocommerce/add-customer/email&#8221; and make your changes there.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to change the email format?<br />\n&#8211; Yes. You can select the preferred format in the Settings menu of the plugin.</p>\n<p>Are there any hooks I can use?<br />\n&#8211; Certainly! There are currently four filters:<br />\n wac_add_customer_email &#8211; To modify the email saved by the plugin.<br />\n wac_supported_fake_email_parts &#8211; To add custom fields support.<br />\n wac_get_user_roles &#8211; An array with the user roles a user is allowed to set.<br />\n wac_deactivate_user_emails &#8211; Allows you to override the deactivation of user emails<br />\n&#8211; And two actions:<br />\n wac_after_insert_new_customer &#8211; To execute after a new customer has been created.<br />\n wac_after_insert_updated_customer &#8211; To execute after an existing customer has been updated.<br />\n Consult the example file examples/hooks.php for more details how to use them.</p>\n<p>I created a users before the update 1.9.0 and would like use the feature to suppress the emails from being sent.<br />\n &#8211; You can use the new hook &#8220;wac_deactivate_user_emails&#8221; for that. It has two parameters: $is_deactivated and $user_id. You can use this filter and return &#8220;true&#8221; for the users you like to suppress the messages.</p>\n",
