Simply posting a disclaimer on a separate page does not inform the reader, who may not click on the disclaimer page. Even if they did click on it, the disclaimer page likely would not be clear as to what products or services you received compensation for.</p>\n<p>From the FTC website &#8220;A single disclosure doesn&#8217;t really do it because people visiting your site might read individual reviews or watch individual videos without seeing the disclosure on your page.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Therefore, you should include a disclosure on every post that has a paid review.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20insert%20a%20disclaimer%20in%20a%20page%20or%20post%3F'>\nHow do I insert a disclaimer in a page or post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In your WordPress dashboard, click on Settings &gt; Review Disclaimer, then enter the disclaimer text and click Save Changes.</p>\n<p>After you have saved the disclaimer text you can use the shortcode [ReviewDisclaimer] in any page or post where you want your disclaimer to appear.</p>\n<p>If your site is using the new Gutenberg editor, there is a new Review Disclaimer block that can be inserted into your page or post content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20required%20language%20to%20use%20in%20my%20disclosure%3F'>\nIs there Required Language to use in my Disclosure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. As long as it is clear that you received compensation of some sort for your review. You could say something like:</p>\n<p>I received compensation for my review of the products or services in this post.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20i%20decide%20to%20change%20the%20language%20in%20the%20disclaimer%20later%20on%2C%20what%20will%20happen%20to%20the%20disclaimers%20currently%20being%20shown%20on%20my%20pages%20or%20posts%3F'>\nIf I decide to change the language in the disclaimer later on, what will happen to the disclaimers currently being shown on my pages or posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you update the disclaimer, the shortcodes used in your pages or posts will update to reflect the new language. They will continue to be shown in the same location on the page as where you originally placed it.</p>\n<p>If you delete the text, and still have the shortcode inside a page or post, it will simply remove the language from that page or post.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
