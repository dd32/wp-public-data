For Stripe Tax for WooCommerce pricing, see the <a href=\"https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-stripe-tax-pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">API integration with Stripe Tax</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow along below to learn how to install this connector and how to configure it.</p>\n<h3>1. Install the Stripe Tax for WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>Install this plugin and make sure it’s activated.</p>\n<h3>2. Connect your Stripe account</h3>\n<p>On your website’s dashboard, navigate to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; WooCommerce.\n</p>\n<p>Then on the Stripe Tax tab, click Connect with Stripe to log in to your Stripe account or create a new one.</p>\n</p>\n<p>After successful authentication, navigate back to the Stripe Tax settings to continue with the configuration steps.</p>\n</p>\n<h3>3. Configure your sales tax settings</h3>\n<p>If you previously configured these tax settings in the <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe Dashboard</a>, the values populate automatically in the Stripe Tax connector. You can edit the values in the connector and the changes automatically update in your Stripe Dashboard.</p>\n<p>On the Stripe Tax tab, under Configure your sales tax settings, complete the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Enter your head office address, which is your company’s legal address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose your default <a href=\"https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">product tax code</a>, which allows Stripe to calculate the tax rate for categories of products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Save changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the Tax tab, you can decide if the prices you set for your products are inclusive or exclusive of tax.</p>\n<h3>4. Manage tax registrations</h3>\n<p>Sales tax calculation isn’t applied <a href=\"https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax#situations-where-stripe-calculates-zero-tax\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">until you add registrations</a> for jurisdictions where you need to collect tax. Our <a href=\"https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">monitoring tool</a> can help you understand where you might be registered or need to register.</p>\n<p>If you’re already registered in certain jurisdictions and want to start collecting tax immediately, you can add those registrations to your configuration. You can only add tax registrations for <a href=\"https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries#supported-countries\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">supported countries and registration types</a>. Some jurisdictions might require additional information.</p>\n<h3>Add tax registration</h3>\n<p>On the Stripe Tax tab, under Tax registrations, click Add new. Choose the jurisdiction from the dropdown, then click Save changes.</p>\n<h3>Delete tax registration</h3>\n<p>To delete a registration, hover over the registration, then click End immediately. To delete multiple registrations, select them from the list, then click End immediately from the Bulk actions dropdown.</p>\n<h3>5. Configure product tax codes and customer tax settings (optional)</h3>\n<p>You can configure tax codes for your products or tax settings for your customers.</p>\n<h3>Product tax codes</h3>\n<p>Stripe Tax can calculate the tax for each of your products based on the product tax code that you assign to it. If you don’t set a code per product, Stripe Tax uses the default <a href=\"https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">product tax code</a> that you selected during setup.</p>\n<p>To set a tax code per product:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to Products and select a product from the list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On the Edit product page, in the Product data section, select a Stripe Tax &#8211; Product tax code for the product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Update to save your selection.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Customer tax settings</h3>\n<p>Stripe Tax can calculate the tax for each of your customers based on their tax status.</p>\n<p>To update a user’s taxability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to Users and select a user from the list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under Stripe Tax Exemptions, select a Tax Status option for the user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click Update user to save your selection.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Learn more about how the customer’s <a href=\"https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax#exempt-customers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tax status</a> impacts sales tax calculation.</p>\n<h3>6. Collect taxes</h3>\n<p>To start collecting taxes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>On the WooCommerce &gt; General tab, select Enable tax rates and calculations, then click Save changes.
