        "faq": "\n<h4>How does 40Nuggets work on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you install and activate 40Nuggets, you will be prompted to open an account by providing your email and setting up a password. A javascript code snippet will then be automatically installed on your site via WordPress. The script loads asynchronously so it will never slow down your site or load time. 40Nuggets tracks the behavior of every one of your site visitors, and our algorithm uses that information to optimize your Nuggets for the highest conversion rate.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does A/B testing work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Test two design variables against each other to see which converts the most traffic. Set it and forget it &#8211; 40Nuggets will automatically adjust the division of traffic based on the Nuggets’ performances, so you don’t waste valuable time and traffic waiting for an experiment to end. <a href=\"https://40nuggets.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205023816-Nuggets-A-B-Split-Testing-Different-Nugget-Designs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Watch this video</a> to learn more about our intelligent A/B testing tool.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I send data to my email service provider or CRM?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. 40Nuggets integrates with many softwares you might already be using, such as MailChimp, HubSpot, Salesforce, Constant Contact and <a href=\"https://40nuggets.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/201066885-INTEGRATIONS\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more</a>.  You can also use a <a href=\"https://40nuggets.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202749865-Webhooks\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">webhook</a> to pass data to any URL you like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I target my paid traffic?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; <a href=\"https://40nuggets.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204705175-Segments-Target-by-Traffic-Source\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">targeting visitors by Custom Traffic Sources</a> is one way to track visitors and conversions all the way through, and understand what channels are giving you the best ROI. Understanding a visitor’s path to your site can also help inform your plan for engagement.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is a Nugget different than an average pop up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pop up, screen overlay, lightbox &#8211; they’re all different names for the same thing. They can be powerful tools for converting visitors &#8211; <strong>when used correctly.</strong> Unfortunately, most standard pop-ups just serve to annoy site visitors and get dismissed without the visitor taking the desired action. Our Nuggets convert more traffic because they are intelligently timed, beautifully designed, and “polite” &#8211; they serve as an extension of your visitor’s experience on your site, rather than an interruption.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I preview my Nugget before publishing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Make sure you add your website&#8217;s URL in the My Accounts page. Then, when you roll over your Nugget in the Dashboard and click <strong>Preview</strong>, you&#8217;ll see exactly how the Nugget will appear on your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
