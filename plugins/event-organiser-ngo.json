        "faq": "\n<h4>How to activate this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is an add-on plugin to event-organiser, so you need to install that plugin first, and then activate it. After that, install this plugin and activate it <em>both</em> on the portal-site, and the sites from where you want to be able to share events.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The site events does not show up in the portal calendar</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure your site owner has ticked the setting in back-office -&gt; settings -&gt; read to allow editors to share events with the portal.<br />\nAlso make sure they have ticked the check box &#8220;Show event in portal calendar&#8221; when creating the event.<br />\nIf it still does not work, deactivate the plugin and activate it again.<br />\nIf the plugin event-organiser-ngo get&#8217;s activated before the plugin event-organiser has ever been activated on the site, then the events will not show up in the portal calendar. This plugin is an add-on to the event-organiser plugin and can not work without it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Newly created site&#8217;s site events does not show up in the portal calendar</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please do not network activate this plugin, or use the otherwise excellent plugin Multisite plugin manager to activate this plugin on newly created sites. It seems as if this plugin gets activated before or to soon after the plugin Event-organiser gets activated. Then the settings does not get right when this plugin activates. It&#8217;s better to set Event-organiser as network-activated and activate this plugin manually after site creation.<br />\nIf above problem apears, just deactivate Event-organiser-ngo and activate it again. It should fix this issue.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

I don&#8217;t know why pluggable.php don&#8217;t get included by WordPress default.<br />\ncurrent_user_can is being called by the plugin and for some reason although capabilities.php has been loaded (which contains the current_user_can function) that function calls wp_get_current_user which is defined in pluggable.php but hasn&#8217;t been loaded when the call is made.</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Cleaned up some menu items. This code was in ngo-menu-deactivate before, but it makes more sence to have it here.<br />\nAlso changed license from GPLv2+ to GPLv3</p>\n<h4>1.1.6</h4>\n<p>Changed donation link (important stuff ðŸ˜‰ )</p>\n<h4>1.1.5</h4>\n<p>Fixed issues with generic function names.</p>\n<h4>1.1.4</h4>\n<p>Initital release on WordPress</p>\n"
