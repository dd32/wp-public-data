Even if the plugin can&#8217;t associate the cart with an email address it will at least show the IP address of the cart on the data page.</p>\n<p>Each cart starts in the &#8216;In Progress&#8217; state on the data page. If a customer hasn&#8217;t updated their cart for 15 minutes it will then show as &#8216;Abandoned&#8217;. If the shopper comes back and later completes their cart it will change to &#8216;Recovered&#8217; and be associated with the order.</p>\n<h4>Where Do I Get Support?</h4>\n<p>Email me or start a support request on WordPress.org.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to SFA Abandoned Cart under WooCommerce in the left hand menu of the WordPress dashboard to see your abandoned carts</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20associate%20carts%20with%20users%3F'>\nHow does the plugin associate carts with users?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a cart is started by a user that&#8217;s logged into your store or logs in at any point after starting the cart the plugin will automatically associate the cart with the user account. On the data page you&#8217;ll see the entry for the cart as well as the users name and email address.</p>\n<p>If a cart is started by an unknown user the plugin will show the IP address of the associated with the cart. This can be useful in the case that you&#8217;re using other software such as chat widgets because you can reference the IP address with the chat sessions.</p>\n<p>If a cart is recovered by a user but that user doesn&#8217;t create and account the plugin will still create an association with the order and show the name and email address on the cart data page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20web%20crawlers%20create%20a%20bunch%20of%20fake%20carts%3F'>\nWill web crawlers create a bunch of fake carts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses a library to filter out common web crawlers. In the case that the library doesn&#8217;t capture the crawler the plugin also has code that is able to look for patterns that indicate a crawler starting a bunch of carts and filter those carts out.</p>\n<p>If you think the plugin is filtering carts the wrong way reach out and we&#8217;d love to help out.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20support%20and%20features%3F'>\nWhat about support and features?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;d love to hear from you! We&#8217;re currently looking at ways to better report on abandoned carts as well as starting to work towards the ability to recover carts both via email as well as integrating with other services such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
