If you translate it to other language(s), please send me the .mo/.po files, and i will add it to the package.</p>\n<p><em>How Banner Garden works [detailed usage]:</em></p>\n<p>Place a shortcode anywhere in your page (see below): [bannergarden id=&#8221;xxx&#8221;]</p>\n<p>The xxx is the ID of your campaign what you found at list of campaigns page. The quotes are important!<br />\nYou have several options to insert this shortcode into your page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can add it to your posts or pages through the WordPress editor.</li>\n<li>You can use the Banner Garden widget, and place it to your sidebar(s).</li>\n<li>Edit the .php file what you want, and insert this code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, before your WordPress engine start to render the page, the plugin is search for this shortcode. If it founds, it try to process it.</p>\n<p>About the process method. The processor get out the id of the campaign. Check, is this campaign exists, if yes, check is this campaign active, and if it is active, check, is the time settings are right. If everything is all right, it check is there any banner in this campaign. If there is/are banner(s), then select one randomly, and replace the shortcode with your media.</p>\n<p>If any of above condition fails, it will show the default banner what is placed in the plugin dirs media subdirectory named “default_banner.jpg”.<br />\nThis happens only, if you did not checked out the “Show default banner if anything fails” option.</p>\n<p>I included a test falsh and a test image banner for you in this media subdirectory.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.<br />\nYou can read more about this plugin, updates, users comments at http://vaso.sma.hu/blog/banner-garden-plugin-for-wordpress/</p>\n<p>I did work very hard on this very first plugin, it tooks me 4 days, because i know wordpress only since a week.</p>\n<p>Thank You!</p>\n",
