        "faq": "<h4>How can I delete a post?</h4>\n<p>Yes, but never empty your trash or delete post from trash. Trashed posts are used to detect deleted posts.</p>\n<h4>Can I modify a tweet-post?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you can. Sync would not revert your post. Syncing is done by time. So if you modify your post, don&#8217;t touch post date and time.</p>\n<h4>Why not all my tweets are displayed?</h4>\n<p>Sometimes Twitter search returns just a portion of latest tweets. Maybe through few next tries more tweets would be found and posted.</p>\n",
