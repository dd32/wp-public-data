        "description": "<h3>SNIP &#8211; Structured Data Plugin for WordPress to create Rich Snippets and Rich Search Results</h3>\n<p>Since 2012, SNIP Structured Data has helped thousands of websites worldwide to <strong>display eye-catching search results on Google</strong> and other search engines. This gave them better visibility in search engines.</p>\n<p>Eye-catching search results, you ask? How is that possible? It&#8217;s because of little snippets of code (called Structured Data) that <strong>tell search engines exactly what kind of content they&#8217;ll find on your site.</strong> This way, they can better understand that content. Certain Structured Data snippets are displayed on search results pages as <strong>Rich Search results</strong>, a different way of displaying your content on the search engine results page (SERP).</p>\n<p>The free version allows you to add structured data to all your pages, posts or custom post types with the world&#8217;s first Structured Data Generator. So it contains everything you need to get started quickly on a standard WordPress site.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObE-t7zw5tE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h4>My story and mission</h4>\n<p>I originally developed SNIP for my own purposes. After a few months I decided to make it available to the public. After years on the market, there is finally a free version of SNIP.</p>\n<p>My mission is to provide a high performance, easy to use and powerful plugin to <strong>bring structured data (which is part of technical SEO) to any WordPress site without having knowledge about the technical details of coding.</strong> SNIP&#8217;s users range from recipe, travel, WooCommerce stores to many other custom sites.</p>\n<h4>Get ahead of the competition</h4>\n<p>Do you do SEO on your website? Of course you do! Because you need to <strong>beat the competition.</strong> Structured data is technical SEO and can help you get eye-catching search results on Google and other search engines. Obviously, <strong>good looking search results</strong> get more clicks! SNIP uses the schema.org vocabulary to create schemas that can <strong>generate so-called Rich Snippets or Rich Results</strong> in search engines. You&#8217;ll see these as star ratings, price quotes, bullet points, images, and more on search results pages.</p>\n<h4>Taking care of your Structured Data on your WordPress site</h4>\n<p>SNIP Structured Data is packed with features designed to help visitors and search engines get a deep understanding of your site&#8217;s content. Some of my favorites features are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The world&#8217;s first <strong>Structured Data Generator</strong>.</li>\n<li>Supports 30+ Schemas in the free version.</li>\n<li>Supports <strong>all schema.org schemas</strong> (currently 800+) <strong>[PRO]</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Automate schema creation</strong> with the built-in Global Snippets feature (create a schema template and play it out to any page, post or custom post type).</li>\n<li>Supports 10+ field types for use in schema templates.</li>\n<li>Supports 30+ field types for use in schema templates <strong>[PRO]</strong>.</li>\n<li>Remove old and invalid schema syntax from your WordPress site.</li>\n<li>Compatible with almost all themes.</li>\n<li>Override schema properties on a per-post basis <strong>[PRO]</strong>.</li>\n<li>Retrieve post metadata (e.g. from Advanced Custom Fields) <strong>[PRO]</strong>.</li>\n<li>Completely free Structured Data video course!</li>\n<li>Premium support from the plugin author <strong>[PRO]</strong>.</li>\n<li>Made in Germany!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Trust the expert</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m Florian (Flo for short), a freelance web developer who has been doing general web development for over 17 years. And as you might expect: I&#8217;m really passionate about what I do (who else can really claim that?). Hopefully you can feel my passion in the brand new SNIP plugin now available on wordpress.org. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h3>What users of the PRO version say</h3>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by MChav06 via CodeCanyon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the first schema plugin that allows absolute control on a post-by-post basis. Support is excellent, and Florian is always open to new ideas to implement to make the plugin even better. Definitely worth every penny and then some.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by vacuumsrus via CodeCanyon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dude seriously this plugin is worth three times what I paid for it. I tried two other plugins before this and looked over several others. Your plugin does EVERY THING all the other ones do all in one plugin. And slick too. (&#8230;) THANK YOU!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by Patrick_D via CodeCanyon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flo is just plain out awesome ðŸ™‚ Even when bouncing ideas around with him you can see that he never loses focus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by jjsolutions via CodeCanyon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At last I&#8217;ve found something that takes the stress out of creating structured data. Previously I&#8217;ve tried myself and there is always one tag out of place and it&#8217;s been impossible to get everything to pass the Google Structured Testing Tool but this plugin took the pain away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by ecoman via CodeCanyon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perfect tool for structured data.

Thanks to SNIP I have finally figured it out and now my website looks much better in Google search results. Strongly recommend!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by Azraph via CodeCanyon</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was hard to choose for which reason this plugin is the best rich snippet plugin available, it&#8217;s super customizable, the documentation is just amazingly extensive, not to mention the awsome video crash course on structured data that&#8217;s freely available on the author&#8217;s site, the customer support was, in my experience, one of the best support you could wish for. The overall quality of the product is top-notch, everything just works as it&#8217;s supposed to. Finally, this plugin is so flexible it will fit whatever your needs/setup is, you can automate and retrieve data from any field in posts_meta and even the wp_options table which practically covers any plugin and/or custom fields situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Get premium support</h3>\n<p>I offer regular support on the WordPress.org forums. But I hope you understand that I have to give priority to my premium customers.
