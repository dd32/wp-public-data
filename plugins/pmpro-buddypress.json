Select Your Preferred Registration Process</h4>\n<p>This plugin allows you to use the BuddyPress or BuddyBoss user registration process (in place of the standard Paid Memberships Pro membership checkout process).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to Memberships &gt; PMPro BuddyPress in the WordPress admin.</li>\n<li>Change the &#8220;Registration Page&#8221; setting to &#8220;Use BuddyPress Registration Page&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Save Settings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: If your membership is not free, you must use the Paid Memberships Pro membership checkout process. If you have a free community and want to allow users to register through BuddyPress or BuddyBoss, you must adjust this setting.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like members that register through the BuddyPress or BuddyBoss system to also be given a membership level, check out this guide on <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/apply-a-buddypress-member-type-on-membership-checkout-or-level-change/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">setting a default level for all user registrations in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<h4>2. Assign the &#8220;Access Restricted&#8221; Page</h4>\n<p>Navigate to Memberships &gt; Settings &gt; Pages to create or edit the &#8220;Access Restricted&#8221; page.</p>\n<p>This is the page that visitors and users are redirected to if they cannot access restricted BuddyPress or BuddyBoss features.</p>\n<h4>3. Configure Membership Level Settings</h4>\n<p>Navigate to Memberships &gt; Settings &gt; Membership Levels and locate the &#8220;BuddyPress Restrictions&#8221; section.</p>\n<p>From this section you can adjust settings for how you &#8220;unlock BuddyPress&#8221; for members of this level, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group Creation</li>\n<li>Single Group Viewing</li>\n<li>Groups Page Viewing</li>\n<li>Joining Groups</li>\n<li>Public Messaging</li>\n<li>Private Messaging</li>\n<li>Send Friend Requests</li>\n<li>Include in Member Directory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, adjust the &#8220;BuddyPress Group Membership&#8221; settings to add or invite members of this level to your existing BuddyPress Groups.</p>\n<p>If you want to adjust BuddyPress Member Types, you must first create the types through custom code. <a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/apply-a-buddypress-member-type-on-membership-checkout-or-level-change/?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">This post explains how to add Member Types to BuddyPress</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/buddypress-integration/#members?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read our full documentation on Membership Level Settings for your BuddyPress or BuddyBoss community here</a>.</p>\n<h4>4. Configure Settings for Logged in Non Members</h4>\n<p>Some of your WordPress users may not have a membership level in Paid Memberships Pro. This plugin allows you to set how BuddyPress should be locked down for these users without a membership level.</p>\n<p>Navigate to Memberships &gt; Settings &gt; PMPro BuddyPress and locate the &#8220;Non-member User Settings&#8221; section.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/buddypress-integration/#non_member_user?utm_source=wordpress-org&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=pmpro-buddypress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read our full documentation on Non-Member Users in BuddyPress or BuddyBoss here</a>.</p>\n",
