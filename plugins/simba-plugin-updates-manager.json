This can be for free plugins, or licensed plugins &#8211; it includes a full licence manager (and a free class for using it is available).</p>\n<p>This is the plugin updates server that has been providing millions of plugin updates to the users of the paid versions of <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the UpdraftPlus backup/restore/clone WordPress plugin</a> since 2013 (and various other <a href=\"https://teamupdraft.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Team Updraft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Simba Hosting plugins</a>).</p>\n<p>A paid connector for WooCommerce is also available, allowing WordPress to automatically assign and renew licences when purchases are made; plus other features for coupons and renewal emails (including pre-filled carts); <a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/plugin-updates-licensing-and-renewals-manager-woocommerce-connector/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">follow this link for more information.</a></p>\n<p>The best way to get a feel for its features is to take a look at the available screenshots.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Manage multiple plugins, both free and paid</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manage user licences &#8211; create, renew and delete licence entitlements for non-free plugins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send renewal reminder emails for licensed plugins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have multiple different zips (i.e. different plugin versions) available for your plugins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have sophisticated rules for which zip a particular user gets delivered (e.g. send them an older version if they are on an old version of WordPress or PHP)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Counts plugin downloads, by version &#8211; calculate how many active users you have</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortcode provided for showing users on your website what plugins are available</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortcode provided for showing plugin changelogs (automatically read from the plugin zip)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data is included in WordPress&#8217;s privacy tools&#8217; output (export / delete)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Import a new zip via WP-CLI: wp plugins-manager import-zip &#8211;file=&#8221;/path/to/file.zip&#8221; &#8211;user=&#8221;your-WP-user&#8221; &#8211;add-rule</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update plugins&#8217; supported WordPress versions via WP-CLI:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>wp plugins-manager update-versions &#8211;user=&#8221;WordPress-username-or-email-or-id&#8221; &#8211;slug=&#8221;plugin-slug&#8221; &#8211;tested-version=&#8221;version-number(x.y.z)&#8221;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wp plugins-manager update_versions &#8211;user=&#8221;WordPress-username-or-email-or-id&#8221; &#8211;current-wp-version=&#8221;version-number(x.y.z)&#8221; &#8211;tested-version=&#8221;version-number(x.y.z)&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Running an updates and an licensing server are two important parts of providing plugin updates to your users. You will also need to add code in your plugin to point towards that updates server. A popular class used for this purpose with free plugins, that requires you to do nothing more than include it and tell it the updates URL, is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker</a> .

It also integrates with WordPress&#8217;s privacy tools (4.9.6+) for export/deletion, and removes user data when users are deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some other plugins you may be interested in: <a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/</a>, <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://updraftplus.com</a> and <a href=\"https://getwpo.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://getwpo.com</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This plugin is ready for translations, and we would welcome new translations (please use <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/simba-plugin-updates-manager\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the wordpress.org translation system</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>The MIT License (MIT)</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2015- David Anderson, https://www.simbahosting.co.uk</p>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &#8220;Software&#8221;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

        "changelog": "<h4>1.11.10 &#8211; 2024-08-10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a semaphore lock to the renewal reminder process to prevent duplicate runs when WP cron misbehaves</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Resolve some PHP 8 dynamic property deprecations</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Now requires PHP 7.4+ (previously 7.3+)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.9 &#8211; 2024-01-17</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent an unwanted PHP notice introduced in 1.11.8 when handling expired licences</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add an extra parameter to the action updraftmanager_add_new_zip_go</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Remove use of dynamic properties in UpdraftManager_Manage_Zips</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Change how markdown is parsed to prevent HTML tags written raw in the readme from being shown when using the [udmanager_changelog] shortcode</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.8 &#8211; 2023-10-23</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: An issue was discovered that could allow a user to download a plugin that he was not entitled to; all users of this manager plugin will want to update to prevent this. To do this, the user had to have an active login on the website running the manager plugin.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a note in the user interface clarifying how the &#8220;add-ons&#8221; setting works when the user has no add-ons (the &#8220;base&#8221; (i.e. no add-ons) plugin is always free). This intended behaviour has been the same since the first release of this manager plugin, but was not officially noted anywhere. (It can be over-ridden with the new filter updraftmanager_downloadable_base_plugin).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.6 &#8211; 2023-09-28</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Add a zip comment to uploaded/created zip files was causing a fatal error</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduced a requirement for WP 5.6+ (for the site this plugin runs on &#8211; this does not affect what requirements you have for plugins you are distributing through it).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.5 &#8211; 2023-09-25</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent a PHP notice due to an undefined variable</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a zip comment to uploaded/created zip files</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add the filter updraftmanager_plugin_deliverzip_delivered to make it more convenient for developers to over-ride the final delivery method</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Bumped required PHP version to 7.3</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated phpseclib 2.0 and soundasleep/html2text libraries to latest releases (the latter of which adds PHP 8.2 support)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.4 &#8211; 2022-09-16</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated phpseclib 2.0 library to the current release</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated soundasleep/html2text library to the 2.0 series for improved PHP 8 compatibility</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated michelf/php-markdown library to the current development version to restore PHP 8 functionality (needed for the changelog shortcode)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Bumped required PHP version to 7.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.3 &#8211; 2022-09-14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: autologin_user method needs to be static for third-party plugin to call it (without a fatal error on PHP 8.0+)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.2 &#8211; 2022-02-22</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When an entitlement is claimed, update the &#8220;last check-in&#8221; field (i.e. don&#8217;t wait for first updates check)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.1 &#8211; 2022-02-14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Daily cron now checks and removes expired SID tokens from the user meta table and all plugin&#8217;s cached files that over a week old</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Replace unnecessarily noisy error_log() when a site authenticated via site ID with an action updraftmanager_authenticated_via_sid (in case someone did want the info).</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update bundled phpseclib library</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Increase init priority value, so that other plugins running on the same hook will run first</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.11.0 &#8211; 2021-10-02</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Replace brace syntax that is no longer allowed in PHP 8.0 in php-markdown-extra library</li>\n<li>FIX: Bulk plugin deletion not working</li>\n<li>FEATURE: New WP-CLI command (import-zip) to import plugin&#8217;s zip file locally</li>\n<li>FEATURE: New WP-CLI command (update-versions) to update plugins&#8217; supported WordPress versions (minimum and tested versions) for the latest version of the available zip file</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Port from previous semaphore classes to Updraft_Semaphore_3_0</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add logic to ignore &#8216;x-spm-duplicate&#8217; header from being issued when home URL is found to be different from network site URL</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a class and wrappers to the download link for easier styling</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Now that PHP 8.0 is released, bump the PHP requirement (for this plugin &#8211; doesn&#8217;t affect plugins distributed through it) to PHP 7.1+</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Adjust a method signature that caused a deprecation notice on PHP 8.0</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update bundled phpseclib library to 2.0.33</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.19 &#8211; 2020-11-05</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix fatal error in 1.10.18 when sending out emails, due to renamed class</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.18 &#8211; 2020-10-30</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Update jQuery document ready style to the one not deprecated in jQuery 3.0</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updated soundasleep/html2text library so as to lose create_function() call (which is gone in PHP 8)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Now requires PHP 7.0 or greater, as required by updated library</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.17 &#8211; 2020-09-28</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: The public Updraft_Manager_Plugin::get_user_entitlements() method, and related updraftmanager_get_plugin_info_entitlements_pre_processing filter now return an array with keys &#8216;addons&#8217; and &#8216;support&#8217; (instead of 0 and 1). If you were directly hooking into those, you will need to modify your code.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add the url_normalised value to what is returned from get_user_addon_entitlements() and (by inheritance) related functions</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Updraft_Manager_Plugin::db_set_last_checkin() now throws an exception, as it should never be called (legacy method)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Return x-spm-duplicate-of in the result if the licence appears to be deployed on multiple sites (e.g. site was cloned)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent a PHP notice being logged in the short-lived 1.10.16</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.15 &#8211; 2020-09-21</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduced a requirement for WP 5.5+ (for the site this plugin runs on &#8211; this does not affect what requirements you have for plugins you are distributing through it). We assume that plugin authors keep their installs updated, so don&#8217;t want to waste time on verifying backwards compatibility for WP 5.5+ PHPMailer changes.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Introduced a requirement for PHP 5.6+ (for the site this plugin runs on &#8211; this does not affect what requirements you have for plugins you are distributing through it)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Changed code that interacts directly with PHPMailer for WP 5.5+ compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.14 &#8211; 2020-09-17</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When a site provides multiple plugins, the &#8220;User Entitlements&#8221; admin page will now display all those with entitlements before those that don&#8217;t.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update phpseclib version to latest 2.0 series release</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.13 &#8211; 2020-09-04</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Update phpseclib version to latest 2.0 series release</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Do not echo back the slug name on the udmanager_changelog_slug parameter when it was not found (N.B. no security implications, as the output was properly escaped)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.12 &#8211; 2020-06-15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: In-dashboard download was emitting an incorrect Content-Length: header</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.11 &#8211; 2020-04-30</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: &#8216;udmanager_send_reminder&#8217; filter is now includes the user id, to allow email reminders to be filtered on a per user basis</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.10 &#8211; 2020-04-21</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent unwanted PHP notices due to wp_mail filter being called with unexpected parameter type when sending HTML mail</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Marked as supporting WP 4.8+ (nothing has changed to make it incompatible, but this is the support requirement)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.9 &#8211; 2019-11-13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix a regression in the introduction of database cacheing that could cause the licence display in admin screens to not update straight away</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.8 &#8211; 2019-11-05</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix a regression in 1.10.6 which could cause licences to not be correctly fetched from the database when displaying a list of licences for all plugins on sites serving multiple plugins</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Switch from get_user_by() to WP_User::get_data_by() to eliminate an unnecessary SELECT of usermeta on a plugin update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.6 &#8211; 2019-10-29</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Perform one less SQL SELECT query per update check</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Perform one less transient lookup (resulting in two less SQL SELECT queries if using the database as the transient store) per update check</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Use WPDB::query() instead of WPDB::update() to update last check-in times, resulting in suppression of an unwanted SHOW FULL COLUMNS query</li>\n<li>PERFORMANCE: The above tweaks, on an optimised setup, result in the total lifetime of an update check performing 8 SQL queries (if using the database for transients) or 6 (if not) instead of the previous 12 or 8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.5 &#8211; 2019-10-12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Set the Return-Path: header on outgoing renewal reminder emails</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.4 &#8211; 2019-07-17</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add filter updraftmanager_manage_user_page_before_entitlements_prepare_additional_data</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.3 &#8211; 2019-04-29</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Added an action run upon entitlement updating</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.10.1 &#8211; 2019-04-13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Add the ability to download past zips from the administrative interface</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Marked as supporting WP 4.5+ (nothing has changed to make it incompatible, but this is the support requirement)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Marked as supporting WP 5.2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.27 &#8211; 2019-03-28</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notices in some cases of checks on expired licences</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.26 &#8211; 2019-03-09</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Will now allow users with no account to see the recent version number and tested until WP version, providing an incentive to connect or renew</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Use version_compare(), not strcmp(), for sorting in tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.25 &#8211; 2019-02-28</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TRANSLATIONS: Change translation domain to match plugin slug for compatibility with the wordpress.org translation system</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add function visibility markers in the list table classes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.23 &#8211;

2019-01-22</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Handle richer info via the udmanager_get_orders filter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.19 &#8211; 2019-01-07</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Prevent PHP notices when a user in the licence table no longer exists in WordPress</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Update the bundled phpseclib version to 2.0.13</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.18 &#8211; 2018-12-10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: When both expired and non-expired add-ons existed on the same site, the version number calculation failed to take the status into account</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Now marking as requiring WP 4.3+ (it&#8217;ll still work on earlier, but this is the official support requirement)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Enhance the prune_expired_entitlements() method to handle add-on as well as support entitlements</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.17 &#8211; 2018-12-05</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Supplement the filter updraftmanager_get_plugin_info_user_addons_pre_processing with the more flexible updraftmanager_get_plugin_info_entitlements_pre_processing</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Allow the updraftmanager_get_plugin_info_user_addons_pre_processing filter to first view details of expired support requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9.15 &#8211;

To be exploitable, your site would need to have a second vulnerability in another PHP component, that performed unsafe actions on object creation. The transport format has now been updated to JSON. If your updates server has download rules depending on client site information (e.g. WP/PHP versions), then after updating, if your server is running an earlier version than PHP 7 (which is the first version to allow safe handling of serialized data), you will need to update the client updater class (https://github.com/DavidAnderson684/simba-plugin-manager-updater) to a version from 8th April 2016 onwards, in order to send this data in the new format. (You can also set the filter updraftmanager_process_old_siteinfo_format to be (bool)true to continue the old, unsafe behaviour, if you must and are confident that your site has no object creation vulnerabilities &#8211; which would be very hard to audit). If your site has no such download rules, then after updating this plugin, updating the client-side class does not matter, since the potentially unsafe data is ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.15 &#8211; 2016-03-11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: The date-picker/reset button on the admin licence management page stopped working after editing entitlements, until you refreshed the page</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Display the user ID directly on the licence page (instead of reading it from the URL bar)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.14 &#8211; 2016-02-22</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Tweak format that data is sent back in upon connect (remains backwards-compatible)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.13 &#8211; 2016-02-06</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Mark a method static</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.12 &#8211; 2016-01-27</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a filter to allow modification of returned plugin_info calls</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Send back JSON with the correct MIME type when returning plugin_info calls</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.11 &#8211; 2016-01-20</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Add an extra parameter to a public function, allowing item renewals specified in &#8220;months from now&#8221; style to be skipped if they are already later than the specified time</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.10 &#8211; 2015-12-03</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: &#8220;Send emails from&#8221; setting was not taking effect (default was always used)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Trim invalid non-numeric values entered for renewal reminder days setting</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add action to allow insertion of content on the user entitlement management page</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.8 &#8211; 2015-11-26</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: New downloads were not being recorded in the download summary</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Provide extra filter when checking renewals, for more flexibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.7 &#8211; 2015-11-20</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Log all PHP events during renewal reminder email run</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Added urlparameters code to renewal emails, for connection plugins to replace with URL parameters for auto-adding products to cart</li>\n<li>TWEAK: When auto-logging in a user, include the $user parameter on the wp_login action</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add a filter for the maximum number of renewal mails sent when in debug mode (defaults to 1)</li>\n<li>FIX: Fix conflict with WP Better Emails when sending outgoing mail</li>\n<li>FIX: The user unsubscribe option, set by connectors, was not being honoured</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.5 &#8211; 2015-11-12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>SPEED: No longer write a transient on every updates check</li>\n<li>SPEED: Introduce SIMBA_PLUGINS_MANAGER_LOCKDOWN constant &#8211; define this to true to prevent updating the &#8220;last checked-in&#8221; field for a licence (useful if under heavy load)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Changed one of the filters to make it more flexible</li>\n<li>FIX: Fix mishandling of parameters in db_get_all_entitlements method</li>\n<li>FIX: Fix a bug introduced in 1.5.4 that prevented plugins being deleted</li>\n<li>FIX: Fix bug introduced in 1.5.4 in the granting of new support entitlements</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.5.4 &#8211; 2015-11-09</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURES: This is now a full version of the plugin, identical to that used on commercial sites.

This can be for free plugins, or licensed plugins &#8211; it includes a full licence manager (and a free class for using it is available).</p>\n<p>This is the plugin updates server that has been providing millions of plugin updates to the users of the paid versions of <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the UpdraftPlus backup/restore/clone WordPress plugin</a> since 2013 (and various other <a href=\"https://teamupdraft.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Team Updraft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Simba Hosting plugins</a>).</p>\n<p>A paid connector for WooCommerce is also available, allowing WordPress to automatically assign and renew licences when purchases are made; plus other features for coupons and renewal emails (including pre-filled carts); <a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/plugin-updates-licensing-and-renewals-manager-woocommerce-connector/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">follow this link for more information.</a></p>\n<p>The best way to get a feel for its features is to take a look at the available screenshots.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Manage multiple plugins, both free and paid</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Manage user licences &#8211; create, renew and delete licence entitlements for non-free plugins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send renewal reminder emails for licensed plugins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have multiple different zips (i.e. different plugin versions) available for your plugins</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have sophisticated rules for which zip a particular user gets delivered (e.g. send them an older version if they are on an old version of WordPress or PHP)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Counts plugin downloads, by version &#8211; calculate how many active users you have</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortcode provided for showing users on your website what plugins are available</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Shortcode provided for showing plugin changelogs (automatically read from the plugin zip)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data is included in WordPress&#8217;s privacy tools&#8217; output (export / delete)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Import a new zip via WP-CLI: wp plugins-manager import-zip &#8211;file=&#8221;/path/to/file.zip&#8221; &#8211;user=&#8221;your-WP-user&#8221; &#8211;add-rule</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update plugins&#8217; supported WordPress versions via WP-CLI:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>wp plugins-manager update-versions &#8211;user=&#8221;WordPress-username-or-email-or-id&#8221; &#8211;slug=&#8221;plugin-slug&#8221; &#8211;tested-version=&#8221;version-number(x.y.z)&#8221;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wp plugins-manager update_versions &#8211;user=&#8221;WordPress-username-or-email-or-id&#8221; &#8211;current-wp-version=&#8221;version-number(x.y.z)&#8221; &#8211;tested-version=&#8221;version-number(x.y.z)&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Running an updates and an licensing server are two important parts of providing plugin updates to your users. You will also need to add code in your plugin to point towards that updates server. A popular class used for this purpose with free plugins, that requires you to do nothing more than include it and tell it the updates URL, is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker</a> . For licenced plugins, a compatible class is available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/DavidAnderson684/simba-plugin-manager-updater\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/DavidAnderson684/simba-plugin-manager-updater</a> .</p>\n<h4>Other information</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Privacy: The plugin does not contact any remote services. It also integrates with WordPress&#8217;s privacy tools (4.9.6+) for export/deletion, and removes user data when users are deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some other plugins you may be interested in: <a href=\"https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/shop/</a>, <a href=\"https://updraftplus.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://updraftplus.com</a> and <a href=\"https://getwpo.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://getwpo.com</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This plugin is ready for translations, and we would welcome new translations (please use <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/simba-plugin-updates-manager\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the wordpress.org translation system</a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>The MIT License (MIT)</p>\n<p>Copyright © 2015- David Anderson, https://www.simbahosting.co.uk</p>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &#8220;Software&#8221;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
