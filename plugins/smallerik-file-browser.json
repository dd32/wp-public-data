However, there are a lot of features to explore.<br />\nFor example, if you want the same post or page to display a different repository for each user viewing it, you can add a command option specifying that the repository should be user-dependent.<br />\nYou achieve this by simply writing: [wpfib repo=&#8217;USERBOUND&#8217;] inside the post or page. This will create a separate folder for each user from the same post or page.</p>\n<p>As an example, this arrangement is useful if you intend to provide file access in a school website, where pupils can access their own repository where to upload homework and download corrections or other personal files.<br />\nThe teacher could access all areas by setting a repository to the top folder (above all personal areas).<br />\nIn a different context, a project team leader could share files with people involved in the project, perhaps even giving different access levels to each team member.</p>\n<p>You can easily customize the plugin behavior or appearance by modifying how to display files and folders or the overall look &amp; feel of the repository.</p>\n<p>Most parameters have an equivalent override option, so that you can modify one or more parameters&#8217; values on a specific repository.<br />\nFor example you can have a &#8216;static&#8217; repository on one page and a user-dependent repository on another one.</p>\n",
