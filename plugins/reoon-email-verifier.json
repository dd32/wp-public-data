It will also notify the submitter to use a different email address.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20it%20can%20take%20to%20verify%20an%20email%20address%3F'>\nHow long it can take to verify an email address?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Verification will take less than 0.5 second in Quick mode. On the other hand, the verification time for the Power mode depends on the response time of their email server, which can also be limited by providing a timeout value.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20will%20happen%20if%20the%20account%20run%20out%20of%20credits%3F'>\nWhat will happen if the account run out of credits?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In such cases email submissions will not be checked by the plugin and every submitted email addresses will be accepted (as like our plugin is not installed).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20gdpr%20compliant%3F'>\nIs it GDPR compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, all data is encrypted and automatically deleted after 15 days of submission, ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
