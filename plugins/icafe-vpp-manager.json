        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>iCafe VPP Manager</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Watch the training videos located in the iCafe VPP Plugin main screen</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin settings according to the videos and your needs</li>\n<li>Create a page with the [icafe_VPP] shortcode</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>How do I get started?</h4>\n<p>Activate the plugin and watch the videos located on the plugin&#8217;s main page.</p>\n<h4>Can I watch the videos without installing the plugin?</h4>\n<p>Sure, you can visit http://chrisnilsson.com/vpp to view the videos before installing the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Does the enterprise password comply with Apple&#8217;s Terms of Use?</h4>\n<p>Yes, Apple allows organizations to maintain the ownership of apps purchased under VPP provide the codes are redeemed under an enterprise owned account. Normally, this is accomplished with the Apple Configurator utility. This is a good solution if you have the ability to physically sync every iOS device with a Mac computer every time an app code needs to be redeemed. The other method is to allow end users to redeem codes under the enterprise account. This involves sharing the enterprise credentials. For large organizations, this may not be a desirable approach. The iCafe VPP Manager allows you to share the enterprise credentials securely with staff members and provides an automated method for changing the password on a schedule</p>\n<h4>How do I signup for VPP</h4>\n<p>Please visit the Apple VPP site http://www.apple.com/education/volume-purchase-program/</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin allow me to reuse codes?</h4>\n<p>No, codes can only be physically redeemed once. But, because they were redeemed under a single account you can reinstall from the purchased apps section of iTunes in the event a device is reset or an app needs to be transferred. As an organization, you are responsible for ensuring that users do not install more copies than they purchased. Apple has &#8220;Terms of Use&#8221; but does not enforce compliance at a technical level. This plugin takes the same approach.</p>\n<h4>How do I make sure only staff have access to app requests or the enterprise password?</h4>\n<p>The front end of the iCafe VPP Manager is only available for WordPress users who have subscriber rights or higher.</p>\n<h4>What other roles do users need?</h4>\n<p>Your Program Administrators will need to be contributors or higher.</p>\n<h4>How do I get my entire staff into WordPress as subscribers?</h4>\n<p>While we can&#8217;t make specific recommendations for your environment, we have been successful both with a custom utility to directly upload users into the WordPress Database as well as a direct integration with our Active Directory via a WordPress LDAP plugin (AuthLDAP)</p>\n<h4>What do you know about VPP and iOS</h4>\n<p>I currently manage over 10,000 iOS devices for a 30,000 student K-12 district. My staff of 10 instructional technology specialists have deployed over $10,000 worth of apps using the iCafe VPP Manager. You can learn more about us from our technology integration site http://icafe.lcisd.org.</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m so confused&#8230;can you help us?</h4>\n<p>Apple VPP is confusing and managing iOS deployments is worse. While this plugin seeks to simplify the process for end users, the Program Manager must set it up correctly. Reach out to me on twitter @chrisnilsson or via the plugin support page for simple questions about configuration. For help designing a massive iOS deployment including Apps and Mobile Device Management please email me at chrisdnilsson@gmail.com for consulting rates.</p>\n<h4>This is close to what we need but I wish it would&#8230;</h4>\n<p>Please reach out to me on Twitter @chrisnilsson with suggestions. I&#8217;m always making improvements!</p>\n",
