However the URL contains the user email address and if your theme sidebar has Google ads in it, these ads can see the user email and thus persons identity is revealed. That&#8217;s why Subscribe to Comments Relaoaded Better Unsubscribe loads a bare bones template for the subscription manager only. This is an important fix until Subscribe to Comments Reloaded gets fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New cron function which automatically unsubscribes all users (emails) which are bounced, invalid , spam or unsubscribed at Sendgrid.com. Read the installation guide.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix for Subscribe to Comments Reloaded &#8211; since this plugin puts up wrong shortlink and canonical link for the management page, Subscribe to Comments Reloaded Better Unsubscribed removes these links from this virtual management page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement &#8211; &#8220;This notification was sent to {email}.&#8221; text added at the end of notification email. It&#8217;s handy if you get spam reports for your comment notifications. Some mail servers hide the &#8220;from&#8221; address, so you don&#8217;t know who reported your notification as a spam and you can&#8217;t unsubscribe him.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix &#8211; post ID was sometimes not properly obtained, resulting in no unsubscribe action</li>\n<li>Bugfix &#8211; the subscription is now only suspended, rather than being suspended and unconfirmed at the same time. That makes it easier to re-subscribe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix &#8211; better checking of what links in emails get adjusted</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
