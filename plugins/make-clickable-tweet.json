        "installation": "<p>Using the plugin is pretty dang simple, as the function only has one parameter: the content you wanted returned in a clickable form. To use the plugin, simply activate it then start using the function in your templates like so:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php make_clickable_tweet($tweetcontent); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, that above function will simply return the tweet content, if you&#8217;d like to display it in your templates you might want to toss an echo in front there.</p>\n<p>If you want to be super-duper safe (and smart), you might want to wrap the whole thing</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nif (function_exists('make_clickable_tweet'))\n{\nmake_clickable_tweet($tweetcontent);\n}\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n",
