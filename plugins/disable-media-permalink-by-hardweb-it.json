The plugin never write anything to your wordpress database, so it is 100% safe to use!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20restore%20all%20media%20permalink%3F'>\nCan I restore all media permalink?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, You can do it with a single click!<br />\n* Simply disable or uninstall the plugin<br />\n* Your permalink structure and all previous permalink will work again.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
