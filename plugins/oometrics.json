Push new prices, popup, coupons and &#8230; remotely and per customer, individually!</p>\n<h4>REALTIME Analytics and Reporting</h4>\n<p>Sessions are everything, they have values, You can count on them! Every customer&#8217;s visit will be a session and every activity adds a value to the session. Add to cart, checkout page and &#8230; have different values. Values define which session is important to interact! OOMetrics provides user activities, shopping profile, digital profile and tools to communicate. All events will be stored in database for further analysis.</p>\n<h4>Interactions is possible, even per customer</h4>\n<p>You can push Discounts, Coupons and Popups to any session instantly and for each session INDIVIDUALLY. Only the customer selected will see the price changes and other features! You can even pop a chat too. As mentioned, sessions worth following (by values provided), can be converted to sales with instant decisions using push feature.</p>\n<h4>Individually means,  Individually!!</h4>\n<p>Most OOMetrics features can be limited to specific product or specific customer! When you send a pop up for specific session, then content will be available only for that session; Or sale prices! you can change the price for specific product and for specific session! NOBODY ELSE CAN SEE THOSE CHANGES! By the way, you can apply some of them globally through shortcuts!</p>\n<h4>OOMetrics Communication using Live Chat</h4>\n<p>There is a live chat system which is connected to other features. Chat can be started by customer or the shop manager. They can have attachments and for logged in users they will be stored as conversations.</p>\n<h3>Pop Ups! Dynamic, Remote and Per Customer Ones!</h3>\n<p>In OOMetrics, you can build new pop ups right away or save it as template. OOMetrics even has a shortcut for it on every live session! You can send or just write and build one right away as a pop up! In most cases it is better to pop a chat :). BTW, delivery and click rates will be calculated for further analytics and it supports Widgets as content.</p>\n<h3>Push stuff to the session and for each session individually!</h3>\n<p>Push what to the session?! OK, lets define &#8220;push&#8221; :<br />\n&#8220;In OOMetrics push is a new state which will be send to a specific session to do what is it made to do! New prices, New settings or new content; Dynamically, remotely and individually! You can define a lifetime for each push like apply for 1 hour or to the end of session! it can be canceled anytime though!&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Push Sale Price, Specifically or Globally</h3>\n<p>This is absolutely odd! You can change product prices dynamically! Sometimes it is obvious from user behavior that  the price is an issue and you can do something about it! so with OOMetrics, you can do it right away or apply a global sale price to whole store for this specific session only</p>\n<h3>Coupons for Cart of somebody!</h3>\n<p>Sure, when you can change prices, and send pop ups dynamically, you can apply a WooCommerce coupons for specific session!</p>\n<h3>What about Cart Content!</h3>\n<p>What about it? üôÇ Of course you can add / edit / remove items from any cart you want remotely, But please use it carefully; The customer may panic.</p>\n<h3>Powerfull UI/UX &#8211; All In ONE</h3>\n<p>Storing user activity is serious and we optimized it. All the features are accessible on only one page! Some of the features have shortcuts too, to speed things up!</p>\n<h4>All in ONE</h4>\n<p>We designed a software which provides a solution! Powerful features, modern approach and quality UI/UX are parts of it! You have your WooCommerce store statistics, customer activities and a push panel all in one page to give you speed. Customer digital info, shopping info and activities alongside powerfull chat and instant push system will give you the tools and speed to interact.  Mix your customer activity, shopping history and dynamic content to increase your customer retention.</p>\n<h3>Key Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Store Analytics + Website Statistics</li>\n<li>Customer activities</li>\n<li>Customer shoopping profile info</li>\n<li>Customer digital profile info</li>\n<li>Online Chat connected to user info and activities</li>\n<li>Push sale price to any user for any product, individually, remotely</li>\n<li>Push and apply coupon to any user for defined time, remotely</li>\n<li>Send dynamic popups remotely, individually</li>\n<li>Add / Edit / Delete cart items remotely</li>\n<li>Shortcuts for speed</li>\n<li>Report dashboard</li>\n<li>Minimal UI Powerfull features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>= Version 1.2 &#8211; Major Update<br />\nOOMetrics is now on version 1.2 which works like a charm.
