One of these is available in the <em>Wolfe Candy Tool Suite</em></p>\n<p><em>Syntax: [show_content_to role=&#8221;xxxxxx&#8221;] [show-tree]&#8230;&#8230; only this role can see the tree view &#8230;.. [/show_content_to]</em></p>\n<p>Use a plugin such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpfront-user-role-editor/\" title=\"Role Editor\" rel=\"ugc\">WPFront User Role Editor</a> to create different roles and then assign the roles using the user editor. User Editors can be a bit clunky so there is a design in the studio for a Wolfe Candy User Extension plugin so watch this space.</p>\n<p>This can be used to make ANY content private including shortcode blocks, buttons, links, images &#8230;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20plug-in%20commercially%3F'>\nCan I use the plug-in commercially?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, although actually monetising the plugins requires a commercial discussion with us. Please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:&#x77;o&#108;&#x66;e&#099;&#x61;&#110;&#100;&#x79;&#064;&#114;&#x75;&#114;&#097;&#x6c;&#099;&#104;&#x65;&#115;&#104;&#x69;&#114;&#101;&#x2e;&#099;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#117;&#x6b;\" title=\"Wolfe Candy Support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wolfecandy@ruralcheshire.co.uk</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20my%20file%20and%20folder%20tree%20view%20blank%3F'>\nWhy is my file and folder tree view blank?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If using tree view with file and folder functionality you will only be able to list or show links to files and structures that the web server has sufficient permissions granted by the underlying file structure to do so. If the web server does not have access then it will not show any node that it does not have access to. If there are no permissions or an incorrect path is passed then the tree may be blank.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20tree%20view%20to%20show%20the%20structure%20of%20xml%20documents%3F'>\nHow do I use the tree view to show the structure of XML documents?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The tree view can have the source of the structure passed to it from another plugin in Windows path format.<br />\nAn XML parser plugin such as the one available in the <em>Wolfe Candy Tool Suite</em> integrates with tree view.<br />\nThis has specific shortcodes to import XML and output it in tree view format.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
