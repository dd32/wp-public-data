Even so, there are just too many variables. It&#8217;s inevitable that this plugin will break someone&#8217;s design on the Layers page only (as everything is self-contained), so I&#8217;ll be available to support you by either adding updates to the plugin or offering you custom CSS for your unique situation.</p>\n"
