Is there a settings screen to enable/configure it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can simply enable this to disable these notifications. Deactivating the plugin then has it resume default behavior. A simple implementation that&#8217;s quick &amp; easy to utilize. Consider enabling/disabling the plugin the setting for whether or not these email notifications are disabled or not.</p>\n<p>Also, this does let notifications about failed updates to be delivered by default as they can be important.

These two plugins can work together to remove all these notifications (hence why this doesn&#8217;t also remove core update notifications). Meanwhile, one can use one or the other if a specific set of emails is desired to be blocked (ex. I personally like the core update notifications since they&#8217;re not too frequent while potentially being substantial so I keep those enabled while I then just use this plugin to disable the more frequent &amp; typically less impactful plugin and theme update notifications.)</p>\n</p>\n\n",
