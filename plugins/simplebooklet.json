Once you have made your simplebooklet, add it to your wordpress website or blog using the following steps.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for and then activate the Simplebooklet plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress (you only need to do this once).</li>\n<li>In Simplebooklet, open the PUBLISH tab for the Simplebooklet you want to embed.</li>\n<li>Tap the WordPress button in the EMBED ON WEBSITE menu.</li>\n<li>Copy the WordPress Shortcode.</li>\n<li>Paste the WordPress Shortcode anywhere in your WordPress Post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed the plugin, you only need to follow steps 2 thru 5 to add more booklets. You can add as many Simplebooklets as you want.</p>\n<p>The shortcode looks like this: <code>[simplebooklet src=\"{booklet embed url}\" width=\"{booklet width}\" height=\"{booklet height}\"]</code></p>\n<p>The width and height are the native size of the simplebooklet. The width will scale to fit the display area but the height will stay fixed to the native height. You may be too high for your display area. You can change the height to better fit your page display area by adjusting the height in the shortcode. It may take a few times to figure out the right height that works for your page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simplebooklet/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">All Iframe params</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://simplebooklet.com/wordpress/simplebooklet/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Iframe plugin page</a></p>\n",
