        "description": "<p>TendoPay is an online service that allows users shop online more easily and spread their purchases across multiple installments. Many online users in the Philippines do not have access to credit cards or alternate payment methods therefore their experience of shopping online can be difficult. TendoPay as a service provides users a set amount of credit upon successful application that they can then use to go shopping on all TendoPay partner merchants. Users can then easily select TendoPay as a safe and secure payment option on check-out. In addition users have the ability to manage their account from anywhere &#8211; desktop, mobile or tablet through the TendoPay admin panel. The service was built to help provide users a more flexible payment method suited for timing that works for them.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Details</h4>\n<p>The single core-functionality of this plugin allows for an online merchant to add TendoPay as a check-out payment method. Installation is quick and easy and upon completion an end user will see TendoPay as a payment option next to other payments gateways such as Visa, Mastercard or Paypal. Once a user selects TendoPay as their payment option, the user will be re-directed to the TendoPay platform where they will need to login. Upon successful login, the user will see the purchase they\\&#8217;re trying to make along with all the product details. They can then select the re-payment instalments plan they would like and approve the purchase. Once the purchase is successfully processed the user receives a confirmation from the online merchant and the TendoPay platform. The TendoPay platform provides the user with a receipt and agreed re-payment terms. The value for the online merchant is that TendoPay immediately pays the merchant on behalf of the user so TendoPay takes on the purchase risk.</p>\n<h4>Account</h4>\n<p>To create an account, Merchants who want to use TendoPay can contact our customer support team who will assist in a quick installation and help activate you as an active merchant on our platform.
