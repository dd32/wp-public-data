For taxonomy filters, order by ID, Name, Slug, Count, or Include Order. For post-author filters, order by ID, Name, Count, or Include Order. For post-meta filters, order by Value, Label, or Count.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Include/Exclude Options:</strong> For taxonomy filters, include or exclude specific terms.

Additionally, use tooltip icons beside the filter titles to provide additional information about each filter option when users hover over them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Search Field:</strong> Include a search field for quick navigation through the filter options.

The toggle allows users to expand or collapse the filter options, reducing clutter and improving usability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Max Height of Filter Block:</strong> Set the maximum height of a filter block to limit the number of visible filter options. This feature helps users show more filters within a specific height, enhancing the browsing experience and avoiding overwhelming displays.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Color/Image Swatches:</strong> Enhance the visual appeal of your filter options by <a href=\"https://wptools.io/docs/wc-ajax-product-filter/common/color-image-swatches/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free+plugin+listing&amp;utm_campaign=WCAPF+Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">displaying them using color or image swatches</a>. For color swatches, the plugin looks for the color first and, if not found, displays the image. The color swatch data includes the primary color and secondary color, when both exist in the swatch data it enables the color gradient which is a more comprehensive visual representation. For image swatches, the data includes the image ID. For the <strong>popular variation swatches plugins</strong> the swatch data can be obtained from term meta automatically. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll need to manually input the filter options and configure the swatch data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Advanced Filtering Functionality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Variable Product Filtering Support:</strong> Ensure seamless filtering for variable products, including support for attribute lookup tables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ajax Pagination:</strong> Enable seamless browsing with Ajax-based pagination, allowing customers to navigate through filtered results without page reloads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Active Filters Display:</strong> Showcase the active filters prominently above the product loop, making it easy for customers to see and modify their selections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Active Sorting Option:</strong> Enable AJAX for the default product sorting dropdown and display the active sorting option in the active filters section.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Easy Integration</h3>\n<p>Effortlessly integrate the filters into your store using a single widget or shortcode. The plugin allows you to create filters by creating a form and adding filters inside it. The flexibility of the plugin allows you to create unlimited forms and filters according to your specific needs. By using the &#8220;<strong>Available on</strong>&#8221; setting, you can precisely determine where the filters should be displayed. Simply add the form widget (named &#8216;<strong>WCAPF &#8211; Product Filter Form</strong>&#8216;) to the sidebar, and the filters will automatically appear based on the current template being used.</p>\n<h3>Different Filters for Different Archive Pages</h3>\n<p>Customize the filter options based on specific product categories by <a href=\"https://wptools.io/docs/wc-ajax-product-filter/common/different-filters-for-different-archive-pages/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free+plugin+listing&amp;utm_campaign=WCAPF+Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">displaying unique filters on various archive pages</a>. This feature allows you to create specialized filter sets that address the specific needs of each product category.</p>\n<p>For example, clothing filters may include options for <em>size</em> and <em>color</em>, while laptop filters may include options for <em>processor</em>, <em>motherboard</em>, <em>RAM</em>, and <em>hard disk</em>. By using different filters for different archive pages, you can enhance the filtering experience for your customers.</p>\n<h3>Integration on Singular Pages</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptools.io/docs/wc-ajax-product-filter/common/filters-on-custom-pages/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free+plugin+listing&amp;utm_campaign=WCAPF+Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Integrate filters on singular pages</a> by utilizing the <code>[wcapf_products]</code> shortcode in conjunction with the form shortcode <code>[wcapf_form]</code>. This integration allows you to display products similarly to the shop page and effectively combines them with the filters.</p>\n<p>The <code>[wcapf_products]</code> shortcode leverages the popular <strong>WooCommerce products shortcode</strong>, providing extensive customization options. With the product loop, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify the layout (such as standard shop loop, products with pagination, or only products)</li>\n<li>Select the type of products to display (on sale, best selling, top rated)</li>\n<li>Define the visibility of products (visible, catalog, search, hidden, featured)</li>\n<li>Configure the product ordering</li>\n<li>Determine the number of columns for the grid layout</li>\n<li>Set the total number of displayed products</li>\n<li>Apply taxonomy and meta queries</li>\n<li>Exclude specific products</li>\n<li>Define a custom message when no products match the applied filters</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Drag and Drop Filter Creation</h3>\n<p>The plugin allows users to add filters in just a few clicks. By clicking the “Add Filter” button, a new filter is added with automatically configured settings. Users can easily customize the filter settings, reorder filters, and delete them as needed.</p>\n<h3>Customizable Filter Keys in URL</h3>\n<p>Set the filter key used in the URL to identify the type of filter applied.</p>\n<p>For example, in the URL <strong>../?category=sneakers&amp;material=mesh</strong>, <strong>category</strong>, and <strong>material</strong> are the filer keys.</p>\n<h3>Dynamic Product Count</h3>\n<p>Update the product count dynamically based on the applied filters, providing accurate and real-time information to customers, allowing customers to filter products with confidence and avoiding &#8220;no results found&#8221; messages.</p>\n<h3>Hide/Disable Irrelevant Options</h3>\n<p>Streamline the filtering experience by hiding or disabling options that return zero products. The plugin offers the flexibility to either hide or disable irrelevant options based on the applied filters. By removing these options, users can focus on relevant choices, enhancing their browsing experience.</p>\n<h3>Hide Empty Filters</h3>\n<p>Exclude empty filters from display to declutter the user interface. Empty filters that do not have any available options are automatically hidden, reducing visual noise and improving the usability of the filter system.</p>\n<h3>Option to Disable Ajax Filtering</h3>\n<p>Provide flexibility to disable AJAX filtering if needed. While AJAX filtering is generally recommended for seamless browsing, users can choose to disable it to troubleshoot any potential JavaScript conflicts that may arise after updating the product loop.</p>\n<h3>Multi-Vendor Plugin Support</h3>\n<p>When enabled, the filter plugin supports <a href=\"https://wptools.io/docs/wc-ajax-product-filter/common/filter-by-vendor/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free+plugin+listing&amp;utm_campaign=WCAPF+Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">multi-vendor setups</a> by showing the store name as the filter option label. This allows customers to easily filter products from specific vendors or stores.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>Easily customize the appearance of the filters to match the design and style of your theme. The plugin provides a variety of settings on the plugin settings page, <strong>including CSS variables</strong>, which allow developers to quickly transform the global style of a filter to a unique style.</p>\n<h3>Theme Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The plugin is designed to be highly compatible with a wide range of themes that follow the standard guidelines set by WooCommerce. This means it is likely to work effectively with almost any theme you choose.</p>\n<h3>Developer Friendly</h3>\n<p>It includes essential hooks, filters and supports template overriding, allowing developers to alter the filter data, change the appearance of filters, and easily modify the plugin&#8217;s behavior.</p>\n",

By using different filters for different archive pages, you can enhance the filtering experience for your customers.</p>\n<h3>Integration on Singular Pages</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptools.io/docs/wc-ajax-product-filter/common/filters-on-custom-pages/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free+plugin+listing&amp;utm_campaign=WCAPF+Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Integrate filters on singular pages</a> by utilizing the <code>[wcapf_products]</code> shortcode in conjunction with the form shortcode <code>[wcapf_form]</code>. This integration allows you to display products similarly to the shop page and effectively combines them with the filters.</p>\n<p>The <code>[wcapf_products]</code> shortcode leverages the popular <strong>WooCommerce products shortcode</strong>, providing extensive customization options. With the product loop, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specify the layout (such as standard shop loop, products with pagination, or only products)</li>\n<li>Select the type of products to display (on sale, best selling, top rated)</li>\n<li>Define the visibility of products (visible, catalog, search, hidden, featured)</li>\n<li>Configure the product ordering</li>\n<li>Determine the number of columns for the grid layout</li>\n<li>Set the total number of displayed products</li>\n<li>Apply taxonomy and meta queries</li>\n<li>Exclude specific products</li>\n<li>Define a custom message when no products match the applied filters</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Drag and Drop Filter Creation</h3>\n<p>The plugin allows users to add filters in just a few clicks. By clicking the “Add Filter” button, a new filter is added with automatically configured settings. Users can easily customize the filter settings, reorder filters, and delete them as needed.</p>\n<h3>Customizable Filter Keys in URL</h3>\n<p>Set the filter key used in the URL to identify the type of filter applied.</p>\n<p>For example, in the URL <strong>../?category=sneakers&amp;material=mesh</strong>, <strong>category</strong>, and <strong>material</strong> are the filer keys.</p>\n<h3>Dynamic Product Count</h3>\n<p>Update the product count dynamically based on the applied filters, providing accurate and real-time information to customers, allowing customers to filter products with confidence and avoiding &#8220;no results found&#8221; messages.</p>\n<h3>Hide/Disable Irrelevant Options</h3>\n<p>Streamline the filtering experience by hiding or disabling options that return zero products. The plugin offers the flexibility to either hide or disable irrelevant options based on the applied filters. By removing these options, users can focus on relevant choices, enhancing their browsing experience.</p>\n<h3>Hide Empty Filters</h3>\n<p>Exclude empty filters from display to declutter the user interface. Empty filters that do not have any available options are automatically hidden, reducing visual noise and improving the usability of the filter system.</p>\n<h3>Option to Disable Ajax Filtering</h3>\n<p>Provide flexibility to disable AJAX filtering if needed. While AJAX filtering is generally recommended for seamless browsing, users can choose to disable it to troubleshoot any potential JavaScript conflicts that may arise after updating the product loop.</p>\n<h3>Multi-Vendor Plugin Support</h3>\n<p>When enabled, the filter plugin supports <a href=\"https://wptools.io/docs/wc-ajax-product-filter/common/filter-by-vendor/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free+plugin+listing&amp;utm_campaign=WCAPF+Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">multi-vendor setups</a> by showing the store name as the filter option label. This allows customers to easily filter products from specific vendors or stores.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>Easily customize the appearance of the filters to match the design and style of your theme. The plugin provides a variety of settings on the plugin settings page, <strong>including CSS variables</strong>, which allow developers to quickly transform the global style of a filter to a unique style.</p>\n<h3>Theme Compatibility</h3>\n<p>The plugin is designed to be highly compatible with a wide range of themes that follow the standard guidelines set by WooCommerce. This means it is likely to work effectively with almost any theme you choose.</p>\n<h3>Developer Friendly</h3>\n<p>It includes essential hooks, filters and supports template overriding, allowing developers to alter the filter data, change the appearance of filters, and easily modify the plugin&#8217;s behavior.</p>\n",
