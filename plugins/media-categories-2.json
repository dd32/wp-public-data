Media Categories 1.5 takes advantage of the new Media Modal &#8211; with this plugin, you can now edit a images categories directly from the modal screen. I&#8217;ve also fixed some long standing bugs with the shortcode gallery functionality.</p>\n<h4>Updates</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Since version 1.5 : Supports the new WordPress 3.5 by adding the metabox to the new Media Modal. Also fixed bugs in the gallery shorcode behavior. All while still supporting 3.3.x &#8211; 3.4.x</li>\n<li>Since version 1.4 : This plugin allows for <strong>multiple metaboxes</strong> to be created for any number of taxonomies.</li>\n<li>Since version 1.3 : A <strong>filter</strong> has been added to allow developers to modify which taxonomy is being used. See &#8216;Other Notes&#8217; &gt; &#8216;Taxonomy Filter Usage&#8217; for details</li>\n<li>Since version 1.2 : This plugin extends the native <strong>[gallery] shortcode</strong> of WordPress so that it has a &#8216;category&#8217; parameter. See the &#8220;Shortcode Usage&#8221; under &#8220;Other Notes&#8221; for more details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shortcode Usage</h3>\n<h4>Normal Shortcode Usage</h4>\n<p>This plugin takes advantage of the existing <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode for showing images by adding the <code>'category'</code> parameter.<br />\nThe value passed to the <code>'category'</code> parameter can be either the <code>category</code> <code>slug</code>, or the <code>term_id</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>[gallery category=\"my-category-slug\"]\nOR\n[gallery category=\"12\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Its important to note that when passing the <code>'category'</code> parameter, the <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode will by default <strong>ignore the current post<br />\nand simply try to include all images from the category</strong>. The syntax above will retrieve any images that are assigned<br />\nto <code>'my-category-slug'</code> a.k.a term id <code>#12</code>, regardless of whether or not those images are attached to the current post.</p>\n<p>To query within a post (even the current post), you&#8217;ll need to explicitly add the post id as such&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>[gallery category=\"my-category-slug\" id=\"43\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This shortcode will retrieve any images attached to post <code>#43</code> that are categorized as <code>'my-slug-category'</code>.</p>\n<p>Aside from this behavior, the [gallery] shortcode should behave exactly as it does by default with the built-in shortcode.<br />\nThe <code>id</code> parameter will behave as normal when the <code>category</code> parameter is not invoked.<br />\nFor more information on using the built-in <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">gallery shortcode checkout the codex page</a>.</p>\n<h4>Other Taxonomy Shortcode Usage</h4>\n<p>If a developer implementing this plugin has made use of the <code>mc_taxonomy</code> filter to modify which taxonomy<br />\nthis plugin uses for attachments, then the name of that particular taxonomy will need to be used in place of <code>category</code><br />\nas the shortcode parameter. For example, if you applied &#8216;Post Tags&#8217; to your images then users should use the <code>post_tag</code> parameter<br />\nin the Gallery Shortcode.</p>\n<pre><code>[gallery post_tag=\"my-tag-slug\"]\nOR\n[gallery post_tag=\"12\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>[Warning: nerdy developer stuff ahead]</em></p>\n<h3>Multiple Taxonomy Metaboxes  *NEW!*</h3>\n<p>Since 1.4 this plugin allows developers to create metaboxes for any number of taxonomies. While previous the previous version allowed<br />\ndevelopers to change the taxonomy being used, it still only allowed a single taxonomy metabox to be generated. With 1.4, that has changed.</p>\n<p>All a developer needs to do, is create a new instance of the Media_Categories class and pass their desired taxonomy as an argument.</p>\n<pre><code>$my_custom_media_metabox = new Media_Categories('my_custom_taxonomy');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thats it!, nothing else to it, the plugin will take care of the rest. You can create as many instances as you like &#8211; just make sure to be careful<br />\nwhen doing this in conjunction with the <code>mc_taxonomy</code> filter &#8211; always check the current taxonomy.</p>\n<p>Obviously this works with any taxonomy, including built-in taxonomies such as &#8216;post_tag&#8217;, &#8216;link_categories&#8217;,<br />\nand yes, even &#8216;nav_menu&#8217;. I&#8217;ll leave it to you developers out uses for that.</p>\n<h3>Taxonomy Filter Usage: &#8216;mc_taxonomy&#8217;</h3>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since 1.4, this plugin allows developers to generate any number of metaboxes, for any number of different taxonomies. Because of this,<br />\nit is important that when filtering the taxonomy, developers conditionally check the current taxonomy before returning a different &#8211; otherwise<br />\nthe filter would override <em>all</em> instances of the plugin&#8217;s metaboxes with the same taxonomy. The examples below have been changes accordingly</p>\n<p>Since version 1.3, the Media Categories plugin includes a filter allowing developers to modify the taxonomy being used.<br />\nChanging the taxonomy will automatically change all the labels used around the metabox, and change the way the Gallery Shortcode<br />\nworks so that it accommodates whatever taxonomy has been chosen.</p>\n<p>The tag for this filter is <code>'mc_taxonomy'</code>, and usage could not be simpler.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('mc_taxonomy', 'mc_filter_taxonomy');\n\nfunction mc_filter_taxonomy($taxonomy){\n\n    if($taxonomy == 'category'){\n        $taxonomy = 'post_tag';\n    }\n\n    return $taxonomy\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code will swap out all references to &#8216;category&#8217; with appropriate (properly pluralized) references to the &#8216;post_tag&#8217; taxonomy.</p>\n<p>It will also change the way the Gallery Shortcode works to use your chosen taxonomy.</p>\n<h4>Important (potential gotchas)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>category</code> parameter for the Gallery Shortcode will be changed by using this filter, so that instead of <code>category</code> is will by <code>your_taxonomy</code>. In the case above with tags,<br />\nyou would write a shortcode as such. <code>[gallery post_tag=\"my-tag\"]</code> OR <code>[gallery post_tag=\"43\"]</code>.</li>\n<li>If using a Custom Taxonomy with this plugin, be sure to assign values to the labels for proper pluralization and context</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Related Plugin</h3>\n<p>Checkout this great plugin for Searchable Categories by Jason Corradino, whose javascript I use in this plugin.<br />\nI believe this very simple functionality should be a part of the standard categories metabox in core.<br />\nWhile I do not employ the plugin directly, the javascript used for filtering/searching is in fact derived with<br />\nconsent, and a few modifications from that plugin. To enable this feature on all your category metaboxes, install the<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/searchable-categories/\" rel=\"ugc\">Searchable Categories</a> plugin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/searchable-categories/\" rel=\"ugc\">Searchable Categories</a> by Jason Corradino</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>/media-categories-2/</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can this plugin work with a custom taxonomy, or a built-in taxonomy other than Categories?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, modify the taxonomy used by a metabox by making use of the <code>mc_taxonomy</code> filter.<br />\nThey can also create additional metaboxes for other taxonomies by creating new instances<br />\nof the Media_Categories class.</p>\n<p>See the &#8216;Multiple Taxonomy Metaboxes&#8217; section (a.k.a &#8216;Other Notes&#8217;) for more details on how<br />\nthis is done.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can any of this customization explained above be done without writing any code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Currently there is no way to change the taxonomy, or create additional taxonomy metaboxes<br />\nin the Media Library without adding a little bit of PHP (preferably to you theme).</p>\n<p>Have no fear however, I do have intentions to add magical plugin options pages to allow<br />\nas much as possible to be done without development &#8211; sorry but I have no timeline for when this<br />\nmight happen.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there any way to see all the attachment/media items associated to a category/taxonomy term, the way we can with Posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In WordPress 3.5, you can now see any taxonomy enabled for attachments the same way you see Categories for Posts. For earlier versions, I&#8217;m afraid the answer is no.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I found a bug, or I would like to suggest/request a feature, can I submit it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, thats great! I love hearing how people want to use my plugins, and if you look though my blog or<br />\nthis plugins support forum, you&#8217;ll see I have a tendency of fulfilling people&#8217;s requests ( but no promises :p )</p>\n<p>Bug reports are extremely helpful! Most of my plugins have been developed while at work, and publicly submitted bug reports help<br />\nprove the point that Open Source is the way to go. It amounts to free public quality assurance testing. So please please please report<br />\nany bugs to you see. Preferably on the WordPress plugin directory, but if you feel so inclined you may report them on my blog http:://eddiemoya.com</p>\n</p>\n\n",
