        "description": "<h3>What is AdRoll?</h3>\n<p>AdRoll is a marketing and advertising platform where any brand can easily <strong>launch and manage display, social media, and email campaigns</strong>. We work with over 22,000 companies to attract new customers, engage existing customers, and grow revenue.</p>\n<h3>Key Features of the AdRoll Platform</h3>\n<h4>1. Display Ads</h4>\n<p>Get in front of your ideal prospects and customers with cost-effective display, video and native ads across millions of brand-safe websites and mobile apps.</p>\n<p><strong>Retargeting Ads</strong><br />\n97% of customers don’t make a purchase on the first visit to your website. AdRoll retargeting brings those shoppers back and gets them buying. Choose from dozens of dynamic ad templates to create retargeting ads that show shoppers the products that captured their attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Brand Awareness (or Prospecting) Ads</strong><br />\nFind and engage new customers with three different types of targeting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lookalike Targeting: People who visit the same websites, have similar shopping habits, and live in the same areas as your existing customers.</li>\n<li>Demographic &amp; Interest Targeting: People who have the same characteristics (education, income, interests, etc.) as your ideal customer.</li>\n<li>Contextual Targeting: People who read content that your ideal customers would view.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Ad Integrations</h4>\n<p>AdRoll’s automation builder is the only tool that lets you create consistent, personalized, and automated campaigns across web ads, social ads, and email — all from one place. Manage and make edits to your Meta, TikTok, and Pinterest campaigns — such as swapping out creative or shifting budget to higher-performing campaigns — directly in AdRoll. Plus, easily analyze performance across all channels and download consolidated reports.</p>\n<h4>3. Email Marketing</h4>\n<p>Want 2x ad performance? Add (unlimited!) email to the mix. Use our drag-and-drop email builder to set up automated email campaigns  that seamlessly retarget shoppers across the web, social, and the inbox to drive more revenue.</p>\n<h4>4. Marketing Automations</h4>\n<p>Tackle common challenges like cart abandonment and generating customer loyalty with marketing recipes. These ready-to-use automation templates include the optimal combination of display ads, social ads, and emails, triggered at exactly the right time. If you can identify the business problem, we can provide the solution — step-by-step instructions included.</p>\n<h4>5. Reporting and Analytics</h4>\n<p>AdRoll makes it easy to know what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. Our Cross-Channel Performance Dashboard provides a consolidated view of how your entire marketing mix — ads, social, paid search, and email — is working together. Choose your attribution model, quickly view insights, and understand your visitors&#8217; paths to conversion to guide smarter budget decisions.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of the AdRoll for WooCommerce Plugin</h3>\n<h4>Automatically tag your site</h4>\n<p>Collect valuable shopper behavior data with the AdRoll pixel, automatically placed on all pages of your website.</p>\n<h4>Access high-performing dynamic ads and emails</h4>\n<p>Run dynamic ads and/or emails using your store’s product feed, generated by the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Create key audiences</h4>\n<p>Build high-intent audience lists based on shopper attributes and behaviors, then target them in ad and email campaigns.</p>\n<h4>Enable conversion and ROAS tracking</h4>\n<p>Track the number of sales and amount of revenue driven by your AdRoll campaigns.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bJ8jaHoB2I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h3>Packages</h3>\n<h4>Marketing &amp; Ads Plus</h4>\n<p><em>Starts at $36/month — first 30 days are free! — plus the cost of advertising campaigns (determined by you). This package also includes up to 50% back in ad credits.</em></p>\n<p>The Marketing &amp; Ads Plus package gives you access to the most powerful version of our platform.

Based on site visitor’s browsing activity on your site, dynamic ads can feature previously-viewed, recommended, and top products.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20retargeting%20and%20how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nWhat is retargeting and how does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Retargeting enables you to deliver personalized content to users who have previously visited their sites. This includes content that relates to sites they’ve visited and products they’ve viewed.</p>\n<p>Retargeting works by utilizing “cookies”, a small piece of data stored by the web browser that remembers users who visited your advertisement or webpage. You can then utilize this cookie data to serve ads to your customers again. By showing relevant, targeted ads to your customers that have shown an interest in your brand, you increase brand awareness and often total conversions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
