        "installation": "<h4>Minimum requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (Tested up to: 8.2.4)</li>\n<li>MySQL version 5.0 or greater</li>\n<li>WordPress 4.0 or greater (Tested up to: 6.4.2)</li>\n<li>WooCommerce 3 or greater (Tested up to: 8.4.0)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>To perform an automatic installation of the CityPay Paylink WooCommerce plugin,<br />\nlogin to your WordPress dashboard, select the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field, type &#8220;CityPay&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you have<br />\nfound our payment gateway plugin, it may be installed by clicking Install Now.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The perform a manual installation of the CityPay Paylink WooCommerce plugin,<br />\nlogin to your WordPress dashboard, select the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>Then select Upload Plugin, browse to the location of the ZIP file containing<br />\nthe plugin (typically named <em>citypay-paylink-woocommerce.zip</em>) and then click<br />\nInstall Now.</p>\n<h4>Post installation: the plugin settings form</h4>\n<p>Once the plugin has been installed, you may need to activate it by selecting<br />\nthe Plugins menu, clicking Installed Plugins and then activating the plugin<br />\nwith the name &#8220;CityPay WooCommerce Plugin&#8221; by clicking on the link labeled<br />\nActivate.</p>\n<p>You will need to edit WooCommerce checkout settings by navigating to the<br />\nWooCommerce administration panel, selecting WooCommerce, Settings and then<br />\nthe checkout tab. If installed correctly, you should see CityPay as a link<br />\nunder the Checkout Options.</p>\n<p>The merchant account, the licence key, the transaction currency and other<br />\ninformation relating to the processing of transactions through the CityPay<br />\nPaylink hosted form payment gateway may be configured by selecting the<br />\nplugin configuration form which is accessed indirectly through the<br />\nWooCommerce settings page upon selecting the Checkout tab, and clicking on<br />\nthe link labeled CityPay which appears in the list of available payment<br />\nmethods.</p>\n<p>You can include the WooCommerce order identifier in the description sent<br />\nto CityPay for the purpose of including a customer-friendly reference in<br />\nthe email sent to the customer. This is<br />\nachieved by specifying {order_id} as part of the descriptive text appearing<br />\nin the text box labeled Transaction Description.</p>\n<p>After the settings for the plugin have been configured, they must be saved<br />\nby clicking on the button labeled Save Changes before they take effect.</p>\n<h4>Developer Postback Testing</h4>\n<p>The Paylink service cannot send a postback/webhook to your localhost test server<br />\nto update the order status. Therefore token requests fail to be created when<br />\na localhost or local network address is detected in the postback URL. To work<br />\naround this, we recommend using <a href=\"https://ngrok.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://ngrok.com</a> to create<br />\na secure tunnel to your localhost server. As your WordPress installation may be<br />\non localhost, the CityPay settings page allows the addition of a<br />\n<strong>Postback Site Address (URL)</strong> which you can customise with your ngrok address i.e.<br />\nhttps://12345678abc.ngrok.io. The value should be the host and protocol part of the<br />\nURL.</p>\n<h4>Processing test transactions</h4>\n<p>To test the operation of an e-commerce solution based on WooCommerce in<br />\ncombination with the CityPay Paylink WooCommerce plugin without processing<br />\ntransactions that will be settled by the upstream acquirer, the check box<br />\nlabeled Test Mode appearing on the plugin settings form should be ticked.</p>\n<h4>Processing live transactions</h4>\n<p>To process live transactions for settlement by the upstream acquirer, the<br />\ncheckbox labeled Test Mode referenced in the paragraph above must be<br />\nunticked.</p>\n<h4>Enabling logging</h4>\n<p>The interaction between WordPress, WooCommerce and the CityPay Paylink<br />\nhosted payment form service may be monitored by ticking the check box labeled<br />\nDebug Log appearing on the plugin settings form.</p>\n<p>Log payment events appearing in the resultant log file will help to trace<br />\nany difficulties you may experience accepting payments using the CityPay<br />\nPaylink service.</p>\n<p>The location of the log file is provided on the plugin settings form.</p>\n",
