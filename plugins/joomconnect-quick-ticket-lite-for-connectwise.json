        "description": "<p>Have you ever wanted a quick, easy way to create a ticket in Connectwise without having to navigate away from your site? Quick Ticket Lite, the newest module from the innovative developers of JoomConnect, allows a user to quickly create a ticket and submit it directly to ConnectWise without having to navigate away from the page. As a standalone module, it can be employed anywhere on your site, does not require the full version of JoomConnect and is completely free. The only information that Quick Ticket Lite requires to create a ticket is the service board name and email connector email address configured in the backend of the module.</p>\n<p>This module will place a form on the frontend of your website. Once a user has entered and submitted his/her information through the form, the data will be inserted into a newly created ticket. By using an email connector, the ticket is created with the user&#8217;s email address so that the correct contact information is used in ConnectWise. The ticket is automatically generated in ConnectWise on the service board chosen by the user.</p>\n<p>If you like the features that Quick Ticket Lite offers, please be sure check out <a href=\"http://www.joomconnect.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JoomConnect</a> for a full suite of integration options between your website and ConnectWise.</p>\n",
