Sometimes the developers go to SETTINGS / READING and check &#8220;Search Engine Visibility: Discourage search engines from indexing this site&#8221; because they think it will help them not becoming indexed by a search engine.<br />\nMuch better than using this option (<strong>which by the way you should never use</strong>) you should install a Maintenance plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/maintenance/\" rel=\"ugc\">Maintenance</a> and activate the option &#8220;503: Service temporarily unavailable, Google analytics will be disable&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20search%20engines%20blocked%20warning%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20database%3F'>\nDoes Search engines blocked warning make changes to the database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The plugin doesn&#8217;t write any options or settings to the database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20check%20out%20if%20the%20plugin%20works%20for%20me%3F'>\nHow can I check out if the plugin works for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install and activate.

There are no options stored in the database so you can delete it also via FTP and everything will be removed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20known%20incompatibilities%3F'>\nAre there any known incompatibilities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t use it with <em>WordPress MultiSite</em>, as it has not been tested.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20php%20version%20do%20i%20need%3F'>\nWhich PHP version do I need?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.6 and greater.
