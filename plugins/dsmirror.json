        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20anything%20else%20in%20addition%20to%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need anything else in addition to the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you need to execute the DSmirror agent in a Linux or Windows workstation or server with Docker, with direct connectivity to your external database. However, this agent only needs Internet connection, no direct connectivity with your WordPress DB or server is required.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20required%20any%20specific%20capability%20in%20my%20wordpress%20hosting%20environment%3F'>\nIs required any specific capability in my WordPress hosting environment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, only the capability to execute scheduled actions through standard WP_cron or any equivalent external scheduling mechanism. Check <a href=\"https://dsmirror.tecknolab.com/wp_cron\" title=\"DSMirror WP_cron info\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP_cron</a> for details.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20a%20free%20service%3F'>\nIs a free service?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you only need to register using your email for getting a free AppId and secret to configure your plugin and agent. Register directly in the [DSMirror] or through the agent. It provides a single site license for replicating up to 3 tables and up to 100 rows per table. An unlimited low priced version is available at [DSMirror].</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20same%20dsmirror%20appid%20in%20several%20sites%3F'>\nCan I use the same DSmirror appId in several sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From a licensing perspective, no unless explicitly granted. Technically, it can generate configuration issues and is not supported.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20same%20dsmirror%20agent%20to%20replicate%20from%2Fto%20several%20sites%3F'>\nCan I use the same DSmirror agent to replicate from/to several sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No at this point. In the future a DSmirror agent will support several appId/secret pairs enabling multisite replication. However, you can launch several DSmirror agents in the same workstation/host providing you configure different ports for each one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20same%20dsmirror%20agent%20to%20connect%20to%20different%20external%20databases%3F'>\nCan I use the same DSmirror agent to connect to different external databases?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of today, you can only configure one database for inbound replication and one database for outbound replication (can be the same for both). In the future we will support configuring serveral databases for serving data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20external%20database%20technologies%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat external database technologies are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently MYSQL. In the near future we will add support to other DB technologies as PostgreSQL and SQL Server.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
