        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20fork%20wp%20word%20count%3F'>\nWhy fork WP Word Count?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong><br />\nWP Word Count is back on the plugin directory, but still seems to be getting very little attention from the developers.</p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;ve already done all the work to fork it and publish it in the plugin directory, I&#8217;ll continue to support this version going forward.</p>\n<p>Also Just Writing Statistics has a lot of features that were only included in the Pro version of WP Word Count, so there&#8217;s that too.</p>\n<p>WP Word Count is by far the best plugin of its kind, however it is, as far as I can tell, abandoned at this point.</p>\n<p>Even worse, the existing plugin has a known security vulnerability in it and so wordpress.org has closed the repository.</p>\n<p>As such, a fork is required to fix the security issue and bring the plugin functionality back.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27ve%20got%20a%20very%20large%20site%2C%20how%27s%20the%20performance%20going%20to%20be%3F'>\nI&#8217;ve got a very large site, how&#8217;s the performance going to be?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Statistics are inherently resource intensive, the large your site is, the slower the statistic generation will be.</p>\n<p>For the general content/monthly/yearly/author based statistics, these should remain quick to display no matter the site size as a custom table is used to gather the data whenever a item is saved.</p>\n<p>For Tags and Categories this is not the case and these are calculated at display time.  Even with a largish site, this should not be significant, a few seconds at worst.  If this becomes an issue I&#8217;ll look into converting this code over to a custom table as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20see%20post%20types%20in%20the%20settings%20tab%20that%20i%20don%27t%20see%20on%20any%20of%20the%20statistics%20tabs%3F'>\nWhy do I see post types in the settings tab that I don&#8217;t see on any of the statistics tabs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a post type has no items associated with it, Just Writing Statistics will not include it in the statistic displays.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20really%20have%20to%20calculate%20the%20statistics%20by%20date%20range%3F'>\nDo I really have to calculate the statistics by date range?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not, but make sure to wait for the progress bar to disappear before reloading the page.  If it is running for more than five minutes, then it&#8217;s failed silently and you&#8217;ll need to break up the calculation into chunks.</p>\n<p>However, even on a modest hosting provider, it would take hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) of posts to get to this point.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20the%20just%20writing%20statistics%20shortcodes%20work%3F'>\nHow do the Just Writing Statistics Shortcodes work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two shortcodes available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[just-writing-statistics] will display the number of words on any page or post.</li>\n<li>[just-writing-statistics-reading-time] will display the reading time of words on any page or post.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every Just Writing Statistics shortcode can be extended with &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; attributes to add text or HTML before and after the result.</p>\n<p>Example: [just-writing-statistics before=&#8221;This post has&#8221; after=&#8221; total words.&#8221;]</p>\n</p>\n\n",
