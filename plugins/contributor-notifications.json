You can change the wording, the language, and add custom HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p>Use whatever string swap/translation method you like, but I recommend the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/\" rel=\"ugc\">Say what? plugin</a> because it&#8217;s the easiest way to change the text with no coding required.</p>\n<p>To use Say what?, you need to add three pieces of info, the exact text string you&#8217;d like to alter, the text domain, and the replacement string you&#8217;d like to use.</p>\n<p>Strings:</p>\n<pre><code>New Pending Post\n&lt;!--email-admin--&gt;\nYour Post Has Been Approved\n&lt;!--email-contributor-approved--&gt;\nYour Post Has Been Declined\n&lt;!--email-contributor-declined--&gt;\nSorry, your post has been declined.\n | \n</code></pre>\n<p>Text Domain:</p>\n<pre><code>contributor-notifications\n</code></pre>\n<p>(see <a href=\"https://ps.w.org/contributor-notifications/assets/say-what-screenshot.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">example screenshot</a>)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20aren%27t%20emails%20being%20sent%3F'>\nWhy aren&#8217;t emails being sent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m using the built-in <code>wp_mail</code> function. Most hosting environments (even shared hosts like Bluehost and GoDaddy) can handle email, but not very well out-of-the-box and require being optimized. It actually takes a bit of work to make sure your emails are deliverable. Some recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check that your SPF, DKIM, and other email records are set up correctly (<a href=\"https://www.mail-tester.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mail-tester.com</a> is a great all-around tool for checking and fixing common email deliverability issues)</li>\n<li>Even on shared hosts, you should be able to add a dedicated IP to your account for very cheap (which allows you to get away from shared IPs that have a bad reputation because your neighbors are spamming)</li>\n<li>If all else fails, you can abandon using your own server for mail altogether, and host offsite with a free or paid third-party service like Gmail (check out the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Mail SMTP</a> plugin to go that route)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20plugin%20only%20works%20for%20the%20pending%20post%20status.'>\nThis plugin only works for the Pending post status.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some examples of when this plugin might be useful include when you allow registration on your site and by default, new users are granted the Contributor role, or when using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-submitted-posts/\" rel=\"ugc\">User Submitted Posts</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
