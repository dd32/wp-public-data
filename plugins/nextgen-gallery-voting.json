        "faq": "\n<dt id='in%20a%20nutshell%2C%20what%20is%20this%3F'>\nIn a nutshell, what is this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin adds options that can allow your users to vote on (more like rate) your Galleries and Images. There are options to limit which<br />\nGallery/Image to allow voting on, if the user needs to be registered and logged in, if they can vote more that once, and if they can see the<br />\ncurrent results.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20show%20the%20voting%20form%3F'>\nHow do I show the voting form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to add a small tag to the gallery display template.</p>\n<p><strong>For image voting:</strong><br />\nFor image voting, add the following tag: <code>&lt;?php echo nggv_imageVoteForm($image-&gt;pid); ?&gt;</code>, to the gallery display template.</p>\n<p><strong>For gallery voting:</strong><br />\nFor gallery voting, add the following tag: <code>&lt;?php echo nggv_galleryVoteForm($displayed_gallery, $gallery); ?&gt;</code>, to the gallery display template.</p>\n<p>For NGG 1.x, you can find the gallery templates in the <code>/plugins/nextgen-gallery/view/</code> directory. For the default shortcode, <code>[nggallery id=x]</code>, you<br />\nadd the tag to the <code>gallery.php</code> file. If you add the <code>template</code> attribute to your shortcode, you need to alter the appropriate template. eg:<br />\nIf you use the <code>[nggallery id=x template=\"caption\"]</code>, you need to add the tag to the <code>gallery-caption.php</code> template.</p>\n<p>For NGG version 2.x, you need to add the tag to the <code>/nextgen-gallery/products/photocrati_nextgen/modules/nextgen_basic_gallery/templates/thumbnails/index.php</code><br />\ntemplate. This will only work for galleries inserted WITHOUT selectiong a template from the gallery display options.<br />\nNGG v2.x templating system can be confusing for some users. Please see <a href=\"http://shauno.co.za/nextgen-gallery-v2-display-template-locations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this page</a> for more info on which templates are used.</p>\n<p>Please be aware, for <strong>image voting</strong>, the form needs to be placed inside the <code>foreach()</code> loop in those templates, as that loop is outputting each image.<br />\nI find the best place to put the tag is AFTER the <code>&lt;div class=\"ngg-gallery-thumbnail\"&gt;</code> is CLOSED.<br />\nFor <strong>gallery voting</strong>, be sure to place the tag outside of the foreach, or it will show more than once on the page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20style%20it%3F'>\nCan I style it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. This plugin intentionally adds very little styling to the voting forms, but it does provide plenty of ids and classes allowing you to style it to fit in with your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20results'>\nWhere are the results\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Under the Gallery or Image options, the current average vote show along with how many votes have been cast.  Click on the number of votes cast to view more info on those votes.<br />\nYou can also see more information on the voting results under the &#8216;Top Voted&#8217; menu option.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
