        "faq": "\n<h4>I receive two notification emails for comments on my own posts</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re admin on the Disqus account used for the site then yes you will receive two emails on your own posts, one from Disqus and another from WordPress. However, users who have authored content on your site but are not admins in the Disqus account will only receive one notification email (coming from WordPress).</p>\n<p>Starting from version 1.1, each WordPress user can choose to opt out of receiving the comment notification emails generated by this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t the notifications arrive immediately?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a delay of a few minutes in notification delivery as notifications to post/page authors are emailed only after the Disqus system submits them back to your WordPress installation; this usually doesn&#8217;t take more than 5 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There&#8217;s a repo/plugin on GitHub with the same name</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a duplicate of the codebase of this plugin. This plugin was originally released on GitHub in March 2014. In August 2014 I applied and got the plugin promoted to WordPress.org. The GitHub repo still remains active and all changes to the plugin are actually first pushed to GitHub and only after that are they pushed to the SVN repo at wordpress.org.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d rather use this plugin by doing a <em>git clone</em>, feel free to do so ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the background of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In standard WordPress settings you can define for WP to email the post/page author whenever a comment is posted on their content; this setting is on by default. However, if you&#8217;re using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/\" rel=\"ugc\">Disqus Comment System</a> plugin, then post/page authors won&#8217;t receive comment notifications. Instead, only comment moderators (defined in <a href=\"https://disqus.com/admin/settings/moderation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Disqus admin panel</a>) will be notified.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why not simply modify Disqus plugin code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You <em>should not</em> modify the Disqus Comment System plugin code to accomplish author notification. Why? Because it&#8217;ll break your plugin updates. In other words, any time you update your Disqus plugin, you&#8217;ll have to remember to re-apply your modification&#8230;</p>\n<p>And what if you manage multiple WP sites? There&#8217;s a 95.37% chance you&#8217;ll forget to re-apply<br />\nthe change on at least one of those WP instances at least sometime&#8230;plus it&#8217;s pretty annoying re-applying the change over and over again.</p>\n<p>Instead, this plugin utilizes WP&#8217;s wp_insert_comment hook/action and the wp_notify_postauthor function as done in this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin work with WP versions prior to 3.9?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I assume it will work with the same WordPress versions as the Disqus Comment System, which is WP 2.8 and higher. Nevertheless, I have not tested support on all versions. If you come across a combo of WP+Disqus versions with which this plugin doesn&#8217;t work, could you please report it, thank you ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the plugin work with Disqus versions prior to 2.74?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t tested. Please report in case you try it ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
