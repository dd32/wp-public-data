No names, credit card information, IP addresses, nothing. Only emails are stored in WordPress core&#8217;s &#8220;users&#8221; table, and can be erased using WordPress&#8217;s normal erase-personal-data process. We recommend adding a note to your privacy policy stating that the only information recorded during a payment is the email address, and that all other data is handled by Stripe.com.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20fully%20support%203dsecure%20and%20the%20sca%20regulation%20in%20the%20eu%3F'>\nDoes this plugin fully support 3DSecure and the SCA regulation in the EU?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20and%20how%20do%20i%20show%20the%20payment%20form%20on%20by%20website%3F'>\nWhere and how do I show the payment form on by website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We typically recommend creating a new page called something like &#8220;Give&#8221;, and placing this shortcode on it [churchtithewp].
