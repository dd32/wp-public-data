        "faq": "\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin hooks into the the_content filter on page and post render. Essentially right before post_content (in the form of raw HTML) is set to the browser, this plugin will scan the HTML for  tags using a regex matcher. Regex was used instead of parsing the HTML into a Document Object to maximize compatibility  (parsing the HTML into a Document Object, and then back to an HTML string would likely modify the HTML syntax, drop attributes, etc. which could break other components and post functionality).</p>\n<p>Once images are identified in the HTML, the image src URL is used to lookup the attachment ID corresponding to the image. Unfortunately I was not able to find a cleaner way of performing this lookup, as the image ID is not always output onto the page when an attachment is included.</p>\n<p>Once the image ID is determined, the plugin retrieves the image Alt and Title values for that attachment using the get_post_meta() and get_the_title() WordPress functions. Once these values are returned, they are added to the image unless the image already contains an alt or title tag, in which case this part is skipped.</p>\n<p>The modified image HTML is placed back into the post_content HTML string, and returned to the browser.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
