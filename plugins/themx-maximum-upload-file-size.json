But, please know that server adjusted limits can&#8217;t be changed from a WordPress plugin. If the server set limit is 16MB you can&#8217;t increase it to 128MB via WordPress. You have to email your hosting provider and ask them to increase the limit. Install the plugin and it&#8217;ll tell you what the limits are.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='increased%20upload%20file%20size%20but%20still%20not%20working%3F'>\nIncreased upload file size but still not working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If minimum upload limit set by hosting provider then its will not work.
