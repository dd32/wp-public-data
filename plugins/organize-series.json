        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20does%20publishpress%20series%20do%3F'>\nWhat does PublishPress Series do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It makes it easier for you to write a series of posts on your blog/website and have them automatically linked together. One of the best ways to build an audience on your blog/website is to write short posts about the same subject over a period of time rather than one long post.  There are numerous SEO benefits to this as well.  PublishPress Series takes the hassle out of managing the serial posts and you can just focus on writing.  Another way of saying this is, PublishPress Series takes the work out of organizing series so that you write more and your readers can EASILY follow along.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20archive%20page%20for%20series%3F'>\nCan I customize the archive page for series?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You sure can! Create a file called <code>taxonomy-series.php</code> and copy the code from your themes <code>archive.php</code> file and use that as the basis for building out how the series archive page looks.  You&#8217;ll also want to take a look at all the template tags you can use for series in the <code>orgSeries-template-tags.php</code> file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customize%20the%20archive%20page%20for%20a%20single%20series%3F%3F'>\nCan I customize the archive page for a single series??\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Create a file named <code>taxonomy-series-{series-slug}.php</code> file and replace <code>{series-slug}</code> with the slug of your series and you&#8217;ll be good to go!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20a%20page%20that%20lists%20all%20the%20series%20available%3F'>\nCan I create a page that lists all the series available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can In the <code>organize-series</code> folder you&#8217;ll see a file called <code>seriestoc.php</code>.  It&#8217;s what gets loaded when you go to your series toc url (defaults at \\series-toc\\ but you can change this on the series options page).  Chances are though it doesn&#8217;t look great with your theme (the file included just gives you an idea of what you can put in the file). What you want to do is copy this file to your theme folder and then modify it to match your theme structure (see your themes archive page for an example).  You don&#8217;t need to put any of the WordPress loop code in this file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20publishpress%20series%20use%20the%20wordpress%20taxonomy%20system%3F'>\nDoes PublishPress Series use the WordPress taxonomy system?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Publishpress Series introduces a new taxonomy &#8220;series&#8221;. Thanks to the rich API provided to plugin authors by WordPress, PublishPress Series takes advantage of the WordPress core.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
