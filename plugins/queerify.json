If you can point me to the flag that is missing, it can be included in the later releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I&#8217;m using a lazy-load plugin for images on my website, does it effect the selected loading screen flag and neon cat image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does have an effect &#8211; flag and neon cat images are loaded with additional delay, which makes it visible only in the last half a second or so.<br />\nMy recommendation is to find a plugin that enables you to choose which css class to exclude from the effect of lazy-load (use the class &#8216;queerify-flag&#8217; and &#8216;queerify-neon-cat&#8217;).<br />\nI personally use the plugin &#8216;Smush&#8217; by WPMU DEV for lazy-loading of images. It&#8217;s a free plugin, and provides other image optimization options as well.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
