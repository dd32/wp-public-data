        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Live Blogging v2, like version 1, requires PHP version 5.2 and WordPress 4.4 or later. Please make sure you have these before you attempt to use the plugin. If you get errors whilst activating, it is likely that you are using a version of PHP before version 5.2.</p>\n<p>Live Blogging is installed and activated as per normal plugins. Once it has been activated, please read the FAQ about how to use it.</p>\n<p>Once you have installed Live Blogging, then it is most sensible to proceed to<br />\nthe Live Blogging settings, which is included in your &#8216;Settings&#8217; panel in the<br />\nadmin area as &#8216;Live Blogging&#8217;. From here, you can enable functionality such as<br />\nposting to Twitter, changing the method used for live blog updating and<br />\ncustomising the style of the live blog entries.</p>\n<p>If you have installed a Meteor server and intend to use it to stream updates,<br />\nyou must also enter your Meteor server details and set the live blog update<br />\nmethod to &#8216;Stream using Meteor&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I start live blogging?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The very first thing you need to do is select a post which to use as the shell<br />\nfor your live blog. Either create a new post, or select an existing one to edit,<br />\nand then to the right of your post screen, there should be an option entitled:<br />\n&#8220;Enable live blogging on this post&#8221;. Without this option being enabled, you<br />\nwill be unable to add new live blog entries to this post!</p>\n<p>The final step is very important. You must insert the shortcode [liveblog]<br />\nsomewhere within your post which indicates where the liveblog is to appear.</p>\n<p>Now, your live blog is set up! You can select &#8216;Add New&#8217; from the sidebar under<br />\n&#8216;Live Blog Entries&#8217;, choose the live blog you want the update to apply to from<br />\nthe list in the sidebar, and then create your entry as per usual.</p>\n<p>Once you have finished with your live blog, untick the &#8220;Enable live blogging on<br />\nthis post&#8221; box. This will stop automatic updating and any new updates to be<br />\nadded to the live blog, but will preserve any existing live blogging<br />\nentries for posterity.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I upgrade my live blogs from version 1.x of the old plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin detects that old data from the plugin exists, then it will prompt<br />\nyou to upgrade on the options screen. Also, a &#8216;Live Blogging Migration&#8217; option<br />\nwill exist under the Tools menu. Run that tool and follow the prompts to upgrade<br />\nall your old entries to the new version.</p>\n<p>Please note that live blogs created in previous versions of the software can<br />\nnot have new entries added to them.</p>\n<p>Please note that it is recommended that you disable posting to Twitter when<br />\nrunning a migration, as the migration will cause all legacy entries to be<br />\nposted to Twitter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I change the time on a live blog entry to appear in the past, then it doesn&#8217;t appear in the right order during automatic updating?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately this is a limitation on the system &#8211; any new entries must appear<br />\nat the top of the live blog. Readers who come in after the blog was posted, or<br />\nusers who subsequentally refresh will see the blog posts in the correct order.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using TwentyTen and comment updating doesn&#8217;t look right</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('live_blogging_build_comments', 'twentyten_liveblogging_comments');\nfunction twentyten_liveblogging_comments($a)\n{\n    $a['callback'] = 'twentyten_comment';\n    return $a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>to your functions.php in your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Comment updating does not appear to work on my theme</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For comment updating to work, you must be using a reasonably standard comment<br />\nsetup. That is, your theme must generate comments using <code>wp_list_comments</code> and<br />\nput them in an element with an ID of <code>commentlist</code>. If your theme does not do<br />\nthese things, it is recommended that you disable comment updating in the option<br />\npanel.</p>\n<p>If your theme does support this, but comment updating still does not work<br />\ncorrectly, it is possible that your theme is calling <code>wp_list_comments</code> with<br />\nnon-default arguments. It is possible to account for this using a filter.</p>\n<p>Using the <code>live_blogging_build_comments</code> filter, you can return the arguments<br />\nwhich your theme uses to call to <code>wp_list_comments</code> to get the same effect as<br />\nyour default theme. For an example of how to do this, see above.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I imported my live blog from version 1 of the software, and am continuing to use the same live blog, but comment auto-updating isn&#8217;t working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sorry, this is a design issue with the software. It is recommended that you do<br />\nnot re-use any imported live blogs in this way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Meteor, and how do I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Meteor is a streaming web server that allows you to instantly &#8220;push&#8221; updates out<br />\nto your readers. This is the technology Twitterfall uses, and the advice of the<br />\nTwitterfall creators was useful in developing this functionality. Using Meteor<br />\nallows you to lower your server load, as well as quicker updates for your<br />\nreaders.</p>\n<p>There is a catch, however. Meteor is a web server separate to what servers your<br />\nnormal website and requires special configuration to set up, and your own server<br />\nor VPS to run it on. Shared hosting is, typically, unsuitable.</p>\n<p>If you are a professional blogger, running your blog from a server where you<br />\ncan install things as root, and are wishing to reduce server load, using the<br />\nplugin with Meteor is highly recommended.</p>\n<p>For more about Meteor, please see the <a href=\"http://meteorserver.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meteor website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does deleting a post from inside WordPress also delete it from Twitter?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Editing a post does not change the tweet the software generated</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is impossible to edit tweets. A decision was made not to implement this<br />\nfunctionality, as it may result in out-of-order or duplicate tweets in a user&#8217;s<br />\ntimeline. If you really need to delete a tweet, it is recommended that you<br />\neither delete the tweet manually, or delete the post and create a new one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I get an RSS feed containing just my live blog entries?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; if permalinks are enabled. Navigate to: WP-URL/feed/?post_type=liveblog_entry&amp;liveblog=ID<br />\nwhere WP-URL is the address of your WordPress site, and replace ID (right<br />\nat the end) with the ID of the post containing that live blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting multiple bookmarking icons or similar on every live blog post</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some bookmarking plugins work by adding their icons at the end of every post.<br />\nObviously, when you&#8217;re microblogging and adding multiple entries per page, this<br />\ncan get very tiresome. The options screen allows you to workaround this.</p>\n<p>In &#8216;Advanced Settings&#8217; at the bottom is a list of actions which are unhooked<br />\nfrom the <code>the_content</code> display filter, so they do not show up. To hide a<br />\nbookmarking plugin, you must add the name of the function which is called by the<br />\n    the_content filter to this list. The green + allows you to add more text<br />\nboxes, and then red &#8211; allows you to remove a function from being unhooked.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add a hashtag to my tweets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure! Just create a custom field on the post/page which contains the live blog<br />\ncalled &#8216;liveblogging_hashtag&#8217; and it will be appended to all of your tweets.</p>\n<p>(Note that this custom field should not contain the # character, that will be<br />\nadded automatically)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>AJAX updating doesn&#8217;t work with multi-site and domain mapping</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This forum topic (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ajax-in-subsite) should<br />\nresolve the issue for you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
