The only thing a blog owner needs is the ability to add files to a folder and change the content of those files.  By adding the template tags to the files the content of the file will be created as a widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How easy is it to create widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All that is needed to create a widget is to create a PHP file in a specified folder and add the template tags to that file.  Then all that is needed is to go to the widget settings page and add the widget to a desired sidebar, and select the file name from the drop down. Then save the widget.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
