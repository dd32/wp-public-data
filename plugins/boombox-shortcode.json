Publishers and marketers use Boombox to drive social traffic, generate qualified leads, and present targeted offers. <a href=\"http://www.boombox.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about Boombox</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is this plugin useful?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shortcodes are cleaner and simpler than javascript embed code. In WordPress, only Editors and Admins can copy and paste the javascript code to embed a Boombox quiz, but authors cannot.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a quiz/poll using the old embed code. Will it still work on WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course! Your content will be the same as before. In fact, if you want to continue using the old method for future quizzes and polls without the plugin, that works too.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it difficult to install and get setup?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all &#8211; it’s two steps. Take a look at the ‘Installation’ section to see just how easy it is.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do all the parameters in the code mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Boombox does all the hard stuff for you &#8211; no need to worry about what the code means. But if you’re genuinely curious, here it is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>widget: the type of Boombox widget that you are embedding. (Valid values are &#8220;quiz&#8221; or &#8220;poll&#8221;)</li>\n<li>id: the id of your quiz/poll. (Valid values are your widget id &#8220;K8nVuVy0ltLiSsJ85C6vzAVpIPh&#8221;)</li>\n<li>width: the pixel or percentage width of your quiz/poll container. (&#8220;500px&#8221; or &#8220;100%&#8221; &#8211; Default: &#8220;100%&#8221;)</li>\n<li>height: The pixel or percentage width of your quiz/poll container. Setting this to auto will resize the quiz/poll on each question to match the content.
