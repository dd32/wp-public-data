        "description": "<p>Video Lead Form is a sales and marketing dream tool. Many people use video as a means of engaging their visitors<br />\nbut then have to find awkward ways to ask their visitors to submit a contact or lead form. Video Lead Form solves<br />\nthis problem by embedding the form directly into the video. Users of Video Lead Form can choose where in the video<br />\nthe form should appear, either at the beginning, the end, or five seconds after the video starts.</p>\n<p>When a viewer submits the form, their information is emailed to you, simple as that. Video Lead Form can also be<br />\nintegrated with Salesforce for an even easier way to generate and manage sales leads.</p>\n<p>We hope you find it as useful we we have ourselves and we love to hear your feedback at contact@video-lead-form.com</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Is Video Lead Form free?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and no. It is free for a certain number of leads/contacts, but for significant commercial usage please<br />\ncheck out http://video-lead-form.com/ for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What size is the video that will be displayed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the videos are resized to 800&#215;450. They can be resized using the shortcode but the contact form looks best<br />\nat 800&#215;450.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
