        "description": "<p>Event Espresso is an event registration and ticket management plugin. To access certain features you are required to pay for the basic license (basic is $89.95).</p>\n<p>Whilst using this it became clear that one thing was missing: a bridge between the Lite and Basic licenses. The Lite version enables users to create events, take bookings and payments but viewing these events is far from ideal. You only get them in list form. For systems with more than 5 events, scrolling could be tedious.</p>\n<p>Now if you do buy the basic license you do get access to the Event Espresso Calendar. However, I am here to introduce a custom solution which allows you to embed a shortcode into your page and display them in a different way.</p>\n<p>I have likened it to a Monopoly-esque style with a bold header and an excerpt followed by a register link. The screenshot(s) below show what it would look like when events have passed and if events do not exist. This is only version 1 and if feedback is good I will consider building upon the foundation set.</p>\n<p>This solution was intended for a project I was working on and that could work for others.
