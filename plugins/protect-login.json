We&#8217;re here to help you succeed online.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20build%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you build this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We care about WordPress and keeping WordPress sites secure. So we decided it was time to take the code of the original Limit Login Attempts plugin and build on top of it.<br />\nWe did this for you. Protect Login is 100% free and will not bother you with nasty upsells or scare marketing. You have better things to do, don&#8217;t you?</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20not%20reset%20failed%20attempts%20on%20a%20successful%20login%3F'>\nWhy not reset failed attempts on a successful login?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is very much by design. Otherwise, you could simply brute force the &#8220;admin&#8221; password by logging in as your own user every 4th attempt.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20if%20my%20site%20is%20behind%20a%20reverse%20proxy%3F'>\nHow do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure about this, chances are your site is not behind a reverse proxy. However, Protect Login&#8217;s settings offer an option to activate proxy mode.<br />\nA reverse proxy is a server between the site and the Internet (perhaps handling caching or load-balancing). This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20put%20my%20ip%20on%20an%20allowlist%20to%20avoid%20getting%20locked%20out%3F'>\nCan I put my IP on an allowlist to avoid getting locked out?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there is an allowlist tab in Protect Login&#8217;s settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20locked%20myself%20out%20while%20testing%20this%20plugin%3B%20what%20do%20i%20do%3F'>\nI locked myself out while testing this plugin; what do I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Either wait until your account/IP is unblocked, or if you have FTP or SSH access to the site, rename it &#8220;wp-content/plugins/protect-login&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20support%20ipv6%20addresses%3F'>\nDo you support IPv6 addresses?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if the webserver passes an IPv6 address to your WordPress installation, the plugin has no problems to handle IPv6 from 1.2.0.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
