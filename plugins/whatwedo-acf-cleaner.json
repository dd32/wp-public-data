This is probably also the issue why there&#8217;s nothing like this baked into the ACF plugin itself. Down the road it gets pretty complex.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='output%20the%20names%20of%20the%20deleted%20fields'>\nOutput the names of the deleted fields\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We are aware that it would be handy to know which exact fields will get deleted, so the user can analyzing the actual data. This could be integrated in a future release.<br />\nWe already know the name of the fields and we&#8217;re also returning them from the server. Since they&#8217;re a lot of unordered data, we don&#8217;t do something proper with those in the frontend .</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='support%20more%20than%20just%20post%20meta'>\nSupport more than just post meta\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ACF allows fields for term meta, user meta etc and not just post meta. This plugin only works with post meta for now.<br />\nThere&#8217;s a ticket in the WordPress Support page for this: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/support-more-than-just-post-meta/.
