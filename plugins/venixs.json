Here&#8217;s how to do an automatic install of the Venixs SDK WordPress plugin:</p>\n<p>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<p>Navigate to the Plugins menu and</p>\n<p>Click Add New.</p>\n<p>Enter &#8220;Venixs plugin&#8221; in the search field and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve discovered our chat sdk plugin, you can learn more about it by viewing its point release, rating, and description.</p>\n<p>You can install it simply by clicking &#8220;Install Now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>MANUAL INSTALLATION</p>\n<p>Manual installation entails downloading our chat plugin file and uploading it to your web server using your preferred Ftp server. The WordPress codex has instructions for doing this here. Go ahead and paste the form shortcode on any page or widget.</p>\n<h4>UPDATING</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work flawlessly; however, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n<h4>CALLING THE PLUGIN</h4>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to do much to have your favorite chat sdk on your wordpress app, you only need to install and activate the plugin, a new admin sidebar will be added to your adnin area called &#8220;Venixs&#8221;, you should click on it and navigate to configuration, put in your chat public key and save. Thats all.</p>\n",
