        "description": "<p>kStats Reloaded began as a project to redesign StatPress Reloaded into a much faster and more up to date statistics plugin<br />\nfor WordPress. The original StatPress Reloaded is an amazing plugin, and can be found<br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/statpress-reloaded/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Using kStats you can instantly see who&#8217;s coming to your site, where they are coming from, be it another web site or one<br />\nof the many popular search engines, and much more. See up to the minute information on how many unique visitors you&#8217;ve<br />\ngotten, how many pageviews they&#8217;ve resulted in, including information on which crawlers are visiting and indexing your<br />\nWordpress site.</p>\n<p>kStats is much faster than many of its predecessors due to the fact that it takes a completely new approach to how<br />\nit stores and maintains information. Using a slightly more complex database schema and running a daily aggregate of<br />\ninformation allows it to reduce its SQL interaction by literally hundreds of queries.</p>\n<p><strong>This plugin is currently in its initial beta release</strong> &#8212; <em>it is meant for beta testing only, and not intended for use<br />\non a live web site.</em></p>\n<h3>kStats Widget</h3>\n<p>Since version 0.5.0, kStats includes the option to display a portion of your statistics publicly on your blog via a sidebar widget.</p>\n<p>The widget operates just like a regular text widget; you can place as many on your blog as you want, in any sidebar you have activated on your theme. The formatting is<br />\ncompletely under your control, so feel free to make it look however you want to suit your blog. kStats will simply interpret any of the inserted macro codes that you choose<br />\nto use and replace them with the appropriate information.</p>\n<p>You can display your all-time totals, this months, todays, or yesterdays for any of the fields currently displayed on your statistics page (visitors, pageviews, spiders and<br />\nfeeds). In addition you are also able to include information such as visitors currently online, or data about the visitor currently viewing your page, including their IP,<br />\nOS, or Browser.</p>\n<h3>Converting From StatPress Reloaded</h3>\n<p>Included in the archive is a conversion utility for StatPress Reloaded so that you don&#8217;t have to lose all the stats<br />\nyou&#8217;ve already recorded. This has been tested on StatPress v1.5.21, and is available from your plugins Options page.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t worry about losing any of your data either if you choose not to use kStats. The conversion utility works from<br />\na temporary table, and does not affect your original StatPress data in any way.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Installation of kStats Reloaded is fairly easy;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>After unpacking the archive, upload the entire <code>/kstats-reloaded/</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>All of the .ini files in the packages <code>/definitions/</code> folder need to be made writable (chmod 0777)</li>\n<li>Navigate to the Plugins page of your WordPress Dashboard and activate kStats-Reloaded</li>\n<li>Watch the statistics start building immediately!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>** Please note that installation of kStats Reloaded requires PHP 5. MySQL 5.0.3+ is recommended but not required.</p>\n",
