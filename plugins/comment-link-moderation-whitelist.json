        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer. Or unzip <code>comment-link-moderation-whitelist.zip</code> inside the plugins directory for your site (typically <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code>).</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; admin menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Via the &#8216;Settings&#8217; -&gt; &#8216;Discussion&#8217; admin page, define some URLs in the &#8216;Comment Link Moderation Whitelist&#8217; field.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nDo I need to explicitly list all the subdomains of a domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not if you list the primary domain name. If you list <em>example.com</em>, then there is no need to explicit list its subdomains, such as <em>info.example.com</em>. However, if you do not list the primary domain (in cases where you consider it too broad), then yes, you must list each subdomain you want to whitelist.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I need to specify the protocol when listing a URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can omit the &#8220;http://&#8221; and &#8220;https://&#8221; from the URLs you list, though it won&#8217;t matter if you include it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I specify a path to only whitelist a certain section of a URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can input something like &#8220;example.com/docs/&#8221; to allow only links relative to the location. In such a case, &#8220;example.com&#8221; and &#8220;example.com/downloads&#8221; would not be  whitelisted and would count against the comment moderation max number of links limit.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this completely negate any checking for the number of links in a comment if a commenter uses an excessive number of whitelisted URLs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. There is a hardcoded maximum number of comment links limit of 25 (which will become a configurable setting in a future release). If the number of comment links exceeds this number, regardless of whatever URLs are whitelisted, then the comment will be flagged for moderation. In the event WordPress is given a comment max links limit greater than 25, then the fallback maximum for whitelisted + non-whitelisted URL will be 10 higher than that limit. This limit exists to prevent abuse by a commenter including an excessive number of whitelisted URLs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes this plugin include unit tests?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs this plugin localizable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
