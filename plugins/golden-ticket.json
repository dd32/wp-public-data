        "description": "<p><strong>Golden Ticket</strong> is a WordPress plugin which encourages user interaction on your website. When used properly, <strong>Golden Ticket will increase your page views, time on site, interaction, and conversions</strong>.</p>\n<p>The theory is simple, you hide these tickets randomly throughout your content. After something triggers the ticket (this something is user definable, such as a timed delay), your ticket slides into view, revealing a bonus for your reader thanking them for reading your content. This is a great way to reward those visitors who actually stay and read your content. By setting a user interaction trigger to show the ticket you’re almost guaranteed to target a user who is interested in reading your content.</p>\n<p>Golden Ticket is not intended for things like opt-in forms, or banner ads. It’s designed to give the reader something as a reward.</p>\n<p>Usage is simple, just insert the shortcode [goldenticket] in your content where you want the ticket to appear.</p>\n<h4>Demos</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://thepluginfactory.co/distribution/submitting-a-plugin-to-the-wordpress-org-plugin-directory/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Golden Ticket Demo Link</a> &#8211; At the top of this page is a hidden Golden Ticket.

This is for those readers who scan through the content with their mouse cursor.  </li>\n<li><strong>When the ticket is scrolled into view</strong> &#8211; The ticket will remain hidden on the page until the position of the ticket is scrolled into view.
