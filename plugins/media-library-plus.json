It not only allows you to organize your image files in your WP site, but it also creates logical URL links to your files based on the folders you create and the name of the image file. So great! No more random numbers for image URL’s.</p>\n<p><strong>Great for organization and better media!</strong> WordPress’s default media folders didn’t work for us on a project with strict requirements on organizing their uploaded files. We had trouble finding a low-impact solution that fulfilled all requirements.</p>\n<p>Media Library Plus solved all our issues, and we’ve been using it on a major site with 11 custom post types, hundreds of media files, and tons of other plugins/customizations — zero issues and exactly what we need!</p>\n<p>MLP performs beautifully and provides great media management features and functionality! To make matters even better support is extremely fast and responsive to inquiries.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='folder%20tree%20not%20loading'>\nFolder Tree Not Loading\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Users who report this issue can usually fix it by running the Media Library Folders Reset plugin that comes with Media Library Folders.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First make sure you have installed the latest version of Media Library Folders.</li>\n<li>Deactivate Media Library Folders and activate Media Library Folders Reset and run the Reset Database option from the Media Library Folders Reset sub menu in the dashboard.</li>\n<li>After that, reactivate Media Library Folders. It will do a fresh scan of your media library database and no changes will be made to the files or folders on your site.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20unhide%20a%20hidden%20folder'>\nHow to Unhide a Hidden Folder\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the hidden folder via your cPanel or FTP and remove the file ‘mlpp-hidden’.</li>\n<li>In the Media Library Folders Menu, click the Check for New folders link. This will add the folder back into Media Library Folders</li>\n<li>Visit the unhidden folder in Media Library Folders and click the Sync button to add contents of the folder. Before doing this, check to see that there are no thumbnail images in the current folder since these will be regenerated automatically; these usually have file names such as image-name-150×150.jpg, etc.</li>\n<li>Repeat step 3 for each sub folder.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='folders%20and%20images%20added%20to%20the%20site%20by%20ftp%20are%20not%20showing%20up%20in%20media%20library%20folders'>\nFolders and images added to the site by FTP are not showing up in Media Library Folders\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Media Library Folders does not work like the file manager on your computer. It only display images and folders that have been added to the Media Library database. To display new folders that have not been added through the Media Library Folders you can click the Check for new folders option in the  Media Library Folders submenu in the WordPress Dashboard. If you allow WordPress to store images by year and month folders, then you should click the option once each month to add these auto-generated folders.</p>\n<p>To add images that were upload to the site via the cPanel or by FTP, navigate to the folder containing the images in  Media Library Folders and click the Sync button. This will scan the folder looking images not currently found in the Media Library for that folder. The Sync function only scans the current folder. If there are subfolders, you will need to individually sync them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='folders%20loads%20indefinitely'>\nFolders Loads Indefinitely\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This happens when a parent folder is missing from the folder data. To fix this you will need to perform a reset of the Media Library Folders database. To do this, deactivate Media Library Folders and activate Media Library Folders Reset and select the Reset Database option. Once the reset has completed, reactivate Media Library Folders and it will do a fresh scan of the Media Library data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='unable%20to%20insert%20files%20from%20media%20library%20folders%20into%20posts%20or%20pages'>\nUnable to Insert files from Media Library Folders into Posts or Pages\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For inserting images and files into posts and pages you will have to use the existing Media Library. The ability to insert items from the Media Library Folders user interface is only available in <a href=\"http://www.maxgalleria.com/downloads/media-library-plus-pro/?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=mlfp&amp;utm_content=mlpp&amp;utm_campaign=repo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Media Library Folders Pro</a>. This does not mean you cannot insert files added to Media Library Folders into any WordPress posts or pages. Media Library Folders adds a folder user interface and file operations to the existing media library and it does not add a second media library. Since all the images are in the same media library there is no obstacle to inserting them anywhere WordPress allows media files to be inserted. There is just no folder tree available in the media library insert window for locating images in a particular folder. We chose to include the folder tree for inserting images in posts and page in the Pro version along with other features in order to fund the cost of providing free technical support and continued development of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='unable%20to%20update%20media%20library%20folders%20reset'>\nUnable to Update Media Library Folders Reset\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Media Library Folders Reset is maintenance and diagnostic plugin that is included with Media Library Folders.

You will need to delete them from media library and upload them again. Also you will need to perform a reset of the Media Library Folders database. To do this, deactivate Media Library Folders and activate Media Library Folders Reset and select the Reset Database option. Once the reset has completed, reactivate Media Library Folders and it will do a fresh scan of the Media Library data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='difficulties%20uploading%20or%20dragging%20and%20dropping%20a%20large%20number%20of%20files'>\nDifficulties Uploading or Dragging and Dropping a Large Number of Files\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Limitations on web server processing time may cause dragging and dropping a large number of files to fail. An error is generated when it takes to longer then 30 seconds to move, copy or upload files. This time limitation can be increased by changing the max_execution_time setting in your site&#8217;s php.ini file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20delete%20a%20folder%3F'>\nHow to Delete a Folder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To delete a folder, right click (Ctrl-click with Macs) on a folder.

Click the delete option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='fatal%20error%3A%20maximum%20execution%20time%20exceeded'>\nFatal error: Maximum execution time exceeded\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Maximum execution time error takes place when moving, syncing or uploading too many files at one time. The web site’s server has a setting for how long it can be busy with a task. Depending on your server, size of files and the transmission speed of your internet, you may need to reduce the number of files you upload or move at one time.</p>\n<p>It is possible to change the maximum execution time either with a plugin such as WP Maximum Execution Time Exceeded or by editing your site’s .htaccess file and adding this line:</p>\n<p>php_value max_execution_time 300</p>\n<p>Which will raise the maximum execution time to five minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20upload%20multiple%20files'>\nHow to Upload Multiple Files\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Users can upload multiple files by using drag and drop. When the Add Files button is click it revels the file upload area either single or multiple files can be highlight can be dragged from you computer’s file manager and dropped into the file uploads areas.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='cannot%20rename%20or%20move%20a%20folder'>\nCannot Rename or Move a Folder\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because most images and files in the media library have corresponding links embedded in site’s posts and pages, Media Library Folders does not allow folders to be rename or moved in order to prevent breaking these links. Rather, to rename or move a folder, one needs to create a new folder and move the files from the old folder to the new.

It not only allows you to organize your image files in your WP site, but it also creates logical URL links to your files based on the folders you create and the name of the image file. So great! No more random numbers for image URL’s.</p>\n<p><strong>Great for organization and better media!</strong> WordPress’s default media folders didn’t work for us on a project with strict requirements on organizing their uploaded files. We had trouble finding a low-impact solution that fulfilled all requirements.</p>\n<p>Media Library Plus solved all our issues, and we’ve been using it on a major site with 11 custom post types, hundreds of media files, and tons of other plugins/customizations — zero issues and exactly what we need!</p>\n<p>MLP performs beautifully and provides great media management features and functionality!
