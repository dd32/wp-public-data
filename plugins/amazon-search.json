This saves your server from having to process the XML itself.</p>\n<p>It uses css to format the search widget and the search results.  It will look in its css dir for theme-specific css files<br />\ntoo, so if you have one in there called <strong>your-theme-name.css</strong>, it will include it after <strong>default.css</strong>.  This way you may<br />\ncustomize search results for a given theme by dropping in a new css file.  So if you allow your users to switch themes, you can include<br />\na css file for each one and the search will look correct when it is switched.</p>\n<h4>Version History</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>v1.2.0 [23 March 2009]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[fix] fixes for potential installation problems on WordPress 2.7</li>\n<li>[new] add buttons to the TinyMCE and QuickTag editors to make the Amazon markup easier [code from <a href=\"http://sillybean.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stephanie Leary</a> &#8211; thanks Stephanie!]</li>\n<li>[new] new editor buttons are optional [They are on by default but may be turned off in the preferences.]</li>\n<li>[new] made the search part of the plugin optional [If you just want to use the text links, search may be completely disabled in the preferences.]</li>\n<li>[other] code reorganization and cleanup</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.1.3 [20 July 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[fix] fix dumbness introduced in 1.1.2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.1.2 [20 July 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[new] code refactoring of the ipNation stuff for some future work</li>\n<li>[new] check if the ip2Nation database is installed when displaying options on the admin page</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.1.1 [23 May 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[fix] fix for PHP 4.x</li>\n<li>[fix] better integration with Silver Light theme</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.1.0 [26 Apr 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[new] added ability to specify a text link in posts by using a special tag: [amazon asin=0123456789]link text[/amazon]</li>\n<li>[new] new text links will use <a href=\"http://www.ip2nation.com/ip2nation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ip2Nation database</a> to do simple geo-location</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.0.2 [02 Apr 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[fix] fix default XSL path</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.0.1 [22 Mar 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[new] add CSS for Silver Light theme</li>\n<li>[fix] fix incorrect paths due to last-minute name change</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>v1.0.0 [08 Jan 2008]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>initial version</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Configuring The Plugin</h3>\n<p>In the Admin section, under <strong>Settings -&gt; Amazon Search</strong> you may configure the following:</p>\n<h4>Associate IDs</h4>\n<p>In this section, fill in any associate IDs you have.  You may also select one of the servers to be the<br />\ndefault for your users.  If you live in France, you might choose the amazon.fr server, for example.<br />\nAny IDs left blank will be filled in with mine.</p>\n<h4>Development Contribution</h4>\n<p>Ah, here&#8217;s the hook!  I&#8217;ve set it up so that every &#8216;N&#8217; searches [or page displays if you are using the text links],<br />\nthe links which are produced use my<br />\nassociate IDs.  You can choose a value for &#8216;N&#8217; here.  No need to go hacking if you don&#8217;t want to support<br />\ndevelopment &#8211; just set it to 0 and it won&#8217;t ever substitute my associate IDs.</p>\n<h4>Text Links</h4>\n<p>If <strong>Use Text Links</strong> is on, the plugin will process your posts looking for a special markup and convert them to links.</p>\n<p>To add a text link to an Amazon product, simply use the following format:</p>\n<p>[amazon ASIN=0743279794]Fancy Title[/amazon]</p>\n<p>ISBN may be used in place of ASIN &#8211; they are effectively the same thing.  It is a case-insensitive match, so &#8216;asin&#8217; is the same as &#8216;ASIN&#8217;.</p>\n<p>This tag will be converted to a link of the form:</p>\n<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0743279794/?tag=yourTag-20&#8243;&gt;Fancy Title&lt;/a&gt;</p>\n<p>If you have <strong>Use ip2Nation</strong> checked and the <a href=\"http://www.ip2nation.com/ip2nation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ip2Nation database</a> is installed, it may be used to locate the best Amazon site for the visitor.  Any country not handled specially will<br />\nuse your default Amazon server.  If you have the <strong>Development Contribution</strong> set in your prefs, a page load will count as a &#8216;search&#8217;.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The handling of which Amazon site is best per country is incomplete at best.  I would appreciate any feedback or additions/corrections<br />\nto the list [which is found in the getAmazonServerFromIP() function in amz-search.php].</p>\n<p><strong>Add Editor Buttons</strong> allows you to turn off the additional buttons in the editors which provide a quick way to enter an amazon link.</p>\n<h4>Searching</h4>\n<p><strong>Use Searching</strong> allows you to turn off the search capability completely in case you just want to use the text links.</p>\n<p><strong>Default Category</strong> is the one that will be used when the user searches from the widget.  When they<br />\nget the results, they will be able to change the category on the search page.</p>\n<p><strong>Default Search Term</strong> is what is used if the user doesn&#8217;t enter a search term.  Right now it defaults<br />\nto &#8216;WordPress&#8217;.  You will probably want to change it to something appropriate to your site.</p>\n<p>You may specify an XSLT file that will be sent to the amazon servers for processing.  <strong>This file must be publicly<br />\naccessible</strong> because the amazon servers will be reading it to provide formatting.<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t know what this means, you better leave it alone.  The XSLT file may be edited if you want to<br />\ncustomise the results produced by the search.  I am certainly <em>not</em> an XSLT expert, so if you have any suggestions,<br />\nplease contact me.</p>\n<p>You may also set the size of the images that are to be returned in the search or &#8216;None&#8217; to turn them off.<br />\nWatch out if you set this to &#8216;Large&#8217;!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the whole amazon-search directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory [it must be called amazon-search]</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Configure it using the <strong>Settings -&gt; Amazon Search</strong> page in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Appearance -&gt; Widgets</strong> page and drag the <strong>Amazon Search</strong> widget into a sidebar.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why do I just get a bunch of text when I search?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check that <strong>XSL file</strong> is set properly in your prefs and is a full URL to an externally visible file.  The Amazon servers will grab<br />\nthis file to format your results.</p>\n<p>Note that if you change the XSL file it may take a minute or two for the Amazon server&#8217;s cache to update it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What did you use for development?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 2.7.1</li>\n<li>MAMP 1.7.1</li>\n<li>Firefox 3.1b3</li>\n<li>MacOS X 10.5.6</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>What are some of the limitations?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>you cannot choose the sorting order</li>\n<li>you cannot choose which item data that is shown in the result [unless you know XSLT]</li>\n<li>the search part of the plugin requires that your HTTP server have cURL support</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Uh&#8230; Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I originally wrote this for the Geeklog CMS.  When I wrote it, Amazon did not provide widgets,<br />\nand Amazon Associates received more income for direct links than for others.  So I wrote this so Associates could<br />\ngenerate more direct-link income from their sites.</p>\n<p>Amazon now provides a widget that does most of what the search provides.  What it doesn&#8217;t do is integrate nicely with your website.  This plugin<br />\nis intended to provide seamless integration with your site&#8217;s theme and give you more control over the layout and information presented.</p>\n<p>After porting the search facility I added support for the special tags to add text links to posts. <a href=\"http://sillybean.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stephanie Leary</a> then<br />\nprovided me with some code to add buttons to the editors which I modified and included with the plugin.</p>\n<p>If I get decent feedback and people are using it, I will continue to improve it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I contact you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can email my gmail account <strong>imol00</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
