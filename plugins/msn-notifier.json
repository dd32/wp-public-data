Setup the plugin in the option page.</p>\n<p>Now the plugin can use three method to synchronize with your MSNSpace: PHP mail() function, linux sendmail, and SMTP, basically what&#8217;s supported by wp-includes/class-phpmailer.php. The mail and sendmail methods are recommended, which requires little setup. You just need to provide your MSNSpace email publishing address, your domain name in the plugin option page.</p>\n<p>REMINDER: Add your msnnotifier@yourdomainn to MSNSpace&#8217;s email publishing from address.</p>\n<p>The SMTP method is still included but it no longer works for Gmail which requires a SSL connection not supported by wordpress&#8217;s phpmailer class. Install a newer version of phpmailer may solve the problem and you will have change the source yourself. SMTP Authencation is always used for SMTP method.</p>\n"
