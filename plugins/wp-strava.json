Included are several widgets and shortcodes for showing maps and activity summaries.</p>\n<h4>Blocks</h4>\n<p><em>Available in WordPress 5.0 and up.</em></p>\n<p>Embeds described in this section will only work in the WP Block (Gutenberg) editor. Compatibility with WPBakery, Visual Composer, Elementor, Beaver Builder, etc. may differ.</p>\n<h3>Strava Activity</h3>\n<p>Embed an activity in any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a map key has been added.</p>\n<p>Paste in the full activity URL from Strava, such as https://www.strava.com/activities/1793155844 and click &#8220;Embed&#8221; (pasting a link directly into the editor also works). A preview map will be shown in the editor, similar to what will be displayed on the front-end.

In the side-panel you can select options to show the image only (without the details table), display markers at the start &amp; finish points, and override the system of measure from your default selection under Settings -&gt; Strava.</p>\n<h4>Shortcodes</h4>\n<p>[activity id=NUMBER] &#8211; add to any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a map key has been added.</p>\n<p>You should replace NUMBER with an activity ID from Strava. The easiest way to find it is from a Strava URL like https://www.strava.com/activities/1793155844 &#8211; where 1793155844 is the activity ID number.</p>\n<p>Also takes the following optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>som &#8211; english/metric (system of measure &#8211; override from default setting).</li>\n<li>map_width &#8211; width (width of image in pixels). Note both width and height parameters are limited to 640px except on premium API plans: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/dev-guide#Imagesizes</li>\n<li>map_height &#8211; height (height of image in pixels). See note above on max height.</li>\n<li>client_id &#8211; specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).</li>\n<li>markers &#8211; Display markers at the start/finish point (true/false, defaults to false).</li>\n<li>image_only &#8211; Display only the map image and not the table (true/false, defaults to false).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[ride] &#8211; an alias for [activity] that will accept the same parameters (kept for backwards compatibility).</p>\n<p>[route id=NUMBER] &#8211; add to any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a google maps key has been added.</p>\n<p>You should replace NUMBER with an route ID from Strava. The easiest way to find it is from a Strava URL like https://www.strava.com/routes/9001676 &#8211; where 9001676 is the route ID number.</p>\n<p>This also takes the same optional parameters as the [activity] shortcode above.</p>\n<p>[activities] &#8211; shows a list of recent activities the same way the &#8220;Strava Activities List&#8221; Widget does, but with a shortcode rather than a widget. Takes the following optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>som &#8211; english/metric (system of measure &#8211; override from default setting).</li>\n<li>quantity &#8211; number of activities to show.</li>\n<li>client_id &#8211; specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).</li>\n<li>strava_club_id &#8211; Will display activity from the specified Strava club ID instead of an athlete.</li>\n<li>date_start &#8211; Will display activities after specified date &#8211; must be <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP DateTime compatible</a>.</li>\n<li>date_end &#8211; Will display activities before the specified date &#8211; must be <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP DateTime compatible</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[latest_map] &#8211; shows a map of your latest activity. Takes the following optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>som &#8211; english/metric (system of measure &#8211; override from default setting).</li>\n<li>distance_min &#8211; show only the latest activity longer than this distance in km/mi.</li>\n<li>client_id &#8211; specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Widgets</h4>\n<p>Strava Activities List &#8211; shows a list of the most recent activities.</p>\n<p>Strava Latest Map &#8211; shows map of latest activity with option to limit latest map to activities of a certain minimum distance.</p>\n<h4>Cron</h4>\n<p>Using WP-Strava 2.0+ may require a WordPress cron configuration. By default, WordPress has a built-in cron system to run scheduled events, but it relies on your website getting frequent visitors. The Strava authentication token system expires after 6 hours if not refreshed. If you think your site will not get any visitors over the span on 6 hours, you might want to set up a <em>real</em> cron: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/. Setting up this sort of cron is beyond the scope of support for this free plugin, so you should seek assistance through your host. Force-running the WordPress cron once an hour is good enough for WP-Strava.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20getting%20%22error%20401%20unauthorized%22%3F'>\nWhy am I getting &#8220;ERROR 401 Unauthorized&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) There may be an issue with app authentication. In some cases it appears that the credentials from authorizing with your Strava app may not save into the database. If you&#8217;re experiencing &#8220;ERROR 401 Unauthorized&#8221; on everything, that may be the case. Steps to help diagnose this are here: https://github.com/cmanon/wp-strava/issues/109</p>\n<p>2) There may be an issue with multiple athlete&#8217;s activities. If you&#8217;re seeing &#8220;ERROR 401 Unauthorized&#8221; only on certain activities, this may be the case. When you have multiple athletes saved, the first is considered to be the default athlete. If you display activity from anyone other than the default athlete, you must add the athlete client ID (found on the wp-strava settings page) to the shortcode, such as client_id=17791.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20my%20google%20map%20not%20showing%20up%3F'>\nWhy is my Google Map not showing up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your API key works with other Google Maps plugins but not WP-Strava, you may need to enable the &#8220;Static Maps&#8221; functionality on your google account. This is especially true for people using G Suite accounts (not just a @gmail.com address). While logged into your G Suite email, visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/static-maps-backend.googleapis.com/?q=static and make sure the &#8220;Static Maps API&#8221; is enabled. For more details see https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-data-errors/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20recently%20uploaded%20an%20activity%2C%20why%20is%20it%20not%20showing%20on%20my%20site%3F'>\nI recently uploaded an activity, why is it not showing on my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP-Strava caches activity for one hour so your site doesn&#8217;t hit the Strava API on every page load. If you recently uploaded activity and want to see it right away, go to the Settings -&gt; Strava in the wp-admin dashboard, check the checkbox labeled &#8220;Clear cache (images &amp; transient data)&#8221; and then click Save Changes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20remove%20and%20add%20an%20athlete%20at%20the%20same%20time%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I remove and add an athlete at the same time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the WP-Strava settings page you cannot currently remove and add another athlete at the same time. This is a known limitation. WP-Strava will remove the athlete(s) that you cleared the ID/Nickname fields for, but the new athlete will no be added. Please complete the add/remove operations as separate save actions on the WP-Strava settings page.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

In the side-panel you can select options to show the image only (without the details table), display markers at the start &amp; finish points, and override the system of measure from your default selection under Settings -&gt; Strava.</p>\n<h4>Shortcodes</h4>\n<p>[activity id=NUMBER] &#8211; add to any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a map key has been added.</p>\n<p>You should replace NUMBER with an activity ID from Strava. The easiest way to find it is from a Strava URL like https://www.strava.com/activities/1793155844 &#8211; where 1793155844 is the activity ID number.</p>\n<p>Also takes the following optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>som &#8211; english/metric (system of measure &#8211; override from default setting).</li>\n<li>map_width &#8211; width (width of image in pixels). Note both width and height parameters are limited to 640px except on premium API plans: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/dev-guide#Imagesizes</li>\n<li>map_height &#8211; height (height of image in pixels). See note above on max height.</li>\n<li>client_id &#8211; specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).</li>\n<li>markers &#8211; Display markers at the start/finish point (true/false, defaults to false).</li>\n<li>image_only &#8211; Display only the map image and not the table (true/false, defaults to false).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[ride] &#8211; an alias for [activity] that will accept the same parameters (kept for backwards compatibility).</p>\n<p>[route id=NUMBER] &#8211; add to any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a google maps key has been added.</p>\n<p>You should replace NUMBER with an route ID from Strava. The easiest way to find it is from a Strava URL like https://www.strava.com/routes/9001676 &#8211; where 9001676 is the route ID number.</p>\n<p>This also takes the same optional parameters as the [activity] shortcode above.</p>\n<p>[activities] &#8211; shows a list of recent activities the same way the &#8220;Strava Activities List&#8221; Widget does, but with a shortcode rather than a widget. Takes the following optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>som &#8211; english/metric (system of measure &#8211; override from default setting).</li>\n<li>quantity &#8211; number of activities to show.</li>\n<li>client_id &#8211; specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).</li>\n<li>strava_club_id &#8211; Will display activity from the specified Strava club ID instead of an athlete.</li>\n<li>date_start &#8211; Will display activities after specified date &#8211; must be <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP DateTime compatible</a>.</li>\n<li>date_end &#8211; Will display activities before the specified date &#8211; must be <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP DateTime compatible</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[latest_map] &#8211; shows a map of your latest activity. Takes the following optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>som &#8211; english/metric (system of measure &#8211; override from default setting).</li>\n<li>distance_min &#8211; show only the latest activity longer than this distance in km/mi.</li>\n<li>client_id &#8211; specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Widgets</h4>\n<p>Strava Activities List &#8211; shows a list of the most recent activities.</p>\n<p>Strava Latest Map &#8211; shows map of latest activity with option to limit latest map to activities of a certain minimum distance.</p>\n<h4>Cron</h4>\n<p>Using WP-Strava 2.0+ may require a WordPress cron configuration. By default, WordPress has a built-in cron system to run scheduled events, but it relies on your website getting frequent visitors. The Strava authentication token system expires after 6 hours if not refreshed. If you think your site will not get any visitors over the span on 6 hours, you might want to set up a <em>real</em> cron: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/. Setting up this sort of cron is beyond the scope of support for this free plugin, so you should seek assistance through your host. Force-running the WordPress cron once an hour is good enough for WP-Strava.</p>\n",
