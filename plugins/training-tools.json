        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Method 1: Move folder inside the .zip file into the &#8220;wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory if your website is stored locally. Then upload the new plugin folder using your FTP program.</li>\n<li>Method 2: Use your hosting control panels file manager to upload the plugin folder (not the .zip, only the folder inside it) to the &#8220;wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory.</li>\n<li>Method 3: In your WordPress admin click on Plugins then click on Add New. You can search for your plugin there and perform the installation easily. This method does not apply to premium plugins.</li>\n</ol>\n",

There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not<br />\nhelp you &#8211; look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want<br />\nto avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version &#8211; do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation<br />\n(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different<br />\nenvironment for WTG Task Manager &#8211; possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common<br />\nin software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.</p>\n"
