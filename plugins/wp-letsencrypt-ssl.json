Your reviews are our biggest motivation for further development of plugin.</p>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>WP Encryption uses SSLLabs API for SSL scan &amp; detection. By using the plugin, you agree to terms &amp; conditions of <a href=\"https://www.ssllabs.com/downloads/Qualys_SSL_Labs_Terms_of_Use.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SSLLabs</a></p>\n<p>By enabling the Vulnerability Scan feature, you agree to terms &amp; conditions of <a href=\"https://vulnerability.wpsysadmin.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPVulnerability Database API</a>. The information provided by the information database comes from different sources that have been reviewed by third parties. There is no liability of any kind for the information.</p>\n<p>Security is an important subject regarding SSL/TLS certificates, of course. It is obvious that your private key, stored on your web server, should never be accessible from the web. When the plugin created the keys directory for the first time, it will store a .htaccess file in this directory, denying all visitors. Always make sure yourself your keys aren&#8217;t accessible from the web! We are in no way responsible if your private keys go public. If this does happen, the easiest solution is to check folder permissions on your server and make sure public access is forbidden for root folders. Next, create a new certificate.</p>\n",

It is obvious that your private key, stored on your web server, should never be accessible from the web. When the plugin created the keys directory for the first time, it will store a .htaccess file in this directory, denying all visitors. Always make sure yourself your keys aren&#8217;t accessible from the web! We are in no way responsible if your private keys go public. If this does happen, the easiest solution is to check folder permissions on your server and make sure public access is forbidden for root folders. Next, create a new certificate.</p>\n",
