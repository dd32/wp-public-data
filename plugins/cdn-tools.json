You can sideload data to a commercial CDN or just load your larger JS libraries (prototype, jquery) for <strong>free</strong> from Google&#8217;s servers.  CDN Tools has been designed to be as easy to use as possible, so give it a shot!  Your blog&#8217;s readers will thank you.  At this time the only commercial CDN supported is Cloud Files.  Check out the plugin homepage to view a screencast.</p>\n<p><strong>1.0 requires you to reload your files! Do not upgrade until you&#8217;re ready to reload.</strong></p>\n<p>Catch new releases and other information about my plugins by following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/reaperhulk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@reaperhulk</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://langui.sh/cdn-tools/\" title=\"CDN Tools Home\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">View complete changelog</a>.</p>\n<h3>CDN Loader Dev FAQ</h3>\n<h4>How do I create a new CDN class?</h4>\n<p>Create a directory in cdn_classes named whatever the shortname will be.  Then create a file named loader.php inside with the same basic structure as the cloudfiles loader and do everything right. Then edit the cdn-tools.php file to add your item.  Easy as pie (if your pie is made of complexity).  I promise I&#8217;ll write some better instructions so third parties can contribute CDN plugins at some point.  Currently CDN Tools probably makes some assumptions that are Cloud Files specific.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<pre><code>Copyright 2010 Paul Kehrer\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Click it!</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re all set!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Could you add XXXX CDN compatibility?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;m likely too busy to do this for your CDN, but I&#8217;d be happy to answer questions if you need some assistance in developing your own!  If you write a plugin, please let me know so I can merge it into the main distribution.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I found a bug. What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact me!  This is a complex plugin and the only way I can ensure it&#8217;s robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up.  Please include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog&#8217;s site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, et cetera).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WP 3.0 compatibility</li>\n<li>Changed method of storing info about sideloaded files to be far more robust.</li>\n<li>Use directory structure on Cloud Files (uses just one container now)</li>\n<li>Now CDNifies post thumbnails as well (WP 2.9+ feature)</li>\n<li>Fix for blogs using SSL</li>\n<li>Caches credentials for more rapid initial loads/multiple media attach uploads.</li>\n<li>You can now define constants in wp-config for plugin configuration. This allows to configure settings that will be active on all end-user sites without allowing them to see/edit the config. If you define constants the CDN Tools admin page will not register a configuration page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.99</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Log retention support (in advanced options)</li>\n<li>Servicenet flag (in advanced options)</li>\n<li>Both these features were added courtesy of John Dickinson</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.98</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 2.9 support.  CDN Tools can now handle the image edit system introduced in WP 2.9.</li>\n<li>Better error handling for a few scenarios.</li>\n<li>As of this release WP 2.7 is no longer supported.  It might work, but future releases will almost certainly break it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.97 &#8211; 12/9/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial sideload AJAX used an absolute path with the siteurl.  This should have been a relative path or the adminurl to accommodate situations where FORCE_SSL_ADMIN is defined.  Thanks to John for identifying the bug.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.96 &#8211; 12/4/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded and (temporarily) forked CloudFiles API to fix bugs related to safe_mode and content type detection.  This means you shouldn&#8217;t see badcontenttype exceptions or &#8220;stuck at 0%&#8221; errors any more!</li>\n<li>Improved error reporting for AJAX uploads (including timeout errors, which are now set at 90 seconds)</li>\n<li>Removed loading.gif in favor of WP native spinner</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.95 &#8211; 10/25/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded to CF API 1.5.1. For users within the Rackspace network who have $_ENV[&#8216;RACKSPACE_SERVICENET&#8217;] defined, CDN Tools will now use the servicenet instead of the public network.  This should speed sideloading of large files as well as not consuming your bandwidth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.94 &#8211; 10/19/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded to CF API 1.4.  This should resolve some cURL issues users have experienced and removes the dependence on a png hack for RHEL4 users.</li>\n<li>Fixed major issue with Google AJAX CDN.  Previously users were unable to switch between visual and HTML mode on the edit post page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.93 &#8211; 10/8/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A partial fix for issues with customers who have full file paths stored in their postmeta table.  This is not a complete fix, but should help some (most?) users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.92 – 10/5/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major upgrade to support WP 2.8. If you are a previous user of CDN Tools you MUST unload files and then load them again. Please let me know if you have issues because several major changes were made.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.81 – 5/17/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Major upgrade to the initial load for attachments. Now done via AJAX with percentage progress.</li>\n<li>Additional exception handling (this is still incomplete)</li>\n<li>Upgrade to CF API 1.3.0.</li>\n<li>WordPress MU compatible (credit John Keyes)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.72 – 2/25/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First public release, no changes from previous.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.72 – 2/22/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small bugfixes</li>\n<li>WP Super Cache compatibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.71 – 2/22/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Workaround for a MIME/PHP bug on RHEL4.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.7 – 2/17/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearing completion of initial feature set.</li>\n<li>UI rework (again)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6 – 2/15/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Huge improvements on all fronts</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4 – 2/8/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial sideload support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2 – 2/7/2009</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First release outside of my own work (seeded to Major Hayden).</li>\n<li>GoogleAJAX for Prototype, jQuery, Dojo, and mootools (free for anyone to use)</li>\n<li>Uploading JS to CloudFiles (only supported CDN presently)</li>\n<li>Supports opting out of CDN’ing wp-admin scripts.</li>\n</ul>\n"
