Our REST API handles all the server side actions so it can be utilized in <strong>faster and familiar frameworks</strong> that you prefer.</p>\n<p>CoCart Free contains everything you need to get started.</p>\n<h4>Why WooCommerce?</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce provides a <strong>flexible, and efficient</strong> way to build cutting-edge stores with WordPress at it&#8217;s core. If you are looking to provide a great store for your customers that is fast, decoupling your store is a no brainer, but accessing the front side via the REST API was missing which is where CoCart comes in.</p>\n<h4>Why CoCart?</h4>\n<p>Is your store slow? Looking to decouple away from WordPress? Overwhelmed with getting WooCommerce working the way you want in your own REST API endpoints?</p>\n<p>These are the struggles web developers have trying to decouple a WooCommerce store and with CoCart, you can overcome these challenges and get straight to utilizing a REST API that is ready for you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source of Truth</strong> &#8211; CoCart sources the WooCommerce&#8217;s Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.</li>\n<li><strong>No Cookie Required</strong> &#8211; Our session handler generates a key for the user session in the WordPress database and stores session-related meta data for use on the client without the heavy load.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic Authentication</strong> &#8211; No Admin API Keys required. Customers can login with their account either with Email+Password, Username+Password, Phone Number+Password.</li>\n<li><strong>Domain Dominance</strong> &#8211; CORS can be an issue when decoupling so we made sure you have control of the origin.</li>\n<li><strong>Your Inventory</strong> &#8211; Search products by Name, ID or SKU, filter and return product data you need without authentication or private data exposed. REST shortcuts are readily provided for your next requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Cart Checkups</strong> &#8211; We have avoided the hassle of needing multiple requests to verify item and coupon validity in your cart. Our system efficiently checks stock, calculates totals and fees, ensuring real-time accuracy so your responses return up to date every time.</li>\n<li><strong>No Headless Checkout?</strong> &#8211; Load any cart session via the native site using the generated key, if you feel more comfortable using WooCommerce’s built in payment system.</li>\n<li><strong>Need your own cart callback?</strong> &#8211; Register custom callbacks without needing to create a whole new endpoint. Cart response returns once the callback is completed.</li>\n<li><strong>Want to track your customers?</strong> &#8211; Keep watch of all cart sessions, even the ones that are starting to expire or have expired.</li>\n<li><strong>Name Your Price Built In</strong> &#8211; Give your customers control of the price they pay. Encourage your audience to support you with payment flexibility that widens your paying audience.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk Requests</strong> &#8211; Combine many cart requests in bulk to save time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze.

Just install CoCart and activate it on the sites you want to use CoCart.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20have%20wordpress%20running%20on%20one%20domain%20and%20my%20headless%20ecommerce%20on%20another%20domain%3F'>\nCan I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless ecommerce on another domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. That is what CoCart is mainly developed for. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/\" rel=\"ugc\">the CORS add-on</a> or you can manually enable it via the filters available <a href=\"https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">in the documentation</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20cocart%20interfere%20with%20other%20plugins%3F'>\nWill CoCart interfere with other plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The majority of plugins are not REST API specific so it shouldn&#8217;t. However, while we allow the source of truth for compatibility, there maybe a WooCommerce extension that returns data via an action hook that the REST API cannot understand during a specific action and may fail the response.</p>\n<p>If that does happen, simply report the situation with as much detail as possible on our <a href=\"https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a> and we will try our best to find a solution.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20up%20cocart%3F'>\nHow do I set up CoCart?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will first need WooCommerce installed and set up to your configurations. Then install CoCart, activate and your ready to start using the REST API following the API Reference provided.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please check the requirements listed in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation\" rel=\"ugc\">installation</a> section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20use%20cocart%20and%20not%20woocommerce%E2%80%99s%20store%20api%3F'>\nWhy use CoCart and not WooCommerce’s Store API?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WooCommerce’s Store API is designed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\" rel=\"ugc\">Gutenberg blocks</a> which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts. It also lacks validation on the server end which you will need and not every extensions yet works with it out of the box. A lot of valuable information and abilities that developers require to help them are also unavailable and if you try to use the Store API for headless you will have issues managing the cart sessions.</p>\n<p>CoCart&#8217;s API is designed for decoupling away from WordPress with ease. It&#8217;s a plug and play solution that just works out of the box. Also, improvements are always made to CoCart to ensure you get the best decoupled experience.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20coding%20skills%20to%20use%20cocart%3F'>\nDo I need to have coding skills to use CoCart?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20documentation%20for%20cocart%3F'>\nWhere can I find documentation for CoCart?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the documentation <a href=\"https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=wpplugindirectory&amp;utm_campaign=readme&amp;utm_content=readmelink\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20formatting%20of%20values%2C%20add%20and%20change%20details%20to%20the%20responses%3F'>\nCan I change the formatting of values, add and change details to the responses?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You certainly can.

A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default session handler only supports cookies.</li>\n<li>The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the <code>shutdown</code> hook.</li>\n<li>The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.</li>\n<li>The default session handler <strong>does not support guest customers</strong>.</li>\n<li>The default session handler <strong>does not store additional data that maybe required to help you</strong>.</li>\n<li>The default session handler <strong>does not allow support for POS capability</strong>.</li>\n<li>More consistent with modern web.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20%22woocommerce%20shipping%20and%20tax%22%20plugin%20supported%3F'>\nIs &#8220;WooCommerce Shipping and Tax&#8221; plugin supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. &#8220;WooCommerce Shipping and Tax&#8221; ignores any custom REST API&#8217;s from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. We don&#8217;t recommend it.

If your store was setup with no decimals the price would not return fully. <a href=\"https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/429\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Solves issue #429</a></li>\n<li>REST API: Value of weight was returning in the wrong format.

Unfortunately it had some unexpected side affects that were not picked up during testing. For that I am sorry. If you haven&#8217;t rolled back to before 4.2 then this patch is highly recommended.</p>\n<p>Previous patch releases will also be updated to prevent further sites from experiencing these issues for those who like to update to specific version of the plugin.</p>\n<p>A hard lesson was learned here and hope you haven&#8217;t lost trust in the plugin. I appreciate your feedback and support during this process.</p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t forget to backup your site before updating.</p>\n<h3>Corrections</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin: Typo caused the WP-CLI commands to not register and crash when used with composer.</li>\n<li>REST API: The data exception class was oddly not loading when updating an item. Autoloader was not picking it up. Now it is required.</li>\n<li>REST API: Cart would empty but the subtotal would not reset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>REST API: Ensure we have calculated totals before we get an item or update an item so we can identify them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v4.3.0 &#8211; 17th July, 2024</h4>\n<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>\n<p>In this release we have added a plugin update prevention system as a safety measure. For the moment it will detect for compatibility with minor releases while we are making adjustments but it&#8217;s designed mostly for detecting major changes. All CoCart add-ons that we release will now check for CoCart&#8217;s requirements and will help you decide to update or not until your ready to do so.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin: Added plugin headers to be used for detecting CoCart add-ons or plugins that support CoCart.</li>\n<li>WordPress Dashboard: Auto-updates are disabled should a CoCart add-on active have not tested with the latest release available.</li>\n<li>WordPress Dashboard: Update now link for CoCart opens up a modal listing none tested plugins with a confirmation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>REST API: Ensure we have calculated totals before we restore the requested item so we can identify them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These filters are for site admins more than anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced filter <code>cocart_in_plugin_update_message</code> allows you to change the upgrade notice.</li>\n<li>Introduced filter <code>cocart_get_plugins_with_header</code> allows you to get the plugins that have a valid value for a specific header.</li>\n<li>Introduced filter <code>cocart_get_plugins_for_cocart</code> allows you to get plugins which &#8220;maybe&#8221; are for CoCart.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tested with WordPress v6.6</li>\n<li>Tested with WooCommerce v9.1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v4.2.2 &#8211; 12th July, 2024</h4>\n<h3>Reverting</h3>\n<p>We are reverting a change for destroying a session. Previous change causes a conflict with identifying the correct column with our session table and causes the cart not to clear.</p>\n<h4>v4.2.1 &#8211; 11th July, 2024</h4>\n<h3>Hot Fix</h3>\n<p>When loading a cart from session a deprecated function was still triggered. It&#8217;s now been removed to prevent failing.</p>\n<h4>v4.2.0 &#8211; 11th July, 2024</h4>\n<p>In this release we have optimized our session handler making this release more compatibility with third party plugins. We also no longer use cookies as a backup for headless. This should also help with the confusion of needing to pass along the session cookie or reading the cookie to extract the cart key and help with user switching much better. A cart key is provided in both the cart response and returned headers. Saving the cart key in your own cookie or local storage is fairly straight forward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We advise that you update on staging or local to check if you have used any of our experimental functions and filters that were added to the session handler to see if any have been deprecated. You can also see the list of deprecations below. If you have any questions about this update please contact us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>REST API: Can now request a guest cart via a requested header <code>cocart-api-cart-key</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Session Handler: Improved identifying cart without the need of cookies.</li>\n<li>Session Handler: Added new function <code>is_user_customer()</code> to check the user role is a customer when authenticated before migrating cart from guest.</li>\n<li>Authentication: Validation for invalid details was taking too long and failed to return an error message.</li>\n<li>REST API: Updating the customer details in cart will now take additional billing and shipping fields as meta data.

    "short_description": "Make your WooCommerce store headless with CoCart, a REST API designed for decoupling.",
    "description": "<p>CoCart&#8217;s mission is <strong>decoupling your WooCommerce store</strong> with our developer friendly REST API extension.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=wpplugindirectory&amp;utm_campaign=readme&amp;utm_content=readmelink\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CoCart</a> is a <strong>customizable, open-source REST API solution</strong> built for WooCommerce that is ready to decouple away from WordPress, allowing you to design and build without limitations imposed by a WordPress theme that is harder to modify and optimize. Our REST API handles all the server side actions so it can be utilized in <strong>faster and familiar frameworks</strong> that you prefer.</p>\n<p>CoCart Free contains everything you need to get started.</p>\n<h4>Why WooCommerce?</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce provides a <strong>flexible, and efficient</strong> way to build cutting-edge stores with WordPress at it&#8217;s core. If you are looking to provide a great store for your customers that is fast, decoupling your store is a no brainer, but accessing the front side via the REST API was missing which is where CoCart comes in.</p>\n<h4>Why CoCart?</h4>\n<p>Is your store slow? Looking to decouple away from WordPress? Overwhelmed with getting WooCommerce working the way you want in your own REST API endpoints?</p>\n<p>These are the struggles web developers have trying to decouple a WooCommerce store and with CoCart, you can overcome these challenges and get straight to utilizing a REST API that is ready for you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Source of Truth</strong> &#8211; CoCart sources the WooCommerce&#8217;s Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.</li>\n<li><strong>No Cookie Required</strong> &#8211; Our session handler generates a key for the user session in the WordPress database and stores session-related meta data for use on the client without the heavy load.</li>\n<li><strong>Basic Authentication</strong> &#8211; No Admin API Keys required. Customers can login with their account either with Email+Password, Username+Password, Phone Number+Password.</li>\n<li><strong>Domain Dominance</strong> &#8211; CORS can be an issue when decoupling so we made sure you have control of the origin.</li>\n<li><strong>Your Inventory</strong> &#8211; Search products by Name, ID or SKU, filter and return product data you need without authentication or private data exposed. REST shortcuts are readily provided for your next requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Cart Checkups</strong> &#8211; We have avoided the hassle of needing multiple requests to verify item and coupon validity in your cart. Our system efficiently checks stock, calculates totals and fees, ensuring real-time accuracy so your responses return up to date every time.</li>\n<li><strong>No Headless Checkout?</strong> &#8211; Load any cart session via the native site using the generated key, if you feel more comfortable using WooCommerce’s built in payment system.</li>\n<li><strong>Need your own cart callback?</strong> &#8211; Register custom callbacks without needing to create a whole new endpoint. Cart response returns once the callback is completed.</li>\n<li><strong>Want to track your customers?</strong> &#8211; Keep watch of all cart sessions, even the ones that are starting to expire or have expired.</li>\n<li><strong>Name Your Price Built In</strong> &#8211; Give your customers control of the price they pay. Encourage your audience to support you with payment flexibility that widens your paying audience.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk Requests</strong> &#8211; Combine many cart requests in bulk to save time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze.
