You need full access to your web server to be able to allow for the WASM file type to load. Without this access you will not be able to run the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20get%20paid%20support%3F'>\nCan I Get Paid Support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, we offer subscription to support for our plugins and consultation to help get your project started and to a professional level.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20see%20other%20projects%20that%20are%20using%20cardanopress%3F'>\nWhere Can I See Other Projects That Are Using CardanoPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you visit our main website, <a href=\"https://cardanopress.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CardanoPress.io</a>, there will be a section dedicated to all the websites and projects that have built using CardanoPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20customise%20the%20look%20and%20feel%20of%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I customise the look and feel of the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve built the plugin and sub plugins with hooks and template layouts that can over overridden in a child theme. We&#8217;ve followed the same methods as WooCommerce where you simply need to copy the template files into your child theme to start overriding the layouts.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also taking into account page builders and created short codes for all the template parts of the theme. This will allow builders such as Divi, Elementor, WPBakery to be used with CardanoPress.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
