Click and drag it over to your chosen sidebar, and it’ll open up automatically.</li>\n<li>Fill in the header. This is the widget title, and it’ll display above your books.</li>\n<li>Enter a single Book ID, or a comma separated list of Book IDs in the order in which you want them to appear. They&#8217;ll be listed on the same row. You can choose to display more fields than just the cover and sales links.

Check your site and click on the cover images to see the menu slide out from the bottom.</li>\n<li>If you want to use the shortcodes, please refer to the <a href=\"https://claireryanauthor.com/btbe-user-manual/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">user manual</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
