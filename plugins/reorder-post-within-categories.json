        "description": "<p>Due to a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50070\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bug</a> in WordPress core, archive taxonomy queries are not being ranked properly on the front end.  If your <strong>posts are not being ranked on your front-end site</strong> please read this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/help-the-pluign-is-not-working/\" rel=\"ugc\">thread</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>v2.3 is now multi-post taxonomy enabled.  A taxonomy registered with multiple post types can has its term&#8217;s posts in each type ranked manually and separately.</p>\n<p><strong>UPGRADE NOTE</strong> if you are upgrading from v1.x, your old ranking data remains unaffected in the custom table used by the v1.x plugin.  However, in v2.x all the ranking is now stored as post meta.  While upgrading, some users have complained of missing posts/lost rankings.  If this is the case, you can reset your order for given term using the reset checkbox/button provided in the admin page (see screenshot #4).  It will reload the ranking from the v1.x custom table.  Please read FAQ #17 for more information on how to migrate your data.</p>\n<p>If your term was not sorted in the v1.x table or you are upgrading from v2.0.x or v2.1.x, then the reset button will reload the post order as per the default WP post table listing, which can be changed using the filtrs provided (see FAQ #7).</p>\n<p>ReOrder Post Within Categories is used to sort posts (and custom post type) in any custom order by drag &amp; drop interface.<br />\nIt works with a selected category, each category can have different order of same post.</p>\n<p>New enhanced <strong>version 2.0</strong> with grid-layout and multi-drag interface to ease sorting of large list of posts.

You need to explicitly set it to false in your custom queries to ensure you retrieve yours posts in the right order.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='2.i%20want%20to%20order%20posts%20in%20non-hierarchical%20taxonomies%20%28tags%29'>\n2.I want to order posts in non-hierarchical taxonomies (tags)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the plugin allows you to order posts only within hierarchical taxonomies (categories).  This is done as a means to ensure one doesn&#8217;t have spurious orders as allowing both tags and category ordering could lead to users trying to order a post in both and this would create issues which have not been tested by this author.  Hence tread with caution if you enable this in your functions.php file,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('reorder_post_within_categories_and_tags', '__return__true');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keep in mind that you will now see <code>Pages</code> as a post type to re-order, selecting such post types which do not have any categories associated with it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='3.i%20want%20limit%2Fenable%20roles%20that%20can%20re-order%20posts'>\n3.I want limit/enable roles that can re-order posts\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since v1.3.0 a new filter has been added that allows you to do that.  Make sure you return a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#roles\" rel=\"ugc\">valid capability</a>,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('reorder_post_within_categories_capability', 'enable_editors', 10,2);\nfunction enable_editors($capability, $post_type){\n    //you can filter based on the post type\n    if('my-users-posts' == $post_type){\n        $capability = 'publish_posts'; //Author role.\n    }\n    return $capability;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>if an unknown capability is returned, the plugin will default back to &#8216;manage_categories&#8217; which is an administrator&#8217;s capability.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='4.i%20am%20uninstalling%20this%20plugin%2C%20how%20do%20i%20removed%20the%20custom%20table%20data%20%3F'>\n4.I am uninstalling this plugin, how do I removed the custom table data ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can now flag the custom sql table to be deleted when you disable the plugin from your dashboard with the following filter,<br />\n     add_filter(&#8216;reorder_post_within_categories_delete_custom_table&#8217;, &#8216;__return__true&#8217;)<br />\nnote that this filter is fired when you disable the plugin in the dashboard.  So make sure it is activated when you set this filter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='5.can%20newly%20published%20posts%20be%20ranked%20first%20rather%20than%20last%3F'>\n5.Can newly published posts be ranked first rather than last?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, as of v2.0 newly published posts can be ranked first instead of last by default using the following filter,</p>\n<pre><code>add-filter('reorder_post_within_categories_new_post_first', 'rank_new_posts', 10, 3);\nfunction rank_new_posts($is_first, $post, $term_id){\n    $is_first = true;\n    //you can filter by taxonomy term, or other post parameters.\n    //WP_Post $post object being ranked;\n    //$term_id for which the post is rank is being inserted.\n    return $is_first;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>NOTE: the post-type must already have a manual ranking for that category term for this hook to fire.  TO ensure this, go to the post ReOrder admin page, select the category term and manually order a couple of post, this is enough to ensure this hook fires.  Even if you have the manual ranking radio-toggle to &#8216;No&#8217;, this hook will still fire.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='6.%20is%20it%20possible%20to%20customise%20the%20text%20on%20the%20sortable%20cards%3F'>\n6. Is it possible to customise the text on the sortable cards?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. On v2+ of this plugin, the sortable cards are now displaying the thumbnail of each posts along with the title.  The title text can be changed or added to in case you require additional meta fields to be displayed to help you manually rank your posts.  To achieve this, hook the following filter,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter ('reorder_posts_within_category_card_text', 'custom_card_text', 10,3 );\nfunction custom_card_text($text, $post,$term_id){\n  //the $text is set to the title fo the post by default.\n  //$post is the WP_Post object.\n  //$term_id is the taxonomy term being sorted.\n  $text = '&lt;div&gt;'.$text.'&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;'.get_post_meta($post-&gt;ID, 'custom-field', true).'&lt;/div&gt;';\n  return $text;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='7.%20the%20initial%20order%20of%20post%20is%20chronological%2C%20can%20it%20be%20changed%3F'>\n7. The initial order of post is chronological, can it be changed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, by default the first time you manually sort your posts, they will be presented in the same order as your post table, namely by post data.  There are 3 possible alternative default order you can set,<br />\n1.reverse chronological by hooking this filter,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('reorder_posts_within_category_initial_order', 'reverse_order', 10, 3);\nfunction reverse_order($reverse, $post_type, $term_id){\n  //$reverse is a boolean flag.\n  //$post_type for the current posts being ranked.\n  //$term_id of the taxonomy term for which the posts are being ranked.\n  return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>by alphabetical title order, using the following hook,</p>\n<p>add_filter(&#8216;reorder_posts_within_category_initial_orderby&#8217;, &#8216;chronological_or_alphabetical_order&#8217;, 10, 3);<br />\nfunction chronological_or_alphabetical_order($is_alpha, $post_type, $term_id){<br />\n  //$is_alpha is a boolean flag set to false by default.<br />\n  //$post_type for the current posts being ranked.<br />\n  //$term_id of the taxonomy term for which the posts are being ranked.<br />\n  return true;<br />\n}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>or by reverse alphabetical title order, using both of the above hooks,</p>\n<p>add_filter(&#8216;reorder_posts_within_category_initial_order&#8217;, &#8216;reverse_order&#8217;, 10, 3);<br />\nfunction reverse_order($reverse, $post_type, $term_id){<br />\n  //$reverse is a boolean flag.<br />\n  //$post_type for the current posts being ranked.<br />\n  //$term_id of the taxonomy term for which the posts are being ranked.<br />\n  return true;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;reorder_posts_within_category_initial_orderby&#8217;, &#8216;chronological_or_alphabetical_order&#8217;, 10, 3);<br />\nfunction chronological_or_alphabetical_order($is_alpha, $post_type, $term_id){<br />\n  //$is_alpha is a boolean flag set to false by default.<br />\n  //$post_type for the current posts being ranked.<br />\n  //$term_id of the taxonomy term for which the posts are being ranked.<br />\n  return true;<br />\n}</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>as of v2.4 it is now possible to programmatically rank the intial post order, see FAQ 11.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='8.%20when%20i%20drag%20the%20slider%2C%20both%20sliders%20move%20and%20the%20number%20of%20loaded%20posts%20remain%20fixed.'>\n8. When I drag the slider, both sliders move and the number of loaded posts remain fixed.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you have a large number of posts in a category, the controls move when the limit of posts to display is reached.</p>\n<p>This to reduce the load on the server. WP limits REST api posts to 100, and this is the base value used. However, the plugin uses a dynamic approach, based on a square grid, hence when your posts grid number of columns equates the number of rows, the slider will automatically adjust the non-dragged slider button to maintain that square.</p>\n<p>If you wish to display more posts, reduce your window zoom level (ctrl+mouse scroll on firefox/chrome), this will force the number of columns to expand and therefore the js script will allow more posts to be loaded until the rows match the columns.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='9.%20multi-post%20taxonomy%20query%20not%20ranked'>\n9. Multi-post taxonomy query not ranked\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you have a custom query to display a set of posts on the front-end which combines multiple post-types under a single taxonomy term, then the plugin needs to be told which post-type to use to rank the results.  It will fire a filter which you need to hook,</p>\n<pre><code>apply_filters('reorderpwc_filter_multiple_post_type', 'ranking_post_type',10,2);\nfunction ranking_post_type($type, $wp_query){\n  //use WP_Query object to figure is this is your query,\n  //then return the post-type the to use to rank the results.\n  //if no type is returned the posts will be ranked by date.\n  return $type;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='10.%20my%20posts%20are%20not%20being%20ranked%20properly%20on%20the%20front-end'>\n10. My posts are not being ranked properly on the front-end\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>There are several reasons why this might happen,</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. You are using a custom query get_posts()&#8230;</strong><br />\nIf you are displaying your posts using a <strong>custom query with the function get_posts()</strong> you should be aware that it sets the attribute &#8216;suppress_filters&#8217; to true by default (see the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_posts/#parameters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">codex page</a>).  The ranked order is applied using filters on the query, hence you need to explictly set this attribute to <code>false</code> to get your results ranked properly.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Your theme or custom query explictly set the &#8216;orderby&#8217; query attribute. **<br />\nIf your **query explicitly sets the &#8216;orderby&#8217;</strong> <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#order-orderby-parameters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">attribute</a>, and the override checkbox is checked (see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/reorder-post-within-categories/#screenshots\" rel=\"ugc\">screenshot</a> #5), then the plugin will override your query and rank the results as per your manual order.  However, if you uncheck the ovverride setting (ie override is set to false), your query will be ordered as per the orderby directive.  However, you can programmatically override the <code>orderby</code> directive with the following hook should you need finer control,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('rpwc2_allow_custom_sort_orderby_override', 'override_orderby_sorting', 10,5);\nfunction  override_orderby_sorting($override, $wp_query, $taxonomy, $term_id, $type){\n    //check this is the correct query\n    if($wp_query....){\n      $override = true;\n    }\n    return $override;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>** 3. You are displaying a taxonomy archive page. **<br />\nIf your query is a <strong>taxonomy archive query</strong> for a given term, then WordPress core query does not specify the <code>post_type</code> by default see this <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50070\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">bug</a>).  This forces the plugin to seek which <code>post_type</code> is associated with this taxonomy.  <strong>In the event that you are using this taxonomy to classify multiple post types</strong> this will lead to the plugin choosing the first type it encounters with available posts for the queried term, and this may give spurious results.  A hook is provided for you to correctly filter the <code>post_type</code> and ensure the right results,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('reorderpwc_filter_multiple_post_type', 'filter_my_ranked_post_type', 10, 4);\nfunction filter_my_ranked_post_type($type, $post_types, $taxonomy, $wp_query){\n  /* String $type post type to filter.\n  *  String $post_types post types associated with taxonomy.\n  *  String $taxonomy being queried.\n  *  WP_Query $wp_query query object. */\n  if('my-custom-tax' == $taxonomy &amp;&amp; in_array('my-custom-post',$post_types)) $type = 'my-custom-post';\n  return $type;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='11.%20programmatically%20ranking%20initial%20post%20order%20in%20admin%20page.'>\n11. Programmatically ranking initial post order in admin page.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are migrating from another plugin in which you have painstakingly sorted your posts, or you need have the intial order of posts based on some other criteria (some date or other meta field value), then you can use the following filter to pass the required rank,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('rpwc2_filter_default_ranking', 'custom_intial_order', 10, 4);\nfunction custom_intial_order($ranking, $term_id, $taxonomy, $post_type){\n  //$ranking an array containing a list of post IDs in their default order.\n  //$term_id the current term being reordered.\n  //$taxonomy the taxonomy to which the term belongs.\n  //$post_type the post type being reordered.\n  //check if this is the correct taxonomy/post type you wish to reorder.\n  if('my-custom-post' != $post_type || 'my-category'!=$taxonomy ) return $ranking;\n  //load you default order programmatically... says as $new_order from your DB\n  $filtered_order = array()\n  foreach($new_order as $post_id){\n    //check the post ID is actually in the ranking.\n    if(in_array($post_id, $new_order)) filtered_order[]=$post_id;\n  }\n  return $filtered_order;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>in version 2.6.1, an additional filter is introduced to allow different post status to appear in the initial rank,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('rpwc2_initial_rank_posts_status', 'allow_draft_in_initial_order',10,3);\nfunction allow_draft_in_initial_order($status, $post_type, $term_id){\n  //allow draft post to be ranked initially.  By default $status=array('private','publish','future').\n  if('post'==$post_type){\n    $status[]='draft';\n  }\n  return $status;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>this will only affect the posts in the admin dashboard reorder page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='12.%20can%20i%20rank%20draft%20posts%3F'>\n12. Can I rank draft posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!  By default all posts moved to draft/pending status are removed from the manual ranking.  However, you can hook the following filter and control which draft or pending posts should appear in the manual ranking in the amdin dashboard,</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('rpwc2_rank_draft_posts', 'allow_draft_posts_in_ranking', 10, 5);\nfunction allow_draft_posts_in_ranking($allow, $new_status, $old_status, $term_id, $post){\n  //$new_status of the post being saved.\n  //$old_status of the post being saved.\n  //$term_id term for which the post is being ranked.\n  //WP_Post object being saved.\n  if(new_status == 'pending' &amp;&amp; $term_id == 5){ //allow pending posts for term id 5 to be ranked.\n    $allow = true;\n  }\n  return $allow;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>NOTE:  this will only affect the admin dashboard queries.  Your draft posts will appear in the admin re-order pages but will not appear in the front-end queries, as only published posts will be retrieved by your queries.<br />\nIf you need to have draft/pending posts in the intial ranking, see FAQ #11.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='13.%20can%20i%20remove%20private%2Ffuture%20posts%20from%20the%20manual%20rank%20%3F'>\n13.
