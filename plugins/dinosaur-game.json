        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20how%20the%20game%20looks%3F'>\nCan I change how the game looks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! The HTML markup of the game has classes that make it easy to apply CSS to them. If you like playing with game files, you can also swap out the spritemap with your own by editing the game-sprites-1x.png and game-sprites-2x.png files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20on%20a%20404%20page%20or%20another%20template%20file%3F'>\nCan I use this on a 404 page or another template file?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! In fact, you can put this game anywhere on your site that you can put a shortcode. Inside post/page content you can use [dinosaur-game]. In a PHP template file you can use:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[dinosaur-game]'); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20see%20the%20game%20showing%20up.%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nI don&#8217;t see the game showing up. What should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you see the message &#8220;The dinosaur game can only be used once per page.&#8221; then that means the page is trying to show the shortcode more than once. Since the game binds to keys (up, down, and spacebar) it wouldn&#8217;t work well with multiple instances of the game on a single page. So this game only runs once per page or post.</li>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t see an error message, and the shortcode still isn&#8217;t working, check your PHP error log or turn on debug mode to see if another plugin or theme is interfering with this plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also feel free to ask a question on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/dinosaur-game/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org support forum</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
