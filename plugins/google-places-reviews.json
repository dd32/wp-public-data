        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy Use this Plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin allows you to display Google reviews on your WordPress website. Why is this important? Positive reviews on websites like Google help businesses gain additional exposure and further enhance their online credibility. As well, positive reviews add substantial credibility to any business and can lead to increased conversion rates and sales.</p>\n<p>There is significant data that demonstrates consumers care about online reviews but very little information about what businesses are doing to respond to this phenomenon. How about displaying reviews on your WordPress website from Google?</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20obtain%20a%20google%20places%20api%20key%3F'>\nHow do I obtain a Google Places API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order for the plugin to access your Google reviews, you must have a valid Google Places API key with the Google Places API and Google Maps API enabled. To get started, please review <a href=\"https://wpbusinessreviews.com/documentation/platforms/google/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">how to create a Google Places API key</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20the%20block%20look%20funny%20in%20my%20theme%3F'>\nWhy does the block look funny in my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely your theme has conflicting CSS that is interfering with the styles included with the plugin. If you&#8217;re handy with CSS this can be an easy fix. If you are new to CSS then please submit a support request with the url of the website and we&#8217;ll do our best to help you fix the issue.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20css%20style%20and%20theme%20compatibility%20issues%20supported%3F'>\nAre CSS style and theme compatibility issues supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We do our best to support users of the free version of the plugin. <a href=\"https://wpbusinessreviews.com\" title=\"Upgrade to WP Business Reviews\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Business Reviews</a> is where our customers receive priority support.
