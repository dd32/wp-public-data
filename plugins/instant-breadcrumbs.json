        "description": "<p>Instant Breadcrumbs adds a breadcrumb trail to your WordPress blog&#8217;s primary navigation menu. No theme editing required!<br />\nIncluding a breadcrumb trail on your site not only makes it easier for visitors to navigate your site, but also allows<br />\nsearch engines to better explore your blog and include the breadcrumb information in rich snippet data in search<br />\nresults. Many breadcrumb plugins exist, but normally require either theme editing, or use of a theme that is already<br />\ncustomized to include the breadcrumb function. In addition, editing the theme is usually followed by some CSS<br />\nstyling to make the breadcrumb trail match the overall &#8216;look&#8217; of the site.</p>\n<p>Instant Breadcrumbs takes a different approach. Since breadcrumbs are a navigation aid, the generated trail is<br />\nautomatically added to the front of your existing primary navigation menu. This allows it to not only function<br />\nstraight out of the box with a large number of themes, but also use the existing styling of your primary navigation<br />\nmenu.</p>\n<p>A quick overview of Instant Breadcrumbs features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Works with both custom primary menus and the default &#8216;page&#8217; menu generated by WordPress;</li>\n<li>Produces RDFa-compliant breadcrumb trails that may be used by Google and others in search results;</li>\n<li>Supports customization of the breadcrumb titles for pages such as the front page, archives, and search;</li>\n<li>Re-uses existing top-level entries in the primary menu to avoid repeated links;</li>\n<li>Includes CSS classes for added breadcrumbs for optional further styling if desired;</li>\n<li>Use the built-in breadcrumb generator, or third-party generators such as Yoast (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress SEO</a>)<br />\nand <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/breadcrumb-navxt/\" rel=\"ugc\">Breadcrumb NavXT</a>, adding those to the nav menu without theme editing.

Go to the &#8216;Widgets&#8217; submenu (under &#8216;Appearance&#8217; in the<br />\nWordPress admin) and drag the Instant Breadcrumbs widget to the appropriate position. You may set a title and optional<br />\nseparator HTML. As above, it is recommended you apply your own CSS styling.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Which themes does the plugin support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Instant Breadcrumbs is designed to work with &#8220;generic&#8221; WordPress blog themes. In other words, these<br />\nare basic themes which have a header that calls <code>wp_nav_menu</code> in their header to include a<br />\nmenu (or a menu based on your static pages, if no menu has been defined). The default themes that<br />\nship with each WordPress installation are good examples, as are most &#8220;general purpose&#8221; blogging<br />\nthemes. The plugin is intended to provide easy breadcrumb functionality for basic blogging, and will<br />\nattempt to identify the first menu on the web page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs are not showing, or are in the wrong menu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Instant Breadcrumbs attempts to find the first menu in your theme, and add the trail there. For some<br />\nthemes the menu may be difficult to identify, or the first menu is not the ideal position. In these<br />\ncases, you may manually specify a theme location in the Instant Breadcrumbs settings. The value here<br />\nshould match the <code>theme_location</code> in the relevant <code>wp_nav_menu</code> call in your theme header. Leave this<br />\nblank to allow Instant Breadcrumbs to automatically find the first one.</p>\n<p>If your web site is highly customized, and your theme contains its own custom code to generate<br />\nmenus or navigation, then it&#8217;s likely that Instant Breadcrumbs may not be called when your site<br />\nis displayed. In this case, you can revert to theme editing and call <code>instant_breadcrumb()</code> manually<br />\nto insert the breadcrumb trail at an appropriate location in your theme. You can optionally insert<br />\nHTML between the breadcrumb elements, and you should perform your own CSS styling. Alternatively,<br />\nyou may insert the supplied widget in an appropriate location.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want the breadcrumb trail automatically adding itself to my menu.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The automatic addition of breadcrumbs to the main menu is not for everyone. It may not suit your<br />\nexisting menu items, or perhaps you would prefer a more traditional breadcrumb display somewhere<br />\nelse in your layout. The automatic mode is the default in Instant Breadcrumbs, but you may disable<br />\nit in the Breadcrumbs settings page (under Appearance). If you are using the widget method, or<br />\nmanually editing your template PHP, it is recommended you disable automatic mode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will settings remain if I upgrade the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is designed to keep your settings from one installed version to the next. If the upgraded<br />\nversion has new settings, they will be set to sensible defaults. You should verify these new settings<br />\nafter an upgrade. Your old settings should still be preserved.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My home page appears twice in the modified menu?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Instant Breadcrumbs will reuse menu items wherever possible, for example when viewing a page that is<br />\nalready in the top-level menu. However it cannot reuse a menu item link if doing so would mean the<br />\ngenerated breadcrumbs are no longer in order. The usual example of this is if the home page already<br />\nappears in the primary menu. The generated breadcrumb trail requires the home link to be first. The<br />\neasiest workaround for this is simply to customize your menu so the home page is not included a<br />\nsecond time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I apply custom CSS to the added breadcrumbs?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Instant Breadcrumbs plugin adds the CSS class <code>ib-crumb</code> to the <code>li</code> element of any breadcrumbs in<br />\nthe menu, and <code>ib-lastcrumb</code> to the last link in the breadcrumb trail representing the current page.<br />\nFurthermore, the class <code>ib-added</code> is added to the <code>li</code> element of new menu items created by the plugin,<br />\nand <code>ib-edited</code> to existing menu items. These may be styled in your theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code> should for<br />\ninstance you would like breadcrumb items to be highlighted in a different color.</p>\n<p>Some useful examples: <code>.ib-crumb {display:inline;}</code> will display your breadcrumb trail in a single line<br />\nif you are using PHP or the widget to display the trail. A more complex one is <code>.ib-crumb+.ib-crumb:before {content:\"&gt;\";}</code><br />\nwhich will add the additional arrow as a separator between consecutive breadcrumbs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do HTML characters such as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; appear incorrectly in the output?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your post title includes these characters, be sure to escape them correctly (for example<br />\nas <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, and <code>&amp;amp;</code>). Otherwise they may be rendered incorrectly at any time they may appear on the Web<br />\npage, including in the breadcrumb trail. This is nothing particular about Instant Breadcrumbs, but all<br />\nbreadcrumb generators, and Web pages in general, behave similarly. As of version 1.2, you may include HTML markup in<br />\nyour post titles, such as <code>&lt;em&gt;for emphasis&lt;/em&gt;</code>, and the Instant Breadcrumb trail will optionally<br />\ninclude it in the breadcrumb as well. This option is enabled by default. Disabling it will use<br />\ntext only in each crumb.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
