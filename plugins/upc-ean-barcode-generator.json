However you will need to find a separate plugin for barcode image generation. Try to search something like &#8220;Barcode Generator&#8221; or &#8220;Print Barcode Labels&#8221; plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='plugins%20creates%20codes%20for%20variations%20too%20%3F'>\nPlugins creates codes for variations too ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, each variation will have its own UPC or EAN field. Field will be created as soon as plugin is installed.<br />\nYou can find this field empty if you didn&#8217;t start &#8220;code generation&#8221; process yet.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20generated%20codes%20real%2Fvalid%20%3F'>\nAre generated codes real/valid ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Generated codes are valid (have correct checksum digit), however some warehouses and shipping centers may request non-free UPC/EAN codes, for more information please <a href=\"https://www.ukrsolution.com/ContactUs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
