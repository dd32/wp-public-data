Perfect for showcasing custom-made themes and plugins, this tool allows potential customers to experience your products firsthand, ensuring a tailored and engaging demonstration every time.</p>\n<p>Typically, we create a single site for all visitors, allowing them to post random content that ultimately spoils the experience for others. If we want to implement a sandbox mechanism where every visitor gets a fresh setup that is deleted after a certain period, we usually have to rely on third-party services, which might not be ideal in all cases.</p>\n<p>To resolve the issue, this plugin offers sandbox mechanism on the same server as the main site. It eliminates the need for additional servers and quickly sets up a new instance for each visitor by leveraging WP Multisite.
