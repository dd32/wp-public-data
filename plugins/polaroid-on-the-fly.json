        "description": "<p>Creates polaroids of images on the fly for thumbnails in posts. Support for lightbox included. Built on modified Polaroid-o-nizer v0.7.2 sources.</p>\n<p>I wanted to mimic the Polaroid look that you can achieve with Google Picasa to add thumbnails to my posts. I found a plugin titled WP-Polaroidonizer that did what I wanted to some extent but it didn&#8217;t have the right feel to it.</p>\n<p>The other problem I have with Polaroid-o-nizer and WP-Polaroidonizer is the lack of security. When I mention lack of security there is by default no way to restrict external sites and users from generating Polaroid pictures using your installation of Polaroid-o-nizer.</p>\n<p>The goal of this plugin was to use rel= style html img tags to transform a simple URL into a Lightbox URL in which there is a thumbnail image in your post which is linked to an image that can be loaded using Lightbox or any of the Lightbox clones/alternatives.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>PHP GD Module</li>\n<li>Lightbox &#8211; Not really a requirement but a recommendation if you want to have a nice ajax/javascript image overlay on your page.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Upgrade</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Delete the previous <code>polaroid-on-the-fly</code> folder from the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Upload the new <code>polaroid-on-the-fly</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Create an image link in your post in the following format:</p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be sure to include <code>rel=\"polaroid\"</code> as this activates the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>If <code>alt=\"Picture[album]\"</code> is included the portion listed here as Picture will be displayed as the image title in Lightbox and the portion listed as <code>[album]</code> will group multiple pictures into an album called album. The alt tag is not required and if used the <code>[album]</code> portion is not required. Read the Lightbox usage for more details on Titles and albums.</li>\n<li>Be sure to place each html img tag on a separate line.</li>\n<li>This plugin supports the following image formats: jpg, png, gif</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>NOTE:</h4>\n<p>Do not use the visual editor for doing the above use the code editor.</p>\n<h3>To Do</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Add features for x and y offset</li>\n<li>Add features for rotation angle</li>\n<li>Add additional error reporting for the offset and angle</li>\n<li>Add functionality to options page to generate a URL for placement elsewhere on the site.</li>\n<li>Add functionality to cache the polaroid images.</li>\n</ol>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>What Do The Error Messages Mean:</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Source image resolution below min (200x200px)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The image referenced in the image tag has a resolution less than 200&#215;200 pixels.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Source image resolution above max (2000x2000px)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The image referenced in the image tag has a resolution greater than 2000&#215;2000 pixels.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Source URL Incorrect of does not Exist</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The URL of the image referenced in the image tag does not exist.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Background color is invalid use RGB only</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The background color specified on the options page is not a valid 24 bit RGB color.  When written, RGB values in 24 bits per pixel (bpp), also known as Truecolor, are commonly specified using three integers between 0 and 255, each representing red, green and blue intensities, in that order. For example:<br />\n* white is 255,255,255<br />\n* black is 0,0,0<br />\n* red is 255,0,0<br />\n* green is 0,255,0<br />\n* blue is 0,0,255</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Source image unknown file type (jpg,gif,png only)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should never see this message.  The regex used to find the img tag with rel=&#8221;polaroid&#8221; will only select img tags including jpg,gif and png.  I figured hey why not create a useless image it may come in handy some day.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>PHP GD Module Not Found. Polaroid on the Fly will not work. See http://us.php.net/gd for installation information.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to have the PHP GD Module Installed.  This plugin requires the GD module to make the polaroid image.  This plugin will not function without this module.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>PHP GD Module Found. However, it does not include support for GIF.  You will not be able to use a GIF for the source image. See http://us.php.net/gd for more information.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have the PHP GD Module installed but the GD version does not support GIF images.  This plugin will still work but you will not be able to use a GIF for the source image.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
