After saving the recipe you, can insert a shortcode with the following syntax: [canvasanimationX attributes=&#8221;Y&#8221;] where X=the animation number (1,2 or 3) and Y is the given animation name. For example, if you have made a recipe for animation 2 and the  recipe name is test1, the shortcode will be:[canvasanimation2 attributes=&#8221;test1&#8243;]. You can also use the plugin as a widget from the customize menu by selecting the animation and the recipe from the dropdown boxes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2) Why doesn&#8217;t the animation appear at the preview of the post at frontpage?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many themes are possible to block the full content of the post at the frontpage, in that case, make sure you have unchecked any option that filters the content of your post at frontpage.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
