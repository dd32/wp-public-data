If you use classic selector, the date selector of the plugin will appear on the top right. If you use the gutenberg editor, the expiration date selector will appear on the bottom right. After you selected the date and the time you wish the particular post to expire, you will need to press update. The changes will take effect in 5 hours from the time you selected it. If you need this to take immediate effect, you need to press purge MS cache from the top dashboard menu.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20support%20woocommerce%3F'>\nDoes this plugin support WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it supports WooCommerce product expiration &amp; scheduling.
