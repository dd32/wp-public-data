        "faq": "\n<h4>Where can I show sliders</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently in any place where you can use a wordpress shortcode. Basically post and pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is my wordpress going to be slower when using this plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. There are no SQL queries or big processing. Just a small code that adapt the html output and adds a small javascript and css.<br />\nIt only includes javascript and css when needed (When there is a slider in the current post). The code is only<br />\nexecuted when you use a shortcode, so your other posts that doesn&#8217;t include a slider will not be affected in any way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What wordpress versions are supported</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We started developing the plugin with wordpress 4.4, but almost any version that can handle shorcodes should work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin easy to use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely yes. Just use a shortcode in your post or pages. No admin, no configuration</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I customize the look and feel or functionalities?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You could add some css code to your theme for visual customizations.<br />\nAsk for any functionality in the support section. Probably, the future<br />\nof the plugin will be to extend some functionalities demanded by users.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
