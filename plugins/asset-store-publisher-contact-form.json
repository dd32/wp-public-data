Once it receives both of these it will return an array containing the following information: 1. Purchase date 2. Was the transaction reversed / refunded 3. The invoice number you supplied 4. The package/product name</p>\n<p>Invalid invoices are not returned so this kit checks the number of returned invoices against the number sent to Unity as well as the refund status of the invoices. If all invoices return as validated, the contact form will be sent to the configured address.</p>\n<p>In terms of the data collected to be sent to Unity, the publisher&#8217;s identification is achieved via the private API  key the publisher gets on the Unity Publisher&#8217;s Administration page. This info is entered in the Dashboard and fetched before contacting the Unity API. This field is never revealed to anyone other than Unity and people with the authority to manage site options. The invoice numbers to be validated is provided by the person completing the form.</p>\n<p>So in summary: In the dashboard, provide the email address you want the contact form to be sent to and your private key to access the Unity API. From the customer, collect their invoice number(s) These two fields are sent to Unity who then returns anonymous info regarding the transaction including only purchases / refund status and purchase date.</p>\n",

The initial release also didn&#8217;t include the name field from the contact form. That has been fixed. All fields are now returned.</p>\n"
