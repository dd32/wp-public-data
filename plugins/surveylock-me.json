When visitors complete the anonymous ~30 second survey, content is unlocked and you&#8217;re paid.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kinds%20of%20surveys%20do%20visitors%20see%3F'>\nWhat kinds of surveys do visitors see?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The surveys that visitors see are from nationally recognized brands that users will be familiar with. Most surveys are simple multiple choice and can take just 30 seconds to complete.</p>\n<p>Every survey your visitors see will be 100% brand safe and authentic, and will never ask for personally identifiable information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20extra%20revenue%20can%20i%20make%3F'>\nHow much extra revenue can I make?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We can&#8217;t provide accurate projections because content &amp; visitor type vary between websites. However, the majority of publishers who implement SurveyLock find that it meets or even exceeds the revenue they generate from traditional display ads.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20started%3F'>\nHow do I get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit https://surveylock.me and submit your name and email. You&#8217;ll be asked to tell us about your website and once approved, you&#8217;ll receive a unique Publisher Key. After that, it&#8217;s as simple as installing the plugin and adding simple shortcodes to lock your content.</p>\n<p>More questions?
