        "changelog": "<h4>0.1.8</h4>\n<p>Added lookup for image sizes incase someone adds a custom size for comic usage. Controls for custom image sizes currently locked.<br />\nCompatability check for WP v 4.8</p>\n<h4>0.1.7</h4>\n<p>(internal release only)<br />\nAdded non-hardcoded controls to lock-out images based on Membership Levels defined by s2Member. Gives both Membership Lable as well as Membership Level in dropdown controls.</p>\n<h4>0.1.6</h4>\n<p>Tested and updated plugin with most recent verion of WordPress. Yup! Still works as intended.<br />\nSetting &#8216;Access Level&#8217; restrictions to &#8216;EVERYONE&#8217; when the &#8216;Image Size&#8217; is checked will now funtion the same as if the &#8216;Image Size&#8217; was not checked and no restrictions applied.</p>\n<h4>0.1.5</h4>\n<p>Fixed CE &hearts; s2 Thumbnail plugin to correctly see the settings drip times. Fixed bug where Thumbnail Plugin was not respecting &#8216;Chapter&#8217; settings.</p>\n<h4>0.1.4.1</h4>\n<p>Cleaning up the Readme text for display on the WordPress.org Plugins repository. No codeing changes made.</p>\n<h4>0.1.4</h4>\n<p>Fixed the comic display so that it would correctly display/interact when &#8216;Comic Easel&#8217;-&gt;&#8217;Clicking the comic goes to next comic&#8217; is active<br />\nRemoved add_action via Frumph&#8217;s wonderful suggestion.<br />\nChanged timestamp creation to fall more inline with WordPress standards.</p>\n<h4>0.1.3</h4>\n<p>(internal release only)<br />\nAdded the ability to set image size via membership level. Currently hard coded to the 4 basic membership levels that come standard with s2member. It can be wonky since it can be set in any random order, so use with caution.</p>\n<h4>0.1.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed bug were variable was feeding into the wrong filter.</p>\n<h4>0.1.1</h4>\n<p>Changed plugin/file name to &#8216;SMEW Comic Easel &lt;3 s2member&#8217; to avoid lookup confusion with Comic Easel on the WordPress Plugin Update Repository. Doh!</p>\n<p><h4>0.1</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
