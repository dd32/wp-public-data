        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I get the data out of the text boxes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s just copy and paste for right now. I was considering adding a button to move it all to the moderate/blacklist section under Discussion options, but that could get pretty messy for people with large datasets with lots of redundancies.</p>\n<p>I may add an option to automatically add the IP/email/URL of a comment marked as spam to one of the lists and then trash the comment right after it gets marked. That&#8217;s really the only way I think that could be implemented without the potential for serious confusion.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you add this feature I just thought of?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Can I? Yes. Will I? Yes, if I think it would be a helpful addition. I&#8217;m trying to keep things clean and simple, but there&#8217;s always room for improvement, so let me know if you think a feature is lacking!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does it take so long to load?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got a large number of spam comments, it may take awhile to load and parse them all. I recommend using this to extract the useful blocking information from your spam comments then kill them all with fire.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
