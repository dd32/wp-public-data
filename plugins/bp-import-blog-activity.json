If so, open bp-import-blog-activity-bp-functions.php, and find lines 38 ad 39. Uncomment them, and adjust the numbers (currently 12 and 30) to keep the plugin from looping through all the blogs on your system. Then change the numbers and repeat until you&#8217;ve looped through all your blogs</p>\n<p>*** Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t recommend you use this plugin unless you know what it does and what you&#8217;re doing!!</p>\n",
