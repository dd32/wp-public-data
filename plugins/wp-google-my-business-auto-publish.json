Posts can be scheduled as well!</p>\n<p>Creating content on Google My Business is becoming an increasingly important SEO factor. But the problem is it can be a hassle creating new content and easy to forget. With Auto Publish for Google My Business you can start getting more content on your, or your clients&#8217; business page on Google without having to do any additional operations.</p>\n<p>The plugin is simple, lightweight and FULLY free. You can also setup a default share message (which includes time saving shortcodes) and an action type for all your posts which you can override on the individual post page as well. You can also filter items to be published based on categories selected on the plugin settings page. You can choose whether you want to share posts, custom posts and pages.</p>\n<p>The plugin utilises the official Google My Business API so your posts featured image will automatically be used as the Google My Business post image and your post link will be set as the call to action link in Google My Business. You can also create event posts with a start and end date.</p>\n<p>Every post will automatically be published to Google My Business, however on each post there is a checkbox which enables you to not share a particular post or you can change the default to not publish posts automatically from the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>On the &#8216;All Posts/Pages/Custom Post Type&#8217; screen you will also see a share history timeline for each post.</p>\n<p>From the plugin settings you can also create a manual new post which isn&#8217;t tied to any WordPress post/page/custom post type and you can also edit and remove past posts without even having to go to your Google My Business page.</p>\n<p>In version 1.2 of the plugin we have introduced full multiple location support! So you can select to use the plugin with multiple Google My Business locations, set your default locations and choose what locations to share to for each post! There is no limit to the amount of posts you can create!</p>\n<h4>Reviews</h4>\n<p>Display reviews on any post, page or in a sidebar widget using the review shortcode builder in the plugin settings. Simply change the settings and get a live preview of your review slider or grid. Then copy and paste the shortcode into the desired position on your website. There are heaps of options to customise the look of the reviews and you can even manually exclude specific reviews from displaying. Reviews will be updated automatically once every day so there&#8217;s no maintenance.</p>\n<h4>Great Support</h4>\n<p>The plugin comes with an FAQ section accessible from the plugin settings page and it&#8217;s transation friendly.</p>\n<h4>Announcing AutoSocial</h4>\n<p>Please check out the pro version called AutoSocial which provides the same functionality as Auto Publish for Google My Business but adds Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. AutoSocial has many other cool features you will love as well! <a href=\"https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/autosocial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more</a></p>\n",
