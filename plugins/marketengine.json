        "faq": "\n<h4>What can I do with MarketEngine?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use MarketEngine to create a marketplace to sell, to offer or rent out any product and service.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is MarketEngine compatible with all WordPress themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. MarketEngine is compatible with most of WordPress themes. But, you strongly recommend you to run MarketEngine plugin with ZeroEngine theme since only ZeroEngine theme can fully demonstrate all features of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I download the free version of MarketEngine plugin and ZeroEngine theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends. If you want to download the free version of MarketEngine, you only need to search MarketEngine plugin from WordPress.org and install it. Or else, you can sign up into our website. Then, you go to the “MarketEngine” section on the left sidebar in the member area to download the free version of MarketEngine plugin and the ZeroEngine theme. However, in the future, we will offer you the Premium version of MarketEngine, so you can purchase this upgrade version if you need more features for your marketplace.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need anything other than this plugin/theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>MarketEngine is a free plugin at this time. You may also want to purchase our Premium version in the future to add more features to your marketplace.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with WooCommerce?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>MarketEngine is built as a standalone marketplace plugin from scratch. It operates independently of WooCommerce, for the purpose of optimizing the flow of your marketplace and ensuring everything on your site run smoothly. Thus, MarketEngine cannot work with WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add extra fields which will display in the post listing form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
