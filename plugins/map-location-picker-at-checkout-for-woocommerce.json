If so, then why not let them choose their exact location on Google Maps?</p>\n<p>Kikote (pronounced Key-Ko-tay) is a Location Picker At Checkout plugin for WooCommerce which allows store owners to add more flexibility to their WooCommerce store by letting their customers choose exactly where they&#8217;d like their product(s) delivered.</p>\n<p>This plugin is excellent for stores with delivery personnel that ship products to customers within a moderate geographical area. It can also work for websites which offer Pickup services such as Private Taxi websites.</p>\n<p>Kikote &#8211; Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce enables store owners to get more precise location details without having to contact customers via other means for location information or directions. With this plugin, lots of time can be saved by allowing customers to select their exact location on Google Maps at checkout with WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>NOTE 🛑</h3>\n<p>The plugin does not currently support the WooCommerce Blocks checkout. To use this plugin you need to have a normal checkout page that has the <code>[woocommerce_checkout]</code> shortcode. If you&#8217;re setting up a brand new website with a fresh version of WooCommerce installed on it, then by default, WooCommerce will create your checkout page as a Blocks checkout page.</p>\n<p>For this plugin to work, you need to <strong>delete all contents of that blocks page</strong> and add the shortcode: <code>[woocommerce_checkout]</code> inside it. You can see this link for reverting to classic checkout <a href=\"https://woo.com/document/cart-checkout-blocks-status/#section-6\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce doc</a></p>\n<p>Once thats done you&#8217;ll have the normal WooCommerce checkout page and the plugin options will show.

When a customer clicks the desired address from the dropdown, it can also automatically fill in the rest of the checkout fields. This feature is also known as Google Address Autofill.</p>\n<h3>✅ Saved Addresses for WooCommerce Plugin</h3>\n<p>Allow customers to save multiple different addresses to their account that they can select from when placing an order. This feature is useful for customers who might be placing orders on your store from multiple locations.</p>\n<p>A customer placing an order might not always be at the previously used address, with this feature they can select any previously saved address such as &#8220;Work&#8221;, &#8220;Home&#8221;, &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s&#8221; etc. Think of it as an address book for WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Custom Shipping Zones Plugin</h3>\n<p>The PRO version of Kikote allows you to create custom shipping zones by drawing them on a Google Map. These Zones can each have their own shipping cost and you can additionally prevent customers from checking out if they do not fall in any of the custom shipping zones.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Delivery Area Plugin</h3>\n<p>Kikote comes with multiple features to fine tune where you deliver to and how much you wish to charge. These include features such as &#8220;Cost by Distance&#8221;, &#8220;Cost by Distance Range&#8221;, &#8220;Cost by Region&#8221;, &#8220;Cost by Store Distance&#8221;, Maximum shipping distance, as well as Cost by Store.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Map Plugin</h3>\n<p>The plugin comes with a Map Builder feature that allows store owners to create custom Google Maps with their store locations and shipping regions and add those maps anywhere on their website using a shortcode.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Multistore Shipping Plugin</h3>\n<p>In the PRO version of Kikote, you can attach shipping methods to the store locations you&#8217;ve created.

In this context &#8220;origin&#8221; and &#8220;store&#8221; means where the order will be getting shipped from or taking place.</p>\n<h3>Below are a few types of stores that would benefit tremendously from this plugin:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Online food delivery websites</li>\n<li>Online supermarkets</li>\n<li>Online furniture websites</li>\n<li>Restaurants offering delivery via their website</li>\n<li>Hardware Rental &amp; Delivery websites</li>\n<li>Car Rental websites</li>\n<li>Pickup service websites</li>\n<li>Taxi and pickup scheduling websites</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Free Features ⭐</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect current location of customer at checkout (Automatically or on click of a button)</li>\n<li>Allow customers to pick their exact location using Google Maps</li>\n<li>Autofill checkout fields with information pulled from Google Maps</li>\n<li>Open directions to customers in Google Maps or Waze</li>\n<li>Store Location Selector &#8211; Create multiple store locations and allow customers to choose the one they&#8217;d like to order from.</li>\n<li>Show/Hide Map based on Shipping Method</li>\n<li>Show/Hide Map based on Shipping Class</li>\n<li>Show Map based on Coupon Code</li>\n<li>Hide Map for Guest Checkout</li>\n<li>Include a QR Code, Static Map or Button link to the customer&#8217;s selected location in the WooCommerce order emails.</li>\n<li>&#8220;View on map&#8221; button to allow admin to view exact location for delivery of any order.</li>\n<li>Customers can see the delivery location they selected on past orders.</li>\n<li>Option to turn on Places Autocomplete(Google Autofill) feature. <a href=\"https://lpacwp.com/docs/places-autocomplete-feature/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn More</a></li>\n<li>Customizable Map container</li>\n<li>Automatically translated map buttons based on the website&#8217;s language (set in WordPress&#8217; general settings) or using a filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Premium Features 🌟</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom Google Maps designs</li>\n<li>Custom Marker Icons</li>\n<li>Export Order Locations</li>\n<li>Plot Orders on a map &#8211; See where your orders are coming from and determine your most popular order locations</li>\n<li>Multiple Customer Saved Addresses</li>\n<li>Shipping Cost by Region</li>\n<li>Shipping Cost by Distance</li>\n<li>Shipping Cost by Distance Range</li>\n<li>Shipping Cost by Store Distance</li>\n<li>Shipping Cost by Store Location</li>\n<li>Multi-store distance pricing &#8211; Set the cost by distanced based on the origin store the customer selected.</li>\n<li>Show/Hide Map based on Shipping Zone</li>\n<li>Hide Map until a minimum cart total is reached</li>\n<li>Hide Map when a maximum cart total is reached</li>\n<li>More Map Visibility Rules</li>\n<li>Restrict Places Autocomplete feature to selected countries</li>\n<li>Map Builder &#8211; Create custom WooCommerce Google Maps with your store locations and shipping regions and add them to anywhere on your website using a shortcode.</li>\n<li>Attach shipping methods to store locations.

If so, then why not let them choose their exact location on Google Maps?</p>\n<p>Kikote (pronounced Key-Ko-tay) is a Location Picker At Checkout plugin for WooCommerce which allows store owners to add more flexibility to their WooCommerce store by letting their customers choose exactly where they&#8217;d like their product(s) delivered.</p>\n<p>This plugin is excellent for stores with delivery personnel that ship products to customers within a moderate geographical area. It can also work for websites which offer Pickup services such as Private Taxi websites.</p>\n<p>Kikote &#8211; Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce enables store owners to get more precise location details without having to contact customers via other means for location information or directions. With this plugin, lots of time can be saved by allowing customers to select their exact location on Google Maps at checkout with WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>NOTE 🛑</h3>\n<p>The plugin does not currently support the WooCommerce Blocks checkout. To use this plugin you need to have a normal checkout page that has the <code>[woocommerce_checkout]</code> shortcode. If you&#8217;re setting up a brand new website with a fresh version of WooCommerce installed on it, then by default, WooCommerce will create your checkout page as a Blocks checkout page.</p>\n<p>For this plugin to work, you need to <strong>delete all contents of that blocks page</strong> and add the shortcode: <code>[woocommerce_checkout]</code> inside it. You can see this link for reverting to classic checkout <a href=\"https://woo.com/document/cart-checkout-blocks-status/#section-6\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce doc</a></p>\n<p>Once thats done you&#8217;ll have the normal WooCommerce checkout page and the plugin options will show.

When a customer clicks the desired address from the dropdown, it can also automatically fill in the rest of the checkout fields. This feature is also known as Google Address Autofill.</p>\n<h3>✅ Saved Addresses for WooCommerce Plugin</h3>\n<p>Allow customers to save multiple different addresses to their account that they can select from when placing an order. This feature is useful for customers who might be placing orders on your store from multiple locations.</p>\n<p>A customer placing an order might not always be at the previously used address, with this feature they can select any previously saved address such as &#8220;Work&#8221;, &#8220;Home&#8221;, &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s&#8221; etc. Think of it as an address book for WooCommerce.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Custom Shipping Zones Plugin</h3>\n<p>The PRO version of Kikote allows you to create custom shipping zones by drawing them on a Google Map. These Zones can each have their own shipping cost and you can additionally prevent customers from checking out if they do not fall in any of the custom shipping zones.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Delivery Area Plugin</h3>\n<p>Kikote comes with multiple features to fine tune where you deliver to and how much you wish to charge. These include features such as &#8220;Cost by Distance&#8221;, &#8220;Cost by Distance Range&#8221;, &#8220;Cost by Region&#8221;, &#8220;Cost by Store Distance&#8221;, Maximum shipping distance, as well as Cost by Store.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Map Plugin</h3>\n<p>The plugin comes with a Map Builder feature that allows store owners to create custom Google Maps with their store locations and shipping regions and add those maps anywhere on their website using a shortcode.</p>\n<h3>✅ WooCommerce Multistore Shipping Plugin</h3>\n<p>In the PRO version of Kikote, you can attach shipping methods to the store locations you&#8217;ve created.
