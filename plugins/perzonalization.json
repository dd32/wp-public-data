You may decide where these recommendations will appear on your pages. You may set recommendations to be shown on the below pages;<br />\n* Product page<br />\n* Cart page<br />\n* Collection/Category page<br />\n* Home page<br />\n* Search page</p>\n<p>You may also choose the type of logic to use on a recommendation block;<br />\n* Related products from like-minded shoppers<br />\n* Popular products<br />\n* Recently viewed products<br />\n* Discounted products<br />\n* New arrivals<br />\n* Frequently bought together products<br />\n* Cross-sell<br />\n* Upsell<br />\n* Product reminder<br />\n* Category reminder</p>\n<p>Product Recommendations on E-mails</p>\n<p>Sending e-mails to your users not only ensures repeat purchases but also creates loyalty. With the Perzonalization app, you can now seamlessly deliver personalized recommendations on emails by integrating to your existing templates with a simple copy &amp; paste. You may send emails via any provider. The set of recommendations are formed not when the e-mail is sent but when the e-mail is actually opened by the user. By this way the results of the real time analysis form the ground for the products recommended.</p>\n<p>Automated E-mails</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cart Reminders: 68% of your shopping carts are abandoned by your visitors. The time has come for you to win back those customers! We automatically send cart reminder e-mails to your shoppers. These e-mails do not only include the product left in the cart but also display personalized related products for you to show other options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product Reminders: Some of your visitors browse through product pages &#8211; never adding any items on their carts. We help you win those customers! We automatically send a product reminder e-mail including the viewed products along with personalized related products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Category Reminders: Online shopping is a great channel for window shopping. We know that browsing through the category pages, looking at the product images and prices is an entertainment opportunity for a lot of online shoppers. As an online merchant, these window shoppers mean a great deal in terms of lost sales. We can help you with that! We automatically send category reminder e-mails to your shoppers. With our AI powered personalisation algorithms, we predict the products from the browsed category which that person is likely to buy and display those items in the form of product recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No Visit: We send reminder emails to inactive customers along with product recommendations and upsells asking them to come back. You can decide on the length of the inactivity period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No Purchase: Keeping your customers active is our job! This is why we send reminder emails to customers a few days after their last purchase to ensure that they re-visit your online store and make another purchase. You are free to decide when the emails will be sent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customising recommendations</p>\n<p>If you feel like you need greater control over recommendations, you may create custom recommendations to maximise the relevancy for your shoppers. You can place these custom recommendations on product, basket, filter, home, search and sales pages.</p>\n<p>Playing with The Design</p>\n<p>We know that the look and feel of your website is very important. That&#8217;s why we give you a chance to tweak the design of the recommendations area. You are free to choose the number of products to display, play with the colours pr choose a title like &#8220;you may also like&#8221; or &#8220;related products&#8221;. You may find all of these options and more under the design settings.</p>\n<h4>Performance Tracking</h4>\n<p>You can track the performance of Perzonalization for all channels and recommendations, in real-time.
