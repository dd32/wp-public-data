You can use chatbot for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>FAQs or AMAs</strong><br />\nChatbots evolve. They can learn from existing data to answer questions on your behalf. Automating an FAQ list or hosting AMA sessions is much easier with a chatbot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Online Profiles</strong><br />\nBuild interactive and unique professional or personal profiles to get noticed.

Replace cluttered feeds on multiple social platforms with one chatbot for your audience to engage with.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you thought embedding your bot required mandatory HTML skills and copy pasting code snippets to your site’s underlying code – think again! With the Bottr Chatbot plugin , all you need to do is sign in with your existing bottr id and your bot widget will be automatically embedded on your site.</p>\n<p>Capturing site visitors with engaging conversations, content suggestions and a bit of personality has never been easier before.</p>\n",
