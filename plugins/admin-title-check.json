Several techniques are used to reduce the number of requests such as waiting for 4 characters before initiating the first search and delaying new searches.</p>\n<p>This has been tested with a site with 1000+ posts which was on optimized hosting for WordPress. It performed with no issue. However, the performance of much larger sites is unknown and it would be helpful if comments could be left about anyone&#8217;s experiences (good and bad please).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
