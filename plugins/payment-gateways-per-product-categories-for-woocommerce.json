How to\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation &amp; How to</a></p>\n<p>Every payment gateway has its own advantages/disadvantages, they are not equal when it comes to fees, adaptability from customers, regional popularity, and even in security as some gateways are known for larger fraud cases than others.</p>\n<p>Using conditional/custom payment methods for your store to restrict what gateways appear for specific products comes handy here, where you will be able to show/hide payment gateways based on what&#8217;s in the cart.</p>\n<p>For most stores, PayPal is considered an expensive payment gateway, and when you&#8217;re selling expensive products (hundreds or probably thousands), you want to prevent users from checking out using PayPal and instead, use wire transfers or even local payment gateways that offer competitive rates, where you can keep your profit margins higher.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, this is what you can expect to get with this plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable based on product category.</li>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable based on product tag.</li>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable by product level (Pro).</li>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable by Country (Pro).</li>\n<li>Show a fallback gateway in the case of gateways allow &amp; disallow conflict (Pro).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get into more details and see what features the plugin offers.</p>\n<h3>ü§ù Recommended By</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://passwordprotectwp.com/restrict-woocommerce-payment-methods-product-types/\" title=\"PPWP Pro: How to Restrict WooCommerce Payment Methods Based on Product Types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PPWP Pro: How to Restrict WooCommerce Payment Methods Based on Product Types</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sktthemes.org/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-payment-gateway-plugins/\" title=\"SKT Themes: Top Payment Gateways Plugins You MUST Have\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SKT Themes: Top Payment Gateways Plugins You MUST Have</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webprogramacion.com/especifica-con-que-pasarela-pagar-cada-producto-en-woocommerce/\" title=\"Web Programacion: How to Specify with which gateway to pay each product in WooCommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Programacion: How to Specify Payment Gateways to Each Product in WooCommerce</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üöÄ Main Features: FREE Version</h3>\n<h3>The plugin works in 2 modes:</h3>\n<p>It lets you select what payment gateways to show if a product category or tag is added (meaning hide all other gateways in this case).<br />\nSecond, lets you select what gateways to hide when a selected product category or product is in the cart (i.e. all other gateways will appear).</p>\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\n<p>Category A is sold using all payment gateways, no restrictions.</p>\n<p>Category B is sold using all gateways except PayPal.</p>\n<p>Category C is sold only using wire transfer (very high price).</p>\n<p>You can configure the plugin to reflect the above 3 cases like the following:</p>\n<p>Category A: untouched, won&#8217;t be included/excluded from the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Category B: Under PayPal gateway, we insert category B on the &#8220;Excluded&#8221; section.</p>\n<p>Category C: Add it to the &#8220;Excluded&#8221; section of all other gateways.</p>\n<p>Note: Adding category C to the &#8220;Included&#8221; section of wire transfer will hide this gateway from all other categories, so you have to be either &#8220;allow all except&#8221; or &#8220;hide all except&#8221;</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Restrict Payment Gateway Visibility by Product Category</h3>\n<p>This feature allows you to control which payment gateways are available for specific product categories.<br />\nFor instance, if you have products in Category C that should only be purchased via wire transfer due to their high price, you can set this category to be exclusively associated with the wire transfer payment gateway.<br />\nSimilarly, for Category B, you can exclude PayPal as a payment option, while Category A remains unrestricted, compatible with all payment gateways.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Restrict Payment Gateway Visibility by Product Tag</h3>\n<p>Similar to the category-based control, this mode lets you specify payment gateways based on product tags.<br />\nThis means you can have even finer control by tagging specific products and associating them with certain payment methods. For example, if a product is tagged with a particular label indicating a special payment condition, the plugin will automatically adjust the available payment gateways for that product in the cart.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Intuitive &amp; easy to use interface</h3>\n<p>By default, the plugin doesn&#8217;t change anything on installation &amp; activation, once you decide what gateways to show/hide for product categories or tags, go to WooCommerce &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Payment Gateways per Products&#8221; and under desired tab (category or tag), start including/excluding categories on respective gateways you&#8217;ve set.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Global Support For All Gateways</h3>\n<p>The plugin supports any gateway (standard or customized), all gateways that are installed &amp; enabled on WooCommerce &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Payments will be supported, and appear on plugin settings, where you will be able to conditionally control what product categories or tags appear on each gateway.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Plugin Use Cases</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Expensive products: This might be the most use case for this plugin, you want to restrict customers buying expensive items to pay using wire transfer only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cheap products: Imagine you have to deal with a wire transfer or cash on delivery for an $7 item, does that make sense to your business operations? The plugin can restrict gateways based on products of your choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Subscription products: when you sell products that need monthly/yearly renewal, you can&#8217;t/shouldn&#8217;t allow checking out on gateways that don&#8217;t support automatic renewals (like CoD), instead, here you can restrict users to checkout using PayPal for example.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Products with very low margins: Some products (even sold at good price points) might have low margins (couple of dollars) because of the competition, in such conditions, you might want to limit the allowed payment methods to those who offer very low fees.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúI wanted to make the payment method for cheap products different than for the more expensive products.<br />\n  This plugin is doing the job very good!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-very-good-82/\" rel=\"ugc\">phdhont</a></p>\n<p>‚ÄúWorks great for tags: Great free resource, I also appreciate the test area, thanks guys, you deserve 5 stars.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-for-tags/\" rel=\"ugc\">SeaLuke</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>üèÜ Pro Version</h3>\n<p>Our <strong><a href=\"https://wpfactory.com/item/payment-gateways-per-product-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" title=\"Plugin Pro version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Pro version</a></strong> features further expands the capabilities of our plugin so you can have more control on product &amp; gateways restrictions, like:</p>\n<h3>üèÜ Payment Method Control at Product and Variation Level</h3>\n<p>This functionality extends your control beyond categories and tags, allowing you to specify payment gateways for individual products and even their variations.</p>\n<p>This granular level of customization is perfect for unique items or specific variations that require special payment handling.</p>\n<p>For example, you could set a high-end product variation to only be purchasable through credit card transactions, while a standard version of the product might be available for purchase through multiple payment methods</p>\n<h3>üèÜ Fallback Payment Method Selection</h3>\n<p>In scenarios where your cart contains mixed products from different rules, potentially leading to a conflict where no payment method is available, this feature comes into play.</p>\n<p>It allows you to designate a fallback payment gateway for such cases. This ensures that there&#8217;s always an available payment option for customers, even when their cart contains a complex mix of products with different payment gateway rules.</p>\n<h3>üèÜ Payment Gateway Restriction by Country</h3>\n<p>This feature allows you to tailor the availability of payment gateways based on the customer&#8217;s billing country.</p>\n<p>This is particularly useful for businesses that operate internationally and need to comply with various regional financial regulations or want to offer localized payment options.</p>\n<p>For instance, you might restrict certain payment methods to customers in the EU while offering different options to those in the US.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it can be used to limit expensive international transaction fees for certain regions by offering local payment solutions, or to comply with regional restrictions on certain payment services.</p>\n<h3>üíØ Why WPFactory?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experience You Can Trust:</strong> Over a decade in the business</li>\n<li><strong>Wide Plugin Selection:</strong> Offering 65+ unique and powerful plugins</li>\n<li><strong>Highly-Rated Support:</strong> Backed by hundreds of 5-star reviews</li>\n<li><strong>Expert Team:</strong> Dedicated developers and technical support at your service</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next?

How to\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation &amp; How to</a></p>\n<p>Every payment gateway has its own advantages/disadvantages, they are not equal when it comes to fees, adaptability from customers, regional popularity, and even in security as some gateways are known for larger fraud cases than others.</p>\n<p>Using conditional/custom payment methods for your store to restrict what gateways appear for specific products comes handy here, where you will be able to show/hide payment gateways based on what&#8217;s in the cart.</p>\n<p>For most stores, PayPal is considered an expensive payment gateway, and when you&#8217;re selling expensive products (hundreds or probably thousands), you want to prevent users from checking out using PayPal and instead, use wire transfers or even local payment gateways that offer competitive rates, where you can keep your profit margins higher.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, this is what you can expect to get with this plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable based on product category.</li>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable based on product tag.</li>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable by product level (Pro).</li>\n<li>Control what payment gateways are available/unavailable by Country (Pro).</li>\n<li>Show a fallback gateway in the case of gateways allow &amp; disallow conflict (Pro).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get into more details and see what features the plugin offers.</p>\n<h3>ü§ù Recommended By</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://passwordprotectwp.com/restrict-woocommerce-payment-methods-product-types/\" title=\"PPWP Pro: How to Restrict WooCommerce Payment Methods Based on Product Types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PPWP Pro: How to Restrict WooCommerce Payment Methods Based on Product Types</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sktthemes.org/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-payment-gateway-plugins/\" title=\"SKT Themes: Top Payment Gateways Plugins You MUST Have\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SKT Themes: Top Payment Gateways Plugins You MUST Have</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webprogramacion.com/especifica-con-que-pasarela-pagar-cada-producto-en-woocommerce/\" title=\"Web Programacion: How to Specify with which gateway to pay each product in WooCommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Programacion: How to Specify Payment Gateways to Each Product in WooCommerce</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>üöÄ Main Features: FREE Version</h3>\n<h3>The plugin works in 2 modes:</h3>\n<p>It lets you select what payment gateways to show if a product category or tag is added (meaning hide all other gateways in this case).<br />\nSecond, lets you select what gateways to hide when a selected product category or product is in the cart (i.e. all other gateways will appear).</p>\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\n<p>Category A is sold using all payment gateways, no restrictions.</p>\n<p>Category B is sold using all gateways except PayPal.</p>\n<p>Category C is sold only using wire transfer (very high price).</p>\n<p>You can configure the plugin to reflect the above 3 cases like the following:</p>\n<p>Category A: untouched, won&#8217;t be included/excluded from the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Category B: Under PayPal gateway, we insert category B on the &#8220;Excluded&#8221; section.</p>\n<p>Category C: Add it to the &#8220;Excluded&#8221; section of all other gateways.</p>\n<p>Note: Adding category C to the &#8220;Included&#8221; section of wire transfer will hide this gateway from all other categories, so you have to be either &#8220;allow all except&#8221; or &#8220;hide all except&#8221;</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Restrict Payment Gateway Visibility by Product Category</h3>\n<p>This feature allows you to control which payment gateways are available for specific product categories.<br />\nFor instance, if you have products in Category C that should only be purchased via wire transfer due to their high price, you can set this category to be exclusively associated with the wire transfer payment gateway.<br />\nSimilarly, for Category B, you can exclude PayPal as a payment option, while Category A remains unrestricted, compatible with all payment gateways.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Restrict Payment Gateway Visibility by Product Tag</h3>\n<p>Similar to the category-based control, this mode lets you specify payment gateways based on product tags.<br />\nThis means you can have even finer control by tagging specific products and associating them with certain payment methods. For example, if a product is tagged with a particular label indicating a special payment condition, the plugin will automatically adjust the available payment gateways for that product in the cart.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Intuitive &amp; easy to use interface</h3>\n<p>By default, the plugin doesn&#8217;t change anything on installation &amp; activation, once you decide what gateways to show/hide for product categories or tags, go to WooCommerce &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Payment Gateways per Products&#8221; and under desired tab (category or tag), start including/excluding categories on respective gateways you&#8217;ve set.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Global Support For All Gateways</h3>\n<p>The plugin supports any gateway (standard or customized), all gateways that are installed &amp; enabled on WooCommerce &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Payments will be supported, and appear on plugin settings, where you will be able to conditionally control what product categories or tags appear on each gateway.</p>\n<h3>üöÄ Plugin Use Cases</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Expensive products: This might be the most use case for this plugin, you want to restrict customers buying expensive items to pay using wire transfer only.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cheap products: Imagine you have to deal with a wire transfer or cash on delivery for an $7 item, does that make sense to your business operations? The plugin can restrict gateways based on products of your choice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Subscription products: when you sell products that need monthly/yearly renewal, you can&#8217;t/shouldn&#8217;t allow checking out on gateways that don&#8217;t support automatic renewals (like CoD), instead, here you can restrict users to checkout using PayPal for example.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Products with very low margins: Some products (even sold at good price points) might have low margins (couple of dollars) because of the competition, in such conditions, you might want to limit the allowed payment methods to those who offer very low fees.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúI wanted to make the payment method for cheap products different than for the more expensive products.<br />\n  This plugin is doing the job very good!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-very-good-82/\" rel=\"ugc\">phdhont</a></p>\n<p>‚ÄúWorks great for tags: Great free resource, I also appreciate the test area, thanks guys, you deserve 5 stars.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-for-tags/\" rel=\"ugc\">SeaLuke</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>üèÜ Pro Version</h3>\n<p>Our <strong><a href=\"https://wpfactory.com/item/payment-gateways-per-product-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wporg&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" title=\"Plugin Pro version\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Plugin Pro version</a></strong> features further expands the capabilities of our plugin so you can have more control on product &amp; gateways restrictions, like:</p>\n<h3>üèÜ Payment Method Control at Product and Variation Level</h3>\n<p>This functionality extends your control beyond categories and tags, allowing you to specify payment gateways for individual products and even their variations.</p>\n<p>This granular level of customization is perfect for unique items or specific variations that require special payment handling.</p>\n<p>For example, you could set a high-end product variation to only be purchasable through credit card transactions, while a standard version of the product might be available for purchase through multiple payment methods</p>\n<h3>üèÜ Fallback Payment Method Selection</h3>\n<p>In scenarios where your cart contains mixed products from different rules, potentially leading to a conflict where no payment method is available, this feature comes into play.</p>\n<p>It allows you to designate a fallback payment gateway for such cases. This ensures that there&#8217;s always an available payment option for customers, even when their cart contains a complex mix of products with different payment gateway rules.</p>\n<h3>üèÜ Payment Gateway Restriction by Country</h3>\n<p>This feature allows you to tailor the availability of payment gateways based on the customer&#8217;s billing country.</p>\n<p>This is particularly useful for businesses that operate internationally and need to comply with various regional financial regulations or want to offer localized payment options.</p>\n<p>For instance, you might restrict certain payment methods to customers in the EU while offering different options to those in the US.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it can be used to limit expensive international transaction fees for certain regions by offering local payment solutions, or to comply with regional restrictions on certain payment services.</p>\n<h3>üíØ Why WPFactory?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Experience You Can Trust:</strong> Over a decade in the business</li>\n<li><strong>Wide Plugin Selection:</strong> Offering 65+ unique and powerful plugins</li>\n<li><strong>Highly-Rated Support:</strong> Backed by hundreds of 5-star reviews</li>\n<li><strong>Expert Team:</strong> Dedicated developers and technical support at your service</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Next?
