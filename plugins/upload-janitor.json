For each file, it searches pages or posts that<br />\nreference the file.  That is, the plugin searches for the part of each file&#8217;s path that comes after the path<br />\nto the uploads folder, such as <code>2010/01/my great but forgotten image.jpg</code>.</p>\n<p>The path is searched as-is, as well as URL-encoded with &#8216;%20&#8217; for spaces, and the same with &#8216;+&#8217; for spaces &#8211;<br />\n    2010/01/my%20great%20but%20forgotten%20image.jpg and <code>2010/01/my+great+but+forgotten+image.jpg</code>.

If a revision references a file, the file will be considered still in use.</p>\n<h3>Restoring</h3>\n<p>If something goes wrong, you can always restore.  If you have shell access to your site, this is easy.  Simply log in,<br />\nnavigate to your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory, and locate the Upload Janitor archive &#8211; it will look like<br />\n    upload_janitor_archive_YYYY-mm-dd.tar.gz.  Then, type:</p>\n<pre><code>    tar zxf &lt;archive name&gt; .\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will restore all files within the archive.</p>\n<p>If you do not have shell access to your server, you will have to download the archive, extract it, then upload the<br />\ncontents back to your server.
