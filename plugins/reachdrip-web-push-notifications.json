        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need to sign up to ReachDrip to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can create a FREE account from the plugin itself. If you are already using ReachDrip just copy your <strong>API Key</strong> &amp; <strong>Secret Key</strong> from ReachDrip control panel and paste in WordPress dashboard once.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t see any code added to my header or footer when I view my page source</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your theme needs to have the header and footer actions in place before the &#8221; and before the &#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t see opt-in box on my site</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using cache plugins like W3 Total Cache, Super Cache etc. Just purge the cache once. Also purge CloudFlare or CDN once to see it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can ReachDrip be implemented on HTTP Websites?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, ReachDrip can be implemented on both HTTP or HTTPS (SSL) websites. Since Push Notifications requires the websites to be running on SSL, we create a SSL sub-domain for your websites like <strong>https://YOUR-SITE-DOMAIN.reachdrip.com</strong>. If your site is already on SSL, please enable SSL settings from ReachDrip control panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will happen when i reach 50,000 subscribers in my FREE account?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you reach 50000 subscribers, ReachDrip will continue to work and let you collect subscribers but will restrict notifications to new subscribers. You can send unlimited notifications to your first 50,000 subscriber but to send notifications to all subscribers you need to upgrade to premium (Paid) account. Check our <a href=\"https://reachdrip.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pricing plans</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will push notifications look like?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on the browser! Each browser will display your notifications somewhat differently, but in general the notifications will look appropriate for the device/OS/browser on which they are displayed</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any design templates to choose for opt-in box?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there are many templates for HTTP based setup opt-in. Configuration is possible within your ReachDrip control panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Targeting Subscribers with Segments</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can quickly categorize subscribers into different segments. This helps you efficiently target a particular set of subscribers registered under particular segments (group). A typical use case could be one segment each for your categories i.e. Sports, Fitness, Homepage, etc.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create segments from Segments tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the following JS code on your category pages or on any pages of your site</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Subscribing for Single Segment</strong></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    var _rd = [];\n    _rd.push('Sports');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>**Subscribing for Multiple Segments</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\n    var _rd = [];\n    _rd.push('Sports', 'Fitness');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Soon, you have some subscribers under segments, you would be able to send personalized messages to specific segments. Users interested in <strong>Sports</strong> are more likely to click on your notifications about <strong>Sports</strong> than <strong>Politics</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
