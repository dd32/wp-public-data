        "description": "<p>Now you can easily manage plant and garden information on your WordPress blog. This plugin brings your plant profiles, plots of land and planting plans together enabling you to track key dates for sowing and harvesting, planting conditions, your garden environment and more. A range of shortcodes enables you to add plant and plot information to other blog pages &#8211; ideal if you use WordPress to keep a garden journal.  Suitable for both flower and vegetable gardens.</p>\n<p>= The three core modules are<br />\n* <strong>Plant Profiles</strong> &#8211; A library for information on plants such as how to grow them, what space they need, when to sow and harvest them etc.  Most of this information would typically be available on the back of a seed packet.<br />\n* <strong>Plot Profiles</strong> &#8211; Areas of land for growing.  You can define as many ‘Plots’ as they wish – for example: a front garden; a back garden; and a vegetable garden.<br />\n* <strong>Planting Profiles</strong> &#8211; All the plants that are to be grown in a specific Plot.  Multiple Planting Plans can be added to cover, for example, different years.  Planting plans will enable you to organise your plants within zones or ‘Beds’ within the plot.  Each Bed contains ‘Sowings’ (which can be one or many) of the same plant. This enables you to list what is growing in the bed over a specific time period.</p>\n<h4>FloraPress Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Plant Profiles (limited to 10 for the free version)</li>\n<li>Plot profiles &#8211; add unlimited profiles of the areas where you grow plants</li>\n<li>Planting plants &#8211; add unlimited planting plants &#8211; profile your existing garden, plan future planting</li>\n<li>Front end pages to share information with others</li>\n<li>Shortcodes to enable you to add plant profiles, plot profiles and planting plan information whereever you want on your blog (e.g. add plant profiles to post to create a garden journal ) </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Upgrade to FlorPress Premium for additional features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add more than 10 plant profiles</li>\n<li>Premium version will add fields to track the results from plant sowings – e.g. how many seeds germinated and grew to term, what the weight of the harvest was, what the monetary value of a harvest was.</li>\n<li>Premium version will include a basic pop-up ‘Warning’ when the plants environmental requirements don’t match those of the plot the User is intending to grow it in.</li>\n</ul>\n",
