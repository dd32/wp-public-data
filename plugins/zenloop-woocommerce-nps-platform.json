NPS correlates with revenue growth and is used by ⅔ of Fortune 1000 companies in the US. More details on the methodology can be found here.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20open%20a%20zenloop%20account%3F'>\nHow do I open a zenloop account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to zenloop’s homepage: <a href=\"https://www.zenloop.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.zenloop.com</a> and click on “Test zenloop” to get to the register page.<br />\nJust enter your company credentials and click “Create account”.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='when%20will%20the%20delivery%20survey%20email%20be%20sent%3F'>\nWhen will the delivery survey email be sent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We send our email to survey your delivery 5 days after an order.

You can change the question subject. However, it is important to stick to the NPS question methodology: “How likely would you recommend [brand / process] to a friend or colleague?” Why? Because the question type “Would you recommend XYZ to a friend?” aims to measure customer loyalty. People only recommend a brand/service, if they are satisfied and emotionally connected with it. If both is true, they become loyal customers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%E2%80%99s%20not%20working'>\nIt’s not working\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have problems with the zenloop for WooCommerce data sync, and have already tried to delete and reinstall the plugin, there are a few other possible causes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your setup doesn&#8217;t meet the minimum requirements. The WooCommerce plugin for WordPress requires PHP 7 or greater. We also recommend you update to the latest version of WooCommerce.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have conflicts with your WordPress Theme or other plugins. You may need to switch themes, or deactivate all plugins except WooCommerce and zenloop for WooCommerce, and try again.
