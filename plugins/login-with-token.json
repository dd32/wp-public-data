Solutions using OTP for logins usually send one OTP via SMS and then ask for the generated OTP in a form. After that, user logs in.</p>\n<p>In this solution, the user receives a link (with a token in the URL). The token is uniquem and after clicking the link, the user is autaomatically logged in, without the need to provide a OTP or extra information.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
