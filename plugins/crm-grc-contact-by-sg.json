For this, you must have already created a form with the <a href=\"https://fr.wordpress.org/plugins/mailin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sendinblue plugin</a></p>\n<p><strong>Inside the API creation page you can find two major sections, one for companies and another for contacts. Note that it is not possible to create a contact without creating a company.</strong></p>\n<p>These sections are composed of three parts:<br />\n* The first is the list of fields of the API GRC Contact<br />\n* The second corresponds to the fields of your Sendinblue form that you want to match<br />\n* The third, gives you the possibility to set a default value. This can be used if the Internet user hasn&#8217;t filled in an optional field or if you wish to insert a value in GRC Contact without there being a correspondence with a Sendinblue field, for example the origin of the contact &#8220;Website &#8211; documentation request&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>The last section allows you to match the fields of the Sendinblue form with your custom fields.</strong></p>\n<p>For this the operation is somewhat different :<br />\n* On the first line, you must list the name of the custom fields you want to pass separated by a pipe character |<br />\n* On the second line, you must list the name of the fields of the Sendinblue form that you want to match separated by a pipe character |, in the same order as the first line</p>\n<p><strong>Debugging</strong></p>\n<p>The GRC Contact API for Sendinblue plugin provide two pages to follow the success and error API message.<br />\nGo to GRC <em>Contact&gt; Logs API success</em> or to <em>GRC Contact&gt; Logs API error</em></p>\n<p><strong>Support</strong></p>\n<p>If you have any issues or if you would like help installing contact me : <a href=\"https://gendt.fr\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://gendt.fr</a></p>\n",
