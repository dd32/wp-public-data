To approve a new PTE, the polyglots team member must be a General Translation Editor (GTE) for the language, meaning one that have access to all plugins for the specific language, since the one approving you off course needs to be fluent in your language to be able to read your first translations and check that they are of good quality.</p>\n<p>To become PTE, you simply request it at the Polyglots forum.<br />\nWe suggest you use the example below &#8211; exchange xx_XX with your locale (ex. da_DK for danish in Denmark) and XXXXX with your wordpress.org username (ex. mine is kasperta).
