Here you can select the product features you have created.</p>\n<p>If you can not see the &#8220;Product Features&#8221; box, click on &#8220;Screen Options&#8221; in the top right of the window and tick the &#8220;Product Features&#8221; checkbox.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I move the product features to another location?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you are logged in to your site, go to &#8220;Appearance&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Customize&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;WooCommerce&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Product Features&#8221;<br />\nNow you have the option of selecting from five locations:<br />\n&#8211; After product heading<br />\n&#8211; After product price<br />\n&#8211; After product description<br />\n&#8211; After product cart<br />\n&#8211; After product meta</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the title &#8220;Product Features&#8221; that is shown?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. This can be done using the built in <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter\" title=\"Function Reference/add filter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress add filter function</a>.<br />\nFor example, if you want to make the tile &#8220;Super Awesome Title&#8221; you could use the following code snippet</p>\n<pre><code>function change_product_feature_title() {\n  return 'Super Awesome Title';\n}\nadd_action( 'pffwc_title', 'change_product_feature_title' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the font size of the title &#8220;Product Features&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can target the font-size or any other CSS property by using like the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>p.pffwc-title {\n  font-size: 3em;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the size of the product feature images?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can change the max-width targeting .pffwc-item with your CSS, for example, if I you want four in the row, use 23% as the max-width.</p>\n<pre><code>.pffwc-item {\n  max-width: 23%;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Wait what? Why 23%, why not 25%?<br />\nWell there is 2% margin on the right of each item, if you want four in the row that would be 4 x 2 = 8. 100 &#8211; 8 is 92, so you need to divide 92 by 4 = 23%</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the way the text box (tooltip) that appears displays?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can target the tooltip box using .pffwc-item-tooltip as the selector for your CSS, for example, if you want to change the background colour to orange:</p>\n<pre><code>.pffwc-item-tooltip {\n  background: orange;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
