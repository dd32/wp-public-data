Just add those to the plugin settings and you are all set.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%20doesn%27t%20seem%20to%20work%2C%20i%20can%27t%20see%20any%20opt-in%20prompt%20or%20javascript%20code.'>\nIt doesn&#8217;t seem to work, I can&#8217;t see any opt-in prompt or javascript code.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using W3 Total Cache, SuperCache or any other cache plugin, you would need to first purge the cache once after the plugin has been configured. CloudFlare or any other CDN must also be purged once for the plugin to work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20pushalert%20work%20on%20http%20websites%3F'>\nCan PushAlert work on HTTP websites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it works with both http and https websites. Push Notifications require an SSL connection, therefore, for HTTP websites we provide a branded HTTPS subdomain similar to https://yourdomain.pushalert.co.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20will%20happen%20after%20i%20cross%203000%20subscribers%20limit%20in%20my%20free%20account%3F'>\nWhat will happen after I cross 3000 subscribers limit in my free account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you reach 3000 subscribers, you won&#8217;t be able to send any notifications but your website visitors will still be able to subscribe to push notifications. You would have to upgrade to a <a href=\"https://pushalert.co/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">paid plan</a> to send notifications.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20a%20demo%20of%20how%20push%20notifications%20will%20look%3F'>\nCan I see a demo of how Push Notifications will look?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can jump over to the <a href=\"https://pushalert.co/demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo</a> page and try it out for yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20configure%20custom%20automated%20woocoomerce%20shipment%20notifications%3F'>\nHow to configure custom automated WooCoomerce shipment notifications?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using any custom shipment plugin (other than WooCommerce Shipment Tracking), then create a custom order status with slug &#8220;shipped&#8221;. Once the order status is changed to &#8220;Shipped&#8221;, notification will be automatically sent to the subscribed customer.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
