It is a connection-oriented, text-based network protocol of the Internet protocol family and as such is on the seventh layer of the ISO/OSI model, the application layer.<br />\nLike any other network protocol, it contains the rules for proper communication between networked computers. SMTP is specifically responsible for sending and forwarding e-mails from a sender to a recipient.<br />\nSince its release in 1982 as the successor to the &#8216;Mail Box Protocol&#8217; in Arpanet, SMTP has become the standard protocol for sending e-mails. However, the SMTP procedure remains largely invisible to the normal consumer, as it is executed in the background by the e-mail programme used.<br />\nOnly if the software, the webmail application on the browser or the mobile e-mail application does not automatically determine the SMTP protocol when creating an account, does it have to be set manually to ensure smooth e-mail traffic.</p>\n<h4>SMTP presets</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Aruba</li>\n<li>Gmail (tls and ssl)</li>\n<li>Yahoo (tls and ssl)</li>\n<li>Outlook (tls and ssl)</li>\n<li>Office365 (tls)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Would you like to find more presets (that you think are useful to other users)? Open a request in the support form and provide the necessary connection data (auth, server address and port). In the next cf7-smtp version you will find the required configuration among the presets.</p>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>it&#8217;s warmly advised to store at least the password into config.php as a constant. And in addition, it&#8217;s also very easy! It needs only to add</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'CF7_SMTP_USER_PASS', 'mySecr3tp4ssWord' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>into your <code>config.php</code> just before</p>\n<pre><code>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */\n</code></pre>\n<p>All passwords will be stored encrypted, but still it is not good practice to put it into database!</p>\n<h4>Quick setup</h4>\n<p>as with the user password other constants can also be defined.
