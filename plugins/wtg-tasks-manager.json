Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different<br />\nenvironment for WTG Task Manager &#8211; possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common<br />\nin software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Please install WTG Tasks Manager from WordPress.org by going to Plugins &#8211;&gt; Add New and searching &#8220;WTG Tasks Manager&#8221;. This is safer and quicker than any other methods.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I import tasks from a .csv file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can import tasks to WTG Tasks Manager from a .csv file using my CSV 2 POST plugin. Tasks in this plugin are<br />\nsimply posts and CSV 2 POST allows the creation of posts for custom post types. Please use my forum to get help<br />\non this subject.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I integrate WTG Tasks Manager with WTG Project Manager?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes these two plugins are being designed to work together and create a larger solution. Other plugins will integrate with both of these<br />\nand the larger goal is to create a professional project management system.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why choose WTG Tasks Manager over other tasks management plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have a keen interest in allowing freelancers to access and complete tasks. I also want to be able to award credits instead of money<br />\nfor selected tasks. Credits would be spent on services and products. I have many ideas aimed at getting the community involved in development<br />\nthat I do not see in other plugins. As I roll out new features or new plugins that integrate with this one, you may find your desired solution.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>As a WebTechGlobal subscriber can I get higher priority support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; subscribers are put ahead of my Free Workflow and will not only result in a quicker response for support<br />\nbut requests for new features are marked with higher priority.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I hire you to customize the plugin for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; you can pay to improve the plugin to suit your needs. However many improvements will be done free.<br />\nPlease post your requirements on the plugins forum first before sending me Paypal or Bitcoins. If your request is acceptable<br />\nwithin my plans it will always be added to the WTG Tasks Management plugin which is part of my workflow system. The tasks<br />\npriority can be increased based on your WebTechGlobal subscription status, donations or contributions you have made.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
