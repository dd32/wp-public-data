        "description": "<p>The GTS Translation plugin provides human quality translation by allowing you to combine automatic translation and human post-editing (crowdsourcing). Your blog content is initially translated by our translation server. The content is then post-edited by human translators through our online editing system. You can use the GTS community of translators, or you can assign the post-editing to your own community of translators to maintain complete control of the process.</p>\n<p>When you use the GTS Translation plugin, translated content is cached in your WordPress database and indexed by search engines. This will increase the traffic to your website and grow your international readership.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guaranteed to increase your traffic by at least 30% after 2 months; some customers have seen over 100% increase in traffic</li>\n<li>Supports over 30 languages</li>\n<li>Uses private, secure translation server</li>\n<li>Publish translated content immediately or following review</li>\n<li>Crowdsourcing: create your own community of translators or use our community</li>\n<li>SEO: translates Permalink URL names and meta tags</li>\n<li>Custom online, side-by-side editor makes post-editing easy</li>\n<li>Translated posts can be retweeted</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Uninstalling</h3>\n<p>Simply click the &#8220;Delete&#8221; link in the plugin management window.  This will delete all of your translated data, so<br />\nplease be careful!</p>\n<h3>Virtual Host Setup</h3>\n<h3>How to setup the Virtual Host feature on the GTS Plugin</h3>\n<p>By default, the translated versions of your website/blog resolves to a URL address which is a subdirectory of your site’s URL address. For example,<br />\nthe Spanish version of your site resolves to http://mywebsite.com/language/es.</p>\n<p>With the GTS Translation Plugin Virtual Host feature you can publish translated versions of yor website/blog under a separate subdomain or top-level<br />\ndomain (TLD). So for example, if your blog is www.mywebsite.com you can serve the Spanish version from www.mywebsite.es.  Alternately, you can use<br />\n subdomains (e.g. es.mywebsite.com) so that you don&#8217;t have to buy a domain for each language.</p>\n<p>To implement the virtual hosts feature, follow these steps:</p>\n<h3>1. Configure DNS</h3>\n<p><strong>For Top Level Domains:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Register your new domain (e.g. www.mywebsite.es.) with a recognized domain registrar.</li>\n<li>In your DNS zone, set the A record for www.mywebsite.es to point to the IP address of your web server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>For Subdomains:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a CNAME alias for your web server (e.g. es.mywebsite.com)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How to complete these steps will depend on your hosting provider.  If you get stuck, please follow up with your support team.</p>\n<h3>2.  Configure your Web Server</h3>\n<p>Please note that all of the translated blogs will be hosted from the same WordPress installation as your current blog.</p>\n<p><strong>For Hosted Blogs:</strong></p>\n<p>Your hosting provider will provide a control panel to map a hostname to a Document Root.  For each translated host name, enter the exact same Document<br />\nRoot as your blog.</p>\n<p><strong>For Self-hosted Blogs:</strong></p>\n<p>These instructions are only valid for Apache.  If you use IIS or another web server, please consult the relevant documentation.</p>\n<p>First off, you need to be set up with Name Based Virtual Hosts (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/name-based.html).  Once you have your blog&#8217;s<br />\nvirtual host set up, add the new hostname to the ServerAlias directive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n\n  ServerName     www.mywebsite.com\n  ServerAlias    www.mywebsite.es\n  DocumentRoot   /path/to/wordpress/install\n\n  # Other configuration here...\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have multiple aliases, remember that the ServerAlias can be a list or can include wildcards…it can save time!</p>\n<h3>3.  Configure the GTS Plugin</h3>\n<p>This is the easiest part:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;GTS Settings&#8221; admin page.</li>\n<li>Enter the host name in the &#8220;Virtual Host&#8221; input next to the desired language.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Voila, translated links will point to your new host!</p>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>While providing high quality translation with our crowdsourced post-editing functionality, it&#8217;s of the utmost importance<br />\nto ensure the security of your blog.  We provide functionality that is out-of-band of the traditional WordPress publishing<br />\ncycle.  As such, our plugin adds a hook into your blog that allows GTS to programmatically update the translated content<br />\nin your local WordPress database.  We&#8217;ve put a lot of thought into ensuring that our system can use this hook while locking<br />\nit against any potential malicious users.</p>\n<p>The first step to securing our system is to make sure that it&#8217;s really <em>you</em> and your blog requesting that your blog be<br />\nsigned up for translation.  First, we only accept registration requests that originate from the WP admin page of the blog<br />\nthat will be translated.  When the user clicks off of the admin page, a digital fingerprint is created and saved to your<br />\nWP database, and then it&#8217;s sent over an SSL-encrypted channel to our server.  When the registration request reaches our<br />\nserver, we will open an HTTP connection back to the requesting blog and verify that a) it has our plugin installed, and b)<br />\nusing an encryption technique called hashing, that the fingerprint matches.  If one of those checks fail, we won&#8217;t register<br />\n the blog for translation.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve verified the blog, we&#8217;ll assign you a Blog ID and an API Access Key.  These will be automatically added to<br />\nyour configuration panel via the registration panel, plus they will be sent to your administrator email address.  We will<br />\nuse these two strings for identifying your blog and to ensure that information isn&#8217;t tampered either en-route to us.  It<br />\nwill also be used by your blog to verify that translated content posted back to your blog is legitimate.  Again, we use<br />\nan encryption technique called hashing.  Whenever your blog sends a translation request to us or we send translated content<br />\nback to you, we create a signature (or hash) of that content PLUS the API Access Key (if you&#8217;re really interested in details,<br />\nusing the SHA-1 algorithm).  Provided that the API Access Key is kept secret, this technique is extremely secure and resistant<br />\nto tampering.  The odds of a malicious person guessing your API key are astronomical : more than 1 in 10^229.  However,<br />\nas with any password, security depends on keeping it secret.  If at any time, you think that your key has been compromised,<br />\nGTS will deactivate the current key and issue you a new one.</p>\n<p>Other measures we take to secure data coming back to your blog include using a whitelist of IP addresses that are allowed<br />\nto use the hook for posting translated content and limiting the size of the post to ~250KB so that, even if all other measures<br />\nfail, an attacker can&#8217;t eat up all the memory on your machine.</p>\n<p>We have dedicated lots of thought to locking down this system, and we are very confident that it&#8217;s secure.<br />\nAfter reading this, we hope you will be too!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin directory to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory or install via WordPress&#8217; automated install feature.</li>\n<li>Activate the GTS plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in your WordPress blog&#8217;s admin area.</li>\n<li>Register with GTS and follow the workflow to configure your blog and prepare it for translation.</li>\n<li><em>(Recommended)</em> Add the GTS Language Selector widget to one of your theme&#8217;s <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Widgets_SubPanel\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">widget panels</a>.</li>\n<li><em>(Optional)</em> Designate a virtual host for each language in the GTS Settings panel (e.g. fr.myblog.com).  First, be sure to speak to your system administrator about configuring virtual hosts.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What&#8217;s so special about our plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most of the other translation widgets and plugins, like those that are powered by Google and Microsoft, provide on-the-fly<br />\ntranslation of your blog content. This has two negative aspects: first, the translation that your reader sees is raw machine<br />\ntranslation which is known to be of questionable quality.  Second, the content is not indexed by the search engines, which<br />\nmeans that readers can not find your translated content on search engines and you lose out on valuable search engine traffic.</p>\n<p>The GTS plugin provides human translation quality which is far superior than the other plugins. And the translated content<br />\nis cached on the same server that your blog is hosted on. Search engines will index your translated content and your blog<br />\nwill come up on keyword searches. This will drive more traffic to your blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is the translation done?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Translation is a 2-step process. In the first stage, your content is translated by our own machine translation server. Then,<br />\nthe translated content is edited by human translators who review the machine translation and make the necessary linguistic<br />\ncorrections. After the content is edited, a moderator reviews the content again to verify that it meets quality standards.<br />\nOnce the moderator approves the translation, the post goes live on your blog.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who does the translation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have two choices: you can use your own people to do the human editing, or you can use the GTS community.</p>\n<p>If you have associates that are qualified to edit the translation, or if you yourself are proficient in another language<br />\nand can edit your own translation, then you can control the process yourself through the GTS Plugin Admin panel. This Admin<br />\npanel allows you to assign Editor and Moderator priviledges to your own network of people so you can keep the process in-house.</p>\n<p>Or, you can have the work done by the GTS community which is a worldwide network of hundreds of translators and language<br />\nexperts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are comments translated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Comments are are passed through as-is.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which languages are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Input: English</li>\n<li>Output: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, and Turkish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We&#8217;re continually adding new languages, so for the latest list, click <a href=\"http://translate.gts-translation.com/api/supportedLanguages\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What URLs will the translated blogs have?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, the translated blogs will be accessed in subfolders of your main blog URL. So for example, the French language<br />\nblog will be accessed via http://blogname/language/fr. The Spanish language blog will be accessed via http://blogname/language/es.<br />\nAnd so forth.</p>\n<p>If you want to assign your foreign language blogs to a subdomain or a TLD (Top Level Domain, like blogname.fr), you can do<br />\nso by making the apporpriate configuration settings on the GTS Plugin area of your WordPress Admin panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which character encodings are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>UTF-8 <em>only</em>.  Note that WordPress is configured to use UTF-8 by default.  If you require another character encoding, please send a feature request.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the plugin work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you publish a post in WordPress, our plugin will send that content onward to GTS.  When we receive it, the content<br />\nwill be immediately passed through our machine translation software.  Then, it will become available for our crowdsourced<br />\neditors to begin the post-editing process.  They will improve the quality of the translated content, after which, crowdsourced<br />\nmoderators will review the improvements.  When the translated text is ready for prime time, one of the moderators will approve<br />\nit, and the human-translated post will be sent back to your blog.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you first sign up with us, our system will pull in some additional information.  In order to get your<br />\ntranslated blog looking good from the get-go, we do an initial translation of all your blog&#8217;s tags, categories, pages, and<br />\nthe posts that appear on your blog&#8217;s home page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the content stored?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Before the translated content is approved, it is stored on a staging area on our own secure servers.</p>\n<p>Once the translated content is approved by a moderator, it is stored on your own server in your WordPress database.<br />\nWe&#8217;ll also keep a copy in our database in case the moderators or editors decide to make more changes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I switch my blog to Russian, Japanese, Chinese, etc. all I see are question marks&#8230;what gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This happens when the data is stored in MySQL with the wrong character encoding.  Execute the following SQL (being sure to<br />\nreplace &#8216;wp_&#8217; with the prefix specified in wp-config.php if you&#8217;ve changed that value):</p>\n<pre><code>ALTER TABLE wp_gts_translated_options CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET 'utf8';\nALTER TABLE wp_gts_translated_posts CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET 'utf8';\nALTER TABLE wp_gts_translated_terms CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET 'utf8';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then get in touch with us so that we can help you reload your content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I enabled Chinese language, but hardly any of the links work.  What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to work correctly, translations to Chinese require plugin version 1.1.6 or greater.  Version 1.1.5 will<br />\ntranslate your posts, but won&#8217;t properly display them.  Upgrade using your WP Admin panel, and you&#8217;ll be good to go.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the virtual host feature?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please see the <em>Virtual Host Setup</em> section in the <em>Other Notes</em> tab.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is theme translation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your WordPress theme is made up of a series of PHP files called templates.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My header link to the home page isn&#8217;t localized properly.  What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using theme translation, these links should be handled automatically.  Otherwise, you&#8217;re probably using the <code>bloginfo('url')</code> or <code>home_url()</code> function.<br />\nReplace <code>bloginfo('url')</code> or <code>echo home_url('/')</code> with <code>gts_get_homepage_link()</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I translated my theme, but now it&#8217;s mangled.  What should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, translating PHP source files correctly is tricky business and doesn&#8217;t always work correctly.  If you have translated your<br />\ntemplates and want to revert to the originals for your translated blogs, untick the &#8220;Use translated templates&#8221; checkbox on the GTS<br />\nconfiguration page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I translated my theme, but there&#8217;s still a bunch of English text?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like above, it&#8217;s tough to sort out what should be translated.  Plus, there are probably random English text strings embedded in the PHP<br />\nsource, function arguments, etc.  In order to get the most out of template translation, try these tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wherever possible, try to keep your text <em>outside</em> of PHP code blocks.</li>\n<li>If you must embed English text in PHP, then surround it with the WP <code>__</code> function or its variants e.g. <code>random_php_method('hello')</code><br />\nbecomes <code>random_php_method(__('hello'))</code>.  IMPORTANT this only works for single-quoted arguments.  recognized functions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>_e</code></li>\n<li><code>translate</code></li>\n<li><code>esc_attr__</code></li>\n<li><code>esc_attr_e</code></li>\n<li><code>esc_html__</code></li>\n<li><code>esc_html_e</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some english language text comes from deep down in WordPress&#8217; code, so you probably won&#8217;t be able to get 100% of the text, but you should<br />\nbe able to get the lion&#8217;s share taken care of.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I wrote a post with a ton of text, but it never gets translated&#8230;what&#8217;s happening?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a maximum entry size of 256KB&#8230;roughly equivalent to 75 pages of single-spaced text.  Have you run into that limit?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any incompatible plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unforunately, yes.  Here is a list of plugins that cause problems with the GTS Plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniquefier : incompatible with multi-byte character sets.  Posts come out as ? marks.</li>\n<li>ICanLocalize : inserts invalid HTML into the post body.</li>\n<li>Recently Popular : directly selects posts from the DB, so plugin hooks are bypassed.</li>\n<li>Another WordPress Classifieds Plugin (aka AWPCP) : Classifieds cannot be translated and URLs produce 404 for foreign languages.</li>\n<li>Title-Case : doesn&#8217;t properly support non-ASCII characters, resulting in capitalized letters in the middle of words.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list is a work in progress and may grow as we roll out to more users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How secure is the system?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please see the <em>Security</em> section in the <em>Other Notes</em> tab.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This will increase the traffic to your website and grow your international readership.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guaranteed to increase your traffic by at least 30% after 2 months; some customers have seen over 100% increase in traffic</li>\n<li>Supports over 30 languages</li>\n<li>Uses private, secure translation server</li>\n<li>Publish translated content immediately or following review</li>\n<li>Crowdsourcing: create your own community of translators or use our community</li>\n<li>SEO: translates Permalink URL names and meta tags</li>\n<li>Custom online, side-by-side editor makes post-editing easy</li>\n<li>Translated posts can be retweeted</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Uninstalling</h3>\n<p>Simply click the &#8220;Delete&#8221; link in the plugin management window.  This will delete all of your translated data, so<br />\nplease be careful!</p>\n<h3>Virtual Host Setup</h3>\n<h3>How to setup the Virtual Host feature on the GTS Plugin</h3>\n<p>By default, the translated versions of your website/blog resolves to a URL address which is a subdirectory of your site’s URL address. For example,<br />\nthe Spanish version of your site resolves to http://mywebsite.com/language/es.</p>\n<p>With the GTS Translation Plugin Virtual Host feature you can publish translated versions of yor website/blog under a separate subdomain or top-level<br />\ndomain (TLD). So for example, if your blog is www.mywebsite.com you can serve the Spanish version from www.mywebsite.es.  Alternately, you can use<br />\n subdomains (e.g. es.mywebsite.com) so that you don&#8217;t have to buy a domain for each language.</p>\n<p>To implement the virtual hosts feature, follow these steps:</p>\n<h3>1. Configure DNS</h3>\n<p><strong>For Top Level Domains:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Register your new domain (e.g. www.mywebsite.es.) with a recognized domain registrar.</li>\n<li>In your DNS zone, set the A record for www.mywebsite.es to point to the IP address of your web server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>For Subdomains:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a CNAME alias for your web server (e.g. es.mywebsite.com)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How to complete these steps will depend on your hosting provider.  If you get stuck, please follow up with your support team.</p>\n<h3>2.  Configure your Web Server</h3>\n<p>Please note that all of the translated blogs will be hosted from the same WordPress installation as your current blog.</p>\n<p><strong>For Hosted Blogs:</strong></p>\n<p>Your hosting provider will provide a control panel to map a hostname to a Document Root.  For each translated host name, enter the exact same Document<br />\nRoot as your blog.</p>\n<p><strong>For Self-hosted Blogs:</strong></p>\n<p>These instructions are only valid for Apache.  If you use IIS or another web server, please consult the relevant documentation.</p>\n<p>First off, you need to be set up with Name Based Virtual Hosts (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/name-based.html).  Once you have your blog&#8217;s<br />\nvirtual host set up, add the new hostname to the ServerAlias directive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n\n  ServerName     www.mywebsite.com\n  ServerAlias    www.mywebsite.es\n  DocumentRoot   /path/to/wordpress/install\n\n  # Other configuration here...\n\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have multiple aliases, remember that the ServerAlias can be a list or can include wildcards…it can save time!</p>\n<h3>3.  Configure the GTS Plugin</h3>\n<p>This is the easiest part:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the &#8220;GTS Settings&#8221; admin page.</li>\n<li>Enter the host name in the &#8220;Virtual Host&#8221; input next to the desired language.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Voila, translated links will point to your new host!</p>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>While providing high quality translation with our crowdsourced post-editing functionality, it&#8217;s of the utmost importance<br />\nto ensure the security of your blog.  We provide functionality that is out-of-band of the traditional WordPress publishing<br />\ncycle.  As such, our plugin adds a hook into your blog that allows GTS to programmatically update the translated content<br />\nin your local WordPress database.  We&#8217;ve put a lot of thought into ensuring that our system can use this hook while locking<br />\nit against any potential malicious users.</p>\n<p>The first step to securing our system is to make sure that it&#8217;s really <em>you</em> and your blog requesting that your blog be<br />\nsigned up for translation.  First, we only accept registration requests that originate from the WP admin page of the blog<br />\nthat will be translated.  When the user clicks off of the admin page, a digital fingerprint is created and saved to your<br />\nWP database, and then it&#8217;s sent over an SSL-encrypted channel to our server.  When the registration request reaches our<br />\nserver, we will open an HTTP connection back to the requesting blog and verify that a) it has our plugin installed, and b)<br />\nusing an encryption technique called hashing, that the fingerprint matches.  If one of those checks fail, we won&#8217;t register<br />\n the blog for translation.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve verified the blog, we&#8217;ll assign you a Blog ID and an API Access Key.  These will be automatically added to<br />\nyour configuration panel via the registration panel, plus they will be sent to your administrator email address.  We will<br />\nuse these two strings for identifying your blog and to ensure that information isn&#8217;t tampered either en-route to us.  It<br />\nwill also be used by your blog to verify that translated content posted back to your blog is legitimate.  Again, we use<br />\nan encryption technique called hashing.  Whenever your blog sends a translation request to us or we send translated content<br />\nback to you, we create a signature (or hash) of that content PLUS the API Access Key (if you&#8217;re really interested in details,<br />\nusing the SHA-1 algorithm).  Provided that the API Access Key is kept secret, this technique is extremely secure and resistant<br />\nto tampering.  The odds of a malicious person guessing your API key are astronomical : more than 1 in 10^229.  However,<br />\nas with any password, security depends on keeping it secret.  If at any time, you think that your key has been compromised,<br />\nGTS will deactivate the current key and issue you a new one.</p>\n<p>Other measures we take to secure data coming back to your blog include using a whitelist of IP addresses that are allowed<br />\nto use the hook for posting translated content and limiting the size of the post to ~250KB so that, even if all other measures<br />\nfail, an attacker can&#8217;t eat up all the memory on your machine.</p>\n<p>We have dedicated lots of thought to locking down this system, and we are very confident that it&#8217;s secure.<br />\nAfter reading this, we hope you will be too!</p>\n",
