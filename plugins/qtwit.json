So yeah, if you&#8217;re here, you probably have a WordPress install as well! Guess what,<br />\nyou&#8217;ve just found the collision! Sure, qTwit isn&#8217;t the <em>only</em> Twitter widget it out there, but it&#8217;s claim-to-fame is that it loads your Tweets on the <em>client-side</em>, meaning<br />\nthat it uses the <a href=\"http://tweet.seaofclouds.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">jQuery plugin by Seaofclouds</a> to load your tweets. What does this mean for you? Well, several things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your tweets are always up-to-date, even with that super-cool caching plugin you just installed!</li>\n<li>Your server isn&#8217;t coughing up blood from exhaustion loading the tweets by itself all the time!</li>\n<li>You can say your blog is <strong>powered by jQuery</strong>, because everybody knows how legit that is.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AND, we can&#8217;t forget that Seaofclouds threw in some goodies that pass on to you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Small size and fast download time.</li>\n<li>Will not slow down or pause your page while Tweets are loading.</li>\n<li>Automatic linking of @replies to users’ Twitter page.</li>\n<li>Automatic linking of URLs.</li>\n<li>Automatic linking of #hashtags, to a Twitter search of all your tags.</li>\n<li>Converts &lt;3 to a CSS styleable ♥.</li>\n<li>Makes awesome text, AWESOME text with AWESOMEIZER.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>&#8211; the Seaofclouds webpage</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there you have it, go ahead and click &#8220;Install&#8221; now!</p>\n<p>**If you appreciate this plugin, I (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/kylehotchkiss/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@kylehotchkiss</a>) and Seaofclouds (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/seaofclouds/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@seaofclouds</a>) would love a tweet saying so!*</p>\n",

Sorry to my Lynx homeboys, I tried so hard for you!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it support multiple instances?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t tried it, but I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t work. (I only I have one Twitter account.)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I CAN ONLY SHOW 5!?!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yeah, sorry buddy, you have a Twitter URL for a reason!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where are my Tweets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, there are a number of reasons they aren&#8217;t showing up:<br />\n1. Your tweets are hidden! (Well, they&#8217;re not just hidden from Twitter, they&#8217;re hidden from all your Guests too!) Just unhide them, and bless the world with your<br />\nthoughts in 140 characters or less!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You haven&#8217;t posted any updates lately! For some reason, Twitter only returns results within a certain time frame, so if you are tweeting at least once a week,<br />\nyour Guests will see at least one. If you aren&#8217;t posting often, why do you need a Twitter widget after all? =P</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the above doesn&#8217;t help, send me a tweet ((<a href=\"http://twitter.com/kylehotchkiss/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@kylehotchkiss</a>)), and if time allows, I can take a look for you!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",

In the future, this could be added as an option.</p>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<p>These daily updates will stop soon, but there was another caps error.</p>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Fixed a fatal bug caused by using an absolute path that ironically didn&#8217;t work, should work &amp; upgrade fine now.</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>Added noscript-ness and multiple instance support. Basically features I should have put in the first release.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>This is the inital release of qTwit (for WordPress).</p>\n"
