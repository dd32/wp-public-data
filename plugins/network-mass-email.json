        "description": "<p>This plugin allows for network administrators on WordPress multisite environments to send an email to users that<br />\nthey select based on the users&#8217; roles in individual sites. For example, checking only &#8220;editors&#8221; will go through<br />\neach active site and add anyone with the role of &#8220;editor&#8221; to your list of emails to send to.</p>\n<p>To use the plugin after installation &amp; activation, find Users / Mass Email in the network admin dashboard in your<br />\nmultisite install. Then, select the user types you wish to email and click on the button for &#8220;Load the List&#8221;. This<br />\nwill load the list of users to email. Then you may compose your email in the boxes provided and click the send<br />\nbutton at the bottom of the screen. If all goes well you will be presented with a confirmation page indicating<br />\nthat your email was sent successfully.</p>\n<p>This plugin is NOT intended for administrators to be sending unsolicited spam to their users. In fact, it was<br />\ncreated with more formal environments in mind. One example would be a University setting where administrators<br />\nof the network may need to notify students and faculty of potential downtime. With the plugin&#8217;s implementation<br />\nI would imagine it would be a highly inefficient way of sending spam anyway.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this work on a regular WordPress install?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin only works (and would only make sense) in a multisite install.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I send emails from?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin now has its own menu in the network admin dashboard.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Won&#8217;t someone use this for spam?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Potentially, but as I stated in the description, I would imagine it would be a pretty inefficient way to spam users.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this work on an earlier version of WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly, but I haven&#8217;t tested it myself. I don&#8217;t see why it wouldn&#8217;t work, but I can&#8217;t vouch for it personally.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Big Update &#8211; Lots of stuff!</li>\n<li>Added message templates! You can now save message templates to re-use at a later date!</li>\n<li>Added checkboxes to all users when they are loaded with &#8216;load the list&#8217;. This means you can now manually uncheck users that you would like not to receive an email you are sending and vice-versa.</li>\n<li>Moved the menu for the plguin to the main Network Admin menu. It now has it&#8217;s own icon and submenus instead of being listed under &#8216;Users&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Updated the plugin compatibility for &#8216;compatible up to&#8217; and &#8216;requires&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Added checkbox labels to all checkboxes that appear. I don&#8217;t know why they weren&#8217;t there in the first place&#8230;</li>\n<li>Added more tweaks to variable formatting so that messages are stored and are sent as intended when you compose them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Applied a fix (again) for escaping slashes and special characters in email body contents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Applied a fix for escaping slashes in email body contents. UPDATE: This fix did not work, was patched in 1.4.2.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Apparently I was temporarily dyslexic and had the WordPress compatible version numbers reversed in the readme. This has been fixed.<br />\nThere are no other changes in this update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
