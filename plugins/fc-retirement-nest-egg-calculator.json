The calculator easily answers the question and creates a detailed schedule with projected date based investments and charts. A site&#8217;s users can select their own currency and date convention used in the investment schedule. This is ideal if your site attracts visitors from around the globe. Select from four predefined sizes or modify CSS file to customize size and change colors. Supports touch devices and a responsive designed website. This plugin is based on and uses the code from my <a href=\"https://AccurateCalculators.com/retirement-calculator\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Retirement Calculator</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Rebranding with your site&#8217;s brand name is supported and encouraged.</em></p>\n<p>The plugin may be used (a) in a post or page&#8217;s content area via a <em>shortcode</em>; or (b) used in a <em>widget area</em>; or (c) called from any template file. See <strong>usage</strong> under installation for details.</p>\n<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>\n<p>Either (a) upload the <em>fc-retirement-nest-egg-calculator</em> folder with all its files to the <em>/wp-content/plugins/</em> folder or (b) unzip the plugin&#8217;s zip file in the <em>/wp-content/plugins/</em> folder.</p>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the <em>Plugins -&gt; Installed Plugins</em> menu in WordPress</p>\n<p><em>Upgrading</em></p>\n<p>If you translated the plugin from English to another language, please backup your work prior to upgrading the plugin.</p>\n<p><em>Usage</em></p>\n<p>There are 3 mutually exclusive ways you can deploy the calculator to an individual page (though you can use all three methods on different pages within a site):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your theme supports widgets, add the plugin to a widget area through the Appearance -&gt; Widgets menu in WordPress. WordPress v5.8 introduced the block editor to the Admin&#8217;s widget management screen. To install this plugin as a widget in WordPress v5.8 or later, install first the widget shortcode and then copy this plugin&#8217;s shortcode into it.</li>\n<li>Add the following code <em>&lt;?php show_fcretirenestegg_plugin(); ?&gt;</em> to your template where you want the calculator to appear. See below for options.</li>\n<li>Add the shortcode <em>[fcretirenesteggplugin]</em> in the content area of your page or post and configure shortcode parameters.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Shortcode parameters</strong></p>\n<pre><code>* sc_size= tiny | small | medium | large\n* sc_custom_style= No | Yes\n* sc_add_link= No | Yes\n* sc_brand_name= \n* sc_hide_resize= No | Yes\n* sc_save_amt=\n* sc_n_months=\n* sc_rate=\n* sc_current_age=\n* sc_retire_age=\n* sc_current_savings=\n* sc_invest_amt=\n* sc_rate=\n* sc_currency=\n* sc_date_mask=\n</code></pre>\n<p>Examples (1st includes all options):</p>\n<pre><code>[fcretirenesteggplugin sc_size=\"medium\" sc_custom_style=\"No\" sc_add_link=\"No\" sc_brand_name=\"\" sc_hide_resize=\"No\" sc_current_age=\"28\" sc_retire_age=\"62\" sc_current_savings=\"16000\" sc_invest_amt=\"750.0\" sc_rate=\"5.5\" sc_currency=\"83\" sc_date_mask=\"2\"]\n\n[fcretirenesteggplugin sc_size=\"small\" sc_custom_style=\"Yes\" sc_hide_resize=\"Yes\" sc_currency=\"83\" sc_date_mask=\"2\"]\n\n[fcretirenesteggplugin sc_custom_style=\"No\" sc_add_link=\"Yes\" sc_brand_name=\"Friendly Financial Planners\" sc_hide_resize=\"Yes\" sc_current_age=\"28\" sc_retire_age=\"62\" sc_current_savings=\"16000\" sc_invest_amt=\"750.0\" sc_rate=\"5.5\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Optional array parameter passed to <em>show_fcretirenestegg_plugin()</em></strong></p>\n<p>Valid values for options are the same as the shortcode above.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php show_fcretirenestegg_plugin(array('op_size' =&gt; \"large\",\n    'op_custom_style' =&gt; \"No\",\n    'op_add_link' =&gt; \"No\",\n    'op_brand_name' =&gt; \"\",\n    'op_hide_resize' =&gt; \"No\",\n    'op_current_age' =&gt; \"28\",\n    'op_retire_age' =&gt; \"62\",\n    'op_current_savings' =&gt; \"18000\",\n    'op_invest_amt' =&gt; \"750.0\",\n    'op_rate' =&gt; \"5.5\",\n    'op_currency' =&gt; \"999\",\n    'op_date_mask' =&gt; \"999\"\n    )); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Notes:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you want to add your brand to the calculator, the *_add_link option must be set to &#8220;Yes&#8221; (i.e. create a subtle follow link to AccurateCalculators.com). </li>\n<li>When branding, the brand name will be added before &#8220;Retirement Calculator&#8221;.</li>\n<li>If _custom_style is set to &#8220;Yes&#8221;, the plugin will load fin-calc-widgets-custom.css located in the plugin&#8217;s CSS folder. If you set the option to &#8220;Yes&#8221; without making any changes, the calculator will change to a horrendous red which indicates the custom css is being used.</li>\n<li>The plugin is built and tested on HTML5/CSS3 pages.</li>\n<li>size (max-width): large: 440px, medium: 340px, small: 290px, tiny: 150px</li>\n<li>The modal dialog that allows users to select a default currency and date format is NOT compatible with some other dialogs. If you have a modeal on the webpage you want to install this calculator on, either your modal or the calculator&#8217;s modal may not work.</li>\n<li>Website developers can set a default currency sign and preferred date format by setting &lt;op/sc&gt;_currency and &lt;op/sc&gt;_date_mask respectively. Set one or both to an integer value. For the list of integers to support 90 plus currency symbols and 6 date format options, see the file <strong>currency_and_date_conventions.txt</strong> in the plugin&#8217;s root folder. (example: India, Indian Rupee: ₹1,23,45,678.99 = 83)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Enhanced Internationalization</em></p>\n<p>Support for over 90 currency signs (using appropriate nummber formatting conventions) and 6 date formats (mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, yyyy.mm.dd etc.). If neither the website developer or the user makes a selection, the calculator will read the browser&#8217;s default currency and date options and automatically use them. Without doing anything, a website visitor from Japan visiting a website hosted in France will initially see a floating yen sign. The website developer can easily override this default behavior by setting either shortcodes or function options. The user (if the website designer keeps the feature enabled) can override both and select a currency and date format.</p>\n<p><em>To summarize, the plugin determines what currency symbol (and date format) to use by applying the following rules:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a website allows a user to select a symbol, and the user makes a selection, the plugin uses the visitor&#8217;s choice first.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if a user has not made a selection, and the website owner has set a default currency (i.e., currency does not equal 999), the calculator uses the website&#8217;s selection.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the calculator plugin will attempt to read the browser&#8217;s currency default and pick a currency symbol.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the plugin defaults to using the &#8216;$&#8217; symbol.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Language Translations</em></p>\n<p>New in v1.5, support for 14 languages in addition to English. The plugin also includes a translation template file (.POT) in the &#8220;languages&#8221; folder. Using a POT/PO file editor, website owners can translate this plugin to any language supported by WordPress.</p>\n<p>The supported languages are:</p>\n<p>da :  Danish : Dansk<br />\nnl :  Dutch : Nederlandse<br />\nfi :  Finnish : Suomalainen<br />\nfr :  French : Français<br />\nde :  German : Deutsch<br />\nhu :  Hungarian : Magyar<br />\nit :  Italian : Italiano<br />\nlt :  Lithuanian : Lietuvių<br />\npl :  Polish : Polski<br />\npt :  Portuguese : Português<br />\nro :  Romanian : Românesc<br />\nru :  Russian : Русский<br />\nes :  Spanish : Español<br />\nsv :  Swedish : Svenska</p>\n<p>Notes: (1) The plugin depends on the site&#8217;s &#8220;Site Language&#8221; setting to display to your visitors the correct language. The files in the language folder can be renamed if needed. For example, if you want the plug to display in Portuguese the .MO and .JSON files include assume your site&#8217;s language setting is Portuguese (Portugal) which is local pt_PT. But if your site is in Brazil, you&#8217;ll need to rename the plugin&#8217;s language files to use pt_BR. (2) At this time, these translations were computer generated. A fluent speaker can edit the included .PO file and regenerate the .MO file to update the tranlation. (3) If you are willing to allow me to include your edits with the plugin, I&#8217;ll regenerate the .MO, and if needed the .JSON files for you.</p>\n<p>I am making the other calculators at my website available free-of-charge to bloggers who are abe to help with translation. See the website for details.</p>\n<p><em>Support</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to offer support for all my plugins. If you have a question or face an issue, please go to the plugin page linked in the description above and leave your question at the bottom of the page. I&#8217;m able to provide faster support at my site than I am on the WordPress.org website.</p>\n<p><em>Other Calculators</em></p>\n<p>As of this writing, AccurateCalculators.com has seven plugins listed in the WordPress Plugin Directory with several more available on the website.

        "faq": "<p><strong>Can the Retirement Nest Egg Calculator plugin be used on a commercial website?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I would be honored. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Also, if you happen to be a financial blogger, I would encourage you to add a &#8220;Calculators&#8221; or &#8220;Tools&#8221; section to your site and include all my calculators. More content equals more opportunity. I expect to have six free plugins by early 2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Does your plugin have any embed advertising?</strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely not.</p>\n<p><strong>Is your plugin self contained?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. 100% of the plugin is installed on your server. There are no external dependencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the plugin include any backlinks?</strong></p>\n<p>No, not by default. If you decide to brand the calculator with your brand and / or set the <em>add_link</em> option to <em>Yes</em>, one discreet link is added to my site. (User will not know there is a link unless their mouse passes over it.) The link is around the copyright in the lower left. 🙂</p>\n<p><strong>Is the calculator plugin responsive?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, I use it on a Bootstrap responsive site.</p>\n<p><strong>Does the calculator support touch devices?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Users use the calculator with all types of devices. (A previous issue with some Android devices is fixed.)</p>\n<p><strong>Do you offer other calculator plugins?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. I&#8217;m offering a &#8220;Plus&#8221; version of this plugin on my website. It is free for a limited time. There will be other calculators available shortly as well. And here is my <a href=\"https://AccurateCalculators.com/calculator-plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">widgets and plugin</a> page where you&#8217;ll find other free plugins as well as some &#8220;plus&#8221; versions which are free for a limited time only.</p>\n<p><strong>I like your plugin and I&#8217;d like to contribute something but I notice you don&#8217;t have a link for contributions, why not?</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you. That&#8217;s very kind of you. Actually, you can contribute, and it won&#8217;t cost you a cent. Please stop by my <a href=\"https://AccurateCalculators.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a> and check it out. In addition to providing some very advanced calculators, I think that I&#8217;m the only one that provides free support via a public forum. Take a look, and if you like what you see, please spread the word. That&#8217;s better than any monetary compensation.</p>\n",

The website developer can easily override this default behavior by setting either shortcodes or function options. The user (if the website designer keeps the feature enabled) can override both and select a currency and date format.</p>\n<p><em>To summarize, the plugin determines what currency symbol (and date format) to use by applying the following rules:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a website allows a user to select a symbol, and the user makes a selection, the plugin uses the visitor&#8217;s choice first.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, if a user has not made a selection, and the website owner has set a default currency (i.e., currency does not equal 999), the calculator uses the website&#8217;s selection.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the calculator plugin will attempt to read the browser&#8217;s currency default and pick a currency symbol.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the plugin defaults to using the &#8216;$&#8217; symbol.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Language Translations</em></p>\n<p>New in v1.5, support for 14 languages in addition to English. The plugin also includes a translation template file (.POT) in the &#8220;languages&#8221; folder. Using a POT/PO file editor, website owners can translate this plugin to any language supported by WordPress.</p>\n<p>The supported languages are:</p>\n<p>da :  Danish : Dansk<br />\nnl :  Dutch : Nederlandse<br />\nfi :  Finnish : Suomalainen<br />\nfr :  French : Français<br />\nde :  German : Deutsch<br />\nhu :  Hungarian : Magyar<br />\nit :  Italian : Italiano<br />\nlt :  Lithuanian : Lietuvių<br />\npl :  Polish : Polski<br />\npt :  Portuguese : Português<br />\nro :  Romanian : Românesc<br />\nru :  Russian : Русский<br />\nes :  Spanish : Español<br />\nsv :  Swedish : Svenska</p>\n<p>Notes: (1) The plugin depends on the site&#8217;s &#8220;Site Language&#8221; setting to display to your visitors the correct language. The files in the language folder can be renamed if needed. For example, if you want the plug to display in Portuguese the .MO and .JSON files include assume your site&#8217;s language setting is Portuguese (Portugal) which is local pt_PT. But if your site is in Brazil, you&#8217;ll need to rename the plugin&#8217;s language files to use pt_BR. (2) At this time, these translations were computer generated. A fluent speaker can edit the included .PO file and regenerate the .MO file to update the tranlation. (3) If you are willing to allow me to include your edits with the plugin, I&#8217;ll regenerate the .MO, and if needed the .JSON files for you.</p>\n<p>I am making the other calculators at my website available free-of-charge to bloggers who are abe to help with translation. See the website for details.</p>\n<p><em>Support</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to offer support for all my plugins.
