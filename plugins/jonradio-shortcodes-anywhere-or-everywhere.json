Or download and unzip this plugin, then upload the <code>/jonradio-shortcodes-anywhere-or-everywhere/</code> directory to your WordPress web site&#8217;s <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the <em>jonradio Shortcodes Anywhere or Everywhere</em> plugin through the <strong>Installed Plugins</strong> Admin panel in WordPress.  If you have a WordPress Network (&#8220;Multisite&#8221;), you can either <strong>Network Activate</strong> this plugin through the <strong>Installed Plugins</strong> Network Admin panel, or Activate it individually on the sites where you wish to use it.  Activating on individual sites within a Network avoids some of the confusion created by WordPress&#8217; hiding of Network Activated plugins on the Plugin menu of individual sites.  Alternatively, to avoid this confusion, you can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jonradio-reveal-network-activated-plugins/\" title=\"jonradio Reveal Network Activated Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">jonradio Reveal Network Activated Plugins</a> plugin.</li>\n<li>View the Settings page, either by clicking on the <strong>Settings</strong> link in the entry for this plugin shown in the Installed Plugins Admin panel in WordPress, or from the Admin menu, <strong>Settings-Shortcodes Anywhere or Everywhere</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select where Shortcodes will be used, and click the Save Changes button.</li>\n</ol>\n",
