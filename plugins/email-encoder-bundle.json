It is completely free and you can <a href=\"https://wpemailencoder.com/email-protection-checker/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">find it here</a> on our website.</p>\n<p>The second possibility is to enable the plugin option (in the admin panel) called <em>&#8220;Security Check&#8221;</em>.<br />\nWhen you are logged in and look on the page there will be a icon on the right side of each email address confirming it was successfully encoded. (This counts only for emails that are displayed within the body tag as HTML. Emails within data attributes or the header won&#8217;t show this icon since otherwise the site breaks.)</p>\n<p>The third possibility is to check the source code yourself by right-clicking on the page and select <em>View Source Code</em> (the exact text depends on the browser).<br />\nNow your (real) source code will be shown. Your email address should not be shown in a readable way in the source.</p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> in the element inspector of the browser the email address is <em>nearly always</em> shown, so don&#8217;t worry about that. That is because the inspector shows a real time representation of the page. This means an encoded email address is already decoded and made usable for the visitor of the page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20encode%20my%20email%20address%28es%29%3F'>\nHow do I encode my email address(es)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All email addresses are protected automatically by default, so it is not necessary to configure anything else.</p>\n<p>In case you wish to customize it, we also offer some neatsettings,  shortcodes and template functions. Please check the settings page within your WordPress website or <a href=\"https://wpemailencoder.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our documentation</a></p>\n<p>The visitors will see everything as normal, but the source behind it will now be encoded.</p>\n<p>For more information, please check out the <a href=\"https://wpemailencoder.com/what-will-be-protected/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">following page</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20encode%20phone%20numbers%20or%20other%20text%3F'>\nHow do I encode phone numbers or other text?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just use the following shortcode within your posts:<br />\n    [eeb_protect_content]35-01235-468113[/eeb_protect_content]</p>\n<p>For other parts of your site you can use the template function <code>eeb_protect_content()</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20website%20looks%20broken%20after%20activating%20the%20plugin.%20what%20to%20do%3F'>\nMy website looks broken after activating the plugin. What to do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First: Don&#8217;t panic!<br />\nSimply create a support request within the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/email-encoder-bundle#postform\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> and we will come back to you as soon as possible with help.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20encode%20content%20of%20bbpress%2C%20wp%20e-commerce%20or%20other%20plugins%3F'>\nHow can I encode content of BBPress, WP e-commerce or other plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every content will be automatically protected.
