        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20to%20test%20if%20this%20plugin%20is%20working'>\nHow to Test if This Plugin is Working\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After activating the plugin, please follow these steps to ensure it functions correctly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clear Your Cache</strong>: It is essential to clear your page cache to reflect the changes made by the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use Incognito Mode</strong>: Open your site in Incognito mode, or use a non-administrator, non-editor account to simulate the experience of a regular visitor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Check Functionality</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit your website and try selecting text from a paragraph. You should find that text selection is disabled as intended.</li>\n<li>Additionally, disable JavaScript in your browser settings and refresh the page. You should see a prompt requesting you to enable JavaScript to access the site.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By following these steps, you can effectively verify that the plugin is working as designed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20prevent%20bypassing%20protection%20in%20noscript%20mode'>\nDoes it prevent bypassing protection in noscript mode\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, yes. Every modern browser comes with JavaScript enabled, and there is generally no compelling reason for users to disable it. However, if a user chooses to disable JavaScript to bypass content protection, this plugin strictly enforces the requirement to enable JavaScript first to deliver its protective features. If you wish to disable this strict mode, you can do so using the following filter and clear the page cache to reflect the changes, though I do not recommend this approach:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'disable_text_selection_noscript', '__return_false' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Protecting against text selection is a complex challenge, and significant efforts have been made to ensure this plugin works effectively in most scenarios.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
