This means when you push content changes to a staging or production environment they are guaranteed to reference the correct target instead of accidentally referencing a production resource in development or, worse-yet, a development-exclusive resource in production.</p>\n<p>It supports path-based MU Installations, but does not support domain-based MU sites due to architectural deficiencies in the WordPress core.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 fixes an infinite redirect problem that is a result of a core bug in WordPress.  If you have problems with the &lt;!&#8211;more&#8211;&gt; tag or permalinks for custom post types, please read the FAQ or new Install Steps for support.</p>\n<p>Version 2.2 allows for adding certain URL&#8217;s or partial URL&#8217;s to a blacklist, meaning I won&#8217;t use root relative urls, but dynamic absolute URLs instead for displaying content.  This will fix problems with 3rd party plugins, and can be configured on the General Settings page.</p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section</h3>\n",

Including Wordpres.org, WordPress.com, Facebook.com, Twitter.com, Google.com, Wikipedia.org, Yahoo.com, Youtube.com, Amazon.com, Fickr.com etc.<br />\nMost RSS Feed readers handle them appropriately (notable exceptions include FeedBurner and FeedBlitz) but my plugin takes into account their lack of HTML specification adherence.</p>\n<p>In fact, root relative URL support was established in the very first HTML specification (where it remains today) by Tim Berners-Lee (the real inventor of the World Wide Web) way back in 1993:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where the base address is not specified, the reader will use the<br />\n   URL it used to access the document to resolve any relative URLs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some WordPress core developers think this is &#8220;doing it wrong&#8221; and &#8220;may not be supported in future content platforms like books.&#8221;  But I can assure you they are a core &amp; valued aspect of the web and are not likely to go away. (I&#8217;m currently trying to explain to FeedBurner &amp; FeedBlitz how it&#8217;s their responsibility to improve their support for the RSS format and not that of others to adhere to an archaic practice like absolute urls.)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t WordPress use root-relative URLs to begin with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Good question.  There are a number of core developers who think the design decision makes an end-user&#8217;s life easier.  But that&#8217;s only for those who maintain<br />\none site and make all of their edits on that public site.  Professional web developers would never consider making changes on a production site because if a mistake<br />\nwere made (yes even professionals make mistakes) then you have an immediate problem in production.  Instead changes should be made on a development or staging<br />\nserver first, thoroughly tested, and then migrated to production as a best practice.</p>\n<p>With root-relative URLs you can make and test your changes on a staging server and then, when the changes are completely vetted, move your changes to your production<br />\nserver. You could do this with absolute URLs as well, but that adds an extra step of doing a search / replace of all http://staging.com/ links to http://production.com/.<br />\nThis extra step is not required in most content management systems. And a step that can potentially break your site depending on what widgets and plugins you are using (http://www.interconnectit.com/719/migrating-a-wordpresswpmubuddypress-website/)</p>\n<p>Additionally, unless you are a network administrator, testing your staging URL on an iPhone or other mobile device is really difficult because the recommendation for<br />\nstaging environments by WordPress core members is to edit your hosts file.  Only you cannot edit hosts files on a mobile device, so you&#8217;d have to resort to complex<br />\nrouter configurations that many people don&#8217;t have at their disposal on typical WIFI networks.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin correct URLs that are already embedded in my site&#8217;s content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately no, this plugin is designed to correct new content as it is entered via the administration panel.  It will still work with your current site,<br />\nbut it will not alter links you have already embedded.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I use this plugin if I only have one production site and I make all of my changes in production?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely!  Just because you have only one site now doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t have a staging site in the future.  If you ever decide to contract out professional<br />\ndevelopment services you&#8217;ll want to work with someone who does follow this process.  And at that point in time it will be a nice time-saver if you have already<br />\ndeveloped content that works with root-relative links.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work with MU sites (Multi-user installations)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sort of.  It will work for path-based MU sites, but not for domain-based sites due to an architectural flaw in the WordPress core.  However, for it to work with path-based installs you<br />\nwill need to patch a WordPress core file &#8211; or wait until the WordPress core team implements this fix &#8211; https://core.trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/18910/ms-blogs.php.patch</p>\n<p>Until then this plugin will not work out of the box for MU installs. I have discovered an approach for resolving this problem without a core hack but I will need to research it before implementing the update.  It will be a big ol nasty hack but it will work.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
