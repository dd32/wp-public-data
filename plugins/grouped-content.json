        "description": "<p>Grouped Content helps you manage and access your hierarchical pages (including hierarchical custom post types) naturally and automatically. <strong>All it takes is the simple action of setting a parent page.</strong> <em>(Which you are probably already doing!)</em></p>\n<h4>Enhanced Page Management</h4>\n<p>With Grouped Content, you’ll be able to access pages faster, quickly generate new draft pages in bulk, and better visualize your site’s hierarchy. Additionally, you&#8217;ll be able to see overview information of each page group. This can give you insight into which content groups are the largest or have the most drafts.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<p>Grouped Content is light and simple with a few powerful features. You can get started immediately all while keeping control of your site’s pages with these main features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groups Admin Page</strong>. View hierarchical pages and group statistics in an easy-to-navigate, distraction-free area.</li>\n<li><strong>Page Relatives Metabox</strong>. Access parent, sibling, and child pages immediately upon setting a parent page.</li>\n<li><strong>Content Generator</strong>. Quickly add new draft pages and automate menu creation to efficiently create new groups of content and navigation for your site.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Grouped Content does not require any configurations after being activated. If you have already been making use of page hierarchies, Grouped Content will automatically enhance your experience of maintaining page structures.</p>\n<p>Here are the features you should notice upon proper installation and activation:</p>\n<h4>The Groups Screen</h4>\n<p>Tucked underneath each hierarchical post type (such as &#8220;Pages&#8221;) in the WordPress admin menu, you should see a submenu item labeled &#8220;(Page) Groups&#8221;. This is where you’ll be able to instantly see any page hierarchies that you’ve established. If you have not set any Parent Pages, then this will be empty until you do.</p>\n<h4>The Page Relatives Metabox</h4>\n<p>Another noticeable feature that’s been added is the Page Relatives metabox. It is available in the righthand sidebar when editing a Page (or any other hierarchical post). If the page currently being edited has been assigned a Parent Page or the page has been assigned as the Parent Page of other pages, the Page Relatives box will display links to the related content. This makes it easier to navigate around hierarchical content!</p>\n<h4>The Content Generator</h4>\n<p>In Tools &gt; Create Draft Pages, you can quickly create empty draft pages under a specified parent page. You can also automatically create a menu of the generated page posts, too! This is helpful for quickly outlining new content groups on your WordPress website, such as resource directories or information modules.</p>\n<p><em>This plugin is multisite compatible and may be activated per site or network activated for all sites. There is no difference in functionality between the different activation methods.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you have any questions during or after installation, please submit to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/grouped-content/\" rel=\"ugc\">Grouped Content’s support forum</a>.</em></p>\n",

When editing a page, you may assign a Parent Page in the Page Attributes section on the righthand side of your edit screen.</p>\n<p>If you can’t find this panel, it may be hidden. Be sure to check the Screen Options to enable the metabox!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%E2%80%99t%20i%20find%20the%20%28page%29%20relatives%20metabox%3F'>\nWhy can’t I find the (Page) Relatives metabox?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the Page Relatives metabox is not listed on the righthand side when editing a page, it may be hidden. Be sure to check the Screen Options to enable the metabox!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
