The tracking process uses the REST API to send performance data to the plugin for recording in the databse. There may be something interfering with the REST API in your WordPress install.</p>\n<p>Please open a support request and we will help you get it resolved.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it all work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Modern web browsers expose a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">NavigationTiming API</a> which can be queried for information about page load performance. We are using the industry standard <a href=\"https://developer.akamai.com/tools/boomerang/docs/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Boomerang</a> library to collect this data and send it to your WordPress site where it is stored in custom tables that have been optimized for database size.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
