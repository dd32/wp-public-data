Within the settings, you will find the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Position: Determines when the slideshow will be created. It can either be placed before the actual content or after it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Animation: The slideshow&#8217;s animation option regulates in which style the slideshow switches from one slide to the other. You can choose between a &#8216;Fade&#8217; mode, which generates an alpha effect and a &#8216;Slide&#8217; mode that creates a flowing transition</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigation: You can choose between two different methods with which to navigate your slideshow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With the help of navigation points, which are visibly displayed as dots on the bottom of the slides and can be used to navigate between slides</li>\n<li>By using the navigation arrows that appear on each side of the slideshow during a mouseover</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both of these methods can be displayed simultaneously</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image size: The chosen image size affects the maximum solution of the slideshow images</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Creation</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have installed and activated the plugin, a new slideshow section will be generated on the bottom half of the content part on every available web page. Here you will find a &#8216;+&#8217; (plus) button that calls for you to choose or to upload an image. Once you have picked the desired image, it can be inserted into the slideshow range using the &#8216;Use Image&#8217; button. Afterwards the chosen image appears in a box with the option to add text. The slideshow will be shown on the respective web page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The slides can be arranged as may be required by dragging them to their desired position via Drag and Drop.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The slideshow&#8217;s layout automatically adjusts to the conditions of the terminal device owing to a responsive web design.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
