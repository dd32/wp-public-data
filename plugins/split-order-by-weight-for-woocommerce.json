        "description": "<ul>\n<li>Author: <a href=\"https://www.suncartstore.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Suncart Store</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Split order by weight” Plugin allows splitting an order into separate orders based on weight.</p>\n<p>This Plugin can be used to split an order automatically into multiple orders based on the weight of the products in the cart. The customer will receive different order ids for their ordered cart.</p>\n<p>With different order ids, customers can view all the order ids in their Order History and track each item separately.</p>\n<h3>Split order for WooCommerce Features</h3>\n<p><strong>A) Default Condition</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>When the condition is Default then the order is split irrespective of any weight. </li>\n<li>All items in the cart available will be splitted into a seperate order.<br />\n  Example: If an order has 4 products then the order is split into 4 different orders no matter what the weight of items are.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>B) Split by Weight</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>When we enable this option, a threshold weight value is set in woocommerce settings. </li>\n<li>Split by weight means order splits only if the total weight of products comes under threshold weight. </li>\n<li>In case of more than one item in order, the number of split orders depends on the total occurrence of this case.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>A brief Markdown Example</h3>\n<p>We can understand the work process of the Plugin with the below-given example.</p>\n<p>This Plugin will split order by weight into multiple orders based on the specified weight in the configuration. If the weight is 1lbs and the cart has a below scenario then it will split as below scenario.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Example: Cart Items</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>We have set 2 Kg as threshold weight in the backend and we have 5 products in order out of which only two products have weight 1 kg others have weight less than 1 Kg. Then the order will split in 2 different orders having different order ids. In first order, two items with 1 kg weight each and the rest of items will be in next order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>P1 = 1 Kg<br />\n  P2 = .6 Kg<br />\n  P3 = .3 Kg<br />\n  P4 = .1 Kg<br />\n  P5 = 1 Kg</p>\n<p>Then it will be split like:</p>\n<p>Order 1 = P1 + P5,</p>\n<p>Order 2 = P2 + P3 + P4,</p>\n<p>Note: Here is P means = Product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Developer Help</strong></p>\n<p>Bug reports and feedbacks are always welcome. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/split-order-by-weight-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"ugc\">Report here</a>.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This WordPress plugin is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 2 of the License, or any later version.<br />\nThis WordPress plugin is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
