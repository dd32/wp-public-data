In order to save those changes, do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make backup copies of any files that you have altered. You may wish to make backups of the following folders: (fcchat/config, fcchat/languages, fcchat/styles, fcchat/html/config). Place them in a safe place where they will not be deleted. </li>\n<li>Next install the new version. </li>\n<li>Finally, manually copy the changes you made to the old files into the current version&#8217;s files. Do not replace the new files with the old files, as the structure of the new files may have changed; but instead, use the wordpress file editor to make the changes line by line.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>FEATURE LIST:</p>\n<p>Real time text chat</p>\n<p>Video Chat: 1 on 1 video chat and video conferencing (6 Simulaneous Cams)</p>\n<p>Full Page Mode: Launch Chat into a separate tab</p>\n<p>Public rooms/Private Rooms</p>\n<p>Instant messaging/Private Chat</p>\n<p>Facebook Connect</p>\n<p>Post Youtube videos (thumbnail with link) simply by entering the url of the video.</p>\n<p>Upload images</p>\n<p>User profiles</p>\n<p>Country Flags</p>\n<p>Coloaborative document</p>\n<p>Doodlepad</p>\n<p>Transliteration</p>\n<p>Two player games</p>\n<p>Customized buttons with content dialog boxes in the chat toolbar.</p>\n<p>Split-screen Mode: Show the chat side by side with your site</p>\n<p>Language translation feature</p>\n<p>Assign titles to users</p>\n<p>Customizable smileys/avatars</p>\n<p>Customizable sounds</p>\n<p>Customizable language templates</p>\n<p>Customizable style templates</p>\n<p>Administration/moderation panel</p>\n<p>Web based file editor</p>\n<p>SERVICE ACTIVATION &#8211; SERVICES HOSTED BY FASTCATSOFTWARE.COM</p>\n<p>In order to use this widget, you will need to sign up for a subscription to the chat service on www.fastcatsoftware.com.
