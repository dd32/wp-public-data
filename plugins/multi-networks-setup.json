Additionally you want to launch the same network, but only for sailors. In this case you can easily create a new network by using this plugin and both networks will share the same functionality.</p>\n<p>It requires manual installation as <code>sunrise.php</code> file must be copied to <code>wp-content/</code>. When upgrading the plugin, remember to update <code>sunrise.php</code> as well.</p>\n<p>After installation and network activation, go to your network dashboard and visip &#8220;Networks&#8221; page. You will see all available networks there (from the beginning there will be only one network). To create new network click on &#8220;Add New&#8221; button, enter new domain name, title, admin email and submit the form. New network will be created.

If it does not exist please ensure it&#8217;s on the line above the last <code>require_once</code> command: <code>define( 'SUNRISE', 'on' );</code>.</li>\n<li>Comment out the <code>DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE</code>, <code>PATH_CURRENT_SITE</code>, <code>SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE</code>, <code>BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE</code> lines in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</li>\n</ol>\n",
