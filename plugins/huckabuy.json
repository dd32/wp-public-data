        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20structured%20data%3F'>\nWhat is structured data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. It makes your content more visible and understandable to search engines. Structured data markup is a way to add machine-readable information to your web pages. This information can then be used by search engines to better understand your content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20the%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does the plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin automatically adds structured data markup to your site. It works by analyzing your content and adding the appropriate markup to your pages. The plugin is fully automated and requires no configuration. There is a settings page where you can add social media links and search paths.  Adding these links will help the plugin to add markup to your pages, but it is not required.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20free%20and%20paid%20versions%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between the free and paid versions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The free version of the plugin adds the following objects to your site: Organization, Website, WebPage. The paid version includes all of the objects listed above but also adds the following objects: Article, Book, BreadcrumbList, ClaimReview, Course, Dataset, Event, FAQPage, HowTo, JobPosting, LocalBusiness, Movie, NewsArticle, Occupation, Offer, Product, QAPage, Recipe, Review, SoftwareApplication, VideoObject (and more to come!)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20make%20requests%20to%20any%20external%20services%3F'>\nDoes the plugin make requests to any external services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Huckabuy Structured Data WordPress plugin accesses a third-party service that is built and maintained by Huckabuy.</p>\n<p>On initial activation of the plugin, a request is made to the third-party service to initialize your settings. This request includes your site URL and the email address you used to register for your account.  This information is used to uniquely identify your account and to provide you with support.</p>\n<p>When you make any updates in the plugin settings, a request is made to the same third-party service to update your settings.  Additionally, if you subscribe to the premium version of the plugin, a request is made to the third-party service to update your subscription status.  Besides these settings, no other information is sent to the third-party service from your plugin.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is activated and configured, our structured data script is added to your site. This script is responsible for injecting structured data to your website. This script does not make any external requests and does not collect any data from your website or visitors. The script is loaded asynchronously and does not affect the loading time of your website. It is generated dynamically (https://api.huckabuy.com/s/{$hash_hostname}/install.js) based on your hostname and the settings you have configured in the plugin.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see our privacy policy: https://huckabuy.com/huckabuy-privacy-policy/ and our terms of service: https://huckabuy.com/legal/terms-of-service-agreement/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nIs the plugin compatible with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is compatible with all themes. It does not require any configuration and works out of the box. The plugin is fully automated and does not require any configuration.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
