Just add the class to your CSS stylesheet.</p>\n<p>.cssdt-evening { background-image: src(&#8216;/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sunrise.jpg&#8217;); }</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20is%20better%20to%20do%20this%20via%20javascript%3F'>\nWhy is is better to do this via Javascript?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Two reasons!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dynamically adding this via javascript will not break your caching plugins ever!</li>\n<li>Your visitors time and deate is often different to the websites. This plugin uses javascript so the classes are based on the visitors time.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20see%20these%20classes%20when%20i%20view%20source%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I see these classes when I view source?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because they are added by javascript on the domcontentloaded event. This still means they can be used for styling purposes though.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20see%20the%20classes%3F'>\nHow can I see the classes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use dev tools (or equivalents in other browsers) to inspect the the DOM elements and you will see the classes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20see%20this%20is%20in%20action%3F'>\nWhere can I see this is in action?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to to the plugin <a href=\"https://lhero.org/portfolio/lh-css-dates-and-times/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donation page</a> to see a live (very trivial) example.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20selectors%20does%20it%20have%3F'>\nWhat selectors does it have?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple date ie the first of january 2018 would be &#8216;cssdt-01-01-2017&#8217;</li>\n<li>Hour ie Midnight would be &#8216;cssdt-hour-0&#8217;</li>\n<li>Time of day (this is divided into 4 blocks, night being &#8211;<br />\n0-6, morning 6-12, afternnon 12-18, and evening being 18-24. So 3PM would be &#8216;cssdt-afternoon&#8217;</li>\n<li>AM or PM , so 3PM would be &#8216;cssdt-pm&#8217;</li>\n<li>Weekday eg &#8216;cssdt-tuesday&#8217;</li>\n<li>Monthday so the first of January 2018 would be &#8216;cssdt-monthday-01&#8217;</li>\n<li>Month so the first of January 2018 would be &#8216;cssdt-january&#8217;</li>\n<li>Day of year, so the first of January 2018 would be &#8216;cssdt-yearday-01-01&#8217;</li>\n<li>Year, so the first of January 2018 would be &#8216;cssdt-2018&#8217;</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH CSS Dates and Times, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-css-dates-and-times/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-css-dates-and-times/</a> .
