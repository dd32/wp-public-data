With this plug-in you can autoplay, pause, skip to and many other features are exposed through URL parameters.</p>\n<p>WordPress default configuration ignores the URL parameters when embedding urls into a post using oEmbed. This plug-in fixes that behavior enabling you to use the built in URL parameters that are available to YouTube video with extra features (namely muting videos).</p>\n<p>For example:<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/rRr4N2nN_X8?autoplay=1</p>\n<p>Will embed the YouTube player and have it automatically start playing.</p>\n<p>You can copy any URL from Youtube such as starting from 1 minute into the video:<br />\nhttps://youtu.be/rRr4N2nN_X8?t=1m</p>\n<p>and it will embed the video and start it at minute 1.</p>\n<p>One extra feature that is not available in the built in youtube player parameters that we added to the plugin is the option to mute the video as well.

        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>is there any configurations needed?<br />\nno.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>is there a a GUI for this plugin?<br />\nno as we are leaning on the urls that are created when you copy them from youtube.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>how do i get a video to autoplay and mute at the same time?<br />\nJust grab a url from youtube and add to the url at the end : ?autoplay=1&amp;mute=1 before pasting it into your WordPress post. The plug in will do all the rest.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
