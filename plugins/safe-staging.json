Whenever you clone your production site to your staging site, you would normally need to complete a number of steps to make your site &#8220;safe for staging.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Instead, install this plugin in production, set the production URL, and safely copy your site to and from staging. No other steps needed!</p>\n<h4>Features on Staging</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>A &#8220;noindex&#8221; tag is added to all pages. Your staging site won&#8217;t show up in Google.</li>\n<li>WordPress emails are stopped. The site won&#8217;t send any emails except for the password reset email. Please note, this feature may not be compatible with plugins that offload email to a 3rd party service.</li>\n<li>The WooCommerce checkout page has a warning message notifying the visitor they are viewing the staging site.</li>\n<li>WooCommerce payment gateways are suspended. Bank account transfer, Cash on Delivery and Check are left enabled. Stripe is automatically put into test mode.</li>\n<li>WooCommerce Subscriptions is put into staging mode.</li>\n</ol>\n",
