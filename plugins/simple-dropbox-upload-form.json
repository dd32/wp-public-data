Sorry!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I updated to 1.7.0 and my settings got reset</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is due to a bug that was found in the database update function.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I updated to 1.5.0 and my settings got erased</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is because I got approval from dropbox for root level access. What does this mean for you? You need to reauthorize your account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this your first WordPress plugin</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes so I make no promises that it will work for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am on a VPS or Dedicated server and this plugin still won&#8217;t play nice</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have a few options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Enable <code>ini_set</code> in your php.ini file (Look for disabled_functions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable <code>set_include_path</code> in your php.ini file (Look for disabled_functions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add the <code>Net::OAuth</code> module to your Perl installation.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
