        "description": "<p>Have you ever had that situation where you have a bunch of plugins installed and you can&#8217;t remember why half of them are there?</p>\n<p>It is important to clean out unused plugins and keep your plugins up to date, but this can be difficult if you have forgotten why you installed them in the first place.  This is particularly true for sites with multiple admin users, and for agencies that manage their clients sites.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to delete an old plugin without being 100% sure why it was installed and therefore know if it is still needed.</p>\n<p>The Plugin Auditor tells you why each plugin was installed and also keeps a record of who installed it so that you know who to ask if you have any questions when performing maintenance on the site.</p>\n<p>Plugin Auditor can be installed at any time but to get the most benefit from it, it should be installed as the first plugin that you install on any WordPress site that you manage.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>The Plugin Auditor plugin is really plug and play.  Just upload the plugin and activate.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload <code>plugin-audit.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To view the logs of plugin activity on your site, simply go to Plugins &gt; Plugin Auditor.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Will it work with all themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it should work fine with all themes.  If you find a problem, let us know.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it work on multisite installations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we have added basic multisite compatibility. On a mutlisite network, the Plugin Auditor notifications and audit table will only appear under the Network admin area, but will track activity throughout the network. In future, we hope to add more comprehensive multisite functionality.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if I install this plugin after other plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Plugin Auditor has no way of knowing who installed existing plugins or when they were installed. It will therefore assign them to the person who installed the plugin and display. If you know this information, you should manually leave a comment for future reference.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
