        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20backups%3F'>\nWhy do I need backups?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Site backups are crucial for an online business or presence. If you make a change in error, want to experiment with your site’s look &amp; feel, or something malicious happens to your site, having backups saves time and money getting your site back online or to a previous version. With Jetpack VaultPress Backup you simply click to restore to a point in the past and get on with your day.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20restore%20my%20site%20with%20jetpack%20vaultpress%20backup%3F'>\nHow do I restore my site with Jetpack VaultPress Backup?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It’s easy to restore your site in just a few clicks. Check out this quick video for more detail.</p>\n<p>For more detailed assistance, check out <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/the-jetpack-backup-plugin/restoring-with-the-jetpack-backup-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the full support article</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='doesn%E2%80%99t%20my%20host%20already%20have%20backups%3F'>\nDoesn’t my host already have backups?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most hosts have some sort of backup. But they are often infrequent and difficult to restore. If your site goes down, you need access to your backups. If they’re stored on your hosting platform (or your hard drive!), and your files are compromised, your database backup could be compromised too.</p>\n<p>Jetpack’s off-site backup storage allows you to restore a clean version of your WordPress website even if you can’t log in. When you rely solely on your host’s built-in backups, you’re putting all your eggs in one basket. Here is <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2017/07/06/wordpress-support-hosting-mistakes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">one story from a Jetpack customer</a> of what can happen. Without a third-party backup that copies your files off-site, your website could be at risk. One false move by you or your host could compromise your web files or delete them entirely.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20create%20a%20wordpress%20backup%20for%20my%20site%3F'>\nHow do I create a WordPress backup for my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you don’t have Backups as part of your Jetpack plan, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/upgrade/backup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visit Jetpack.com to learn more and purchase</a>.</p>\n<p>As soon as you purchase Jetpack VaultPress Backup, it will be activated, and the first backup will be completed. There are barely any settings to configure, and you don’t need coding experience.</p>\n<p>For plans with daily backups, a new backup will take place approximately 24 hours from the previous backup. They occur automatically – you don’t need to create a specific time for backups to run.</p>\n<p>For plans with real-time backups, a new backup will be performed each time a change is made to WordPress core&#8217;s database tables, WooCommerce database tables, and any associated file changes. All other changes are backed up daily.</p>\n<p>You can also initiate a backup on-demand by clicking the <strong>Back up now</strong> button.</p>\n<p>You’ll know your WordPress backup has been created if you see a <strong>Backup complete</strong> event in the activity log.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='don%E2%80%99t%20see%20your%20wordpress%20backup%20in%20the%20activity%20log%3F'>\nDon’t see your WordPress backup in the activity log?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you notice that backups are not being saved yet, update your <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/the-jetpack-backup-plugin/adding-credentials-to-the-jetpack-backup-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">site credentials</a>. Go to the <a href=\"https://cloud.jetpack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Jetpack Cloud</strong></a> and click <strong>Settings</strong>. You should see a form that allows you to add your site credentials.</p>\n<p>If Jetpack cannot make contact with your site and it’s not able to create backups, you’ll receive an email after two failed attempts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20jetpack%20to%20back%20up%20my%20wordpress%20database%3F'>\nCan I use Jetpack to back up my WordPress database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the Jetpack VaultPress Backup plugin backs up your WordPress database.

If a directory named <em>donotbackup</em> is added, we will also exclude all files inside that directory.

If you’d like to retain a copy, you can download your backup and upload it to any third-party site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20download%20my%20backups%3F'>\nCan I download my backups?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
