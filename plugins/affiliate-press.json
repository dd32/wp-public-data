        "description": "<p>Affiliate Press is a plugin that allows you to create products ( as a custom post type ) based on product feeds. It also collects other data for these products, such as prices and affiliate links, which are shown on the product pages in the front end, effectively allowing you to set up your own affiliate website as easy as 1-2-3.</p>\n<p>Affiliate Press was specifically developed to be compatible with multiple affiliate programs and networks, aiming to support a broader range of feeds and therefor more competitive prices for your visitor.</p>\n<p>Currently I&#8217;m looking for people who are willing to send me examples of their product feeds so I can improve this plugin further. Please send your XML product feeds as attachment to <a href=\"mailto:a&#x66;&#x66;&#105;&#108;&#x69;&#x61;&#116;&#101;&#x70;&#x72;&#101;&#115;&#x73;&#x40;&#108;&#117;&#x63;&#x64;&#101;&#098;r&#x6f;&#x75;&#119;e&#x72;&#x2e;&#110;&#108;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">affiliatepress@lucdebrouwer.nl</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow Luc De Brouwer on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lucdebrouwernl\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ldebrouwer\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Twitter</a>.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I display the prices and links on a product page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can do this by copying the following PHP code in your product template.</p>\n<pre>\n    if( class_exists( 'LDB_Affiliate_Press' ) ) {\n        $ap = new LDB_Affiliate_Press;\n        echo $ap-&gt;AP_getPrices( true );\n    }\n</pre>\n<p>To load the products into a page template you can use this code.</p>\n<pre>\n    $posts = get_posts( array( 'post_type' =&gt; 'product' ) );\n    foreach( $posts as $post ) {\n        setup_postdata( $post );\n        the_title();\n        the_post_thumbnail();\n        the_content();\n        if( class_exists( 'LDB_Affiliate_Press' ) ) {\n            $ap = new LDB_Affiliate_Press;\n            echo $ap-&gt;AP_getPrices( true );\n        }\n    }\n</pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;d rather retrieve just the data and not the pre-formatted table you can use the following code.</p>\n<pre>\n    if( class_exists( 'LDB_Affiliate_Press' ) ) {\n        $ap = new LDB_Affiliate_Press;\n        $data = $ap-&gt;AP_getPrices();\n    }\n</pre>\n<p>The affiliate data is now stored in the $data variable.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I not seeing the products on a category page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default custom post types are not shown on a category page. To achieve this you&#8217;ll have to add something along the lines of the code below to your themes&#8217; function.php.</p>\n<pre>\nadd_filter( 'pre_get_posts', 'my_get_posts' );\n\nfunction my_get_posts( $query ) {\n\n    if ( is_category() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() )\n        $query-&gt;set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'product' ) );\n\n    return $query;\n\n}\n</pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Why aren&#8217;t the images from the feed being attached to the post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The permissions on you &#8216;uploads&#8217; folder in &#8216;wp-content&#8217; are most likely not set correctly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where&#8217;s the help section?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is still under development and in beta. Most of the functionality is still subject to change and I hope to bring some more features to the plugin. Compiling an extensive help and support section would therefor be somewhat of a hassle at the moment. I strongly advise you to post in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/affiliate-press\" rel=\"ugc\">support forums</a> if you have any questions. ( And please check there first if your question wasn&#8217;t answered yet. )</p>\n</p>\n\n",
