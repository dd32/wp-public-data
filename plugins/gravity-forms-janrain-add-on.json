        "faq": "<p><strong>I can&#8217;t find (Facebook/Twitter/other provider) in the list of available<br />\nproviders.</strong></p>\n<p>Some providers require configuration in order to be available. To use Facebook<br />\nlogin through Janrain Engage, for example, you will have to create an app on<br />\nFacebook, and give those credentials to your Engage app.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are current step-by-step directions on the Engage dashboard. Go<br />\nto the &#8220;Setup Widget&#8221; page on your Janrain dashboard (find it under<br />\n<strong>Deployment &gt; Sign-in for Web</strong>; open the <strong>Providers</strong> section of the<br />\nsidebar). Each of the providers which requires configuration will have a gray<br />\ngear icon next to it; click that icon and follow the wizard steps.</p>\n<p><strong>I want to be able to access a field that a provider offers, but it&#8217;s not<br />\npopulating in my forms.</strong></p>\n<p>Some profile fields require requesting extended profile data. You can configure<br />\nthe permissions your app requests of the user on an &#8220;a la carte&#8221; basis from your<br />\nrpxnow dashboard under <strong>Deployment &gt; Provider Configuration</strong>. (Keep in mind<br />\nthat asking users for too many permissions is more likely to scare them away &#8211;<br />\n<a href=\"http://janrain.com/blog/when-collecting-social-profile-data-dont-be-a-creeper/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">don&#8217;t be a creeper</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: some extended profile fields are only available to Plus or higher<br />\nservice levels.</p>\n\n<h4>How can I add more prefill fields beyond the default ones?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been designed to be easy to extend. If you want to add more<br />\nfields, you will need to hook a function to the filter <code>janrain_gforms_profile_data</code><br />\nthat defines the name of the field you want to add, and the function to get its<br />\ndata. This filter recieves the array of core fields as its argument, so if you<br />\nneed to redefine one of the core fields, this is the place to do that as well.</p>\n<p>For example, the following code will make a new field available called<br />\n&#8220;religion&#8221;; which pulls any data the user has entered as their &#8220;religion&#8221; on<br />\nFacebook (or any other provider that includes that field):</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'janrain_gforms_profile_data', 'add_religion_field' );\n\nfunction add_religion_field( $fields ) {\n    $fields['religion'] = array(\n        'name' =&gt; 'Religion',\n        'function' =&gt; 'religion_field'\n    );\n    return $fields;\n}\n\nfunction religion_field( $profile ) {\n    return $profile-&gt;merged_poco-&gt;religion;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
