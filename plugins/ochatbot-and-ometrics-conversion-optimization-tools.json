However, depending on your support ticket load, this usually does not mean the elimination of support personnel. Rather the support personnel are now answering the most important and complex questions. This leads to faster response times and increases customer satisfaction and happiness. It also provides time for customer support to upsell clients.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20ochatbot%20generate%20leads%20for%20my%20business%3F'>\nCan Ochatbot generate Leads for my business?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

It does not use Open AI&#8217;s ChatGPT. Ometrics AI is faster with tailored website and eCommerce features, heightened security, and no hallucinations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20have%20time%20to%20build%20my%20chatbot%3F'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t have time to build my chatbot?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We can build it for you!

Then, when someone adds a product to their cart the chatbot will suggest those other items to the customer. It is also possible to manually create upsells and cross-sells within Ochatbot if you do not have it set up in WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20my%20customers%20track%20their%20orders%20in%20ochatbot%3F'>\nCan my customers track their orders in Ochatbot?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!
