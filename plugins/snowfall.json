        "installation": "<p>To install the plugin do the same steps you do for installing wordpress plugins.</p>\n<h4>Set up</h4>\n<p>The set up for the plugin is a bit harder, but I&#8217;ll explain it in details:<br />\nThe plugin allows to set up snowfall effect in 2 ways:<br />\n1. via WordPress actions<br />\n2. manually.</p>\n<h4>1. WordPress actions.</h4>\n<p>Plugin provides action <code>snowfall_main_tag_action</code> which adds necessary blocks and queues necessary scripts. This is why this set up is easier.<br />\nTo make it work add the following code right after <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> opening tag:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php do_action('snowfall_main_tag_action'); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>When this action will be added, and the plugin will be enabled you will see the snowfall effect on your site.</p>\n<h4>2. Manual set up</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above manual set up is a bit harder than set up through WordPress actions.<br />\nTo set up plugin manually you need to:<br />\n&#8211; add <code>&lt;div id=\"some-unique-id\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> right after <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> opening tag.<br />\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> the <code>id</code> attribute for this block should be unique.<br />\n&#8211; create the following javascript snippet: <code>new Snowfall(\"some-unique-id\");</code> <strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>some-unique-id</code> from this code snippet should be the same as <code>id</code> attribute from the block you created above.<br />\n&#8211; enqueue the code snippet from the step above after <code>snowfall</code> script (<code>snowfall</code> &#8211; is a script&#8217;s handle for more info see <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">wp_enqueue_script</a>)<br />\n&#8211; now activate the plugin if it&#8217;s still disabled and you will see the snowfall effect on your site.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nCan I customize the snow effect?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In short &#8211; yes.<br />\nTo customize the snowfall effect(increase/decrease number of snowflakes, increase/decrease it&#8217;s size/color etc) you have 2 options:<br />\n&#8211; do it manually yourself (some coding knowledge required)<br />\n&#8211; ask me to do it for you</p>\n<p>If you chose to do it yourself, please refer to snowfall library documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/KupnoH/snowfall/blob/master/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.<br />\nIf you want me to do it for you, please write me an email to <code>kupnoh25@gmail.com</code> with Subject <code>Snowfall customization</code> and we would discuss further details.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
