For an automatic install of GoodCarts, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click ‘Add New’</p>\n<p>In the search field type ‘GoodCarts’, then click ‘Search Plugins’. Once you&#8217;ve found us,  you can install it by clicking ‘Install Now’, and WordPress will take it from there.</p>\n<p>Activate the GoodCarts plugin and then go to the admin / GoodCarts section and follow the instructions.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>Manual installation method requires downloading the GoodCarts plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/Warecorp/goodcarts-wp-plugin/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip the plugin you downloaded and upload the “goodcarts” folder to your ‘wp-content/plugins’ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Then go to the admin / GoodCarts section and follow the instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we recommend that you backup your site.</p>\n",

We carefully review stores to make sure they are in the best fit circle..</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kinds%20of%20stores%20aren%E2%80%99t%20allowed%3F'>\nWhat kinds of stores aren’t allowed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>None of the GoodCarts Circles allow stores selling adult/mature products, alcohol, weapons, etc. Only the Founders Circle for everyday small business retailers accepts stores that dropship products from outside of their home continent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20my%20store%20join%20from%20anywhere%3F'>\nCan my store join from anywhere?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our initial focus is on stores that ship standard to the United States. Additional Circles are planned for other parts of the world. <a href=\"https://goodcarts.co/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact us</a> and ask to  join a waiting list for your part of the world.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20%E2%80%9Cfree%E2%80%9D%20too%20good%20to%20be%20true%3F'>\nIs “Free” too good to be true?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is both good AND true! GoodCarts is powered by reciprocity &#8211; all members in our network present their post-checkout customers the opportunity to view discounts from other brands in the same Circle. By recycling your post-purchase traffic, you’re earning  free exposure and traffic in return.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20choose%20which%20stores%20to%20cross-promote%3F'>\nCan I choose which stores to cross-promote?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, once you are approved into your Circle, find the Blocklist feature under More Options. This  allows you to pick stores with whom you DO NOT wish to share traffic. It is typically used to avoid promoting a direct competitor.</p>\n<p>For more answers to questions, see the <a href=\"https://goodcarts.co/faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ on our website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
