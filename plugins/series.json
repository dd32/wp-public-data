        "faq": "\n<h4>Why was this plugin created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Originally, it was a bit of a proof-of-concept of how plugins could create custom taxonomies based off a couple of highly-popular WordPress tutorials I wrote (<a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/05/06/custom-taxonomies-in-wordpress-28\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Custom taxonomies in WordPress 2.8</a> and <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/06/04/using-custom-taxonomies-to-create-a-movie-database\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Using custom taxonomies to create a movie database</a>).</p>\n<p>However, it was also a plugin I wanted for my personal blog.  I&#8217;d been using custom fields for years to handle series, but it was always kind of a crude method of doing so.  When WordPress created the Taxonomy API, I knew it was time to build something simple and usable for handling series on my site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does this plugin do, exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It creates a new taxonomy called &#8220;series&#8221; for use on your site.  It gives you template tags, shortcodes, and widgets to allow you to more easily tie posts together in a series.</p>\n<p>Basically, you get a new meta box on the edit post screen titled &#8220;Series&#8221; that works just like regular tags.  You can input a series name to add a post to a series.  You also get a &#8220;Series&#8221; screen under the &#8220;Posts&#8221; menu in the WordPress admin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I getting a 404 error on series pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You just need to set up the plugin.  Go to Settings &gt; Series in your WordPress admin and save the settings.  It&#8217;ll let WordPress know about your series permalink, which is necessary for showing series on the front end of the site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What widgets are available to use?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Series &#8211; List Posts</strong> &#8211; This widget allows you to list posts from any series you&#8217;ve created.</li>\n<li><strong>Series &#8211; List Related</strong> &#8211; This widget displays posts within the current post&#8217;s series.  So, it only shows up under two conditions: 1) you&#8217;re viewing a single post and 2) the current post is within a series.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there other functions to use in my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All standard WordPress functions for taxonomies work.  The name of the taxonomy is <code>series</code>.  So, if you want to do anything custom, WordPress already has the functions you need.  I&#8217;m not going to list them all here.  That&#8217;d be just like rewriting a large portion of the WordPress Codex, which is already available to you.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a specific template tag, start with the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags#Category_tags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">category template tags</a>.  Most of them allow you to use custom taxonomies.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you show me some examples?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Okay.  I&#8217;ll show a few, but you&#8217;ve probably seen them before if you&#8217;ve done anything with tags or categories.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Displaying a &#8220;tag&#8221; cloud</h4>\n<p> &#8216;series&#8217; ) ); ?&gt;</p>\n<h4>Displaying the current post&#8217;s series</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Displaying a &#8220;category&#8221; list of series</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n         &#8216;series&#8217;, &#8216;title_li&#8217; =&gt; false ) ); ?&gt;\n    </ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I create custom templates for series?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Certainly.  You can create templates for series archives.  Just copy your theme&#8217;s <code>archive.php</code> or <code>index.php</code> template.  Then, rename it to <code>taxonomy-series.php</code> and make custom modifications from there.</p>\n<p>If you want a template for a specific series, name the template <code>taxonomy-series-exampleslug.php</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you add feature X?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll consider it.  Let me know what features you&#8217;d like to see added to the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This is way too complicated for me!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please let me know how I could make things simpler for you in a future version of the plugin.</p>\n<p>Also, keep in mind that there are other series plugins out there.  This particular plugin might not be the best fit for you.  However, I&#8217;m more than willing to listen to feedback on making things easier.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
