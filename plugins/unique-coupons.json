They have are only shown the coupon after clicking a button, to ensure interest.</p>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>After installing, you&#8217;ll find a new menu item in the admin area near the bottom called &#8216;Coupons&#8217;. All administration is done from there.</p>\n<p>There are <em>coupons</em> and <em>(coupon) groups</em>.<br />\nEach coupon belongs to exactly one group and has a value and expiry date.<br />\nA group contains many coupons and defines the template that is shown to the users within a popup. By default, only logged in users can get coupons.</p>\n<p>Start by creating a new group. Give it an unique name and write out the template.<br />\nThere are four buttons in the editor, which mark the speical areas for the popup. Highlight the according text and press the button to mark it up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action button</strong>: When this button is clicked, the coupon&#8217;s value will be fetched from the backend and displayed.</li>\n<li><strong>Success area</strong>: This area is hidden until the coupon is fetched from the backend.</li>\n<li><strong>Coupon value</strong>: This area will be <em>replaced</em> with the coupon&#8217;s value. Make sure to not include trailing whitespace, otherwise it may look ugly.</li>\n<li><strong>Expiry date</strong>: This area will be <em>replaced</em> with the coupon&#8217;s expiry date. Make sure to not include trailing whitespace, otherwise it may look ugly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Save the group and add some coupons. You can add multiple coupons with the same expiry date. Just make sure that every coupon gets its own line (empty lines are ignored).</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to go. But you may want to have a look at the default settings. There you can adjust delays between events to not spam your users.</p>\n<h4>Customization</h4>\n<p>Most of the user-facing customization can be done in the group editor. If you want to change the users which should be able to get coupons, you can hook into the <code>unique_coupons_user_is_authorized_for_coupons</code> filter. Currently, there is no way to distribute coupons to anonymous users (keeping track is done server-side). So even if you allow this through this filter, it will not work.</p>\n<h4>Shortcomings/Bugs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For now, data from this plugin will stay around after deleting it.</li>\n<li>You can&#8217;t explicitly filter when the popup shouldn&#8217;t be shown.
