        "faq": "\n<h4>I have the plugin enabled on my WordPress installation, but I&#8217;m not receiving emails when a new update is released. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Try using the test email functionality on the Update Notifier settings page to see if you can receive emails from Update Notifier at all.</p>\n<p>Make sure that the admin email address (see General Settings in WordPress) is set correctly to your email address.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, have you tried looking in your spam folder? To prevent Update Notifier emails going into your spam you should set up a filter making<br />\nsure that emails with the subject: &#8220;Updates are available for your WordPress site&#8221;, are not placed in your spam folder.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I receiving notifications telling me to upgrade from version &#8216;abc&#8217; (or similar)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>NB:</strong> This should be fixed as of 1.4.1, if you continue to encounter any issues please get in contact via the support forum.</p>\n<p>You probably have a plugin installed which is changing the global <code>$wp_version</code> variable. This means that when WordPress does its automatic check<br />\nfor updates it asks wordpress.org if there are versions newer than &#8216;abc&#8217;, obviously &#8216;abc&#8217; doesn&#8217;t exist and so the response is that an update is<br />\navailable (even if your site already has the latest version of WordPress!). This response is stored by WordPress and when Update Notifier checks<br />\nthis stored value it sees that allegedly an update available and sends an unnecessary email notification.</p>\n<p>For example the WP Security Scan plugin changes the internal version to &#8216;abc&#8217;, to disable this comment out line 53 of securityscan.php<br />\nwhich reads <code>add_action(\"init\",mrt_remove_wp_version,1);</code></p>\n</p>\n\n",
