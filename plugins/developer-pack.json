In my opinion, all developer would have familiar with the browser console. So instead of spending effort on rendering beautiful output, I was focus on doing the core function and put all the output &#8220;lazily&#8221; in the browser console. However it is quite cool, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does these red, green and yellow background color of the address bar in code editor mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you put a filename in the address bar (with relative path to the WordPress root) and hit Enter, the address bar color change background color indicate the existence of the file. If it still white, and file content is loaded in both editor, then the filename is correct. If it is yellow, then the file you entered was a folder, and you can open your browser console to see what files you can navigate to. If it turn red then the file you entered was not exist, right folders/files name of the same directory is listed in the console.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
