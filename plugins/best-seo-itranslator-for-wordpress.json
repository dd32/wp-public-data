This is a perfect SEO instrument for those who want to get traffic from search engines. Best SEO iTranslator for WordPress generates new translated posts, which are treated by search engines as being new different posts, containing different information.</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>From Settings-&gt;BSW iTranslator select the language your blog is written in. On the same page, choose what languages you would like to have your blog posts translated in.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>The translation time takes a little bit longer than my blog usually loads. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is normal. This plugin relies on an external website (Google Translate) and the loading time of your translated posts mainly depends on how fast Google will translate your pages. If it takes more than 10 seconds, there must be something wrong with your server. In this case check your host&#8217;s error log to see whether everything is OK with your hosting.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>&#8220;Please return to this page in some minutes.&#8221; message</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There has been something wrong with the translation process, or Google temporarily banned your website for excessive queries. Don&#8217;t worry! A 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable message is displayed to both human readers and search bots, informing them that the page is not available at the moment.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The cache gets too large in size</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is normal. Every page is stored in a cached file, so the next time a request is made for that page, it is quickly fetched from the cache, saving a lot of time and server resources. The cache can grow quickly in size, make sure you have the required space on your server, before activating the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The translated page has a bad/broken layout</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually Google Translate will deliver translated pages in the original format, however it may happen sometimes to get a page with a broken layout. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to regenerate such broken files automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does a yellow box appear at the top of my translated page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That box informs the readers that the page they are currently viewing is a translated version and the original source is to be found in a different place (link provided).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Cache Duration?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cache Duration is the time a cached file can stay on your server before it can be removed with a new one (if obsolete). Best Cache Duration time to set in the plugins settings are higher than 86000 seconds (one day). If you notice that translated pages are displayed correctly and they don&#8217;t need to be replaced, set the Cache Duration to 1 week or more (use the calculator to get the value in seconds: Xdays<em>24hours</em>60minutes*60seconds)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Best SEO iTranslator for WordPress plugin doesn&#8217;t work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First things to check is that the cache folder inside the plugin&#8217;s directory exists and is chmoded to 0755. If that is not the problem you may write a comment message on my blog at  , and I&#8217;ll see what I can do to help you.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
