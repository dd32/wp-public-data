        "description": "<h4>Varying Prices on Product Variations is Tedious and Error-Prone</h4>\n<p>Want to add $5 to every blue product you sell? Maybe you sell jewelry with birthstones, and some stones just cost more than others. If all “X-Large” products cost 7.5% more, you have to manually calculate and change every “X-Large” variation of every product.</p>\n<h4>Markup by Attribute Adds &#8216;Markup&#8217; to Attribute Terms</h4>\n<p>Markup by Attribute solves this problem by allowing you to add a markup (or markdown) to global attribute terms. If the attribute is &#8216;color&#8217;, then Markup by Attribute allows you to add “+5&#8243; to Blue while leaving Green and Yellow alone. When you set regular and sale prices, every blue product will be $5.00 more.</p>\n<p>Markup by Attribute:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can create a fixed value markup (such as $5), or a percentage markup (such as 5%).</li>\n<li>The markup value can be positive yielding an increase in price, or negative yielding a decrease in price.</li>\n<li>Uses familiar WooCommerce bulk edit actions <code>Set regular price</code> and <code>Set sale price</code>.</li>\n<li>Puts the price increase (or decrease) in the options drop-down box alongside of the terms, so customers can make informed decisions. (Or, optionally, does not).</li>\n<li>Can write a breakdown of the price modifications in the variation description, so the itemization is visible to the customer.</li>\n<li>Has been tested with Gutenberg and is fully compatible.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Use it to activate the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Using Markup by Attribute for WooCommerce</h4>\n<p>(Detailed instructions can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/Mark-Tomlinson/markup-by-attribute-for-woocommerce/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Markup by Attribute Wiki</a>.)</p>\n<p><em>NOTE:</em> These instructions assume you are familiar with WooCommerce global Product Attributes and with WooCommerce Product Variations. If not, you may want to review the WooCommerce documentation on <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#section-6\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Product Attributes</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/variable-product/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Variable Products</a>.</p>\n<p>Three Easy Steps</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>While creating new global attribute terms or editing existing ones, add the markup.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If the option needs a markup, put the amount of the markup in the term’s Markup field on either the <code>Add new attribute</code> panel or the <code>Edit attribute</code> panel.</li>\n<li>Examples of valid values include: ‘-5’, ‘5.95’, ‘+5.678’, ‘7.5%’, and ‘-12%’.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Create product variations as you normally would.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Markup by Attribute requires variable products because it changes the price of each variation.</li>\n<li>Using <code>Create variations from all attributes</code> is the easiest way to ensure you have all combinations.</li>\n<li>Do not have a variation with “Any” in an attribute with a markup because WooCommerce will choose the “Any” variation regardless of others that may exist. So, if XX-Large is 5% more, you cannot have one variation for “XX-Large” and another for “Any size” to cover the rest because WooCommerce assumes “Any size” includes “XX-Large”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Use the <code>Set regular price</code> and <code>Set sale price</code> bulk edit functions as you normally would.</strong>  (<em>NOTE: If you’ve already set the prices before installing Markup-by-Attribute, you will need to do it again to apply the markup</em>).\n<ul>\n<li>The markup will be applied to the price according to the attribute terms associated with the variation.</li>\n<li>A description of the markup will be added to the variation description.<br />\n  <code>Product Price 18.95<br />\nAdd 2.00 for Logo</code></li>\n<li><em>TIP</em>: If you change the markup later, repeat this step to recalculate the markup for this product. Or do not repeat the step to leave the previous markups unchanged.</li>\n<li><em>TIP</em>: Always set the regular price before setting a sale price. Percentage markups are calculated on the regular price, so they cannot be applied to a sale price if the regular price has not been set.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='if%20i%20change%20the%20markup%20for%20an%20attribute%2C%20how%20will%20product%20prices%20change%3F'>\nIf I change the markup for an attribute, how will product prices change?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Markup by Attribute works within the framework provided by WooCommerce and sets product variation markups (or markdowns) during the <code>Set regular price</code> and <code>Set sale price</code> actions. Therefore, you must locate the products affected by this change and reset the regular and sale prices.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%27s%20not%20working.%20why%3F'>\nIt&#8217;s not working. Why?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When I get this question, it is usually because people want the prices to change as soon as they add or adjust a markup. The way Markup by Attribute was built, however, requires that you run the <code>Set regular prices</code> function for the variations.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used <code>Set regular prices</code>and it still doesn&#8217;t update the prices properly, you may have a variation with an “Any” attribute. If you have six sizes, for instance, but you have one product variation with “Any size”, then WooCommerce will pick that one. The important take-away here is that you shouldn&#8217;t have a variation with “Any attribute”, if that attribute has a markup.</p>\n<p>If it&#8217;s neither of these things, please check the support forums.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20change%20an%20attribute%27s%20markups%20but%20do%20not%20want%20to%20change%20products%20marked%20up%20previously%3F'>\nWhat if I change an attribute&#8217;s markups but do not want to change products marked up previously?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Then do nothing. Prices, descriptions, and option drop-downs for products will remain at whatever value they were set to last time you ran the <code>Set regular price</code> or <code>Set sale price</code> bulk variation activities.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20support%20languages%20other%20than%20english%3F'>\nDoes this support languages other than English?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. However, the developer only speaks American English.  I can provide &#8216;Google Translate&#8217; versions of other languages, but I would prefer it if a native speaker translated the text. The .POT file is found in the /languages folder of the plugin. If you don&#8217;t have access to your server, you can also find it on <a href=\"https://github.com/Mark-Tomlinson/markup-by-attribute-for-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s a .POT file? If you&#8217;d like to help but don&#8217;t know how to use a template file, don&#8217;t worry. A .POT file is a text file that contains all the English phrases found in Markup-by-Attribute.  You can simply open it and translate what you read there.  Send me the translations and I will incorporate them in the next release.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Zjadlbymcos\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Zjadlbymcos</a> on GitHub for his Polish Translation and @silentstepsch for several variations of German.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27d%20like%20to%20donate.'>\nI&#8217;d like to donate.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thanks! The donation button assumes $5.00 USD. But please don&#8217;t hesitate to adjust that amount up or down as you feel it&#8217;s appropriate. I&#8217;m a retired guy who&#8217;s living off his savings, so every bit helps.</p>\n<p>If you use Markup by Attribute and want to see me continuing support for it, I encourage you to encourage me with a small donation.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
