The plugin does not disables any of  Forms normal behavior, unlike all other plugins that do the same.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20uses%20%22on_sent_ok%22%20additional%20setting%3F'>\nDoes this plugin uses &#8220;on_sent_ok&#8221; additional setting?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. One of the reasons we developed this plugin, is because on_send_ok is now deprecated, and is going to be abolished by the end of 2017. This plugin is the only redirect plugin for Contact Form 7 that has been updated to use <a href=\"https://contactform7.com/dom-events/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DOM events</a> to perform redirect, as  developer Takayuki Miyoshi recommends.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
