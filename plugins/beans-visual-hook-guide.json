The values of which can be used by the various <a href=\"https://www.getbeans.io/code-reference/api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Beans APIs</a> to rapidly develop beautiful themes.</p>\n<p>Any markup added using Beans adds several <a href=\"https://www.getbeans.io/documentation/markup-and-attributes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">dynamic action hooks</a> both before and after it:</p>\n<pre><code>{$markup_id}_before_markup, fires before the opening markup\n{$markup_id}_prepend_markup, fires after the opening markup\n{$markup_id}_append_markup, fires before the closing markup\n{$markup_id}_after_markup, fires after the closing markup.\n</code></pre>\n<p>( _prepend_markup and _append_markup are not available for self-closed markup )</p>\n<p>In short, this means pretty much anything can be added anywhere on any page by adding actions to the available hooks.</p>\n<p>This plugin is intended as a companion tool to the Beans Development Mode and your Browser inspector. It displays all of the available hooks that have been created dynamically by the Beans HTML API, making it easy for Beans Themes Developers to visualise the appropriate hook to use.</p>\n<p>The Beans logo and Beans name are being used with kind permission from the amazing people behind the Beans Framework.</p>\n",

It adds an extra menu item to the WordPress Toolbar.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t enabled Beans Development Mode this menu item will link to the Beans setting page so that you may enable it.</p>\n<p>Once Beans Development Mode has been enabled, you will be presented with an &#8216;Enable Beans Visual Hook Guide&#8217; menu item, click on this and the plugin will do its thing. You will now have a drop-down menu available, from this menu you can:</p>\n<p>*Display Action Hooks on a hook by hook basis<br />\n*Display all Action Hooks at once (Crazy Mode)<br />\n*Clear all displayed Action Hooks<br />\n*Clear all displayed Action Hooks and Disable the functionality.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin require the Beans Framework to work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes</p>\n<p>If a Beans Framework Child theme is not the active theme, the plugin will not activate.</p>\n<p>Even if it did activate it would be useless.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if I deactivate the Beans Framework</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you swap themes to a non-Beans framework theme while the plugin is active then it will just harmlessly disable itself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have my admin bar disabled, can I still use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can, but it is (much) more difficult. As each hook can be displayed selectively, there are many (so many) query_args used to display each hook.</p>\n<p>When the Beans Visual Hook Guide is active your url will already have the following query_arg added:</p>\n<p>?bvhg_enable=show</p>\n<p>To display the &#8216;beans_content&#8217; hook add this to end of your url:</p>\n<p>&amp;beans_content=show</p>\n<p>So now it will look like the following:</p>\n<p>?bvhg_enable=show&amp;beans_content=show</p>\n<p>For each hook you wish to display you need to add an ampersand followed by {markup_id}=show</p>\n</p>\n\n"
