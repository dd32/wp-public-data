To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Product Fees, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Fees” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",
