        "description": "<p>NGO-branding cleans up WordPress admin for NGO-sites, changes menu items in backoffice, to link to NGO-portal instead of WP, set permalinks, removes WP-version from frontoffice and add some extra secutity to the portal. It also adds a field for meta-keywords, disables some updates that might cause problems if done unattended, adds feature guest writers to posts and makes the NGO Portal to feel like home. Most settings are based on user permissions, so for super-admin, it does not change much, but for site-admin it cleans up the backoffice a great deal. It also provides a custom login page.</p>\n<p>See documentation on <a href=\"https://ngo-portal.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://ngo-portal.org</a> for more information and documentation about NGO-portal and this plugin.</p>\n",

If you do not need to translate this plugin, you can skip this update.</p>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<p>I had the wrong header for this plugin, sorry. Now it&#8217;s correct.</p>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<p>Minor update. Moved blocking from backoffice for writers and less to ngo-menu-deactivate and opened up access to look and users in admin for site admins.<br />\nThis makes this plugin a branding plugin, and put all the other adaptations of the backoffice in ngp-menu-deactivate, making it easier to adapt this plugin at will.</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<p>Added setting in settings -&gt; general to set the slug for site-list page link and moved some functions to other plugins, where they belong.</p>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<p>Bug fix. Network activating would have locked you out of admin</p>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<p>Changed donation link (important stuff ðŸ˜‰ )</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Initial release to the WordPress repositorium</p>\n"
