        "description": "<p>SimpleForm is a very simple to manage plugin for creating a basic contact form for your website. Here are some reasons to use it:</p>\n<h4>Easy to use</h4>\n<p>This plugin is very easy to set up thanks to a graceful and intuitive admin interface. You can quickly create a contact form by using our pre-built page or copying a shortcode to where you want it to appear.</p>\n<h4>Fully customizable</h4>\n<p>It allows you to customize everything you want. You can decide which fields to display and what kind of user can see them. You can decide which fields are required and which are not. You can change or hide the field labels, choose the labels placement and how required fields are marked, set a minimum or maximum length for text fields, use placeholders, decide what message to display when an error occurs and how to set focus on errors. You can add customized text above and below the form, you can choose a template based on your tastes or you are free to create and use a personal template for your contact form, you can add your own customized JavaScript code or CSS stylesheet.</p>\n<h4>Ready to use</h4>\n<p>It comes with the SMTP option for outgoing email to be ready to use immediately. This feature makes it less likely that email sent from your website is marked as spam and lowers the risk of email getting lost somewhere.</p>\n<h4>Clean design</h4>\n<p>We love clean and minimalist design, and for this reason we provide a contact form that is both simple and appealing.</p>\n<h4>Designed thinking about the user experience</h4>\n<p>It is a lightweight and responsive plugin. SimpleForm does not interfere with your site performance. The submission via AJAX, on the backend too, allows a seamless user experience without page refreshes. You can show users a success message or redirect them elsewhere after they complete the form. You can also send a confirmation email to thank whoever contacts you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5rqtOE1UUU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>What SimpleForm is not for now:</strong></p>\n<p>There is still much to be done! For now, you cannot add new fields.</p>\n<p>For complete information, please visit the <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SimpleForm website</a>.</p>\n<h3>SimpleForm Demo</h3>\n<p>Find out how SimpleForm works, try our <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a>.</p>\n<h3>What feature do you wish SimpleForm had?</h3>\n<p>SimpleForm already contains many options for being a basic contact form, but there are many other features it lacks. Go to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simpleform/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> and create a new topic with your ideas! We’ll do our best to include the missing features in forthcoming releases.</p>\n<h3>Integrations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simpleform-contact-form-submissions/\" rel=\"ugc\">SimpleForm Contact Form Submissions</a> – Database addon.

You no longer need to worry about getting spam in your contact form, since each new form submission will be filtered for spam using Akismet. Once activated, you will find the new section called “Akismet Protection” in the settings page within the Anti-Spam tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simpleform-recaptcha/\" rel=\"ugc\">SimpleForm reCAPTCHA</a> – Anti-Spam addon.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='who%20should%20use%20simpleform%3F'>\nWho should use SimpleForm?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anyone who needs only what is strictly necessary. SimpleForm is designed for whoever is looking for a minimalist, friendly, and fully controllable contact form.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20form%20fields%20can%20be%20used%3F'>\nWhich form fields can be used?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The standard fields that come with SimpleForm are a name field, a last name field, an email address field, a phone number field, a website field, a subject field, a message field and a consent checkbox field.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20simpleform%20include%20a%20gutenberg%20block%3F'>\nDoes SimpleForm include a Gutenberg block?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It sure does. SimpleForm is built to work in both the Gutenberg and Classic editors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%E2%80%99t%20i%20find%20the%20gutenberg%20block%20%3F'>\nWhy can’t I find the Gutenberg block ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to update your WordPress version. The minimal version required to use the block is 5.6.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20publish%20a%20contact%20form%20as%20a%20widget%3F'>\nIs it possible to publish a contact form as a widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can publish the contact form as a widget. Go to the “Appearance” &gt; “Widgets” page, search for SimpleForm, and drag it to the widget area of your theme where you wish to place the form. Select the pages where it should appear and who should see it. Press “Save” after making these changes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20create%20a%20contact%20form%3F'>\nHow can I create a contact form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The fastest way is to use our pre-built “Contact Us” page. You just need to publish the page and the contact form will be displayed immediately. Navigate to &#8220;Pages&#8221; &gt; &#8220;All Pages&#8221; and open the “Contact Us” page. Not enough? With SimpleForm, adding a new form is quick and easy. Navigate to &#8220;Contacts&#8221; and click on “Add New”. Make sure to enter a name for this form and choose all the fields you need.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20contact%20forms%20can%20i%20create%3F'>\nHow many contact forms can I create?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can create unlimited contact forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20display%20multiple%20forms%20on%20the%20same%20page%3F'>\nCan I display multiple forms on the same page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can display more than one form on the same page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20be%20notified%20when%20someone%20submits%20a%20form%3F'>\nWill I be notified when someone submits a form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It sure does, but only if you enable this option. You will find the “Contact Alert” section in the settings page within the notifications tab. Here you can configure the email to alert the admin, or person responsible for managing contacts, when a form has been successfully submitted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20implement%20the%20autoresponder%3F'>\nCan I implement the autoresponder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. You will find the “Auto Responder” section in the settings page within the notifications tab. Here you can configure the confirmation email to send to users who have successfully submitted the form.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20simpleform%20include%20spam%20protection%3F'>\nDoes SimpleForm include spam protection?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course, it includes, by default, two honeypot fields, invisible spam protection to trick spambots into revealing themselves, and also allows you to enable an optional maths captcha field which requires human interaction. Google reCAPTCHA and Akismet are supported by using the SimpleForm addons.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20simpleform%20meet%20the%20gdpr%20conditions%3F'>\nDoes SimpleForm meet the GDPR conditions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you&#8217;re collecting personal data, you can use a required checkbox for requesting the user&#8217;s explicit consent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20not%20receiving%20messages%20when%20users%20submit%20a%20form%3F'>\nWhy am I not receiving messages when users submit a form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to enable an SMTP server. You can install a dedicated plugin that takes care of outgoing email, or you can enable our SMTP option in the settings page. If you have done so already, verify the correct SMTP server configuration, and always keep the notification email option enabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20check%20the%20submissions%20of%20my%20form%3F'>\nWhere can I check the submissions of my form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SimpleForm doesn’t store submitted messages in the WordPress database by default. You can easily add this feature with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simpleform-contact-form-submissions/\" rel=\"ugc\">SimpleForm Contact Form Submissions</a> addon. Without it, only the last message is temporarily stored. Therefore, it is recommended to verify the correct SMTP server configuration in case of use, and always keep the email alert enabled if you want to be sure to receive messages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20simpleform%20translation%20ready%3F'>\nIs SimpleForm translation ready?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, SimpleForm is ready to be translated into other languages. If you’re a polyglot, help us by translating it into your own language!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20text%20direction%3F'>\nCan I change text direction?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can change text direction from left to right and from right to left.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20support%3F'>\nWhere can I get support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We provide free support in the WordPress.org plugin repository.

    "short_description": "A simple and effective contact form. Ready to use, thanks to the SMTP setup options.",
    "description": "<p>SimpleForm is a very simple to manage plugin for creating a basic contact form for your website. Here are some reasons to use it:</p>\n<h4>Easy to use</h4>\n<p>This plugin is very easy to set up thanks to a graceful and intuitive admin interface. You can quickly create a contact form by using our pre-built page or copying a shortcode to where you want it to appear.</p>\n<h4>Fully customizable</h4>\n<p>It allows you to customize everything you want. You can decide which fields to display and what kind of user can see them. You can decide which fields are required and which are not. You can change or hide the field labels, choose the labels placement and how required fields are marked, set a minimum or maximum length for text fields, use placeholders, decide what message to display when an error occurs and how to set focus on errors. You can add customized text above and below the form, you can choose a template based on your tastes or you are free to create and use a personal template for your contact form, you can add your own customized JavaScript code or CSS stylesheet.</p>\n<h4>Ready to use</h4>\n<p>It comes with the SMTP option for outgoing email to be ready to use immediately. This feature makes it less likely that email sent from your website is marked as spam and lowers the risk of email getting lost somewhere.</p>\n<h4>Clean design</h4>\n<p>We love clean and minimalist design, and for this reason we provide a contact form that is both simple and appealing.</p>\n<h4>Designed thinking about the user experience</h4>\n<p>It is a lightweight and responsive plugin. SimpleForm does not interfere with your site performance. The submission via AJAX, on the backend too, allows a seamless user experience without page refreshes. You can show users a success message or redirect them elsewhere after they complete the form. You can also send a confirmation email to thank whoever contacts you.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5rqtOE1UUU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><strong>What SimpleForm is not for now:</strong></p>\n<p>There is still much to be done! For now, you cannot add new fields.</p>\n<p>For complete information, please visit the <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SimpleForm website</a>.</p>\n<h3>SimpleForm Demo</h3>\n<p>Find out how SimpleForm works, try our <a href=\"\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a>.</p>\n<h3>What feature do you wish SimpleForm had?</h3>\n<p>SimpleForm already contains many options for being a basic contact form, but there are many other features it lacks. Go to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simpleform/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> and create a new topic with your ideas! We’ll do our best to include the missing features in forthcoming releases.</p>\n<h3>Integrations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simpleform-contact-form-submissions/\" rel=\"ugc\">SimpleForm Contact Form Submissions</a> – Database addon.
