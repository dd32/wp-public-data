        "description": "<p>SHAREABLE makes it easy to distribute links to your site. Just place the Widget on your sidebar to display a link to your site, that visitors can copy to their own site (features easy-to-copy link code). You can even customize the style of the link and use external images.</p>\n<p>After installation this Plugin will start collecting in-bound clicks and impression statistics immediately.</p>\n<p>Updated Nov-7th</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download and unzip the plugin into your WordPress plugins directory (usually <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code>).</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in your WordPress Admin.</li>\n<li>Place the widget on your sidebar through the &#8216;Widgets&#8217; menu in your WordPress Admin.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What do I do after I activate the Plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the Widgets menu in the WordPress Admin and add the &#8220;In-Bound Links&#8221; Widget to your Sidebar or Footer Area.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why am I not seeing the Widget on my site after I add it to the sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Widgets only shows up after the plugin has logged traffic from another site. Try clicking to your site from a link on another site or search for your site on Google and click on the link to your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do Blocked Sites still show in the In-Bound Links Report in my admin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You cannot block a site from linking to your site and the report shows all the In-Bound Links that the plugin has logged. By blocking a site you are telling the plugin not link back to this site, no matter what, even if they keep on linking to you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do the Google links on the Widget just loop back to my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In October of 2011 Google announced that signed-in users will, by default, be routed to the SSL version of Google Search. So now, when someone finds your site through Google&#8217;s SSL Search, the HTTP_REFERER is not actually the page that they found your site on but rather a special redirect page that forwards traffic to your site without passing query information. This means that if you try to go back to the page that they came from it just loops back to your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
