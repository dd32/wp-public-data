        "description": "<p>This plugin is a simple yet popular WooCommerce extension which redirects a buyer to a custom WordPress page created by the administrator. Simply create a blank page using the template in your theme, naming it anything like &#8220;Thank You Page&#8221; and then select that page from the plugin settings dropdown as the Thank You page. You must then add these short codes in your page to display content where you want in your template (see example graphic below using a builder):</p>\n<p><strong>[ctyw_order_review]</strong> &#8211; Displays order details (Normally at top)<br />\n<strong>[ctyw_socialbox]</strong> &#8211; Displays responsive social box (Normally at bottom)</p>\n<p>This valued redirect customization allows the user to embellish the purchase verification page with more suggested items and even the WooCommerce user console short code if desired. This plugin allows maximum design options!</p>\n<p>A new global shortcode was added in version 1.0.5. The shortcode is [ctyw_order_information data=&#8221;key&#8221;]. This addition extends the plugin to make provision for users to be able to access 40 different data fields from orders by replacing the &#8220;key&#8221; entry with what they want to retrieve. For example [ctyw_order_information data=&#8221;order_billing_first_name&#8221;] will output order customer billing first name and [ctyw_order_information data=&#8221;order_billing_address_1&#8243;] will output customer billing address. This shortcode allows an infinite combination of results, limited to only what WooCommerce or other third-party plugins include.</p>\n<p>The highly valued social share box can appear on the custom thank you page after a finished purchase.  A customer can select any one of the items purchased and post the product on Facebook, Pinterest or Twitter. They can also choose to email the purchase to anyone. This is an effective and proven method of content marketing through social sharing.</p>\n<p>While some &#8216;Thank You&#8217; plugins entail complex setups and functions which result in extra memory usage, system conflicts and frequent updates, this plugin eliminates all the hurdles by providing a simple solution without excessive size or options. This plugin too supports Google Analytics tracking. The hook “woocommerce_is_order_received_page” is added to line 33 and returning true. Tests confirms that Google Analytics can track the dynamic page and record it both historically and in real-time.</p>\n<p>In summary, at the conclusion of a purchase, your buyer will be redirected to your custom &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page instead of WooCommerce&#8217;s default &#8216;Thank You&#8217; page. You can create your own Thank You message due to this plugin&#8217;s flexibility.</p>\n<h3>Technical Details for Release 1.1.1</h3>\n<p>Load time: 0.215 s; Memory usage: 3.06 MiB<br />\nPHP up to tested version: 8.3.4<br />\nMySQL up to tested version: 8.0.36<br />\nMariaDB up to tested version: 11.3.2<br />\ncURL up to tested version: 8.6.0, OpenSSL/3.2.1<br />\nPHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 compliant.</p>\n",
