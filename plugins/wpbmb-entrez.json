        "description": "<p>This plugin allows you to insert references to articles in NCBI Entrez databases (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using a shortcode. It supports any query or search syntax you would use on the main NCBI site. For single sites with simple requirements the options on the settings pages may be enough. For more advanced requirements, such as, multiple unique shortcodes, parameter overrides and custom templates, shortcodes can be defined using the builder or dynamically by just inserting a shortcode in a post or page.</p>\n<p>The plugin has a built in caching mechanism with cache life settings (if desired) to reduce page load times. Search terms that are dynamic (for example Author queries) will update automatically on the next page load if not in cache or if the cache for that shortcode is expired.</p>\n<p>A default set of templates and stylings are included. Custom styles (either in the settings or via stylesheet) and templates are also supported using the standard WordPress styles/templates overrides in child-themes.

The plugin can, in theory support any of the queryable databases, but templates and parsers are not provided at the moment.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I just want to show my publication list on a single page. How can I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install the plugin</li>\n<li>Set the options you want in the General and Display tabs</li>\n<li>Add the shortcode [wpbmb] to your page or post</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Can multiple/different shortcodes be used on the same page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to aggregate a bunch of different search queries into a single list. Is that possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin has support for combining multiple shortcodes by either ID or by custom assigned tags to the shortcode (see tags, use_tags and sid on the Shortcode tab in the admin settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
