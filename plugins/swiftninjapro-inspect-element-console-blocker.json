Opening the console is done client side, so it can only be detected client side. This plugin does make it much harder for non-admins to inspect element though.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20do%20if%20i%20can%27t%20access%20the%20login%20screen%3F'>\nWhat do I do if I can&#8217;t access the login screen?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This could be because of the browser your using. Some browsers may respond differently.</p>\n<p>If you cant access your site, you can do 1 of 2 things to disable this plugin:<br />\n 1. Contact your host, and ask them to disable the plugin manually<br />\n 2. Use FTP, Filezilla, or cpanel, then (click &#8220;File Manager&#8221;, if using cpanel) navigate to public_html/wp-content/plugins, then find the folder &#8220;swiftninjapro-inspect-element-console-blocker&#8221; and rename it to &#8220;swiftninjapro-inspect-element-console-blocker-off&#8221; to disable the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
