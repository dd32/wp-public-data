Being a photo enthusiast having a WordPress site with one post per image, I realized after a while that there were limited possibilities to show the images in a smooth flow.</p>\n<p>To avoid the cumbersome manual navigation between posts, I decided to (try to) write a plugin to collect the featured image (if it has a featured image) or first image from each post, show them in an image slider and then navigate to the post from the image. The content of the slider is then defined based on the context of the page, for intance an archive page that contain the result of a tag query.</p>\n<p>Messing around with various gallery plugins &#8211; that always require som extra effort to set up &#8211; or modifying page template code was not an option.</p>\n<p>Eventually the plugin was extended to be applied for general use as well, and the collection of post images and handling of navigation between posts has just become an optional feature that can be turned on/off from the plugin settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20shortcut%20keys%20available%3F'>\nAre there any shortcut keys available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, for those users who are blessed with a keyboard:</p>\n<p><strong>right arrow/left arrow</strong> &#8211; next/previous<br />\n<strong>C</strong> &#8211; toggle caption if supported<br />\n<strong>A</strong> or <strong>P</strong> &#8211; toggle autoplay<br />\n<strong>B</strong> &#8211; switch background class<br />\n<strong>L</strong> &#8211; last image<br />\n<strong>T</strong> &#8211; swith between slide in/out or cross-fade transition<br />\n<strong>V</strong> or <strong>S</strong> &#8211; switch view style<br />\n<strong>X</strong> &#8211; exit<br />\n<strong>Z</strong> &#8211; zoom mode on/off</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20touch%20gesture%20or%20mouse%20operations%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhich touch gesture or mouse operations are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>swipe left/right</strong> go to next/previous image<br />\n<strong>spipe up/down</strong> exit viewer<br />\n<strong>pinch</strong> &#8211; zoom<br />\n<strong>doubleclick/doubletap</strong> &#8211; enter/exit zoom mode<br />\n<strong>left mouse button down while swiping right/left with mouse</strong> &#8211; next/previous<br />\n<strong>ctrl key and left mouse button down while swiping up/down</strong> &#8211; enter zoom mode and do zooming<br />\n<strong>mousewheel</strong> &#8211; zoom when in zoom mode<br />\n<strong>click caption</strong> &#8211; turn off display of caption if captions are supported.

If in doubt, do not hesitate to file a support ticket.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20choose%20which%20posts%2Fpages%20and%20images%20it%20shall%20be%20activated%20for%3F'>\nCan I choose which posts/pages and images it shall be activated for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This can be specified in the plugin settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20modify%20the%20styles%3F'>\nCan I modify the styles?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Please have a look into the plugin settings page and the stylesheet located in the plugin directory. If you need advice on how to set up the styles, please leave a support message.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20responsive%20and%20touch-device%20friendly%3F'>\nIs it responsive and touch-device friendly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I would say so.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20in%20all%20versions%20of%20all%20browsers%3F'>\nDoes it work in all versions of all browsers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visitors running a &#8216;modern&#8217; browser released in 2020 or after should be good to go.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20it%20together%20with%20nextgen%20gallery%20or%20other%20third-party%20galleries%3F'>\nHow can I use it together with NextGEN gallery or other third-party galleries?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For NextGEN, select None for Lightbox effects in the Other options page of NextGEN gallery plugin.<br />\nFor other galleries, please leave a support message if you are not able to make it work as expected.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
