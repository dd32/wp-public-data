        "faq": "\n<h4>How this plugin works?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin simply creates a customized template in your page. You just need to install the plugin, and the plugin does everything for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin creates a default page: My tickets &amp; New ticket. Can I create my own page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely yes &#8211; You create the page, and paste [my-tickets] and [new-ticket] in tickets listing page and open ticket page, and update it in ticketpress settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to customize the template without working on Plugin file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have created a template keeping in mind of template customization. For this, you need to copy template folder from the plugin to your current theme, and rename it to ticketpress. So your directory would look similar to this:<br />\nThemes &gt; Current Theme &gt; ticketpress -&gt; [files in plugins template folder]</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I setup the plugin successfully, but when I try to browse the ticket, it do not show right post. Am I missing something?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometime there might be problem with the permalink. So, you need to reset the permalink.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
