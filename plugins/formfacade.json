So, you quickly put together a Google form to connect with your users. But, what do your users think when they see a form that doesn’t have your branding? Does it give them the confidence that you will be able to deliver a great product or service, when you can’t even show them a professional looking form? Formfacade modifies Google Forms to blend with your websites and apps. Replace Google branding in the forms with your own branding and gain your users’ trust.</p>\n<h3>Try it out</h3>\n<p>Step 1: Login to your WordPress site as an admin<br />\nStep 2: Install and Activate the Formfacade WordPress plugin for Google Forms<br />\nStep 3: Follow the prompts in the setup wizard to embed the google form</p>\n<p>For detailed instructions, refer to this help article.<br />\n<a href=\"https://formfacade.com/embed/embed-google-forms-in-wordpress.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">(https://formfacade.com/embed/embed-google-forms-in-wordpress.html)</a></p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h4>Make your embedded form look like your website</h4>\n<p>Convert your Google Form into a tailor-made form that fits neatly in your website. Once the user submits the form, you can manage them with Google Sheets/Forms, you are comfortable with. Gain your users’ trust with a professional user experience, while still being scrappy.</p>\n<h4>Prefill your embedded form</h4>\n<p>Google Forms prefill feature does not work with embedded form. With Formfacade, you can append the prefill url from Google Forms to the url of the webpage that embeds the Formfacade form. Formfacade will automatically read your webpage url and prefill the form appropriately.</p>\n<h4>Analyze where users are dropping off using session recording tools</h4>\n<p>Google forms embedded in your website can’t be analyzed using session recording tools. This is critical for forms with multiple sections. Formfacade allows you to analyze user behaviour and see where they are dropping off using session recording tools like FullStory or Hotjar.</p>\n<h4>Customize UI</h4>\n<p>With customize UI paid plans, you can also customize the form layout, apply custom styles, change form field permissions (editable, hidden, readonly), update the placeholder text, format the question, description, add dynamic response validations, add calculations, enter a caption to update the button text, personalize the confirmation message and redirect users to another webpage on submit.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Free plan for 20 responses per month.</li>\n<li>Paid plan starts at $18 for 100 responses per month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ask <a href=\"mailto:&#115;&#x75;&#x70;&#112;&#111;&#x72;t&#064;&#x66;&#x6f;&#114;&#109;&#x66;a&#099;&#x61;&#x64;&#101;&#046;&#x63;&#111;&#109;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support@formfacade.com</a> for questions.</p>\n<h3>External service used in this plugin</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses our external web service <a href=\"https://formfacade.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">(Formfacade)</a>.
