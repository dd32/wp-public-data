The<br />\nway it does this is to create a temporary blog post, read it really quick, then delete it again right away.  The problem is,<br />\nsometimes the posts don&#8217;t get deleted.

It&#8217;s a simple plug-in just to filter out posts from your live blog and RSS feeds that<br />\nmatch the format of the Windows Live Writer detection messages.
