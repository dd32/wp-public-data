        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Extract the <code>wp-guides.zip</code> to your local system prior to upload.</li>\n<li>Upload <code>wp-guides</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugin Panel&#8217; in WordPress</li>\n<li>While in the WordPress admin panel, simply navigate to the &#8220;SETTINGS&#8221; by clicking on the tab for &#8220;SETTINGS&#8221; then to WP Guides.</li>\n<li>Upload folders containing your documents, guides and other media elements to the /wp-guides/tutorials/ directory.  If you name your folder My Cool Documents, the category instance in WordPress will be titled the same.  It is important to NEVER upload any type of executable file like .php, .exe, .asp and so on.  By default any file ending in .php no be active in the actual documents available but can still be parsed if the name and path are known to anyone so its NOT a good idea to add those types of files to your folders.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>Can I distribute this to any of my clients and change the branding paragraph on the guides page in the admin panel?<br />\n<em>Dont change the plugin license but feel free to modify the file called vendor-include.php to add your own links for your clients! This tool was built for people like you who want to build a WordPress site for your clients and have a way to distribute your own series of how to guides and documents as an extension of your service. We have NO restrictions as far as you altering the branding in that regard.</em></li>\n<li>Will this work with all document types?<br />\n<em>Alomst, it works with the most common document types used today such as DOC, PDF, TXT, RTF, HTML and soon DOCX!</em></li>\n<li>Will this work with commercial tutorials I purchase from Lynda or other tutorial publishers?<br />\n<em>It can, but I cant advise you to do that considering their NO DISTRIBUTION License.</em></li>\n<li>Will this work in WordPress Multi User?<br />\n<em>Yes, we have this very plugin installed on Real Estate sites where there are literally dozens of Realtor agent blogs.</em></li>\n<li><em>Are there any special settings I should be aware of?</em><br />\n<em>There are a few things you should be aware of before you begin the practice of uploading files into your /tutorials/ folder.  Also there are things to consider in using a WordPress MU type site with WP Guides so I have published a few tutorials to help with the configuration.s You can examine these things by visiting <a href=\"http://www.jaredritchey.com/wp-guides/\" title=\"Jared Ritchey Instructional Videos\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jared Ritchey</a></em></li>\n<li>Are there any linkback requirements?<br />\n<em>Linkback Requirements? NO! Would we appreciate contextual linking? Absolutely! We would love for you to wright a little post about us and link to us within your content. Nothing against the blogroll but if you dont want a link to us on every page, then a little post about the plugin would be great. \ud83d\ude42</em></li>\n</ol>\n"
