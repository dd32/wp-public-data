        "description": "<p>The Snap Marketing plugin enables preapproval functionality where your credit-challenged shoppers can get potentially approved during key moments of their shopping journey on your webstore; thereby, giving you greater ability to close more sales.  There are multiple ways to drive e-commerce preapproval customers, with our “Get Approved” and “Get Approved – As low as” treatments. We encourage you to use both on key places on your site to drive visibility for customers who may need financing to transact on your store.<br />\nEnable the &#8220;Get Approved&#8221; promotional treatment on any pages of your webstore.  Let customers know they have a financing option, from the start, to turn browsers into actual customers.  With the preapproval application flow, if approved, customers will know exactly how much they have been approved for, giving them the motivation to transact for a higher shopping cart value on your store.  As research shows, when customers know they have an approval and the amount, not only are they likely to purchase but purchase more items or a higher price point item.</p>\n<p>=Assets for Banners and logo=<br />\nPlugin uses Snapfinance server resources to load banners and logos used in treatment.</p>\n<h4>Get Approved &#8211; As low as</h4>\n<p>Offer contextual financing experience with &#8220;Get Approved &#8211; As low as&#8221; treatment and banners<br />\nEnable the &#8220;Get Approved &#8211; As low as&#8221; promotional treatment and get enhanced benefits of the &#8220;Get Approved&#8221; but customized for your product pages.
