        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I change the language for something else than English?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is delivered with English as the default language, and French as second optional language.<br />\nIn order to use French you must have:<br />\ndefine (&#8216;WPLANG&#8217;, &#8216;fr_FR&#8217;);<br />\nin your wp-config.php file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where in the .htaccess file the settings should be located?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no specific place for the settings in the .htaccess. The plugin should put it on the right place on its own.<br />\nThe only thing you should watch is if there is no other redirection for images file (e.g. gif, png, jpeg,jpg) as it can prevent this plugin to work</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the prerequesite for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must have the GD Library enabled on your server. The plugin will make a check for it.<br />\nAlso, you should have the Freetype enable too if you want to use a &#8220;text watermark&#8221; instead of &#8220;image watermark&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I set up everything well but my watermark didn&#8217;t display on other sites?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should checks these:<br />\n* first thing first, try a complete refresh (control + F5) on the targeted website as sometime your page on those sites is on a buffer and won&#8217;t be refreshed with the new &#8220;watermarked&#8221; version until a complete refresh<br />\n* check the watermark isn&#8217;t wider than your image. If you use &#8220;text watermark&#8221; try to use a shorter sentence and/or lower font size<br />\n* check if the GD library is installed AND enabled on your server. Contact your administrator for further info.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Your plugin&#8217;s doing a great work. How can I rewards you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Thanks for the compliment.
