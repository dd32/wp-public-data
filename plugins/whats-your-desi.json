        "faq": "<h4>What is so great about .desi?</h4>\n<p>Until today, if you wanted to connect with desis around the world with content that you control you likely would be doing that on top of legacy and aging top-level domains like .com, .net, .org, and .in. But now you’ve got new options. That’s because the brand new .desi top-level domain is an officially sanctioned open Internet neighborhood just like the other domains, but also a powerful new targeting platform that brings desis together without restriction by geography. Dot desi is a space in which all registrants can confidently identify to the desi markets.</p>\n<h4>Who is the target customer?</h4>\n<p>Brands, individual or business, who are either from the desi markets (Indian sub-continent and diaspora) or are looking for effective means to connect with this vast, generally under-served market.</p>\n<h4>Can anyone get a .desi domain?</h4>\n<p>Absolutely, .desi is an open, un-restricted domain and available to anyone.</p>\n<h4>Are there going to be premium names?</h4>\n<p>Yes. They will be setting aside some limited premium names for both “buy it now” pricing as well as domain auctions.</p>\n",
