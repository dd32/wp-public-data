Hide the block on desktop.<br />\n2. Hide the block on mobile and tablet.<br />\n3. Hide the block to loggedin users.<br />\n4. Hide the block to loggedout users.</p>\n<p>You can use it for:<br />\n* Hide any block on mobile and tablets to improve performance.<br />\n* Display/hide some menu items dependending if the user it&#8217;s loggedin or not (on block themes).<br />\n* Increase loading speed for pages with different block designs for each screen size.</p>\n<h4>Tutorial</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://osompress.com/control-wordpress-blocks-visibility-device-logged-status/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Control WordPress blocks visibility by device &amp; logged status</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Dev Info</h4>\n<p>The plugin uses wp_is_mobile function to check if the device it&#8217;s a mobile (or tablet) or not. This has the limitation that it can&#8217;t discern between mobile and tablet, but it has the advantage that let&#8217;s you load only the necessary block for the device. This can reduce the number of blocks loaded per page even by half in some cases.</p>\n",
