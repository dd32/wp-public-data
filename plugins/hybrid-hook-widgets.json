This allows users to add widgets virtually anywhere.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What widgets areas are available?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Aside from <em>Hybrid&#8217;s</em> many default widget areas, you&#8217;ll get 11 new ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hook: Before HTML</li>\n<li>Hook: After HTML</li>\n<li>Hook: Before Header</li>\n<li>Hook: Header</li>\n<li>Hook: After Header</li>\n<li>Hook: Before Container</li>\n<li>Hook: After Container</li>\n<li>Hook: Before Footer</li>\n<li>Hook: Footer</li>\n<li>Hook: Before HTML</li>\n<li>Hook: Comment Form</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t understand any of this.
