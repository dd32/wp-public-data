        "installation": "<p>The most basic installation simply requires that you upload the &#8216;micromint&#8217; folder to your /wp-content/plugins directory. Then, from the Administration -&gt; Plugins menu, simply activate the plugin and indicate where Mint is installed. Now the Mint tracking code is automatically inserted into wordpress. Done.</p>\n<p>In order to integrate statistics into WordPress, you need to install an API for Mint. There are currently two supported options, the Expos\u00e9 pepper, by Adam Livesley or the \u00b5API which is heavily based on the Expos\u00e9 code, with some improvements. The \u00b5API is distributed along with this package. In the future, I hope to discontinue the \u00b5API and simply provide an exposure for Expos\u00e9, but at this time it is not mature enough to be the reccomended option. Although both pepper are supported, at this time I reccomend the \u00b5API pepper for several reasons:</p>\n<p>Although somewhat convoluted there is a way that the Expos\u00e9 pepper can expose priveledged information. \u00b5API patches this.</p>\n<p>The \u00b5API includes better formed, XML based error responses, allowing the client application to integrate better.</p>\n<p>The \u00b5API is currently 100% compatible with Expos\u00e9 exposures, as it uses the same serializer.</p>\n<p>\u00b5API has been more extensively tested with this release.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> You cannot have both Expos\u00e9 and \u00b5API installed concurently. If you already have Expos\u00e9 installed (with Firemint, for example), you should simply drop the included <code>/exposures/micro.php</code> file into the /exposures folder of your Expos\u00e9 installation</p>\n<p>To install the API (installation is the same for both), simply upload the pepper to the appropriate folder in mint (/pepper/chrisoconnell/ and /pepper/84degrees/ for \u00b5API and Expos\u00e9 respectively). Go to the Mint control panel and enable the API. Enter an API key. If you are using the Expos\u00e9 API, make sure that the micro.php file is in /pepper/84degrees/expose/exposures/.</p>\n<p>In wordpress goto &#8216;Settings &gt; \u00b5Mint&#8217;. Change your mint URL if neccessary. Select &#8220;Integrate Mint statistics into WordPress?&#8221;. Select the appropriate API and enter the API key.</p>\n<p>To setup the sidebar widget, visit &#8216;Design &gt; Widgets&#8217;. You can manually configure which datafields are displayed as well as display labels for different data.</p>\n",
