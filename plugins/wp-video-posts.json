All uploaded video files will be converted into MP4<br />\nformat to enhance the performance so that it loads and plays fast.  It creates<br />\nsnapshot of a specified frame at a specific time to create the splash image<br />\nfor the video. This plugin enables WordPress the ability to allow the<br />\nfollowing formats to be uploaded as well as convert them to the finalized MP4<br />\nformat for playing; FLV, F4V, MP4, AVI, MOV, 3GP and WMV formats.<br />\nImportant Note: If FFMPEG is NOT installed then the supported formats for playing videos are FLV and MP4 formats and the splash image will not be created and the default image will be shown. You can always encode your video and create a splash image manually.</p>\n<p>In addition, WP Video Posts allows the embed of Youtube and Vimeo videos with<br />\nthe use of the following shortcodes:</p>\n<p>Youtube:<br />\n[wpvp_embed type=youtube video_code=vAFQIciWsF4 width=560 height=315]</p>\n<p>Vimeo:<br />\n[wpvp_embed type=vimeo video_code=23117398 width=500 height=281]</p>\n<p>You can also use our general shortcode to display a video player anywhere on your site (video need to be of mp4 format):<br />\n[wpvp_player src=http://example.com/path/to/video/file.mp4 splash=http://example.com/path/to/image/file.jpg width=500 height=281]</p>\n<p>You can pass the following attributes to a shortcode (examples):<br />\n&#8211; width (640)<br />\n&#8211; height (480)<br />\n&#8211; autoplay (1|0)<br />\n&#8211; volume (50)<br />\n&#8211; src (http://example.com/video.mp4)<br />\n&#8211; splash (http://example.com/video.jpg)</p>\n<p>You can also overwrite our template files for the front end uploader / editor if you need to add your styling.<br />\nIf you&#8217;re going to do so, please copy the files from wp-video-posts/templates/ into your own theme:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wpvp-frontend-uploader.php</li>\n<li>wpvp-frontend-editor.php</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember to keep the fields and field names as is in order for the form processing to work properly.</p>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>After install, go to the Dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hover over the Videos menu item and click on Add New Video in the submenu for Videos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a title to the Video Post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click the Upload/Insert icon above the post content editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the media uploader pop up, add the video you want to attach to this video post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the video uploads, it will automatically be encoded if ffmpeg exists on the server.

        "faq": "<p>Q: I get a &#8220;Page not found&#8221; error when I view my new video post. Why is this<br />\nhappening?<br />\nA: With any new custom post type being registered with WordPress, the permalinks need to be updated.  The solution is go to the &#8216;Settings&#8217;-&gt;&#8217;Permalinks&#8217; and save your current links structure again.</p>\n<p>Q: I installed ffmpeg AFTER I already installed and activated WP Video Posts on my site. How do I refresh the settings?<br />\nA: You can re-check for ffmpeg by clicking on &#8220;Re-Check FFMPEG&#8221; button under options page for WP Video Posts.</p>\n<p>Q: I have ffmpeg installed but I get a message &#8220;FFMPEG test encoding failed. Possible reasons: restricted permissions on /test/ directory within the plugin, incorrectly configured ffmpeg, etc.&#8221;.<br />\nA: Check permissions on /test/ folder under wp-video-posts/classes/. Make sure that apache has permissions to write to this directory.<br />\nThe script will try to create an image file out of ffmpeg_test_video.mp4 test file. It can either fail due to permissions issue, or some flags that we used in ffmpeg are failing in your ffmpeg version.</p>\n<p>Q: I&#8217;m running WordPress multisite and I get the message that says something about the file type not being supported.  How do I fix that?<br />\nA: If you are using WordPress multisite, then you need to manually list the type of video formats to allow for upload.  This is done by logging in to the wp-admin, and going to &#8216;My Site&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Network Admin&#8217;, then click on &#8216;Settings&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;Network Settings&#8217;.<br />\nScroll down to the Upload Settings section of the network settings page and add the format in the Upload file types list.</p>\n<p>Q: I&#8217;m using the plugin but I do not have FFMPEG installed on my server.  How can I create my own default splash image and have it display rather than the default image supplied with the plugin?<br />\nA: You can create an image with the dimensions you want and upload it to your server to override our default_image.png located in the /wp-content/plugins/wp-video-posts/images/ directory.</p>\n<p>Q: How do I install FFMPEG if I have root access on my server?<br />\nA: If you have either Ubuntu, Debian, or Mint you can follow these steps to compile ffmpeg:<br />\n    &#8211; https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu<br />\nRemember you need to compile it with libfdk-aac (for audio) and libx264 (for video) in order for mp4 to work.</p>\n<p>Q: I have ffmpeg on the server but encoding of the video doesn&#8217;t work for me<br />\nA: 1. Check what version of ffmpeg is installed and what configuration ffmpeg has. You can do so by running &#8220;ffmpeg&#8221; via command line.<br />\nMake sure ffmpeg configuration has the following enabled:<br />\nconfiguration: &#8211;enable-libfdk-aac &#8211;enable-libx264</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Check the codecs that are supported with your installation:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ffmpeg -codecs | less</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure libfaac (or libfdk_aac) and libx264 are among the codecs available for you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As of now Debian ffmpeg repository distribution DOES NOT include libx264. You will have to compile ffmpeg yourself from source. There are a lot of good tutorials on web how to install ffmpeg on Debian with libx264 support.</p>\n\n<h4>What pre-requirements do I need to install this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must Install ffmpeg on your server.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happen if I dont have ffmpeg in my server?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not have ffmpeg support on your server, this plugin will simply ignore the conversion and proceed with the rest of the process.  The supported file formats without ffmpeg installed would only be FLV and MP4.  In addition, the splash image will not be generated either and the default image will be displayed.</p>\n<p>You can convert your video manually by using online resources or programs on your computer.  One online resource is this: http://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-flv</p>\n</p>\n\n",
