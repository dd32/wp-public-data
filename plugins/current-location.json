You entered this id: Nothing&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to visit the Current Location settings page and update the Google Badge UserID.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>On the settings page you see this note: &#8220;Since you are using an older version of WordPress, the timestamp output will be set to the server.&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All that means is your not using WordPress 2.8, which is fine, but the new TimeZone feature in 2.8 will fix the timestamp to your local blog timezone instead of your server timezone. Example: My server is located in the EST timezone but I want my blog on the CST. This will fix the timestamps for CST not EST.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
