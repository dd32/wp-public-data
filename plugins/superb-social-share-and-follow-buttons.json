For instance, you choose the position of the Share and Follow buttons— at the end or at the beginning of the posts and pages. You can also opt to enable or disable a floating sidebar and hide or unhide the buttons on mobile devices. For more customization, consider purchasing the <a href=\"https://superbthemes.com/plugins/social-media-share-and-follow-buttons/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">premium version</a> for $11.</p>\n<h3>Lightweight Format</h3>\n<p>Each new plugin installed on your site impacts its loading speed. However, the developers of Superb Social Media Share and Follow Buttons have done their best to make this plugin as lightweight as possible. You can use the plugin confidently because it won’t affect the site’s speed.</p>\n<p>How To Install The Social Share &amp; Follow Buttons Plugin<br />\nInstalling the plugin is as simple as ABC. Here is the entire process of installing Superb Social Media Share and Follow Buttons:</p>\n<p><strong>How To Install Social Share Buttons: Option 1</strong></p>\n<p>Head to your WordPress admin dashboard and click on Plugins &gt; Add New. Type “Superb Social Media Share and Follow Buttons” into the search box and select the first plugin suggested. Install and activate it.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Install Social Share Buttons: Option 2 </strong></p>\n<p>Go to the plugin’s website and type your email address into the subscribe form to get the free version of the plugin. Check your email and download the plugin. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard and click on Plugin &gt; Add New. Hit the Upload Plugin button and choose the path to the plugin you downloaded.</p>\n<h3>SEO Optimized &amp; Responsive Social Share &amp; Follow Icons</h3>\n<p>Having a responsive website means that it works on all devices such as tablets, iPhone, Android phones and desktop computers. Responsiveness matters, it has a huge impact on how you rank in search engines such as Google and Bing. Not all plugins that provide social share buttons and social share icons are responsive or SEO optimized. There isn&#8217;t much to optimize beside making them W3C valid, you can&#8217;t add schema or other types of microdata to make such a module SEO friendly.</p>\n<p>Our WordPress plugin is fully responsive and works with AMP, CDN (such as Cloudflare) &amp; SSL (HTTPS websites) as well We know how important it is for monetization in the digital world to have an SEO-friendly website – especially if you rely on AdSense, ads or affiliate programs to earn your money. When Google releases and SEO updates then we&#8217;ll read it and take action if any changes are needed to keep this plugin SEO optimised.</p>\n<h3>Simple To Use</h3>\n<p>This plugin impresses with its simplicity. I can hardly believe that anyone will get stuck when using it. All you have to do is to install it, go to its settings, paste the social media links you want, and tick the activate checkbox. Could it be any simpler than that?</p>\n<h3>Plenty of Social Networks</h3>\n<p>You are probably active on Facebook and X (Twitter), and some of you may use Pinterest and LinkedIn too. However, neglecting other social networks isn’t always a smart decision. You have to be present where your audience is present.</p>\n<p>It’s totally up to you to decide which bookmarking services &amp; social networks are suitable for your business. Regardless of your choice, Superb Social Media Share and Follow Buttons lets you engage with your readers on countless social networks. YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Reddit, Twitch, and Behance are all available with this plugin.</p>\n<h3>Vertical Floating Share And Follow Bar</h3>\n<p>Having a floating social share / follow bar on either the left or right side of a website has become popular, especially for bloggers and news websites. Because of that we&#8217;ve of course integrated that in our plugin as well! We are still working on a horizontal floating share &amp; follow bar design. Having a floating follow bar with a follower count is great for website integrity and showing how popular your website is.</p>\n<p>The floating follow sidebar is sticky and loads fast, so your users will see it right away. You can choose to use our custom designs or the native social sharing buttons that the social networks have.</p>\n<p>If you got ideas for how we can improve our floating share and follow buttons feature then let us know through the support channel or email!</p>\n",

We try to update the plugin so it works with all drag and drop page builder plugins. The plugin works with all WordPress themes with page builders integrated too.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20my%20own%20custom%20social%20media%20follow%20icon%3F'>\nCan I create my own custom social media follow icon?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is that we&#8217;re working on it. We believe it&#8217;s important that our lovely users and customers can create a custom design for their follow button, share button, follow icon and share icon. Currently, we offer different designs, available shapes are rectangular, round and square. We try to create designs for what&#8217;s modern and make sure we have professional designs for blogs and business websites. The goal is that you can go to your media library and pick any video or image to use as an icon. We&#8217;ll do so it works with PNG, JPEG, SVG and, JPG.

You need no coding &amp; no programming skills to help us &#8211; what we need most of all is help with translations. We&#8217;d love to make it translatable when using plugins such as WPML, TranslatePress, Polylang, Weglot, MultilingualPress, Translate WordPress with GTranslate, Google Website Translator, and Loco Translate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20add%20the%20shortcodes%3F'>\nWhere can I add the shortcodes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can pretty much add them anywhere, for example in an email marketing popup, a custom post type, in PHP or in the Gutenberg Shortcode Block or show them in a footer widget. Shortcodes are great for WP beginners because it&#8217;s simple and easy to add them.</p>\n<p>There is no shortcode for the floating share sidebar &amp; floating follow icon sidebar, only the regular icons horizontal icons.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
