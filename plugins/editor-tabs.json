If you are using a more complex WordPress install and theme you are likely to end up with a long list of dialog boxes on the edit pages to manage the different elements of your site. This can be a usability problem for two reasons, one being that a client may not know they have control over an element because it will be hidden way down the page. Additionally you can get to a point where you have to scroll way down and up to make changes and then publish the site.</p>\n<p>This is especially true if you are using CMS plug-ins like PODS or Flutter.</p>\n<p>I am currently working on finding a way to better work around moving meta boxes into the right hand column. Currently doing so will still give it the behavior of being a tabbed content area until you reload the edit page. IE: It will still show / hide the content and the tab will still appear in the menu as well. Any suggestions on the logic / behavior would be greatly appreciated as I am somewhat stumped at this point.</p>\n<p>Changes</p>\n<p>1.75 &#8211; Improved the styling of the tabs. Improved the handling with hidden / disabled fields. Fixed javascript conflicts for drag and drop menus in WordPress 3.0</p>\n",
