        "installation": "<h3>Plugin Installation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>plugin-name.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Visit admin page and configure the domains you need to place on your site.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Adding Your Domain</h3>\n<p>After activation, you can see the &#8216;Multiple Domains&#8217; link at the bottom of the wp-admin menu.<br />\nWhen you visit this page, you can add Domains. It is possible to add same domain twice, the plugin will use the first entry.If you need to update a domain theme, simply add another copy and then delete the original one.</p>\n<h3>Modifying Theme Settings</h3>\n<p>You will need to activate each theme one by one on master installation and customize its settings. The saved settings will be used on other sites even if the theme is no longer active on the master site.</p>\n<h3>htaccess Update</h3>\n<p>In case where there are domains involved with wp install on non-root path, there is a manual step required to update htaccess, otherwise permalinks based on post name will malfunction on some domains. The htaccess content will appear automatically if the plugin thinks it is required. You will need to do a manual update of the file as mentioned in the admin page.</p>\n<p>Autogenerated htaccess content based on domains entered. Simply copy and paste this one.</p>\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n<p>There are certain limitations of how you use this plugin as listed below</p>\n<pre><code>WordPress does not allow multiple sites on same subdomain at different paths, this plugin does not attempt to allow that. However you can use as many subdomains as you like as well as different domains without issue.\nIf you need to modify theme settings, you must enable it on the 'master' site and modify there, once done, you can apply the same theme with same settings to any other site.\nYou cannot have the same theme applied with DIFFERENT settings to different sites. This may apply to some child themes using the same db entries too.\nNot recommended to be used with wordpress multisite network install.\n</code></pre>\n",
