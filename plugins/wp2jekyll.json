This Jekyll path must point to an existing Jekyll site directory. If you&#8217;re using it for testing purposes then make sure the assets, data and posts directories exist.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What is Jekyll?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out https://jekyllrb.com/ It should give you all the answers you need right here.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do after the site has exported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That completely depends on your setup. If you have Jekyll set up to watch the directory for changes then it will build or serve the site automatically.</p>\n<p>Future versions will trigger Jekyll in to building the site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use the data it exports?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well the posts are self explanatory.</p>\n<p>The taxonomy and author data is stored in  as yaml files which can be used by Jekyll very easily. Check out http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/.<br />\nI personally use it to load in author information and build menus.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This is great/terrible</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Let me know! I&#8217;d love to get some feedback on this. This is the first plugin I&#8217;ve created so go easy!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I would really like it if it did &#8216;x&#8217;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>How about you get in touch and I can see what I can do?</p>\n</p>\n\n",
