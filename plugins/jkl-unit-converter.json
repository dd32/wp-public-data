        "faq": "\n<h4>Tips</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As a general rule, it is always best to keep your WordPress installation and all<br />\nThemes and Plugins fully updated in order to avoid problems with this or any other<br />\nThemees or Plugins. I regularly update my site and test my Plugins and Themes with<br />\nthe latest version of WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the style of the plugin to match my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each element within the <code>conversion_form</code> contains its own unique CSS identifier,<br />\nallowing you to hook into those in your own Custom CSS stylesheet.</p>\n<p>To easily find out which classes control which elements, simply open your site in<br />\na modern browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Internet Explorer 9 or later)<br />\nand right-click on the element you wish to style. Then find <code>Inspect</code> in the pop-up<br />\ncontextual menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why don&#8217;t the lists show units immediately upon page load?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The unit lists are dynamically controlled by JavaScript (which loads at the end<br />\nof the page load). So, if your site has large images or other things that cause<br />\nthe page to load more slowly than usual, this will also cause the script to load<br />\nlater and delay the appearance of unit options in the select dropdowns.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the Sidebar Widget also show up on a Page using the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple: it&#8217;s best to not allow TWO separate instances of the Unit Converter<br />\nto run on the same page. It&#8217;s overkill. You only need one per page. The same is<br />\ntrue for multiple shortcodes on one page. Only ONE instance of the Unit Converter<br />\nshould be used on any one Page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does my Page reload every time I click the Convert button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is currently no AJAX functionality implemented by this plugin to maintain<br />\nthe state of the Page and dynamically calculate and show the answer without a<br />\nreload. This is a planned feature for an upcoming release.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do I have to scroll down the Page to see my results after conversion?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, the plugin doesn&#8217;t remember your page position when you submit the<br />\nconversion form, so because the form completely reloads the page, it thinks this<br />\nis the first time you&#8217;re loading, so it will load to the top of the page.</p>\n<p>Remembering page position is a planned upcoming feature, but it will be<br />\nunnecessary if/when I implement dynamic calculations with AJAX.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why do some of the Unit Converter fields appear out of place?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For the most part, it depends on how your Theme styles those elements. I did my<br />\nbest to style the form very simply and plainly, but some elements may appear out<br />\nof place in your installation due to your Theme&#8217;s default styles. In order to fix<br />\nthis, add some Custom CSS (preferrably using Jetpack&#8217;s Custom CSS feature, or<br />\nanother that doesn&#8217;t require modifying the Theme or Plugin files).</p>\n<p>See the first question above for more info on how to do create Custom CSS for the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can you ADD / REMOVE / CHANGE features of the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, I&#8217;m always open to suggestions. Let me know what you&#8217;re looking for. Feel<br />\nfree to open a GitHub Issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-jkl-unit-converter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin repository</a><br />\nto let me know the specific features or problems you&#8217;re having.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
