All settings are neatly saved per blog. It will even allow you to set outgoing email settings for all Events Manager emails per blog! That way you are finally able to protect each blog&#8217;s branding. This is not possible within Events Manager itself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20multiple%20bookings%20mode%20fully%20supported%3F'>\nIs Multiple Bookings Mode fully supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it is!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20wp_mail%28%29%20to%20send%20emails%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I use wp_mail() to send emails with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.<br />\nThere is no security/identity check in wp_mail() <em>at all</em>. Plugins can only hook into wp_mail() at the very end. That means that all alterations will always be for <em>all</em> outgoing emails on your website. Also, the EM dev team did not put any hooks or filters in their wp_mail() option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20an%20automated%20email%20when%20i%20create%20a%20new%20event%3F'>\nCan I send an automated email when I create a new event?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin hooks into bookings already made, not into publishing a new post. There are many other great plugins out there to help you send an email when you publish a new custom post type. The <a href=\"https://www.stonehengecreations.nl/creations/stonehenge-em-email-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Premium version</a> of EM Email Users does offer you the option to send automated follow-up emails or when event details change.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
