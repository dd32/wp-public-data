        "faq": "\n<h4>What is Gutenberg and why do I need it for Demoify to work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Gutenberg is a beta project by Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress. It’s a visual builder prototype of the new WordPress editor that’s coming out with WordPress 5.0 sometime this year.</p>\n<p>Since it’s yet to be fully integrated with WordPress, Gutenberg comes as a separate plugin for developers and beta testers. Demoify is an add-on for the current Gutenberg plugin, so you’ll need both of them installed for you to use Demoify.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I need an add-on for Gutenberg?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, Gutenberg has some of the most basic features needed to create a website. However, we wanted to extend its current functionality by developing more options for designing and creating your Gutenberg-built website. Along with the additional blocks, Demoify also lets you change colors, edit text and shape sizes, and tweak your blocks styles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this add-on for other page builders I’m using?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. Demoify only works with Gutenberg.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
