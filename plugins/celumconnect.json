This also enables you to link them in other posts later on. As an alternative to saving in WordPress, assets can only be linked from CELUM, so that they remain up to date at all times, even if they are adapted in CELUM.</p>\n<p>To enable cross-references, the brix extension Direct Download is included as part of WordPress:connect. If an asset from CELUM is used via WordPress:connect, the usage (linked or downloaded assets) can be automatically written to an information field of the asset to mark it in CELUM with a &#8220;WordPress bullet&#8221;, for example. With separate bullets can be distinguished whether an asset is linked in the CMS and deletion in CELUM DAM has an immediate effect, or is simply used there, which has no effect on deletion in CELUM DAM.</p>\n<p>The API key of the CELUM user and the ID of the CELUM root node to be used as well as the &#8220;Asset Picker&#8221; version to be used can be entered via a separate WordPress settings dialog. Just as, the desired download formats for saving assets in WordPress can be defined for each media type. Finally, for the two types of use (download or link), a name can be defined, which will be set as a node-ref value for downloaded resp. linked assets.
