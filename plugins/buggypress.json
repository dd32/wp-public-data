The Project taxonomy has disappeared, and has been replaced with Project posts. All projects will have to be re-created, and issues will not be automatically associated with projects.</p>\n<p>After upgrading be sure to visit your permalinks settings page to update permalinks. Then visit the BuggyPress options page to designate permissions for Projects.</p>\n<p>Want to write an update script to fix this? Let me know. I&#8217;ll be happy to include it in the plugin (or make you a committer, if you&#8217;re so inclined).</p>\n",

Otherwise, the plugin will not be able to modify the comment form to insert the necessary fields.</p>\n<h4>How do I attach files to a comment/update?</h4>\n<p>BuggyPress doesn&#8217;t yet support this.
