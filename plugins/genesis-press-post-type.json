        "faq": "\n<h4>What is the difference between a Press custom post type and a normal WordPress post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress posts are for you to write content.  Press custom post types are more like a bookmark that allows you to title and describe the bookmark.   In normal implementations, any click on the bookmark will take you to the source article.  For example, clicking on a Press post will take you to a the newspaper website where the article is hosted versus resolving to a WordPress permalink.  Press custom post types have no content.  Just titles, excerpts, and links.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why wouldn&#8217;t I just copy the newspaper&#8217;s article to my WordPress blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Copyright laws are one good reason why you wouldn&#8217;t want to do that.  But more importantly, newspaper and media sites carry credibility.  Your mention on their site carries more marketing weight than you simply talking about it on your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
