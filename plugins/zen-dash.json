        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20to%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to I use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply activate it, then head over to Dashboard &#8211; Zen Dash where an admin interface is waiting for you. Use the sliders to activate or deactivate an, then hit &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;.<br />\nYou can also choose to enable or disable all widgets at once.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20still%20access%20removed%20menu%20items%3F'>\nCan I still access removed Menu Items?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Zen Dash only hides them, but if you know the direct URL you can still call it.<br />\nFor example, to access the Dashboard, you can still navigate to yourdomain.com/wp-admin/index.php</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20still%20update%20wordpress%20core%20%2F%20themes%20%2F%20plugins%20with%20disabled%20notifications%3F'>\nCan I still update WordPress Core / Themes / Plugins with disabled notifications?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes indeed. Zen Dash only hides the notifications at the top, not the fact that an update is available.<br />\nWhen you&#8217;re ready to update, activate notifications again, then head over to Dashboard &#8211; Updates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='help%21%20i%27ve%20disabled%20the%20dashboard%20menu%20item%2C%20and%20now%20i%20can%27t%20access%20zen%20dash%20options%20to%20bring%20it%20back%21'>\nHELP! I&#8217;ve disabled the Dashboard Menu Item, and now I can&#8217;t access Zen Dash options to bring it back!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can access the Zen Dash options by hovering over the Admin Footer. Please do not disable both.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='help%21%20i%27ve%20disabled%20both%20the%20dashboard%20menu%20and%20the%20zen%20dash%20footer%20link...'>\nHELP! I&#8217;ve disabled BOTH the Dashboard menu AND the Zen Dash footer link&#8230;\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can still call the Zen Dash menu directly by appending &#8220;index.php?page=zendash&#8221; to your admin area.<br />\nFor example, if your URL in the admin area is &#8220;mydomain.com/wp-admin&#8221;, head over to &#8220;mydomain.com/wp-admin/index.php?page=zendash&#8221;.<br />\nIf that doesn&#8217;t work for you, please disable and uninstall the plugin, then re-install it. This will reset all your options.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20i%20remove%20the%20jetpack%20feedback%20option%3F'>\nHow to I remove the Jetpack Feedback option?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a tad tricky, but can be done under Jetpack &#8211; Settings. Towards the bottom you&#8217;ll find a Debug option. Select it and look for a link that reads &#8220;Access the full list of Jetpack Modules on this site&#8221;. After clicking it, find an option to disable the Contact Form. This will remove the Feeback Tab as well as the Jetpack Contact Form. I only recommend this if you have another Contact Form solution in place (such as Gravity Forms).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
