        "faq": "\n<dt id='no%20scheduled%20scans%20are%20performed'>\nNo scheduled scans are performed\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the main problems met during development was the one that scheduled scans were not running properly. Note that the plugin makes use of <strong>wp-cron</strong> for scheduled scans rather than system-specific cron. That means no scheduled events would fire unless someone visits your site from time to time. And if scheduled scans do not run, make sure <strong>wp-cron</strong> runs correctly (for instance using <strong>ALTERNATE_CRON</strong> made the trick during the development phase). Or you can simply set system cron yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='everything%20else'>\nEverything else\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pretty much everything else should have been accounted for (either fixed or appended to the list of future developments). However, if you do run into something you believe to be a problem in the plugin itself, you can send your question to <strong>support@vulners.com</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
