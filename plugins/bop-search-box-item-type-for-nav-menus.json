Thanks to (Das)[https://wordpress.org/support/profile/adwaitatechnologies].</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: The items are behaving weirdly in the WordPress appearance customizer?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The customizer is still in active development, especially for menus, at the time of writing this and any odd behaviour is likely because of that. Nonetheless, if you do experience any issues, let me know on the support forum. I still recommend using <em>Appearance &gt; Menus</em></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: The search box menu items are being called custom links in the editor?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This is a known issue with the customizer (at the time of writing). Ignore it, they still work just fine.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: This plugin is causing my site to fail an HTML validator. Why is that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: It is not this plugin but WordPress itself that is causing this issue. When using more than one WordPress HTML4 search form, there is a conflict as id attributes are repeated in the same document (not allowed in HTML). The only solutions to this are to only use one search form per page, or add support for HTML5 search forms to your theme. I advise the latter, see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/placholder-in-non-html5-template?replies=3#post-7813012\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a> to find out how this is done.</p>\n<p>Alternatively,</p>\n<p>A: There is an issue with your theme&#8217;s nav walker class. Probably worth getting another theme/if it&#8217;s yours, fixing it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I&#8217;d like a placeholder in my search input field, how would I go about this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This is set via the <em>Attribute Title</em> field in the menu item editor in the admin area. However, if your theme doesn&#8217;t support html5 search forms, this won&#8217;t work. See <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/placholder-in-non-html5-template?replies=3#post-7813012\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a> for a support post on how to enable HTML5 support. Note that there are a few id and class changes when going to HTML5 and that if your theme&#8217;s css/js uses the old ones, you made need to make a few small fixes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Annoying html class change in version 1.4.0?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This has been rectified, but depending on when you downloaded v1.4.0, it may be incorrect on your system.</p>\n<p>See this support question for more info and a fix: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/please-dont-modify-prev-used-classes-in-the-plugin-it-breaks-developed-theme</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: How do I modify the output of the search box?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: There are a number of filters available for the output of the search box and they are written about below. The most comprehensive method is to use the filter hook <em>get_nav_search_box_form</em> and return the html you want to see. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'get_nav_search_box_form', function( $current_form, $item, $depth, $args ){\n  $new_form = '...my_html...';\n  return $new_form;\n}, 10, 4 );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keep in mind that this is being accessed as part of a walk and that $item, $depth and $args are the same as in <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/walker_nav_menu/start_el/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Walker_Nav_Menu::start_el()</a>. Try to use some of the features demonstrated in the code there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: How do I hide/remove the search submit button (i.e. use enter key to submit only)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The filter hook <em>bop_nav_search_show_submit_button</em> will do the job of removing. Use:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'bop_nav_search_show_submit_button', function( $bool, $item, $depth, $args ){\n  $bool = false;\n  return $bool;\n}, 10, 4 );\n</code></pre>\n<p>in your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file &#8211; or other similarly suitable php file.<br />\nIf you wish to strictly hide the button (i.e. keep outputting html but have it invisible), use</p>\n<pre><code>.bop-nav-search input[type=\"submit\"]{\n  display: none;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>in your theme&#8217;s <em>style.css</em> &#8211; or other similarly suitable css file. Note that <code>bop-nav-search</code> is the default class applied list item, so if it&#8217;s changed, the style rule will need changing accordingly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: How do I hide/change/remove the screen reader text (i.e. the possibly invisible text before the input box)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The filter hook <em>bop_nav_search_screen_reader_text</em> will do the job of removing or changing the text. Use:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'bop_nav_search_screen_reader_text', function( $text, $item, $depth, $args ){\n  $text = ''; //for nothing\n  $text = __( '&lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;The text you want&lt;/span&gt;', 'myslug' ); //to change - the __() is for theme translation\n  return $text;\n}, 10, 4 );\n</code></pre>\n<p>in your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file &#8211; or other similarly suitable php file.<br />\nThe output should be hidden in a well written theme as it has screen-reader-text class. However, if this is not the case, you may well wish to add</p>\n<pre><code>.bop-nav-search .screen-reader-text {\n    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n    height: 1px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    position: absolute !important;\n    width: 1px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>or simply,</p>\n<pre><code>.screen-reader-text {\n    clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\n    height: 1px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    position: absolute !important;\n    width: 1px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>in your theme&#8217;s <em>style.css</em> &#8211; or other similarly suitable css file. Note that <code>bop-nav-search</code> is the default class applied list item, so if it&#8217;s changed, the style rule will need changing accordingly. Also note that, as per WP defaults, the default output for this filter is different depending on whether your theme supports html5.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Why isn&#8217;t Search Box appearing as a possible item for menus?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: It is most likely that you have it turned off in the Screen Options tab on your Menus admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Why can&#8217;t I modify certain fields for my Search Box menu item, e.g., css classes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: It is most likely that you have it turned off in the Screen Options tab on your Menus admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I&#8217;m experiencing conflicts between this plugin and my caching plugin, what should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Your caching plugin is likely being naughty by misusing WP Object Cache. Many of these plugins allow you to turn this on or off; I recommend off. However, you are also likely using an older version of this (BSBITFNM) plugin and you should update. Versions 1.3.1 and above no longer use WP Object Cache and should fix the conflict.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
