        "faq": "\n<h4>What are the &#8220;Current Date&#8221; classes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;Current Date&#8221; classes are a collection of classes dynamically created classes relevant to the date the reader lands<br />\non the site. These classes would include on December 1, 2012 at 5:00pm (GMT-5) the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>year-2012</li>\n<li>leap-year</li>\n<li>month-12</li>\n<li>month-dec</li>\n<li>month-december</li>\n<li>day-01</li>\n<li>day-sat</li>\n<li>day-saturday</li>\n<li>hour-22</li>\n<li>hour-10pm</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I activate the calendar extension?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Included with the package is the file named &#8216;bnsbc-calendar-sample.php&#8217;; simply rename this file to &#8216;bnsbc-calendar.php&#8217;, then edit it to add your own date-specific classes.</p>\n<p>As the specifically named file &#8216;bnsbc-calendar.php&#8217; is not included with the standard plugin package it should survive any automatic updates via the WordPress Administration Panels.<br />\nJust in case, it is recommended to keep a backup of your custom calendar in case it is lost from your site for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>This file should also be saved under /wp-content/bns-customs/ as the safest update location.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add a new class in the calendar extension?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After changing the sample file to &#8216;bnsbc-calendar.php&#8217; simple find the date you want to add the class to and amend that line.</p>\n<p>For example, to add a class for the Ides of March you would edit the March 15 entry and add an appropriate class such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>near line 138: if ( &#8217;15&#8217; == date( &#8216;d&#8217; ) ) { $dates .= &#8221;; } would change to if ( &#8217;15&#8217; == date( &#8216;d&#8217; ) ) { $dates .= &#8216; ides-of-march&#8217;; }</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NB: Remember to use &#8220;safe&#8221; characters for class names; and, add a single preceding space to eliminate the risk of classes running together.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
