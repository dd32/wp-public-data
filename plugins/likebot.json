        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>likebot.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>The LikeBot-button will automatically appear below your posts.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I add just the button to another area of my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the Theme Editor, you will place this line of code where you want the button to appear in your theme:<code>&lt;?php if( function_exists('LIKEBOT_BUTTON') ) { LIKEBOT_BUTTON(); } ?&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Keep in mind that manually inserted buttons wont be aligned left or right, though it will use the background-color and button-design option. Generally you should go with automagically-positioning if you&#8217;re not very familiar with working with php in theme-files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i change the appearance of the LikeBot-button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to change the customization plugin administration. Logon as an Administrative account and click &#8220;LikeBot Plugin&#8221; in the Plugins-menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i change the alignment of the button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, you can change the alignment under customization in the plugin administration.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve added nolikebot-tag to a post but the buttons keeps showing up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Be sure that you&#8217;ve added <code>&lt;!--nolikebot--&gt;</code> to the top of your post. Adding it further down could cause the LikeBot-button to appear regardless of the tag.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The buttons doesn&#8217;t show up and it says [LikeBot Error]?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the [LikeBot Error]-text and you will be take to a description of the problem.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
