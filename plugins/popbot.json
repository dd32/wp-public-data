Use Gutenberg to build on top of our specialised pop-up templates and our customisable triggers and conditions to perfectly target your users.</p>\n<h4>Fully Customisable Appearance</h4>\n<p>All out pop-ups are fully customisable, allowing you to choose from a range of mobile-friendly pop-up templates. Then you can build on top of them with the block editor, meaning PopBot supports a wide range of block plugins out of the box.</p>\n<h4>Target User Behaviour</h4>\n<p>With customisable triggers, you can ensure you pop-ups only show when the users is ready to convert. Use scroll depth, form submission, click events, time on site, and more to target your users when they\\&#8217;re primed to convert.</p>\n<h4>Focus using Conditions</h4>\n<p>Conditions allow you to focus your pop-ups to be specialised to specific users &amp; pages. PopBot supports a wide range of useful values you can target out of the box like URLs, devices, user journey and time. If that\\&#8217;s not enough, our powerful Custom Conditions system allows you to create any condition you can imagine. With PopBot, your pop-ups will always be relevant to each visitor.</p>\n<h4>Flexible Scheduling</h4>\n<p>You can set start &amp; end dates for your pop-up to become visible on your site and specify what users can see your PopBot. Hide your pop-up, make it visible to admins or visible to everyone.</p>\n<h4>Analytics Built-in</h4>\n<p>We automatically track how well your pop-ups are performing so you can make informed decisions on how you to push your conversion rate even further.</p>\n<h4>Intelligent Behaviour</h4>\n<p>Our pop-ups are intelligent and work together to ensure they&#8217;re not overwhelming the user. They&#8217;re limited to only show one pop-up at a time, and not too soon after one another. If a user dismisses or converts on a pop-up they won&#8217;t be shown it again.</p>\n",
