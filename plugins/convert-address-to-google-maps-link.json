It also converts any address in a “.address” class into a Google Map link that opens in a new window.</p>\n<p>NOTE: You need to put the address inside the <code>&lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt;</code> html tag or within an html element with the <code>.address</code> class for this plugin to work. For example, you would need to write the following into your code: <code>&lt;address&gt;3 Abbey Rd, London NW8 9AY, United Kingdom&lt;/address&gt;</code> OR <code>&lt;span class=“address”&gt;3 Abbey Rd, London NW8 9AY, United Kingdom&lt;/span&gt;</code> OR <code>&lt;div class=“address”&gt;3 Abbey Rd, London NW8 9AY, United Kingdom&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>\n<p>IFRAME LINKS:<br />\nIf you want to display the Google Map in an iframe, just use the <code>.address-iframe</code> class in your markup.  For example, <code>&lt;div class=“address-iframe”&gt;3 Abbey Rd, London NW8 9AY, United Kingdom&lt;/div&gt;</code>  (Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.mikedoesweb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mike Jasper</a> for this idea and code!)</p>\n<p>FYI: This plugin is great for themes with custom fields that supply the address, but is probably not too useful for themes that don’t, because you’ll need to enter the text view to add the appropriate html markup.  Thanks!</p>\n<p>Finally, many many thanks to <a href=\"http://www.mikedoesweb.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mike Jasper</a> , who wrote the javascript that powers this plugin.
