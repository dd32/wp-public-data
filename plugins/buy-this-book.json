        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>buy-this-book.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the Appearance -&gt; Widgets screen. You should now see a new widget called Buy This Book. Click and drag it over to your chosen sidebar, and it’ll open up automatically.</li>\n<li>Fill in the header. This is the widget title, and it’ll display above your books.</li>\n<li>Paste the cover image link into the appropriate box. Here’s where the size of the image becomes important – if you want to add just one book to your sidebar, make the image as wide as the sidebar and only use the first column. If you’re only adding two and you want them to sit side by side, you have to make sure the images are narrow enough to fit comfortably. If you find that your images are below each other instead of being side by side, and you don’t want this to happen, then reduce their size. Include an alt tag to describe your cover.</li>\n<li>Paste a link to your book’s page for each website into the appropriate boxes. Any you don’t use won’t show up.</li>\n<li>Save the widget. You’re done! Check your site and click on the cover images to see the menu slide out from the bottom.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>My covers are jumping around when I click on them and the menu slides out!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;re probably using cover images smaller than 100px wide. The menu is set in a box that&#8217;s 105px across, because the icons are stacked into two rows of three, and having it slide out makes everything jump around as the images try to accomodate the extra space.</p>\n<p>Add this line to your CSS:</p>\n<p>.buybook .box {  width: XXpx !important; }</p>\n<p>where XX = width of your image + 5.</p>\n<p>This should fix it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
