It uses a new technology, Self Sovereign Identity, or SSI, to perform the issuance and verification of credentials.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20on%20my%20production%20site%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin on my production site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can however it relies on a Proxy Server managed by Sideos GmbH. If you wish to create your own implementation of the service there is documentation on https://docs.sideos.io.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20submit%20my%20plugin%20feedback%3F'>\nWhere can I submit my plugin feedback?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feedback is encouraged and much appreciated, especially since this plugin is a small use case of waht SSI is capable of. If you have suggestions or requests for new features, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/sideos/wp-ssi-login\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">submit them as an issue in the Sideos GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
