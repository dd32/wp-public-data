When developing the Portfolio plugin, we took into consideration all the problems our customers may experience. One of the most important advantages is the speed, which will be provided through Lazy Loading and Thumbnail size options. Also, the Custom Attributes tab makes the WP Portfolio plugin flexible and provides more time for admin.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/portfolio-responsive-gallery\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PRO</a>|<a href=\"https://plugins.ays-demo.com/portfolio-responsive-gallery-pro-demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DEMO</a>|<a href=\"https://ays-pro.com/wordpress-portfolio-responsive-gallery-plugin-user-manual\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DOCUMENTATION</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Features available in Free Version</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited number of projects and images</li>\n<li>Project Attributes tab</li>\n<li>Project Description and Project URL options</li>\n<li>Global loading and Lazy loading features for the images</li>\n<li>Project grid view type</li>\n<li>Projects main image size option</li>\n<li>Lightbox image fit feature</li>\n<li>Project hover and Project thumbnail options</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-responsive-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">PRO</a> Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Includes ALL Free version Features</li>\n<li>Advanced Project Attributes functionality</li>\n<li>Project Audio feature</li>\n<li>Advanced animation types for opening the project images</li>\n<li>Animation types once the project image animates out of the view</li>\n<li>Animation speed feature</li>\n<li>Project sound</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget, in case of any problems or upcoming questions feel free to contact us via the following <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-responsive-gallery/\" rel=\"ugc\">FREE SUPPORT FORUM</a>.</p>\n",
