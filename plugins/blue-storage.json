You can also extract blue-storage.zip to the plugins<br />\ndirectory after uploading through SFTP or similar means.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin using the &#8220;Activate&#8221; option for Blue Storage in the plugins list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the Azure Portal go to your storage account settings, select &#8220;Access Keys&#8221;, and copy the &#8220;Storage Account Name&#8221; and one of the<br />\n&#8220;Access Keys&#8221; for use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy your account name and access key to the appropriate location on the plugin&#8217;s settings page and save.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Either create a new container or choose an existing public container for your files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional-Recommended!) Check the box that allows Blue Storage to manage all uploads to put them directly in Azure Storage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Do this before any uploads! Add in a CNAME if you are using Azure CDN or something else. See FAQ for more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Do this before any uploads! Set the caching max-age value for uploads. This is specified in seconds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(Optional) Use the &#8220;Copy To Azure&#8221; ability to copy all files not in Azure to your Azure Storage container.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>When I upload files to the media library it doesn&#8217;t go to Azure. What gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to enable the &#8220;Use Azure Storage for default upload&#8221; option.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the CNAME option?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We will use the example of using the Azure CDN service.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Specify a custom CNAME for your domain in the plugin settings, e.g. cdn.example.com.</li>\n<li>Point that CNAME at the endpoint for your Azure CDN in your DNS settings. For example, create the CNAME cdn.example.com to mycdn.azureedge.net</li>\n<li>Create a custom domain mapping in Azure to map mycdn.azureedge.net to cdn.example.com. This is important! If you do not do this you will break HTTPS.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I didn&#8217;t specify a CNAME at first, how can I change my files to use the CNAME?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will have to do a search and replace in the posts and postmeta tables of your database. This plugin does not do that for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I disable access to certain settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Just edit the blue-storage-config.php file and change true to false for any of the settings you want to disable access to.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting an error when trying to upload to my zone redundant storage</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not support &#8220;Zone Redundant&#8221; storage accounts at this time.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
