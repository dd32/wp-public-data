        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20amz%20watcher%20truly%20free%3F'>\nIs AMZ Watcher truly free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! AMZ Watcher is a freemium software provided to anyone looking to optimize their affiliate site. The free version includes broken links reports for some pages of your site. If you would like to get full reports, please upgrade.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20are%20my%20links%20checked%3F'>\nHow often are my links checked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AMZ Watcher gives you different options: you can pick how often you want your links checked. Currently it is possible to check your links from once every 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days. This setting will have an effect on how fast you are using up your page credits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20page%20credits%20work%3F'>\nHow do page credits work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Page credit system is something AMZ Watcher uses to measure your account usage. One page credit equals to AMZ Watcher going to a single page on your site or on Amazon.<br />\nEvery time AMZ Watcher does a site check, it does a full crawl of your site and then checks all the pages on Amazon you link out to.</p>\n<p>Consider this scenario:<br />\nYour site has 100 pages with 50 commercial(money) pages and 5 links to unique products on Amazon on average.<br />\nThis makes a total of 100 site pages + 250 unique Amazon product pages AMZ Watcher needs to check to do a full scan. These 350 pages are equal to 350 credits that are spent on a single crawl.<br />\nMonitoring this site once a week will cost you 1400 credits per month just for this site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20a%20daily%20page%20check%20limit%3F'>\nDo you have a daily page check limit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, we do not have a daily page check limit. Our tool works great with sites of all sizes, from 10 page niche sites to 20,000+ pages large authority sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20do%20you%20keep%20my%20data%3F'>\nHow long do you keep my data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Historical data is kept for one year.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20just%20want%20to%20use%20amz%20watcher%20once%20to%20find%20invalid%20links.%20is%20it%20possible%3F'>\nI just want to use AMZ Watcher once to find invalid links. Is it possible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You’re free to take a subscription just for one month and cancel your account when your work is done. Note, when cancelling your account, you will lose access to all your data until you re-subscribe again.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20amz%20watcher%20register%20clicks%20in%20my%20amazon%20associates%20dashboard%3F'>\nDoes AMZ Watcher register clicks in my Amazon Associates Dashboard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AMZ Watcher does not “click” any clicks, so the link checking we do is not registered in your amazon affiliate dashboard. We split any identifying information like affiliate id and link id from your links and this does not create clicks on amazon’s end.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20upgrade%20my%20plan%3F'>\nHow can I upgrade my plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Select the desired subscription plan from the Pricing page and follow the steps to upgrade. Depending on your current plan and its prepaid period, you’ll only pay the prorated amount in the first payment for the new plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20amz%20watcher%20compatible%20with%20wordpress%20multisite%3F'>\nIs AMZ Watcher compatible with WordPress multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AMZ Watcher is compatible with WordPress multisite, but it allows connection to only one website crawl reports at a time.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20support%20is%20provided%3F'>\nWhat support is provided?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Limited free support is provided, and we offer dedicated priority email and live chat support for our AMZ Watcher users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20out%20about%20the%20pricing%20of%20amz%20watcher%3F'>\nWhere can I find out about the pricing of AMZ Watcher?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Find out all relevant <a href=\"https://amzwatcher.com/pricing/?utm_campaign=AMZW_upgrade&amp;utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pricing information over on our official site</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
