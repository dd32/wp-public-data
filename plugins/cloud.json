        "description": "<p>WP Cloud allows you to build a cloud platform. With this plugin your users will have their personal space for hosting images or documents, and can easily access and share them.</p>\n<p>This plugin generates a folder under your second-level domain (ex. website.com/<strong>cloud</strong>) with one folder for each user (ex. mywebsite.com/**cloud/$user_id/***). Every user can store the file there via a front-end mask displayed using shortcodes, back-end dashboard or the exciting cloud panel found in website.com/cloud.</p>\n<h4>What is the cloud panel?</h4>\n<p>The Cloud Panel of WP Cloud can be accessed from website.com<strong>/cloud</strong> and give users the opportunity to log-in and manage their file via a friendly mask. For un-logged users, the log-in for will be shown and users can authenticate.</p>\n<p>Directly via the cloud panel, logged-in users can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>see files uploaded, and eventually delete</li>\n<li>see cloud space assigned</li>\n<li>see cloud space used (with percentage too)</li>\n<li>upload a new file</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Users quota</h4>\n<p>WP Cloud offers a standard user-quota of 10MB, that is applied by default to every member. You can change this value to give all the users the space you want.<br />\nThe quota for each user is stored in a meta-field for each profile with the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>null = default quota (the meta-field doesn&#8217;t exist)</li>\n<li>0 = hosting not allowed</li>\n<li>any other number = n MB hosting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that the user-quota only applies when the user uploads a file. If a user has 90 of 100MB used and you downgrade it to 10MB, files are kept but won&#8217;t be able to upload files.<br />\nThere is also an <strong>overload-quota</strong> (default 10%) in percentage that can be set in the settings panel. It works as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>9 of 10 MB used. Overload 10%. File to upload: 2MB. -&gt; YES</li>\n<li>9 of 10 MB used. Overload 0%. File to upload: 2MB. -&gt; NO</li>\n<li>10 of 10MB used. Overload 10%. File to upload: 1MB. -&gt; NO</li>\n<li>9.99 of 10MB used. Overload 10%. File to upload: 1MB. -&gt; YES</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Shortcodes</h4>\n<p>In addition you can create custom pages in your website using the following shortcodes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[cloud]</strong> prints a list of files for the current user</li>\n<li><strong>[cloud_show id=&#8221;0&#8243;]</strong> prints a list of files of given user id</li>\n<li><strong>[cloud_upload]</strong> prints a simple upload form that allows the current user to upload a file in his/her directory</li>\n<li><strong>[cloud_send]</strong> prints a simple upload form that allows the current user to upload a file to another user directory by specifying login_name or email</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>The plugin is in English and actually doesn&#8217;t have support for translations. In some days it will, with italian translation included.</p>\n<h4>Roadmap</h4>\n<p>The plugin is new, and there are some ideas that need some other work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assign quota based on user role</li>\n<li>Assign different quota for each user</li>\n<li>Share files with other members</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ideas?</h4>\n<p>If you think that this plugin could be improved, please let me know.<br />\nhttps://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cloud</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>= thank you =</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
