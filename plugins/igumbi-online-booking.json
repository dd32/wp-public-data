        "installation": "<ul>\n<li>Download the plugin, add it to your blog in the plugin folder and activate it.</li>\n<li>Go to the WordPress settings page (igumbi online bookings) and fill out the details. Get the &#8216;Hotel code&#8217; from the <a href=\"https://www.igumbi.net/settings/mine\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hotel settings page in igumbi</a>.</li>\n<li>Add to any page, post, or as a sidebar widget. Integrate with shortcodes [igumbi_dialog] and [igumbi_avform] into your site template. [igumbi_dialog] needs to be placed into your template/page where you want the response of the booking system. You can get all fancy with [igumbi_avform wide=true lang=es] to handle different layouts and languages from within your template.</li>\n<li>Tweak and overwrite the CSS to match the look of your template via the igumbi backend or the custom CSS field in the settings page in the WordPress backend.</li>\n</ul>\n",

To manage your rates, availability and reservations you will use the igumbi backend.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20plugin%20handle%20payments%20after%20accepting%20the%20reservation%3F'>\nCan the plugin handle payments after accepting the reservation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it can. If you have a stripe.com account stripe can be set as the payment processor. There are three modes: Charge the whole amount at the time of booking or charge a deposit which can be specified as a percentage of the total amount. You can also just get the card to secure the booking, you can manually charge it later</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20style%20of%20the%20booking%20tool%20to%20be%20in%20line%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nHow can I style of the booking tool to be in line with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can overwrite the CSS of the booking tool via the igumbi backend (recommended) or via the WordPress settings page (easier for a designer that maintains to WordPress Installation for a property)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20languages%20do%20you%20support%3F'>\nWhich languages do you support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The online booking tool is available in German, German Du (Duzen), English, Greek, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Dutch, Czech, Japense and Polish.</p>\n<p>Bear in Mind that you will need to translate the product names and descriptions and the productcategory descriptions for all the languages you want to support via the igumbi backend [Hotel data &gt; Translations]. If you require other languages, we can integrate them if you are willing to help with the translation: there are around 100 words/phrases in the booking tool. We support UTF-8, so Asian languages should not be a problem.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20booking%20tool%20uses%20javascript%2C%20what%20if%20there%20are%20conflicts%20%28typically%20image%20gallery%29%3F'>\nThe booking tool uses Javascript, what if there are conflicts (typically image gallery)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The booking tool uses jQuery but has the &#8220;$&#8221; function  mapped to the &#8220;$igu&#8221; function. This is the one we use for the Javascript calls. We have tested extensively with other sites and javascript libraries. However the web is vast: if you do encounter an issue, we are very eager to fix it. Please <a href=\"https://www.igumbi.com/de/kontakt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">let us know it</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
