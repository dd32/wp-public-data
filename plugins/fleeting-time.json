Some time you write a number of technical articles or software use tutorial, may have been a long time technology has changed, you can also use this plugin to mark what has been changed. Because it is the first time to write a WordPress plugin, even I has a long experience in using wordpress, but I still not very familiar with WordPress plugin API, and also don&#8217;t know how to make this thing have much practical significance. If you have any comments, or there is a need for the needs of WordPress plugin development, all can email to me @im@andy-cheung.me, thanks!</p>\n",
