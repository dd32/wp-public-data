This can be particularly useful when you use WordPress as your primary platform<br />\nhowever use other systems such as a forum or eCommerce solution which would require the user to create another<br />\naccount before being able to use that system. You could also use this plugin to interface with third party email<br />\nmarketing systems, utilizing a custom script to send your own welcome messages, initiating custom sessions, or<br />\ntriggering external functions.</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 is now enabled to work with BuddyPress sites allowing you to maintain the same functionality. Upon enabling<br />\nthe plugin, there will be a new set of options within the plugin administration panel allowing you to choose which<br />\nfields are transmitted to the Transaction URL once a user completes the BuddyPress controlled registration page.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 introduced one new feature and an enhancement to an existing feature. The amount of delay that was<br />\npreviously experienced while waiting for the call to the Transaction URL was optimized to only add an<br />\nadditional second or two to the overall load time. As for new features, on BuddyPress installations the profile<br />\nfields are also passed along. However, because of the dynamic nature of these fields there is not a<br />\nfeasible way to assign new names to them as they pass so they will maintain their original form names (i.e &#8211;<br />\nfield_1, field_2, etc&#8230; going down as an ordered list).</p>\n<p>Version 1.2 further optimizes the methods by which the Transaction URL is called and respective form data passed.<br />\nBecause the plugin uses a POST method, the receiving server should be expecting a POST as well. A later version<br />\nis planned to allow for the selection of either a GET or POST transaction. This version also confirms the ability<br />\nto work with the infamous MailChimp mailing system. For details regarding how to integrate with your MailChimp<br />\nlist, please refer to http://www.gkauten.com/cross-registration-integration-meets-mailchimp.</p>\n<p>If you find this plugin useful, please donate. Donations help pay for the massive amount of energy drinks<br />\nI consume and music I purchase on iTunes to keep the creative process going. It is also a good way of showing<br />\nsupport for my work which allows me to continue supporting and improving this plugin as WordPress continues<br />\nto evolve as one of the best known software systems out there.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Ewart at <a href=\"http://www.onesportevent.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OneSportEvent.com</a> for the inspiration.</p>\n",

If you wish to turn off the plugin temporarily, simply remove<br />\nthe link you have entered into the Transaction URL field.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with other plugins that modify my registration form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At this time it is hard to say what effect this plugin has on other plugins, or vice versa.
