Our plugin offers a sophisticated solution to the limitations of the default number-based revision system, which can quickly become inadequate for active sites. Instead of restricting revisions to a set count, our plugin allows you to specify a timeframe for keeping revisions, such as 30, 60, or 365 days, ensuring that your database retains only what&#8217;s necessary without losing the essential edit history of your posts.</p>\n<p>In addition, our plugin enhances the admin dashboard with an analytics feature that relies on Google&#8217;s Chart API to generate visual representations of revision history data.</p>\n<p>Please note: The dashboard analytics feature of this plugin relies on a third-party service (Google&#8217;s Chart API). For more information about this service, please visit the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Chart Tools</a> documentation. You can review the terms of service <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chart/terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Key Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intelligent Age-Based Management</strong>: Preserve your site&#8217;s history by automatically deleting revisions past a certain age, keeping only the recent and relevant changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless On-Save Cleanup</strong>: The plugin intuitively removes outdated revisions upon saving posts, based on the age criteria you&#8217;ve set, without disrupting the creative process.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional Automated Cleanup</strong>: Enable the optional CRON job to perform regular, site-wide revision cleanups at intervals you control, maintaining optimal database health with no manual effort.</li>\n<li><strong>Dashboard Analytics</strong>: Visualize your site&#8217;s revision cleanup activity with an integrated chart, powered by Google&#8217;s Chart API.</li>\n<li><strong>Fully Customizable</strong>: Configure the plugin&#8217;s settings to fit the unique demands of your site, including save timeout, CRON frequency, and the maximum number of revisions to process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By focusing on time rather than revision count, our plugin addresses the core flaw in the default system, ensuring that a busy day of editing won&#8217;t result in the loss of important historical data. With the optional CRON job for hands-free maintenance, adjustable settings for precision control, and insightful analytics, the Time-based Revision Cleanup plugin is an essential tool for maintaining a healthy, efficient WordPress site.</p>\n",
