Check your PHP error log to see if there are any errors and correct them. The most common problems are script timeout or running out of memory. Change your PHP.ini file and increase the script timeout and/or amount of memory used by PHP process. You can view the current values of these settings from the system info page which can be accessed by going to Bulk WP -&gt; System Info.</p>\n<p>In particular try to change the following settings</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>max_execution_time = 600</code> &#8211; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds</li>\n<li><code>max_input_time = 30</code> &#8211; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data</li>\n<li><code>memory_limit = 256M</code> &#8211; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also try to disable different sections of the Plugin, if you have huge number of posts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20what%20are%20the%20current%20values%20for%20these%20options%20configured%20in%20my%20server%3F'>\nHow do I know what are the current values for these options configured in my server?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Access the System Info page using the menu Bulk WP -&gt; System Info.

But if you choose &#8220;Delete permanently&#8221;, then it is not possible to retrieve the posts.
