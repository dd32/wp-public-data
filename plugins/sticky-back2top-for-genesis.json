        "faq": "\n<h4>Q: Why is the sticky arrow hidden by my widgets or other page content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The CSS z-index of the sticky arrow is set to 9999, so it should sit on top of everything. If it doesn&#8217;t, it could be that your widget or other content has a z-index of 9999 also &#8211; in that case, set it to 9998 or less.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Does this work if I&#8217;m using a Genesis theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: YES! Not only does it work, but the loading of the sticky arrow is specifically optimized for the Genesis hooks and initialization if you are using a Genesis child theme, meaning faster load times.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I&#8217;ve heard of Genesis before, and it sounds cool &#8211; where can I find it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: If you&#8217;re interested, you can find out more about Genesis and StudioPress here: http://goo.gl/hE5B7F<br />\nEven if you already have Genesis, I would highly recommend the Minimum Pro theme &#8211; I use it for nearly all my clients because of its flexibility.<br />\nYou can find it here:  http://goo.gl/Qsy1xn</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I don&#8217;t have time to mess around with stuff like that, can I just hire you to make a nice site for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Of course! You can either email me directly at michael@43folderstech.net or visit my website and portfolio at http://43folderstech.net Thanks!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I&#8217;ve already got Genesis, don&#8217;t need to hire you for anything, but I do stil want to show some appreciation for doing this. What do you suggest?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Can I tell you I love you?  Not in a romantic or creepy way (OK, if I&#8217;m completely honest here maybe a little creepy), but I do. Here&#8217;s where you can buy me a coffee, or lunch or something:  http://paypal.me/43folders</p>\n</p>\n\n",
