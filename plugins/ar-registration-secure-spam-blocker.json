This plugin helps to resolve this issue.  It allows your to create a custom question and answer on the registration page of a wordpress site that only the users in your demographic can answer.  An example (and the reason I created this plugin) is a school track website.  I would get up to 3 to 5 bogus registrations a day.  I added this plugin with the question &#8220;What city is your school in?&#8221; and that number went to 0.  Someone in another area is not going to know this question, however anyone who would/should be registering would defintely know the answer.  This plugin will not work for everyone but it certainly was a perfect fit for me and I know it will help others too.</p>\n",
