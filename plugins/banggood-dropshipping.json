Go to &#8220;Bng2Woo Lite &gt; Search Products&#8221; page and click on the Search button. if you want to search for products from a specific Banggood&#8217;s category, choose the desired category from drop-down selection. Once search results appear, pick items you want to add to your Import List.</p>\n<p>2) Using our free extension for Chrome browser. The extension can pull products from selected categories or deals pages on Banggood. Also, if you want to import a specific product only, you can use Banggood product ID or Banggood product URL to do that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Import from single product page</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Import from category page</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Import from deals page</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bulk Import feature from category or deals page</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#9658; <strong>Choose images which should be published with the product</strong>:</p>\n<p>When you import the products into your store, they are added to the Import List. There you can edit their data before making them published in your store. In the import list you can manage product images and choose what images should be published together with the product.</p>\n<p>&#9658; <strong>Configure settings for all imported products</strong>:</p>\n<p>This is a set of settings that applies to all products imported from Banggood portal. Go to &#8220;Bng2Woo Lite &gt; Settings &gt; Common Settings &gt; Import Settings&#8221;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Currently the Banggood API provides data in english language only. However, they want to add more languages in the next API updates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Currency</strong>: Change the currency of products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Default product type</strong>: By default our tool imports product as &#8220;Simple/Variable product&#8221;. In this case, shoppers will stay on your website when they make a purchase else choose the &#8220;External/Affiliate Product&#8221; option and your visitors will be redirected to the Banggood website to finish the purchase.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Default product status</strong>: Choose the &#8220;Draft&#8221; option and imported products will not be visible on your website frontend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Not import description</strong>: Enable this feature if you don&#8217;t want to import product description.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use external image urls</strong>: By default, the plugin keeps product images on your server. If you want to save a free space on your server, activate this option and the plugin will load images using the external Banggood&#8217;s URLs. Please note: This feature works if the plugin is active only, by default WordPress can&#8217;t work with the external images paths!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Import in the background</strong>: Enable this feature and allow the plugin to import products in a background mode. In this case, each product is loaded in several stages. First, the plugin imports main product data such as: title, description, and attributes, and in the second stage, it imports product images and variants. This feature speeds up the import process extremely. Please note: In the first stage a product is published with the “draft” status and then when all product data is loaded the product status is changed to “published”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Convert case of attributes and their values</strong>: Products may come with different text case of attributes and their values. Enbale this feature to covert all texts to the same case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Set default stock value</strong>: By default the plugin imports the original stock level value. Some sellers on Banggood don&#8217;t set stock value. To solve the issue we added this feature where you can set the default stock value for such products, for example: 1</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use random stock value</strong>: This feature has a similar behaviour to previous option, but it forces the plugin to generate stock level value automatically and choose it from a predefined range.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#9658; <strong>Set up global pricing rules for all products</strong>:</p>\n<p>These options allow you to set own markup over Banggood prices. You can add separate markup formula for each pricing range. The formula is a rule of a price calculation that includes different math operators such as +, *, =. Pricing rules support three different modes that manage the calculation in your formulas. Additionally, you can add cents to your prices automatically. And even more, it&#8217;s easy to apply your pricing rules to already imported products.</p>\n<p>Go to &#8220;Bng2Woo Lite &gt; Settings &gt; Pricing Rules&#8221; and add your pricing rules.</p>\n<p>Please note: the Banggood API method gives infromation about product sale pice only. Currently it&#8217;s not possible to get the regulat price via API.</p>\n<p>&#9658; <strong>Filter or delete unnecessary text from Banggood product</strong>:</p>\n<p>Here you can filter all unwanted phrases and text from the imported product. It allows adding unlimited rules to filter the texts. These rules apply to the product title and description. Please note the plugin checks your text in case-sensitive mode.</p>\n<p>Go to &#8220;Bng2Woo Lite &gt; Settings &gt; Phrase Filtering&#8221; and create a few rules that will be applied to the imported data.</p>\n<h3>PRO VERSION</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>All features from the free version</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>6 months of Premium support and updates</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#9658; <strong>Earn more with Banggood Affiliate program:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>[pro version feature]</strong> You can connect your store to the Banggood Affiliate program using your Admitad account.
