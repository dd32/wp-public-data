        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow do I register multiple new featured images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the handy filter to add multiple featured images.</p>\n<p>For expample, this code adds two additional featured images to pages and one additional featured image to posts:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'kdmfi_featured_images', function( $featured_images ) {\n  // Add featured-image-2 to pages and posts\n  $args_1 = array(\n    'id' =&gt; 'featured-image-2',\n    'desc' =&gt; 'Your description here.',\n    'label_name' =&gt; 'Featured Image 2',\n    'label_set' =&gt; 'Set featured image 2',\n    'label_remove' =&gt; 'Remove featured image 2',\n    'label_use' =&gt; 'Set featured image 2',\n    'post_type' =&gt; array( 'page', 'post' ),\n  );\n\n  // Add featured-image-2 to pages only\n  $args_2 = array(\n    'id' =&gt; 'featured-image-3',\n    'desc' =&gt; 'Your description here.',\n    'label_name' =&gt; 'Featured Image 3',\n    'label_set' =&gt; 'Set featured image 3',\n    'label_remove' =&gt; 'Remove featured image 3',\n    'label_use' =&gt; 'Set featured image 3',\n    'post_type' =&gt; array( 'page' ),\n  );\n\n  // Add the featured images to the array, so that you are not overwriting images that maybe are created in other filter calls\n  $featured_images[] = $args_1;\n  $featured_images[] = $args_2;\n\n  // Important! Return all featured images\n  return $featured_images;\n});\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I register additional featured images for WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The post type of WooCommerce products is &#8220;procut&#8221;. So you are able to define multiple featured images as seen above, just add &#8220;product&#8221; to &#8220;post_type&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you want to add a detail image to WooCommerce products. Then this code is for you:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'kdmfi_featured_images', function( $featured_images ) {\n    $args = array(\n            'id' =&gt; 'product-image-detail',\n            'desc' =&gt; 'The detail image of the product.',\n            'label_name' =&gt; 'Product detail image',\n            'label_set' =&gt; 'Set product detail image',\n            'label_remove' =&gt; 'Remove product detail image',\n            'label_use' =&gt; 'Set product detail image',\n            'post_type' =&gt; array( 'product' ),\n    );\n\n    $featured_images[] = $args;\n\n    return $featured_images;\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you are able to display the image via shortcode, widget or by including a display function (seen below) in your WooCommerce theme files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I display the featured image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use one of the functions for retrieving the image. E.g. kdmfi_the_featured_image( &#8216;featured-image-2&#8217;, &#8216;full&#8217;); or use the new widget &#8220;Multiple featured images&#8221; or the new shortcode!<br />\nThe widget can be found under Appearance -&gt; Widgets.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I use the shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shortcode usage:</p>\n<p>[kdmfi_featured_image id=&#8221;featured-image-2&#8243; size=&#8221;full&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Possible attributes for the shortcode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>id: the id of the featured image, e.g. featured-image-2, <strong>requried</strong></li>\n<li>size: the desired size, defaults to &#8220;full&#8221;</li>\n<li>post_id: the ID of the post to which the featured image is assigned, defaults to the current ID</li>\n<li>class: the classes for the image tag, defaults to &#8220;kdmfi-featured-image&#8221;</li>\n<li>alt: the alt attribute for the image tag, defaults to the title of the used image</li>\n<li>title: the title attribute for the image tag, empty by default</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Filter</strong></p>\n<p>If you need to change the image tag created by the shortcode, please use the filter &#8220;kdmfi_shortcode_html&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example use:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'kdmfi_shortcode_html', function( $html, $shortcode_atts, $post_id) {\n\n  // do something\n\n  return $html;\n}, 10, 3);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The filter callback gets the image tag html, the used shortcode attributes and the ID of the post where the shortcode is used.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I use a different size of the featured image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply add the size to the function call:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_the_featured_image( 'featured-image-2', 'full' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can choose every size that WordPress knows.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I get the ID of the featured image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With this function call you can get the ID:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_get_featured_image_id( 'featured-image-2' );\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Note:</em> Since a featured image has only one individual id, there is no option &#8216;size&#8217; in this function call.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I get the URL of the featured image?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With this function call you can get the URL:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_get_featured_image_src( 'featured-image-2', 'full' );\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhich functions do exist?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you need the ID only, use this function:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_get_featured_image_id( $image_id, $post_id );\n</code></pre>\n<p>$post_id is optional, if you leave it out, the ID of the calling post is used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To get the URL of the image:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_get_featured_image_src( $image_id, $size, $post_id );\n</code></pre>\n<p>$post_id is optional (see above); $size is optional and defaults to &#8216;full&#8217;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To get the featured image in HTML as a string:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_get_the_featured_image( $image_id, $size, $post_id );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, $size and $post_id are optional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To display the featured image directly:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_the_featured_image( $image_id, $size, $post_id );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, $size and $post_id are optional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To check if the post has a featured image:</p>\n<pre><code>kdmfi_has_featured_image( $image_id, $post_id );\n</code></pre>\n<p>$post_id is optional.
