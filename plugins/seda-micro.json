This will be replaced by the upload form.</li>\n<li>You will need to distribute the URL of these pages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Step 5:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users can use the app or a web browser to upload audio files (and image or videos if web server permits)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The WP/Drupal should also be configured to accept the types.
