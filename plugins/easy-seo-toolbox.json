        "description": "<p>Are you looking for an easy way to analyze your wordpress site in order to avoid common SEO pitfalls? No need to hire a SEO specialist, with Easy SEO Toolbox the work is done for you by simply running our specialized scanning tools. Our plugin checks through the pages on your site for different types of SEO errors and misconfigurations. These scans will enable you identify the appropriate changes needed for your site and correct many common mistakes wordpress owners make.</p>\n<p><strong>Keyword density</strong><br />\n    Writing good content is key for ranking pages on search engines, but are your pages focusing on the right keywords? Do you have too many keywords stuffed into one page? Maybe your pages are unfocused and need more keyword density. The keyword density tool will reveal both.</p>\n<p><strong>Broken link validation</strong><br />\n    The best way to look like you don&#8217;t know what you are doing is to have broken links on your site. Maybe a typo or perhaps you removed a page or content but forgot where you were previously linking to it. This tool will scan every link on your site to validate it is working.</p>\n<p><strong>Internal link counter</strong><br />\n    Determining spammy looking pages, loosing page rank, and lowering the quality of pages on your site. The internal link counter will keep you up to date with pages with too many outbound links.</p>\n<p><strong>alt tags on images</strong><br />\n    Images need good SEO too. The alt tag on images throughout your site helps search engines determine content on your site. This toll will give you a list of images on your site that are missing the alt tag completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Missing title and desc</strong><br />\n    One of the most important aspects of a website often overlooked or forgotten is basic title and descriptions for every content page.  If your site has any missing title or meta descriptions this tool will dig and find them all.</p>\n<p><strong>Noindex and blocked pages</strong><br />\n    One sure way to sabotage your own site is to accidentally block a search engine from viewing a page, or stop them from indexing it at all. This tool will make sure all your content is live and index able to all search engines.</p>\n<p><strong>Robots.txt generator</strong><br />\n    Search engines are not perfect and can sometimes improperly scan your site. Or maybe there is a non content folder on your site that you should block from search. Our robots.txt generator is a simple tool that can generate the robots.txt file ever website should have.</p>\n<p><strong>Sitemap generator</strong><br />\n    Creating a sitemap is the perfect way to tell every search engine which pages on your site are important. The formatting and creation of these sitemaps can be confusing. We take out the stress and create them for you.</p>\n<p><strong>https scanner</strong><br />\n    Security and user confidence is number 1 these days. You paid for a SSL but is it working properly? Are you sure? This tool will scan and give you the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Thin content scanner</strong><br />\n    Your site is always evolving, you are always creating content, but is it enough? Creating pages with low or poor level of content will be hard to rank. This tool can point out where your content is weak.</p>\n<h3>Dashboard Video Tutorial</h3>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uz5JDBiJKzE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Installation Via WordPress.org</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8217;</li>\n<li>Search for &#8216;easy seo toolbox&#8217;</li>\n<li>Activate Easy Seo Toolbox from your &#8216;Plugins&#8217; page.</li>\n<li>You will see Easy Seo Toolbox in your menu, begin to run the scans and tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Manual Installation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Download from our <a href=\"http://easyseotoolbox.com/\" title=\"Easy SEO Toolbox Website\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Easy SEO Toolbox Website</a></li>\n<li>Copy the easy-seo-toolbox folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from your wordpress admin and begin to run the scans and tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>More Information</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Our Official <a href=\"http://easyseotoolbox.com/\" title=\"Easy SEO Toolbox Website\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Easy SEO Toolbox Website</a></li>\n<li>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/easyseotoolbox\" title=\"Easy SEO Toolbox Twitter\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">twitter</a></li>\n<li>Our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ivEHAzi35bxmYUFcLPILw\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Youtube Channel</a></li>\n</ul>\n"
