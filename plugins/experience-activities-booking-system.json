        "description": "<p>Are you offering authentic activities or experiences for visitors or local audiences? Looking for a simple way to make your activities instantly available to book online? Experience &amp; Activities Booking System by uppliv allows you connect your WordPress installation with your uppliv.com account. Add pages for your activities, experiences and courses which you have created on uppliv.com with an online booking calendar to your WordPress site within just a few minutes. The plug-in also features a shopping cart with a validity of 30 days, which allows your customers to retrieve the shopping cart again after having left the site – just like they would on Amazon. Once a customer checks out their activity order, uppliv will manage all the email communication (order confirmation, order updates, pre-arrival emails, etc.) for you and your customers. Your uppliv WordPress plug-in token connects your site to your <a href=\"https://cms.uppliv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">uppliv account</a> and pulls in all of your activity information, including availability, price categories and seasonality, cancellation policy and much more.</p>\n<p>Experience &amp; Activities Booking System by uppliv is based on the uppliv Cloud Activity Platform. By making use of this platform you acknowledge that data and images are stored remotely. The reason for data and images being stored remotely is that the uppliv Cloud Activity Platform is a solution both for direct sales and indirect sales.
