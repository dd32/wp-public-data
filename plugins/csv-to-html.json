        "description": "<p>CSV to html is a highly configurable plugin that makes it easy to fetch content from file(s) (.csv,.xlsx, .json and .ods) and put content from that file/those files and display the html(table) on a page with a single shortcode. If using more then one file, content from all files are mixed into one single table instead of creating two tables.</p>\n<p>The plugin fetches the actual content directly from the file(s) without having to import/export any file(s) manually. So any changes in the file(s) will be updated when you view your table(s). CSV to HTML is able to fetch both local and external files.</p>\n<p>Get started with the plugin by moving on to the Installation tab. There&#8217;s a 4 step guide how you could start using the plugin. Good luck!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<p>Look at inspirational examples of what you can do with the plugin here: <a href=\"http://wibergsweb.se/plugins/csvtohtml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://wibergsweb.se/plugins/csvtohtml/</a></p>\n<p>But <strong>FIRST</strong>, go through below steps!</p>\n<p><strong>STEP1 &#8211; INSTALLATION</strong><br />\n1. Upload the plugin folder csvtohtml to the `/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.<br />\n2. Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</p>\n<p><strong>STEP2 &#8211; PREPARATION</strong><br />\nThe plugin can either fetch files locally from your server (or from an external resource). The plugin supports csv-files, Excel(xlsx-files only), ods-files (spreadsheet) and json-files. If using a json-file then you should set source type to JSON. In most cases the source type should be set to guess if not using JSON.</p>\n<h4>Local fetch</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a folder called csvtohtmlfiles in your wp-content/uploads/ manually (e.g. wp-content/uploads/csvtohtmlfiles should be created)</li>\n<li>Upload/copy your file to this created folder (e.g. wp-content/uploads/csvtohtmlfiles/testfile.csv). This <strong>cannot</strong>be done from media-upload (Use ftp, ssh or directly on your os to copy files to the webserver).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>External fetch</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Have an uri to your csv-file available/accessible from your computer (eg. https://[domain]/testfile.csv).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP3 &#8211; SHORTCODE GENERATOR</strong><br />\n1. Begin to understand what you are able to to do with the plugin. Do this by playing around with the CSV to HTML shortcode generator. This is accessible in the admin dashboard &#8211; Tools/CSV to HTML. Do this on a desktop computer for easiest management.<br />\n2. Try and click/modify settings and see the preview of the table to the right. This preview only shows how it would look like, but functionality such as search and pagination etc isn&#8217;t going to work.<br />\n3. If you want to see the current output based on applied settings, then you should click the update/preview &#8211; button.<br />\n4. Settings are splitted into different sections in the shortcode generator page.<br />\n5. The section &quot;Debugging&quot; shows known errors and gives warnings depending on your settings. It turns into red when there are any errors or warnings. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it won&#8217;t work but can be an indicator of somethings you must adjust.<br />\n6. You should see the &quot;General&quot; section as a starting point for your settings. By default all csv files that exists in wp-content/uploads are used to generate a table (*.csv).<br />\n7. Change *.csv to the name of the file you prepared in STEP2.</p>\n<h4>Local fetch</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set Path(local)</strong> to csvtohtmlfiles or click on the button with three dots and select csvtohtmlfiles (if you have done previous steps you should see your folder csvtohtmlfiles here). <strong>In File(s) combined to this table</strong> type the file that you put into wp-content/uploads/csvtohtmlfiles</li>\n<li>If an Excel-file is selected for fetch, then it is converted to a csv-file and the Excel-file remains intact (so there are two files that has identical data in the same folder). This may seem redudantant, but this is because the plugin fetches data from the csv-file and not from the Excel-file directly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>External fetch</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>In File(s) combined to this table</strong> put in your url that you prepared in STEP2. If your external file is a google spreadsheet, make sure it&#8217;s publicy available for download and that you have the full uri to your googlesheets workbook. Also set &quot;add extension automatically&quot; to no.</li>\n<li>If you have more files you want to combine, then just add a semicolon (;) and add filename (local or external)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP4 &#8211; MAKE IT WORK</strong><br />\n10. Play around with settings until you&#8217;re satisfied. In very few cases you should change character encodings but if you&#8217;re having issues with encoding, you could try and change these settings.<br />\n11. Copy generated shortcode (above General section) and put the shortcode in a wordpress page or post to display table with the functionality you have set in the shortcode generator page.<br />\n12. If you don&#8217;t like the default design of the table(s), use your theme&#8217;s css to change the layout of your site/table etc.</p>\n<p>If having issues that you cannot solve please send a mail to info@wibergsweb.se.<br />\nIf you like the plugin, please consider donating. Please donate to paypal info@wibergsweb.se. Amount does not matter. I like coffee! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><strong>SHORTCODE</strong><br />\nIf you feel comfortable by modifying settings directly in your shortcode: Down below are settings available and what they are intended for. Value within parenthesis show the default value for the setting, so if that setting/attribute is not included in the shortcode, the default value for the setting will be applied.<br />\nThe shortcode should always start with <em>[csvtohtml_create</em> followed by <em>settings/attributes</em> below. Every setting must have a space between and <em>]</em> must be set at the end of the shortcode.</p>\n<p>Another option is to go into the shortcode generator again and repeat previous steps (from STEP2).</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20your%20tables%20responsive%3F'>\nIs your tables responsive?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is yes. From v1.60 the tables are responsive as default. If you want more advanced responsivity you have to modify css yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20don%27t%20you%20include%20any%20css%20for%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy don&#8217;t you include any css for the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>From v1.60 there are som basic css to make responsive table. It&#8217;s possible to turn this css off if having issue though.<br />\nThe goal is to make the plugin work as fast as possible as expected. By not supplying a lot of css the developer has full control over the design. If you know css, it&#8217;s easy to apply your style on all tables / invidual tables etc. From version 1.6 there are also some templates to use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20plugin%20totally%20free%3F'>\nIs the plugin totally free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is. If you feel bad about using this plugin for free, please write a review and/or give a donation to PayPal info@wibergsweb.se.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20premium%2Fpro%20version%20of%20the%20plugin%20available%3F'>\nIs there a premium/pro version of the plugin available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No there&#8217;s no need. This plugin offers a lot totally free. The plugin&#8217;s existence depends on donations only.If you like the plugin, please consider donating. Please donate to paypal info@wibergsweb.se.

Now a given shortcode (shortest possible) is given for testing.</p>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<p>Removed warning issue of editable file (when not using editing)</p>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<p>Bugfix &#8211; Also at resetting &#8211; show table correctly again</p>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<p>Bugfix &#8211; important update for them who uses search functionality! Displaying correctly after search now.</p>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<p>Editable values in local csv-file(s) directly in the browser. This makes it smooth to update csv-file(s) without using any other texteditor.<br />\nFaster loading of csv-files</p>\n<h4>1.2.88</h4>\n<p>Possible to add percentage value for a specific column and show that both above and below table. Some improvements regarding to debug-functionality.</p>\n<h4>1.2.80</h4>\n<p>Characters are now ignored at calculation (e.g. â‚¬56 will turn into 56 and 24â‚¬ will turn into 24. These numeric values will be used for the actual calculation of the column)</p>\n<h4>1.2.79</h4>\n<p>IMPORTANT! Totals not showing correctly before.

Bugfix: First two columns should not be duplicated now</p>\n<h4>1.2.70</h4>\n<p>Possible to save tables temporarily and update from source once,hourly, daily or weekly (If set to once, it only retrieves data from source once and then always fetches from file on server). It would make most sense to use this together with external files.<br />\nNew source_type json added (It&#8217;s now possible to fetch json content from file(s))<br />\nAnother way of fetching jsondata is added because of some issues with cloudflare and wp_remote_get()<br />\nAdded some checks to make debugging even easier</p>\n<h4>1.2.64</h4>\n<p>Important update! Bugfix: Pagination will work together will filter_operator equalsurl.</p>\n<h4>1.2.63</h4>\n<p>A new operator is added for filter_operator and it is called equalsurl. When fetching data from url, spaces often becomes hyphens(-) or underscores(_) and this setting solves this by seaching for all necessary combinations (with spaces between words, with hyphens and with underscores). Filter is applied in a case insensitive manner. If filter_data_ucfirst is set to yes, the filter_operater overrides this value.</p>\n<h4>1.2.62</h4>\n<p>Filter data can now be set by part of url (e.g. domain/part1/part2/part3). The use of %urlparts-X% makes this possible where X indicates level in path hiearchy (1,2 or 3). If X is set to &quot;last&quot; it would be automatically fetch last level (part3).<br />\nFilter data&#8217;s first letter could be automatically set to upper case (Useful in combination with %urlparts-X%)</p>\n<h4>1.2.60</h4>\n<p>It is now possible to export a csv-file when clicking on a button under the table. The download process does not require any temporary file creations.</p>\n<h4>1.2.58</h4>\n<p>Possible to use %userlogin% for creating a dynamic path based on loggedin user, e.g. users/%userlogin%.</p>\n<h4>1.2.57</h4>\n<p>Ignore error when using Premium version (&gt;0.96) in combination with &quot;Gutenburg&quot;.</p>\n<h4>1.2.56</h4>\n<p>Ignore error when entering incorrect values for table in cell columns</p>\n<h4>1.2.55</h4>\n<p>Bugfixes: Some warnings are ignored when including files when not are avaialable, when using incorrect encoding etc<br />\nCompability fix for CSV to HTML Premium (Premium is only in beta stage for now)</p>\n<h4>1.2.53</h4>\n<p>Bugfix: Include last row when fetching external files when using source_type guess<br />\nDebugging-class improved for translation/internationalisation<br />\nMore hints what could be going wrong when debugging</p>\n<h4>1.2.5</h4>\n<p>It&#8217;s now possible to easily add a totals row under the bottom of a table and tell which columns that should be included<br />\nYou can also add a custom title to show , e.g. TOTAL at specific column</p>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<p>Added possibility to set alt-description based on a specific columns value (or a fixed alt-value for all images)</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Bugfix: fixed issue when realtime search active and when typing to fast or searching while plugin already searching<br />\nRealtime search attribute now works invidually for different tables (so one table can have realtime search and another not on the same page)<br />\nAutoconversion of url&#8217;s, images and emails to html-tags are now possible with attribute settings<br />\nWith autoconversion it&#8217;s also possible to set if links should open in a new window or not</p>\n<h4>1.1.96</h4>\n<p>Possible to have an empty table when clicking reset button and not only at first pageload.<br />\nShow a custom message when search by user did not give any results. This is within a span which makes it easy to style with css.<br />\nSet a required length of characters at search<br />\nSet a specific message when required length length of characters at search is not valid<br />\nNew attribute to add placeholder to search inputfield<br />\nIt&#8217;s now possible to search in &quot;realtime&quot;, e.g. search starts when user enter characters in search input field directly<br />\ndebug-attribute alais for debug_mode (because of some people enters debug instead of debug_mode)</p>\n<h4>1.1.89</h4>\n<p>Possible to have an empty table at pageload (when doing search it will get filled with appropiate result).</p>\n<h4>1.1.88</h4>\n<p>Added a function for converting Windows-1255 characters to UTF-8 (this is not builtin into PHP mb_convert_encoding &#8211; function).</p>\n<h4>1.1.87</h4>\n<p>Bugfix responsive &#8211; relationsship between column and rows works indenpently of source_type given and<br />\nmanagaging several tables on same page with different number of columns now works.</p>\n<h4>1.1.86</h4>\n<p>Textdomain has changed from csvtohtml-wp to the expected csv-to-html for correct internationalisation.</p>\n<h4>1.1.85</h4>\n<p>filter_operator has a new option: wildcard which filters data from a string within a substring<br />\nSearch functionality implemented:<br />\nAn input search field, a search button and a reset button is created<br />\nEasy configurable texts for the buttons<br />\nThe buttons are easily styled because of classes set for each button<br />\nSearchresult is shown directly without reloading the page<br />\nBugfix: When excluded columns responsive tables &quot;out of the box&quot; was in some cases not working as expected.

If having pagination for several tables<br />\nThe pagination is separated accordingly and the page is not reloaded when browsing through tabledata.<br />\nIf javascript is not applicable then pagination could be used but only for one specific table and the page would be reloaded</p>\n<h4>1.1.61</h4>\n<p>If having more than one table an automatic html id is generated so responsive css rules can be generated invidually.</p>\n<h4>1.1.60</h4>\n<p>Responsive tables &quot;out of the box&quot;. It adjusts table view automatically based on different resolutions/devices.<br />\nIt&#8217;s also possible to adjust mediaquery/css breakpoints.</p>\n<h4>1.1.55</h4>\n<p>Possible to tell which rows to include (in the same format as include_cols)</p>\n<h4>1.1.54</h4>\n<p>Possible to apply filter in different ways such less then, more than , less or equal then, more or equal then or between<br />\nExtended debug-functionality separated from core.<br />\nMany thanks to g.deepwell for making this update possible! ( <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/gdeepwell/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/users/gdeepwell/</a> )</p>\n<h4>1.1.52</h4>\n<p>Apply a new filter on all rows based on a specific string from a specific column.<br />\nIt&#8217;s now possible to include a subset of the whole table in a cell where you specify columns that should be included. This data is added to the end of the table. Combined with css this could be used for hiding/showing data.<br />\nAdded more useful debug-functionality for getting the plugin running even quicker<br />\nMany thanks to g.deepwell for making this update possible! ( <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/gdeepwell/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/users/gdeepwell/</a> )<br />\nPlugin tested and verified for use with version 5.6 of WordPress</p>\n<h4>1.1.46</h4>\n<p>Better performance when not debugging due to debugging code loaded when neccessary.<br />\nA new attribute has been added so float numbers fetched from csv-files could be shown with another character instead of dots (probably comma)</p>\n<h4>1.1.44</h4>\n<p>A new attribute has been added so .csv does not have to be added automatically. This could be useful when loading files from Google Drive or similar cloud based services.</p>\n<h4>1.1.43</h4>\n<p>A html-tag that (for some reason) has been inserted by mistake. It&#8217;s now corrected. Validation of html table should now validate.</p>\n<h4>1.1.42</h4>\n<p>Some missing tag in table corrected (/tbody and id-attribute(when used) corrected).</p>\n<h4>1.1.41</h4>\n<p>Debug code removed. (update to this version if you tried to install/update to 1.1.40!)</p>\n<h4>1.1.40</h4>\n<p>Changed autodetection of EOL to auto(detect) (from cr/lf) when importing CSV-files.</p>\n<h4>1.1.39</h4>\n<p>Bugfix: Display order of columns when including, excluding is fixed. (In some circumstances the display order of columns would be inccorect before)</p>\n<h4>1.1.38</h4>\n<p>CURL is not used anymore for fetching external files. Instead native WordPress HTTP API is used. Why? It&#8217;s faster and handles security (with ssl) much better. As a fallback CURL is used by the HTTP API.</p>\n<h4>1.1.37</h4>\n<p>Bugfix admin page. Important to update to this version! (if you have installed 1.1.36)</p>\n<h4>1.1.36</h4>\n<p>Help-page introduced in wordpress dashboard<br />\nDebugging functionality improved<br />\nCURL bugfix when mixing http and https &#8211; protocols.<br />\nPossible to disable/ignore curl if something goes wrong (even if CURL is installed)<br />\nNow it&#8217;s possible to use wildcards (to grab all csv-file from a specified path for example)</p>\n<h4>1.1.31</h4>\n<p>Bugfix sorting on columns when both asc and desc are used</p>\n<h4>1.1.3</h4>\n<p>Sorting of columns are now possible. It&#8217;s also possible to define different sortorders depending on which column is sorted.</p>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s possible to convert(translate) characterencoding from csv to another charset (for display)</p>\n<h4>1.0.9</h4>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s possible to use &quot;last&quot; instead of entering a specifing column-number when excluding a column.</p>\n<h4>1.0.8</h4>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s possible to use a custom delimiter for each row in a csv file.</p>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<p>Autodetection of line endings now supported. Works automatically on local files (on server)<br />\nPossible to specifiy custom line endings when loading external links (when CURL is enabled)</p>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s possible to specify an extra class for the table. Example: If used together with the tablesorter plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/table-sorter/) you can add a class called tablesorter and combine these two plugins to<br />\ncreate a &quot;tablesorted&quot; html table generated from csv file(s) in realtime.</p>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s possible to include or exclude columns in format 1,2,3 or 1-3. It&#8217;s also possible to combine these two eg. 1,2,3,7-9,13,14,15.</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>Semantic bugfix. When not defining a path an extra slash was included in the path. Now there are no extra slashes.<br />\nNow it&#8217;s possible to include a full url to fetch csv-files from external sources. CURL are used to fetch csv files from external sources, but if CURL is not installed, then php&#8217;s file() function is used but that requires that the server<br />\nhas allow url fopen enabled.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<p>Plugin released</p>\n"
