Then you got right plugin.</p>\n<p>WP Mail.Baby plugin goal is to make email deliverability easy and reliable. We want to ensure your emails reach the inbox.</p>\n<p>WP Mail.Baby fixes your email deliverability with various email smtp&#8217;s like Mail.baby, SMTP.com, Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun, Sendinblue and more Api&#8217;s.</p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?</h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by using authentication.</p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers. One of the things they look at is if an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.</p>\n<p>If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, then emails either go in the SPAM folder or worst, don&#8217;t get delivered at all.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://mail.baby/\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Mail.Baby</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue is that most WordPress hosting companies don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.</p>\n<p>The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.</p>\n<h4>How does Mail Baby SMTP work?</h4>\n<p>Mail.Baby SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by improving and changing how your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()</code> function to either use proper SMTP host credentials or leverage a built-in SMTP mail provider.</p>\n<p>When using one of our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. This means even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails still send successfully.</p>\n<p>This helps you fix all WordPress not sending email issues.</p>\n<p>Mail.Baby SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP setup options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Mail.Baby <strong>(Recommended)</strong></p>\n<p>MailBaby is an email smart host that offers outbound filtering. Emails are sent to MailBaby systems, and are analyzed for content.</p>\n<p>Email is then routed through an email zone based on the email content, and score of the email, or bounced as spam. IP reputation is handled by MailBaby.</p>\n<p>MailBaby monitors all our ips for blacklists, and works with email providers through feedback loops and other abuse monitoring to ensure email delivery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sendinblue SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mailgun SMTP</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SendGrid SMTP</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gmail SMTP</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails.</p>\n<p>Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one.</p>\n",
