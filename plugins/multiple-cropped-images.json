The images are only saved in image sizes that were previously defined in a configuration page. This ensures that the images are saved in the correct image sizes. The original image and the cropped image are always available in the backend. This makes it possible to recut them at any time without having to upload the original again.</p>\n<h4>Comfortable image management</h4>\n<p>Using drag &amp; drop, images can be sorted in the preferred order. This is ideal for quickly adapting a slideshow to your needs. Title and text features for each picture help to keep track. If required, these options can be displayed on the frontend.</p>\n<h4>Shortcodes for multiple image usage</h4>\n<p>Using shortcodes, images can be inserted into any type of post.</p>\n<h4>Search engine friendliness included</h4>\n<p>Additional input options such as title, text, SEO-title and SEO-alt make the MCI plugin search engine friendly.</p>\n<h4>Equally suitable for users, developers and agencies.</h4>\n<p>The MCI plugin is intuitive to use, and users will love its ease of use. Developers get a sophisticated solution for use in projects. Web agencies can professionally implement image management on websites while knowing that the customer can easily manage the images later.
