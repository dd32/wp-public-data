Most hosting environments (even shared hosts like Bluehost and GoDaddy) can handle email, but not very well out-of-the-box and require being optimized. It actually takes quite a bit of work to make sure your emails are deliverable. Some recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check that your SPF, DKIM, and other email records are set up correctly (<a href=\"https://www.mail-tester.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mail-tester.com</a> is a great all-around tool for checking and fixing common email deliverability issues)</li>\n<li>Even on shared hosts, you should be able to add a dedicated IP to your account for very cheap (which allows you to get away from shared IPs that have a bad reputation because your neighbors are spamming)</li>\n<li>If all else fails, you can abandon using your own server for mail altogether, and host offsite with a free or paid third-party service like Gmail (check out the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Mail SMTP</a> plugin to go that route)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20captcha%20not%20appearing%20on%20my%20form%3F'>\nWhy is the CAPTCHA not appearing on my form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The modern versions of Google reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha are relatively invisible. Be sure to send yourself a test message through your form.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
