        "faq": "\n<h4>I still see errors on my form</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whilst this plugin goes a long way to taking a Gravity Form towards WCAG 2.0 compliance, there are still some things that haven&#8217;t been looked at yet.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having troubles or even better know a solution, please leave a detailed message on the support tab.</p>\n<p>I am aware of three issues that are yet to be resolved &#8211; duplicate ID&#8217;s for checkbox lists, duplicate ID&#8217;s for multi-page form wrappers (the hidden pages have the same ID), and duplicate ID&#8217;s for the &#8216;Save and continue later&#8217; link/button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Opening links in new windows &#8211; isn&#8217;t that bad practice?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Typically forcing links to open in a new window is bad practice, both from a usability and accessibility point of view. However when it comes to forms there is reason enough to do this &#8211; if the user clicks on the link they are taken away from the form &#8211; loosing any data they may have provided.</p>\n<p>This plugin uses jQuery to modify the form once the browser has loaded it, any links in the form are changed to open in a new window (target=&#8217;_blank&#8217;), then a title is added (or appended to the existing title) which reads &#8216;this link will open in a new window&#8217;.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H33.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">H33: Supplementing link text with the title attribute</a> technique.</p>\n<p>Why not use the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/C7\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">C7: Using CSS to hide a portion of the link text</a> technique?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m concerned it would have a negative consequence on SEO, because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search engines may down-rate your website, thinking you&#8217;re attempting the black hat practice of stuffing a page with keywords that may not have any relevance to the content. </li>\n<li>Search engines may index the links with the hidden text. For example, &#8216;document title this link will open in a new window&#8217; instead of &#8216;document title&#8217;.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I&#8217;m willing to be convinced otherwise. But my goal is to make a Gravity Form accessible for everyone &#8211; which needs to take into account how it affects search engines.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is the plugin tested</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is tested using screen-reader software JAWS and the latest version of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome.</p>\n<p>The plugin is developed using the latest version of Gravity Forms. The plugin may work in previous versions but could have mixed results. Only the latest version of Gravity Forms can be supported.</p>\n<p>The aim of the plugin is to make forms created using Gravity Forms have valid HTML and comply with WCAG 2.0 &#8211; level AA.</p>\n<p>Each change the plugin makes to a Gravity Form has been decided through research into best practice for usability and accessibility.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I disable the tabindex on the validation message</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I DO NOT recommend removing the tabindex.</p>\n<p>After considered research I am of the belief that tabindex with a value of =-1 is perfectly fine, and infact quite helpful in making critical messages such as a validation message appear immidately for screen reader users.</p>\n<p>With that said, if you want to disable it you can add this code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file, below the starting &lt;?php line.</p>\n<pre><code>add_action('itsg_gf_wcag_disable_tabindex', function () {\n    return true;\n});\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
