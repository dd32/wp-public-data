Use a number from 0: default, 1: purple, 2: orange, 3: grey, 4: white.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example use: <code>[authentiq_login_button sign_in_text=\"Login\" linking_text=\"Link your account\" sign_out_text=\"Logout\" color_scheme=1]</code>.</p>\n<p>You can even place the <a href=\"http://docs.getshortcodes.com/article/52-using-of-shortcodes-in-template-files\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shortcode in your template files</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8216;Authentiq&#8217; and click Search Plugins, once you find it, you can install it by simply clicking &#8216;Install Now&#8217;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the Authentiq plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How a user can link her account with Authentiq</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two flows for this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>She signs in using the Authentiq ID App, using the same email as her current WordPress user.</li>\n<li>She signs in at the site using WordPress Username &amp; Password, and then links her account with Authentiq, either using a widget or shortcode button, or by visiting her profile.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I see extra user info send by Authentiq ID</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can simply visit the user’s profile page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I disable WordPress Username &amp; Password, how a user can get back access if lost?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When this happens, the WordPress site admin visits the user profile from the WordPress Dashboard, and click the &#8220;unlink&#8221; button in the Authentiq section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is WooCommerce supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, WooCommerce checkout and account pages are supported. In case &#8220;Address&#8221; and &#8220;Phone number&#8221; have been opted-in in Authentiq plugin settings page, they will be pre-filled for the user during checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I am already using &#8220;WordPress Social Login&#8221; (WSL) plugin, for Authentiq</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply disable Authentiq within the WSL plugin (or the WSL plugin as a whole). Make sure you configure the redirect url correctly and add a backchannel redirect url in the Authentiq dashboard as prompted in the plugins page. Your users will be able to sign in with Authentiq right away.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
