If you don&#8217;t 302 redirect, the plugin will read the template to a buffer and output it directly to the user.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The rewrites aren&#8217;t working.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Rewrites require PHP Dom which is part of libxml. Most servers will have this but some may now.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do the rewrites do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The rewrites will replace any source links in Javascript and Image tags with the correct path to the template. It will do the same for CSS and Hyperlink hrefs. If you do not use rewrites or 302 redirect then your landing page will not show correctly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is only rewrite local paths?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This will only rewrite css, javascript, images and links that are relative links, i.e. do not being with &#8216;http(s)://&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use WordPress functions in my template?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can if you use php in your template and load wp-load.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
