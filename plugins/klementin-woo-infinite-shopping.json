This could be a category, a landingpage etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20customer%20be%20redirected%20back%20to%20ex.%20facebook%3F'>\nWill my customer be redirected back to ex. Facebook?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, we never redirect back to anywhere that is not your website. If the customer got to the product from ex. A facebook shopping feed the customer will get redirected to your frontpage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20woocommerce%20for%20this%20to%20work%3F'>\nDo i need Woocommerce for this to work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this is an extension to Woocommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20have%20a%20page%20i%20dont%20want%20the%20customer%20to%20get%20redirect%20back%20to%3F'>\nWhat if i have a page i dont want the customer to get redirect back to?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this case, you can go to the &#8220;Infinite shopping&#8221; menu point in the WordPress menu.<br />\nHere you can add URL&#8217;s that the system want &#8220;remember&#8221;. Be very specific once adding these as the system match the URL<br />\nOn a word basis. This means that just inputting &#8220;shop&#8221; will exclude all URL&#8217;s with the text &#8220;shop&#8221; in them.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
