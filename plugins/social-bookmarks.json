Simply grab a copy of the <a href=\"http://www.dountsis.com/downloads?cat=2\" title=\"Template Pack at Dountsis.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Template Pack</a> and follow the simple instructions included in the pack.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to wait for another plugin release to get an updated list of sites?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The releases of the Site Packs are independent of the plug-in core releases.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I think that I have a problem with the plugin.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can report your issues to me using the <a href=\"http://bugtracker.dountsis.com/\" title=\"Bugtracker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bugtracker</a>.
