This means that, as an affiliate, you just need to set which broker each page on your site is about and the plugin will keep the risk percentage up to date.<br />\nYou can see a demo of Risk Warning Bar displaying eToro&#8217;s latest risk warning on <a href=\"https://brokernotes.co/etoro-review/\" title=\"BrokerNotes here\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BrokerNotes</a>.<br />\nPlease note: We developed this plugin to make remaining compliant easier for both affiliates and brokers, but it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that your website is compliant.
