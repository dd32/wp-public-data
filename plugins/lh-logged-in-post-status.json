It means the content is only available to certain logged in users, generally authors (own posts), editors, and administrators.</p>\n<p>The Logged in post status, on the other hand, is available to all logged in users, whatever their role.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Logged In Post Status, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-logged-in-post-status/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-logged-in-post-status/</a>.
