The files which are downloaded are less than 5KB. Once downloaded these font files are cached by the browser. So if a visitor visits a page next he is likely to have that font files already.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if WebRupee doesn&#8217;t work for any reason? What would visitors see?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A visitor would see &#8220;Rs / Rs.&#8221; WebRupee looks for &#8220;Rs / Rs.&#8221; and converts it to the Rupee Symbol. So if for some reason WebRupee fails, it will not be able to turn &#8220;Rs / Rs.&#8221; to Rupee Symbol. So the visitos would see &#8220;Rs / Rs.&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What licensing terms are associated with WebRupee?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WebRupee is Licensed under the Apache License, Version 3.0 (the &#8220;License&#8221;).<br />\nPlease visit (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) for details.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
