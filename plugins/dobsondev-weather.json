Inside the widget you simply need to fill out the City/Town you want the weather for. The City/Town should be in the format of Town or City, comma, then the country code. For example, New York would be location=&#8221;New York, US&#8221;. Click save and the widget will then display the weather on the front end of the site.</p>\n<p><strong>Shortcode</strong></p>\n<p>[weather location=&#8221;City/Town, CC&#8221; align=&#8221;align&#8221;]</p>\n<p>This Shortcode will embed the weather app into your page. Be sure to replace the above code with information pertaining to you. The location should be in the format of Town or City, comma, then the country code. For example, New York would be location=&#8221;New York, US&#8221;. The alignment is where you want the shortcode to be aligned to. This works the same way as the WordPress image alignments, so your choices are &#8220;right&#8221;, &#8220;left&#8221;, or &#8220;center&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>API Key</strong></p>\n<p>Please note that this plugin DOES use an API to get the weather and you do have to supply your own API key (the key is free with paid versions for high traffic).
