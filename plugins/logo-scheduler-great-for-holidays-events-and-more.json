You can save multiple logos to be scheduled at different times.</li>\n<li>Each logo variation has a name/title to help you keep track if you have multiple scheduled logos. You&#8217;ll need to set the start and end dates, whether you want it to repeat yearly, and then upload your replacement logo (and retina version if desired).</li>\n<li>The &#8220;Logo Container ID&#8221; field is generally set automatically based on the theme you have activated. This field is for advanced users and it is not recommended that you change it unless you know HTML.</li>\n<li>Click to save your changes.</li>\n<li>Done! Your logo will automatically change in the header of your website during the scheduled times.</li>\n</ul>\n",

It is still possible that your theme does not use one of these container ID&#8217;s though. If that is the case, you will need to look at the code to see what the ID is for the div containing your logo and insert that ID in the Logo Container ID field.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20provide%20professional%20development%20support%20if%20i%20can%27t%20get%20it%20to%20work%3F'>\nDo you provide professional development support if I can&#8217;t get it to work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We sure do!
