We take privacy very seriously. BitFire inspects all traffic going to the webserver and takes care to filter out any potentially sensitive information by replacing it with <strong><em>redacted</em></strong>. The config.ini file includes a list of common sensitive field names under the &#8220;filtered_logging&#8221; section. You can add additional fields to filter in the config file by adding a line &#8220;filtered_logging[field_name] = true&#8221; and replacing &#8220;field_name&#8221; with the name of the desired parameter to filter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BitFire includes an error handler which monitors it&#8217;s operation. In the event an error is detected <em>only</em> in the BitFire software; including during install, an alert can be sent to BitFire&#8217;s developer team. The development team monitors these errors in real time and includes fixes for any detected errors in each new release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Malware scanner. BitFire sends tiny 64bit hashes (signatures, or fingerprints) of every file to our hash database. For instance, index.php may hash to the number: 812612388126487. The database is many gigabytes and centrally located on our servers. BitFire uses that information to determine if a file has been modified or is a known good file and sends the results back to your site. Client hashes are never stored off your server.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "installation": "<p>After installing, you can configure the plugin by clicking the &#8220;BitFire&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu item in the WordPress admin dashboard.  You may choose to run the plugin in &#8220;Always On Mode&#8221; (WordFence: &#8220;Optimized&#8221; mode) by clicking the &#8220;Always On&#8221; button on the settings page.  This will add bitfire to your PHP&#8217;s auto_prentend_file list and ensure that BitFire is always running on your site.<br />\n<em>Note, not compatible with Windows Operating systems.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitfire.co/support-center\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Visit our website to access our official documentation, which includes in-depth descriptions of security features, common solutions, and comprehensive help.</a></p>\n",

Notice how much extra other plugins charge you to clean up malware and how much of their product is focused on finding malware on your system?<br />\nThey don&#8217;t do a great job of keeping malware off your site, and then charge you extra when their security fails.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20is%20pro%20version%3F'>\nHow much is PRO Version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bitfire.co/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WAF only version</a> is $79.99 / year, and <a href=\"https://bitfire.co/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">complete RASP protection</a> is $128.00 / year.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20other%20security%20plugins%20live%20up%20to%20their%20hype%2C%20why%20do%20they%20scan%20my%20site%20for%20malware%20daily%3F'>\nIf other security plugins live up to their hype, why do they scan my site for malware daily?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s an excellent question. The majority of popular security plugins create custom signatures for each WordPress plugin vulnerability as they are publicly disclosed. With over 10,000 known WordPress security vulnerabilities and less than 200 signatures, they miss blocking a lot of hacks. They are also unable to block the most common security flaws (access control errors) for anything they do not have a pre-built signature for. To make the situation more difficult, they delay these rules by up to a month for non-paying customers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20redirection%20protection%20work%3F'>\nHow does Redirection Protection work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our unique software keeps track of every 3rd party domain your web page uses (Facebook, Google, JavaScript APIS, themes, etc.). After several weeks of learning, CSP security headers are sent to visitors instructing their browsers to only use or redirect to your approved domain list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20bitfire%20prevent%20cross-site%20scripting%20%28xss%29%3F'>\nDoes BitFire prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>BitFire includes outstanding XSS protection, including HTTP headers and content filtering for persistent, reflected, and DOM-based XSS attacks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20bitfire%20block%20sql%20injection%20attacks%20%28sqli%29%3F'>\nDoes BitFire block SQL Injection attacks (SQLi)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. BitFire has advanced SQL parsing similar to MySQL syntax parsing and can understand SQL queries regardless of encoding, injected comments, and other evasion techniques.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20some%20examples%20of%20rasp%20blocks%3F'>\nWhat are some examples of RASP blocks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adding a new administrator account?</strong> BitFire checks that the current user has the administrator privilege before allowing the account creation.</li>\n<li><strong>Making a network connection?</strong> BitFire checks the remote system against a list of over 2.5 million malware domains before allowing the connection.</li>\n<li><strong>Adding or editing a file?</strong> BitFire inspects the filename and content to ensure that it does not edit a PHP file or inject backdoor code. </li>\n<li><strong>Redirecting the visitor to another website?</strong> First check the malware domain list before sending the redirect.</li>\n<li><strong>Is a plugin eval() dynamic PHP Code?</strong> Inspect the code being passed to eval() and block malicious code before executing it.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20shouldn%27t%20i%20use%20wordfence%3F'>\nWhy shouldn&#8217;t I use WordFence?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you use WordFence, you should only use the paid version. WordFence has a team monitoring emerging WordPress vulnerabilities and writing custom rules to block specific exploits. They are very good at it and run a great blog on their work. Paying customers receive these virtual patches as soon as they are available. Free customers receive the patches 30 days later. If your website is vulnerable, it is almost guaranteed to be hacked before the patch is available to free customers.

BitFire verifies human web browsers with a JavaScript challenge similar to Cloudflare but over 50 times faster (1/10 second VS 6 seconds). BitFire also includes a list of over 80 search engines and SEO tools that are network verified to ensure only valid bot traffic reaches your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20support%20if%20i%20encounter%20issues%20with%20bitfire%20rasp%3F'>\nHow do I get support if I encounter issues with BitFire RASP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bitfire/\" rel=\"ugc\">the WordPress support form</a> or visit our website to access our official documentation, which includes in-depth descriptions of security features, common solutions, and comprehensive help.

We take privacy very seriously. BitFire inspects all traffic going to the webserver and takes care to filter out any potentially sensitive information by replacing it with <strong><em>redacted</em></strong>. The config.ini file includes a list of common sensitive field names under the &#8220;filtered_logging&#8221; section. You can add additional fields to filter in the config file by adding a line &#8220;filtered_logging[field_name] = true&#8221; and replacing &#8220;field_name&#8221; with the name of the desired parameter to filter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>BitFire includes an error handler which monitors it&#8217;s operation. In the event an error is detected <em>only</em> in the BitFire software; including during install, an alert can be sent to BitFire&#8217;s developer team. The development team monitors these errors in real time and includes fixes for any detected errors in each new release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Malware scanner. BitFire sends tiny 64bit hashes (signatures, or fingerprints) of every file to our hash database. For instance, index.php may hash to the number: 812612388126487. The database is many gigabytes and centrally located on our servers. BitFire uses that information to determine if a file has been modified or is a known good file and sends the results back to your site. Client hashes are never stored off your server.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
