In that submenu, you can modify following settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoPlay – decides whether the video starts playing automatically, when the page/post is displayed.</li>\n<li>AutoBuffering – decides whether the video starts buffering automatically, when the page/post is displayed. If AutoPlay is set to true, you can ignore this setting.</li>\n<li>Popup Box – decides whether a popup box with “replay” and “share” buttons will be displayed when video ends.</li>\n<li>Enable Full-screen Mode – select false if you do not wish the fullscreen option to be displayed.</li>\n<li>Allow User Uploads – select true if you like to upload new videos via Media Library.</li>\n<li>Enable Post Thumbnail – select true if you wish the screen shot appear as post thumbnail. Works only when uploading new splash image via Media Library.</li>\n<li>Convert old shortcodes with commas – older versions of this plugin used commas to separate shortcode parameters. This option will make sure it works with current version.</li>\n<li>Commercial Licence Key – enter your licence key here to get the completely unbranded version of the player</li>\n<li>Colors of all the parts of flowplayer instances on page/post (controlbar, canvas, sliders, buttons, mouseover buttons, time and total time, progress and buffer sliders).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the right side of this screen, you can see the current visual configuration of flowplayer.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='1.%20my%20video%20doesn%27t%20play%20in%20some%20browsers.'>\n1. My video doesn&#8217;t play in some browsers.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This should be related to your video format or mime type issues.</p>\n<p>Each browser supports different video format, MP4 is the recommended format. In general, it&#8217;s recommended to use constant frame rate. Detailed instructions about <a href=\"https://foliovision.com/player/encoding\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">video encoding for HTML 5</a>.</p>\n<p>HTML5 is pickier about what video it can play than Flash.</p>\n<p>Please note that MP4 is just a container, it might contain various streams for audio and video. You should check what audio and video stream are you using. Read next question to find out how.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='2.%20player%20buttons%20are%20gone%20-%20there%20are%20only%20square%20symbols.'>\n2. Player buttons are gone &#8211; there are only square symbols.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) This can happen if your site is at www.domain.com, but the CSS is loaded from your CDN at cdn.domain.com. Based on CSS3 and HTML5 specs not all the resources can be shared between domains.</p>\n<p>So you need to set the following on your CDN for web fonts (woff, eot, ttf, svg):</p>\n<p>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</p>\n<p>Or you can allow your domain only (but in that case it might be good to also allow it with https):</p>\n<p>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.domain.com</p>\n<p>Or you can exclude wp-content/plugins/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/css/flowplayer.css from CDN.</p>\n<p>2) Second cause might be that your webfonts are served with bad mimetype</p>\n<pre><code>AddType application/x-font-woff woff\nAddType application/x-font-ttf ttf\nAddType application/vnd.ms-fontobject eot\nAddType image/svg+xml svg\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='3.%20i%20want%20to%20align%20my%20player%20%28left%2Fright%2Fmiddle%29.'>\n3. I want to align my player (left/right/middle).\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the player is positioned in the middle. To change alignment of the player to either left or right:<br />\nGo to FV Player settings &gt; scroll down to post interface options &gt; tick &#8220;Align&#8221;. Now you can insert your video. In the interface you can now choose you alignment from the drop down menu: default (middle), left, or right.<br />\nYou can check <a href=\"https://foliovision.com/player/demos/align-settings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo in here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='4.%20how%20to%20check%20my%20video%20properties%20using%20the%20built-in%20checker%20and%20how%20to%20report%20video%20not%20playing'>\n4. How to check my video properties using the built-in checker and how to report video not playing\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The video checker works automatically when you&#8217;re logged in as admin. You&#8217;ll see a text in upper left corner of any video on your site. All the necessary info can be found in <a href=\"https://foliovision.com/player/basic-setup/how-to-use-video-checker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this guide</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='5.%20my%20video%20doesn%27t%20play%20in%20internet%20explorer%209%20and%2010.'>\n5. My video doesn&#8217;t play in Internet Explorer 9 and 10.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most of the issues is caused by bad mime type on the server which serves your video files. Our plugin contains an automated checked for this &#8211; just click the &#8220;Check Videos&#8221; button on the plugin Settings screen.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to fix the mime type:</p>\n<p><strong>If your videos are hosted on a standard server:</strong></p>\n<p>You need to put the following into your .htaccess:</p>\n<pre><code>AddType video/mp4             .mp4\nAddType video/webm            .webm\nAddType video/ogg             .ogv\nAddType application/x-mpegurl .m3u8\nAddType video/x-m4v           .m4v\nAddType video/mp2t            .ts\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you use Microsoft IIS, add following into web.config (one should be in your root website folder) into configuration/system.webServer/staticContent section:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;remove fileExtension=\".mp4\" /&gt;  \n&lt;mimeMap fileExtension=\".mp4\" mimeType=\"video/mp4\" /&gt;\n&lt;remove fileExtension=\".webm\" /&gt;  \n&lt;mimeMap fileExtension=\".webm\" mimeType=\"video/webm\" /&gt;\n&lt;remove fileExtension=\".ogg\" /&gt;  \n&lt;mimeMap fileExtension=\".ogg\" mimeType=\"video/ogg\" /&gt;\n&lt;remove fileExtension=\".m4v\" /&gt;  \n&lt;mimeMap fileExtension=\".m4v\" mimeType=\"video/x-m4v\" /&gt;\n&lt;remove fileExtension=\".ts\" /&gt;  \n&lt;mimeMap fileExtension=\".ts\" mimeType=\"video/mp2t\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This can be also done in the Apache configuration. If you are on Microsoft IIS, you need to use the IIS manager.</p>\n<p><strong>If you host videos on Amazon AWS:</strong></p>\n<p>They might be served with bad mime type too &#8211; &#8220;application/octet-stream&#8221;. This largely depends on the tool which you use to upload your videos. Using your Amazon AWS Management Console, you can go though your videos and find file content type under the &#8220;Metadata&#8221; tab in an object&#8217;s &#8220;Properties&#8221; pane and fix it to &#8220;video/mp4&#8221; (without the quotes, of course different video formats need different mime type, this one is for MP4). There are also tools for this, like S3 Browser Freeware, good place for start is here: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=224446</p>\n<p>Good example can be seen in our support forum: https://foliovision.com/support/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/how-to/how-to-set-correct-mime-type-on-videos-hosted-by-amazon</p>\n<p>Also for Internet Explorer, it&#8217;s not recommended to use MPEG-4 Visual or MPEG-4 Part 2 video stream codecs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='6.%20how%20do%20i%20fix%20the%20bad%20metadata%20%28moov%29%20position%3F'>\n6. How do I fix the bad metadata (moov) position?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This means that the video information (such as what codecs are used) is not stored at the beginning of the file. In our experience, video with bad meta data position might be slow to load in Flash engine (check some browser which doesn&#8217;t play MP4 format in Flash &#8211; like Opera) and Firefox. Although Safary and iOS (iPAd, iPhone) may play it just fine.</p>\n<p>In general we recommend you to re-encode your video as <a href=\"https://foliovision.com/player/encoding#encoding-samples\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">per our instructions</a>, but here are some quick tools:</p>\n<p>If you are using Mac, try Lillipot (just remember to rename the file back to .mp4 extension): http://www.qtbridge.com/lillipot/lillipot.html</p>\n<p>If you have Quick Time Pro, just open the video and in the Movie Properties -&gt; Video Track -&gt; Other Settings turn on the &#8220;Cache (hint)&#8221; &#8211; <a href=\"http://drop.foliovision.com/webwork/it/quick-time-pro-cache-hint.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">screenshot</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are using Windows, try MP4 FastStart: http://www.datagoround.com/lab/</p>\n<p>There are also server-side tools for fixing of this written in Python and there one for PHP, but it fails on videos bigger than the PHP memory limit.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='7.%20i%27m%20getting%20error%20about%20%27http%20range%20requests%27.'>\n7. I&#8217;m getting error about &#8216;HTTP range requests&#8217;.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check with your technical support if your web server supports HTTP range requests. Most of the modern web servers support this feature (Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd, Litespeed&#8230;). It&#8217;s important for fast seeking in HTML5 video playback.</p>\n<p>Other possible cause is that you are using some membership plugin to protect downloading of your videos (Premise and others). While this might seem like a good solution, we don&#8217;t recommend it as it increases the load of your server and it won&#8217;t allow seeking in the videos. You can use <a href=\"https://foliovision.com/player/secure-amazon-s3-guide\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amazon S3 with privacy settings</a>, just hit the link to read our illustrated guide.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='8.%20are%20there%20any%20known%20compatibility%20issues%3F.'>\n8. Are there any known compatibility issues?.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We heard about problems when using some fancy pro templates like OptimizePress (read below for fixing instructions) or Gantry framework. These templates often break the WordPress conventions (probably as they often try to add too many non-template functions, like video support built-in into the template). We can debug the issues for you, just head over to our website and order the pro support.</p>\n<p>Full list of conflicting plugins is available here: https://foliovision.com/player/compatibility</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='9.%20i%27m%20using%20optimizepress%20version%201%20template.'>\n9. I&#8217;m using OptimizePress version 1 template.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First click the &#8220;Check template&#8221; button on the pluging settings screen. It will likely report an issue like:</p>\n<pre><code>It appears there are multiple Flowplayer scripts on your site, your videos might not be playing, please check. There might be some other plugin adding the script.\nFlowplayer script http://site.com/wp-content/themes/OptimizePress/js/flowplayer-3.2.4.min.js is old version and won't play. You need to get rid of this script.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem with this template is that it includes that old Flowplayer library without using the proper WordPress function to add a new script (wp_enqueue_script). You need to go through the template and make sure the script is not loading. Typically it will be in any of the header.php files &#8211; including header-myheader.php, header-singleheader.php or similar files.</p>\n<p>There is also a workaround &#8211; on each page what is using one of the OptimizePress custom templates, check Launch Page &amp; Sales Letter Options &#8211;&gt; Video Options &#8211;&gt; &#8220;Activate Video&#8221; and enter &#8220;&lt;!&#8211; FV Flowplayer &#8211;&gt;&#8221; into Launch Page &amp; Sales Letter Options &#8211;&gt; Video Options &#8211;&gt; &#8220;External Player Code&#8221; field. That way the template thinks the video is external and will not try to put in the Flowplayer library and the video will play.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='10.%20i%27m%20using%20optimizepress%20version%202%20template.'>\n10. I&#8217;m using OptimizePress version 2 template.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>FV Flowplayer will handle all the videos inserted by the Live Edit.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='11.%20does%20this%20plugin%20support%20shoutcast%3F.'>\n11. Does this plugin support Shoutcast?.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunatelly HTML5 does not support live broadcasting. Please read about it here under &#8220;Flash. The good parts&#8221;: http://flowplayer.org/docs/#flash</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='12.%20i%20get%20an%20error%20message%20like%20this%20when%20activating%20the%20plugin%3A%20parse%20error%3A%20parse%20error%2C%20unexpected%20t_string%2C%20expecting%20t_old_function%20or%20t_function%20or%20t_var%20or%20%27%7D%27%20in%20%2Fwp-content%2Fplugins%2Ffv-wordpress-flowplayer%2Fmodels%2Fflowplayer.php%20on%20line%204.'>\n12.

I get &#8220;Can&#8217;t create temporary file for video analysis&#8221; in admin video checker.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This temporary file is required as our plugin contains a video checker for admin users &#8211; it checks the video format and other information and warns you about potential issues why your video might not play for everybody.</p>\n<p>The error message means the WordPress media uploads directory (by default wp-content/uploads) is not writable by PHP. We use this standard WordPress path as it should work for nearly all the websites. Most of people use the standard WordPress Media Library, so this should really work.</p>\n<p>You can try to set the permissions of that folder to allow writing for everybody and see if that helps. If you are not sure, ask your web host support about what PHP permission model you use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='14.%20i%20installed%20the%20plugin%2C%20inserted%20the%20video%2C%20but%20it%27s%20not%20working%20-%20there%20is%20no%20control%20bar%20or%20only%20a%20gray%20box%20appears.'>\n14.

Your player works just fine, but there are some weird display issues.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please check if these issues also appear when using the default WordPress template.

Is there a way to force pre-buffering to load a chunk of the video before the splash screen appears?.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This option is not available. With autobuffer, it means every visitor on every visit to your page will be downloading the video. This means that you use a lot more bandwidth than on demand. I know that I actually watch the video on only about 1/3 of the pages with video that I visit. That saves you money (no bandwidth overages) and means that people who do want to watch the video and other visitors to your site get faster performance.<br />\nIf you want to autobuffer, you can turn that on in the options (we turn it off by default and recommend that it stays off).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='19.%20my%20videos%20are%20hosted%20with%20amazon%20s3%20service.%20how%20can%20i%20fill%20the%20details%20into%20shortcode%3F.'>\n19.

Where can I change the default directory for videos?.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can change this manually in the the models/flowplayer.php in the flowplayer_head function.

How do I insert flowplayer object outside the post, for example to a sidebar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need to use following code to include the shortcode into a sidebar:</p>\n<p>echo apply_filters(&#8216;the_content&#8217;, &#8216;[flowplayer src=yourvideo.mp4 width=240 height=320]&#8217;);</p>\n<p>Fill the Flowplayer shortcode part according to your needs. The apply filter needs to be called because the flowplayer shortcodes are not parsen outside posts automatically. Also, please do not forget to add the echo at the beginning.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='23.%20how%20can%20i%20style%20the%20popup%20or%20ad%3F'>\n23.

You need to copy this CSS into your theme style sheet:</p>\n<pre><code>iframe.fvyoutube-engine {\n    width: 100% !important;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can optionally edit your theme&#8217;s JS to prevent the shrinking.</p>\n<p>FV Player Pro comes with a money back guarantee so you can even try the commercial no-branding version risk free.

In that submenu, you can modify following settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoPlay – decides whether the video starts playing automatically, when the page/post is displayed.</li>\n<li>AutoBuffering – decides whether the video starts buffering automatically, when the page/post is displayed. If AutoPlay is set to true, you can ignore this setting.</li>\n<li>Popup Box – decides whether a popup box with “replay” and “share” buttons will be displayed when video ends.</li>\n<li>Enable Full-screen Mode – select false if you do not wish the fullscreen option to be displayed.</li>\n<li>Allow User Uploads – select true if you like to upload new videos via Media Library.</li>\n<li>Enable Post Thumbnail – select true if you wish the screen shot appear as post thumbnail. Works only when uploading new splash image via Media Library.</li>\n<li>Convert old shortcodes with commas – older versions of this plugin used commas to separate shortcode parameters. This option will make sure it works with current version.</li>\n<li>Commercial Licence Key – enter your licence key here to get the completely unbranded version of the player</li>\n<li>Colors of all the parts of flowplayer instances on page/post (controlbar, canvas, sliders, buttons, mouseover buttons, time and total time, progress and buffer sliders).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the right side of this screen, you can see the current visual configuration of flowplayer. If you click Apply Changes button, this player’s looks refreshes.</p>\n",
