It does this while letting your valid users pass through with ease.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20changed%20the%20permalink%20setup%20and%20now%20the%20login%20panel%20doesn%27t%20work%2C%20how%20to%20access%3F'>\nI Changed the Permalink setup and now the login panel doesn&#8217;t work, how to access?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Changing the permalink settings to or from default selection causes the secure login url to change accordingly, if your permalink setup was default and you changed it to SEO friendly URL, remove the &#8220;?&#8221; previously existed in your login url (i.e http://yourname.com/?axs-login would be http://yourname.com/axs-login), add the &#8220;?&#8221; after http://yourname.com/ if you reverted to default permalink.
