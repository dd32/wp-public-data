Copy the key in the <em>Public Key</em> field to your own application (receiver). Use it to verify the signature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20format%20can%20i%20use%20for%20custom%20key'>\nWhat format can I use for custom key\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Keys that are generated by the plugin have the following format:<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Digest algorithm:</strong> SHA256<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Private key type:</strong> RSA (OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA)<br />\n&#8211; <strong>Private key bits:</strong> 1024</p>\n<p>It is therefore advised that in case you use custom keys, you use a similar format, since no other format than the one above has been tested.</p>\n<p>You also have to include the <strong>BEGIN</strong> and <strong>END</strong> lines, for example:</p>\n<p><strong>Public Key:</strong><br />\n    <code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----<br />\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br />\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br />\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br />\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br />\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20send%20feedback%20or%20get%20help%20with%20a%20bug%3F'>\nHow can I send feedback or get help with a bug?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your bug reports, feature suggestions and any other feedback! Please head over to <a href=\"https://github.com/danielboven/gravity-forms-webhook-signature/issues\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the GitHub issues page</a> to search for existing issues or open a new one. While I&#8217;ll try to triage issues reported here on the plugin forum, you&#8217;ll get a faster response (and reduce duplication of effort) by keeping everything centralized in the GitHub repository.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
