It&#8217;s designed to offer your wordpress users and your IPS users a seamless experience and as of 0.9.0 has the following features:</p>\n<p>. Single Sign-On, with IPS as the authoritative entity</p>\n<p>. Login status sync.   If you&#8217;re signed into one system, you&#8217;re also signed into the other.</p>\n<p>. 100% Compatible with third party authentication plugins, provided they make use of the new 4.3.x OAuth framework.  Other authentication mechanisms may also work but remain untested.</p>\n<p>. Uses IPS&#8217; login, logout, password reset and profile forms.</p>\n<p>. Synchronizes avatars and other pertinent profile information.</p>\n<p>. Automatically sync IPS primary group membership to a WordPress role.</p>\n<h3>Additional Recommendations</h3>\n<p>For the best experience possible, we also recommend the following plugins:</p>\n<p>. IPS Referer Redirect:  This plugin will allow IPS to redirect the user back to your WordPress site after login provided the login was initiated from a WordPress page.</p>\n<p>. Capability Manager Enhanced: This plugin allows for more fine-grained permission management within WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Software Freedom</h3>\n<p>We believe in software freedom.   This software is offered to the community completely free of charge; however, we cannot continue to bring you quality plugins like this without your help.
