        "faq": "\n<h4>Why not just use a text widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because using pages gives you the visual editor, revisions, short codes, easier management and numerous other benefits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s so important about shortcodes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Shortcodes are increasingly important in WordPress and are used to output certain types of content, such as galleries and video, but also by a lot of plugins which don&#8217;t have widget functionality but which could effectively be widgetised by using this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does removing from wp_list_pages mean?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the name of a WordPress function that lists all pages in your blog.  It&#8217;s used by theme developers to build menus and navigation.  Our plugin can remove a page from this list, but it can&#8217;t remove a page from navigation that&#8217;s built using an alternative method &#8211; such as the new WP 3.0 menu builder, for example.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I used this plugin to output a video in my sidebar, but it doesn&#8217;t fit the space!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure that any content you place in a page to be output in the sidebar is small enough to fit in the sidebar &#8211; you may need to resize images and video embeds expressly for this purpose.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m outputting from a plugin using a shortcode, but it looks wrong!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes a plugin can&#8217;t output items in a space as small as most widget areas or sidebars, so in this case you may need to restyle the plugin&#8217;s output, or try a different plugin.  There&#8217;s only so much we can do here.  Sorry!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My theme&#8217;s gone all screwy.  Help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A very small number of themes can&#8217;t handle the output from this plugin very well.  Try the option to add a clear block at the end of your content &#8211; that may help in some cases.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
