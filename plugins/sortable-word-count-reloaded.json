        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20make%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you make this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We love the &#8220;Sortable Word Count&#8221; plugin but it didn&#8217;t have some of the funcionality we wanted so we decided to create this reloaded version of the plugin. This plugin can be translated and the word count function has been changed so that it gets the correct word count by filtering comments and other page builder code.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20remove%20the%20page%20builder%20code%20from%20the%20word%20code%3F'>\nDo you remove the page builder code from the word code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why we released this reloaded version of the plugin. We exclude the Gutenberg code and the page builder (Elementor, Beaver Builder, Visual Composer, etc) code from the word count.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20sortable%20word%20count%20reloaded%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20database%3F'>\nDoes Sortable Word Count Reloaded make changes to the database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin adds an option to the database: &#8216;apa_swcr_option_word_count&#8217;. This option is deleted when the plugin is deactivated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20check%20out%20if%20the%20plugin%20works%20for%20me%3F'>\nHow can I check out if the plugin works for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install and activate. Go to the posts or page list in the adminitration. There you will find a new column with the word count.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20remove%20sortable%20word%20count%20reloaded%20%3F'>\nHow can I remove Sortable Word Count Reloaded ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can simply activate, deactivate or delete it in your plugin management section. If you delete the plugin through FTP the option &#8216;apa_swcr_option_word_count&#8217; is not deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20known%20incompatibilities%3F'>\nAre there any known incompatibilities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please don&#8217;t use it with <em>WordPress MultiSite</em>, as it has not been tested.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20php%20version%20do%20i%20need%3F'>\nWhich PHP version do I need?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.6 and greater. WordPress itself <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/\" rel=\"ugc\">recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater</a>. If you&#8217;re using a PHP version lower than 5.6 please upgrade your PHP version or contact your Server administrator.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20server%20requirements%3F'>\nAre there any server requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin requires a PHP version 5.6 or higher and we recommend using PHP version 7.3 or higher. The plugin has been tested with PHP up to 7.3.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20make%20use%20of%20sortable%20word%20count%20reloaded%20yourself%3F'>\nDo you make use of Sortable Word Count Reloaded yourself?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course we do. That&#8217;s why we created it. ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n\n",
