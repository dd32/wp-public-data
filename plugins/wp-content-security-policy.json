The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8216;self&#8217;</strong><br />\nRefers to your own host. The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8216;unsafe-inline&#8217;</strong><br />\nAllows inline elements, such as functions in script tags, onclicks, etc. The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8216;unsafe-eval&#8217;</strong><br />\nAllows unsafe dynamic code evaluation such as JavaScript eval(). The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8216;strict-dynamic&#8217;</strong><br />\nThe trust explicitly given to a script present in the markup, by accompanying it with a nonce or a hash, shall be propagated to all the scripts loaded by that root script. The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8216;sha-AAAAAAAAA&#8217;</strong><br />\nFor scripts and styles that can&#8217;t take a nonce the browser will tell you a &#8216;sha-&#8216; value you can use. The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#8216;nonce-AAAAAAAAA&#8217;</strong><br />\nThe trust nonce value &#8211; this value is automatically generated per page refresh and should not be entered by the user. The single quotes are required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>data:</strong><br />\nAllow loading resources from data scheme &#8211; usually inline images. <strong>This is insecure</strong>; an attacker can also inject arbitrary data: URIs. Use this sparingly and definitely <strong>not for scripts</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>mediastream:</strong><br />\nAllows mediastream: URIs to be used as a content source.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>filesystem:</strong><br />\nAllow loading resource from file system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>https:</strong><br />\nOnly allows loading resources from HTTPS: on any domain. This can be used to block insecure requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>www.example.com</strong><br />\nAllow loading resources from this domain, using any scheme (http/https)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>&#042;.example.com</strong><br />\nAllow loading resourcs from any subdomain under example.com, using any scheme (http/https)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>http://www.example.com</strong><br />\nAllows loading resources from this domain using this scheme.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>/path/to/file/</strong><br />\nAllows loading any file from this path on this domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>/path/to/file/thefile</strong><br />\nAllows loading this one file on this domain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Security Headers</h4>\n<p>In addition to the CSP headers, there are other security headers supported, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expect-CT</strong><br />\nInstructs user agents (browsers) to expect valid Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strict Transport Security</strong><br />\nThe HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS)  lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>X-Frame-Options</strong><br />\nThe X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a &lt;frame&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;object&gt; . Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>X-XSS-Protection</strong><br />\nThe HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that disables the use of inline JavaScript (&#8216;unsafe-inline&#8217;), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don&#8217;t yet support CSP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong><br />\nThe X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed. This allows to opt-out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, it is a way to say that the webmasters knew what they were doing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Referrer-Policy</strong><br />\nThe Referrer-Policy HTTP header governs which referrer information, sent in the Referer header, should be included with requests made.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Written By</h3>\n<p>This plugin was written by Dylan Downhill, CDO of <a href=\"https://www.elixirinteractive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elixir Interactive</a> .</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<h4>Before You Start</h4>\n<p>I recommend you <em>move all styles and scripts into include files</em> &#8211; this will allow WP_CSP to approve the included file and will mean you can stop the browser running scripts that have been added to the page from an unknown source.<br />\nRead the ** Upgrade notice** for information on CSP version 3.</p>\n<h4>To Install</h4>\n<p>Follow the standard WordPress plugin installation procedures.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>plugin-name.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Visit the settings under &#8216;Settings-&gt;Content Security Policy Options&#8217;. I recommend you run this plugin in &#8216;report only&#8217; mode for a little while to help you set your CSP settings correctly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>To Upgrade</h4>\n<p>See the new CSP V3 tab on the admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the best way to set a content security policy</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you first turn on CSP, put into report-only mode and build the basic rules for your site. After about a week, turn off report-only and go to enforce rules.</p>\n<p>If you want to implement the latest W3C version of CSP &#8211; version 3 <a href=\"https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google recommends</a> &#8211; set the following for default-src, script-src, and style-src:<br />\n    &#8216;unsafe-inline&#8217; &#8216;unsafe-eval&#8217; &#8216;strict-dynamic&#8217; https: http:<br />\n(single quotes are required) This will allow modern browsers to run the latest version of CSP with nonces, etc. and older browsers to just work without restrictions.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to run CSP v2, one good way of building a policy for a site would be to begin with a default-src of &#8216;self&#8217;, and to build up a policy from there that contains only those resource types which are actually in use for the page you&#8217;d like to protect. If you don&#8217;t use webfonts, for instance, there&#8217;s no reason to specify a source list for font-src; specifying only those resource types a page uses ensures that the possible attack surface for that page remains as small as possible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I set &#8216;self&#8217; in all options</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually you will trust your own site for all directives; however, I usually only add &#8216;self&#8217; when it shows up as a violation. None of these directives is inherited, except some directives will default to &#8216;default-src&#8217; if not set explicitly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I set &#8216;*&#8217; in all options?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Usually you would want to keep security as strict as possible while still allowing your application to run. Therefore, &#8216;*&#8217; should be avoided.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have a different policy for each page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The W3C specification allows for a different policy for each page, this plugin was not written with page-level security capability.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have some options enforced and some report-only?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The W3C specification allows for this functionality; this plugin does not support this capability.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>No errors are getting logged</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>First check that your site is producing CSP errors by starting the developer tools in your browser (usually F12) and checking for messages in the console output.</li>\n<li>If nothing is in the console output then check the page has a CSP header by looking at the page in the &#8216;network&#8217; tab of the dev tools. Check the &#8216;response&#8217; has a header called &#8216;content-security-policy&#8217; or &#8216;content-security-policy-report-only&#8217; &#8211; if this is misisng then the plugin is not running or CSP is not enabled.</li>\n<li>If there is a CSP header and nothing is reported in the console then you have no violations and everything is running as it should. Yippee!</li>\n<li>If there is a CSP header and errors in the console then the REST route might not be registered properly. Go to /wp-json and look for &#8216;wpcsp&#8217; (usually CTRL-F for find and type in wpcsp) &#8211; if nothing is listed then the REST route is not getting registered.</li>\n<li>Look in the PHP error logs for an error &#8211; post the error, file name and line number in the support forums and I should be able to work out why it&#8217;s failing.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>CSP v3 Inline Scripts/Styles</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Inline scripts and styles can be dangerous, you do not know which scripts wrote them and probably don&#8217;t want them run if you can avoid it. When you use &#8216;script-dynamic&#8217;, the &#8220;unsafe-eval&#8221; and &#8220;unsafe-inline stop working and the browser will say in the console &#8220;Note that &#8216;unsafe-inline&#8217; is ignored if either a hash or nonce value is present in the source list.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To fix this either:<br />\n* Put all the scripts and/or style code into files and include the files.<br />\n* If the browser returns &#8220;Either the &#8216;unsafe-inline&#8217; keyword, a hash (<strong>&#8216;sha256-h3SEZNZpOYg4jp6TCkoWN7Z477Qt3q1owH0SPbz+a4M=&#8217;</strong>), or a nonce (&#8216;nonce-&#8230;&#8217;) is required to enable inline execution.&#8221; &#8211; you can take the SHA number (including single quotes) and put that in the policy line.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Big Does The Database Get</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is different for all sites. The plugin will automatically delete records older than one week to keep the size managable. Also, if too many records are found the system will only report on the worse errors to avoid locking your browser.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Handling the Violation Reports/Errors Is A Big Resouce Drain</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every error output by your browser is likely to result in a call to the server to log the error &#8211; if a page has 20 errors that&#8217;s 20 calls to your server &#8211; this can be a lot of processing power. To avoid this change the &#8220;Log Violations&#8221; option from &#8220;Yes, All&#8221; to &#8220;Yes &#8211; 10%&#8221;, &#8220;Yes &#8211; 1%&#8217;, or &#8220;Yes &#8211; 0.1%&#8221; &#8211; in each case the plugin will randomly allow only a set fraction of your visitors to report errors back to the server, they&#8217;re still enfored at the browser but no report will come back to your site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>X-XSS-Protection</strong><br />\nThe HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that disables the use of inline JavaScript (&#8216;unsafe-inline&#8217;), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don&#8217;t yet support CSP.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong><br />\nThe X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed. This allows to opt-out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, it is a way to say that the webmasters knew what they were doing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Referrer-Policy</strong><br />\nThe Referrer-Policy HTTP header governs which referrer information, sent in the Referer header, should be included with requests made.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Written By</h3>\n<p>This plugin was written by Dylan Downhill, CDO of <a href=\"https://www.elixirinteractive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elixir Interactive</a> .</p>\n",
