You could use multiple instances of the widget to have product dropdowns for each of your categories; you could display the top 5 most frequently bought products in a specific category; you could display the top 20 most reviewed products in your entire store or just in a specific category; and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p>For sites with a very large number of products, it is not recommended that you display all products in a single dropdown because it would be both heavy on server resources and also just be difficult to use.</p>\n",
