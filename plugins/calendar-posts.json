Pick dates to make the post available in the calendar. Set up the Calendar Posts widget under Appearace &gt; Widgets and posts will appear in a Calendar in your sidebar.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Under <code>wp-admin/widgets.php</code>. It&#8217;s called Calendar Posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the settings panel?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s none. You configure the calendar on each widget directly. There are some configurable vars at the top inside the plugin&#8217;s php-script file (for developers).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is that CSS code mentioned in the description?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s here:</p>\n<pre><code>.cp-month {\n    padding: 8px 0px 5px 0px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n}\n.cp-date-div {\n    margin: 0.4em 0px;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>The month names are shown in English even though WordPress is set to a different language?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Since PHP is showing month abbrevations wrong (typographicly) you have to set custom month names on your own at the top of the script file. Sorry. This is something I had to do since PHP&#8217;s abbrevations always appear with three letters which is wrong.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change how month names are shown?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This can be acheived inside the plugins php file. You should know some PHP and you&#8217;ll find how to add your own month abbrevations at the top of the script file. More details there.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
