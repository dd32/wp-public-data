I originally created this plugin because I looked everywhere, and I couldn&#8217;t find a plugin already out there, free or premium, that would do the simple fact of selling access to a particular page or post through WooCommerce.  So I decided to write my own.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce version 2.6+ to be installed and active</li>\n<li><strong>Guest checkout to be turned OFF</strong></li>\n<li>PHP 7.4+ is required</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How It Works</h4>\n<p>Getting everything setup will take you less than 5 minutes with three simple steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1</strong> Create a product in WooCommerce</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2</strong> Create a page or post in WordPress</li>\n<li><strong>Step 3</strong> Associate your product with your page using the Pay For Post with WooCommerce meta box.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s that simple.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the Premium version, you have several other options for protecting content like, time based, number of page views, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>How-to Videos</h4>\n<p><strong>How-to Install and Configure</strong><br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZepEicA3yeA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span><br />\n<strong>How-to Protect a Page/Post</strong><br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEjs8JCknFU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Demo</h3>\n<p>You can view a front-end demo by going to <a href=\"https://demo.pramadillo.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://demo.pramadillo.com</a> if you would like to schedule an admin demo please visit <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/support</a> and select Plugin Admin Demo.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict content from pages, posts and custom post types based on if they have purchased a specific WooCommerce product</li>\n<li>Ability to protect a single post or multiple posts with a single product</li>\n<li>Ability to protect posts with multiple products</li>\n<li>Simple to use</li>\n<li>Uses native WooCommerce functionality to ensure future compatibility</li>\n<li>Global restricted content message which is used for <strong>all</strong> protected content</li>\n<li>Utilize any standard WooCommerce shortcodes</li>\n<li><strong>PREMIUM ONLY</strong> Ability to override Restricted Content Message on a per page basis</li>\n<li><strong>PREMIUM ONLY</strong> Delay Restriction &#8211; This allows you to delay the paywall from appearing for a set amount of time.</li>\n<li><strong>PREMIUM ONLY</strong> Page View Restriction &#8211; This allows you to limit the number of page views the user who purchased this product has before the paywall reappears.

Take a look at <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/</a> for other available shortcodes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Template Functions</h4>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> Out of the box this plugin will work with any theme which uses the standard WordPress function <code>the_content()</code>. For those themes that do not utilize <code>the_content()</code> you can use the following static functions in your templates.</p>\n<pre><code>Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::has_access()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This checks if the current user has access to the page.  It returns true/false</p>\n<pre><code>Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::get_no_access_content()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This returns the content specified in the PPP Options.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a full example of this take a look at <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20installation%20and%20customization%20services%3F'>\nDo you offer installation and customization services?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you need help with installation and/or would like additional customization work done for your website, you can fill out a request form at <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/support</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20wish%20this%20plugin%20had%20xzy%20feature'>\nI wish this plugin had XZY feature\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While I try to do my best to incorporate new features all the time, I implemented a new Feature Request board located at <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/feature-requests\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/feature-requests</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20output%20from%20the%20shortcode%20to%20display%20the%20products%20needed%20to%20purchase%20to%20view%20content%20looks%20weird'>\nThe output from the shortcode to display the products needed to purchase to view content looks weird\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a default shortcode from WooCommerce.  Take a look at https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/#section-9</p>\n<p>Another thing you can try is to set the number of columns on the shortcode to disply only 1 column to do that you can change your shortcode to be [products ids='{{product_id}}&#8217; cols=&#8217;1&#8242;]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20custom%20post%20types%3F'>\nCan this plugin work with custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin worked with all custom post types.  In the settings you can add and remove which post types you would like the metabox to show up on.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20link%20to%20your%20post%20after%20an%20order%20has%20been%20placed%3F'>\nHow do you link to your post after an order has been placed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the premium version. 🙂 The premium version handles this for you.  However, if you are using the free version what I have done in the past is use the Order Notes for the product in WooCommerce. So what will happen is after they purchase, on the Payment Received page they will see the order notes, and they will get sent in the receipt also.</p>\n<p>So for instance, I have a Vimeo video that I embed in a page, on the Vimeo Product in WooCommerce I add the Password and notes on how to view the video, they gets transmitted via email and on the thank you page for the user.</p>\n<p><strong>For PREMIUM users, there is a built-in option to include the post links in the order email, confirmation screen and on the users My Account page.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20user%20accounts%20turned%20on%3F'>\nDo I need to have user accounts turned on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, in order to keep track of who purchased what, it is a requirement that all customers have user accounts/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20support%3F'>\nDo you offer support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I do the absolute best I can to support the free version of the plugin.  If you upgrade to the premium version you will have priority support.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

So I decided to write my own.</p>\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce version 2.6+ to be installed and active</li>\n<li><strong>Guest checkout to be turned OFF</strong></li>\n<li>PHP 7.4+ is required</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How It Works</h4>\n<p>Getting everything setup will take you less than 5 minutes with three simple steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1</strong> Create a product in WooCommerce</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2</strong> Create a page or post in WordPress</li>\n<li><strong>Step 3</strong> Associate your product with your page using the Pay For Post with WooCommerce meta box.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s that simple.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the Premium version, you have several other options for protecting content like, time based, number of page views, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>How-to Videos</h4>\n<p><strong>How-to Install and Configure</strong><br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZepEicA3yeA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span><br />\n<strong>How-to Protect a Page/Post</strong><br />\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEjs8JCknFU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>Demo</h3>\n<p>You can view a front-end demo by going to <a href=\"https://demo.pramadillo.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://demo.pramadillo.com</a> if you would like to schedule an admin demo please visit <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/support</a> and select Plugin Admin Demo.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict content from pages, posts and custom post types based on if they have purchased a specific WooCommerce product</li>\n<li>Ability to protect a single post or multiple posts with a single product</li>\n<li>Ability to protect posts with multiple products</li>\n<li>Simple to use</li>\n<li>Uses native WooCommerce functionality to ensure future compatibility</li>\n<li>Global restricted content message which is used for <strong>all</strong> protected content</li>\n<li>Utilize any standard WooCommerce shortcodes</li>\n<li><strong>PREMIUM ONLY</strong> Ability to override Restricted Content Message on a per page basis</li>\n<li><strong>PREMIUM ONLY</strong> Delay Restriction &#8211; This allows you to delay the paywall from appearing for a set amount of time.</li>\n<li><strong>PREMIUM ONLY</strong> Page View Restriction &#8211; This allows you to limit the number of page views the user who purchased this product has before the paywall reappears.

For those themes that do not utilize <code>the_content()</code> you can use the following static functions in your templates.</p>\n<pre><code>Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::has_access()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This checks if the current user has access to the page.  It returns true/false</p>\n<pre><code>Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::get_no_access_content()\n</code></pre>\n<p>This returns the content specified in the PPP Options.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a full example of this take a look at <a href=\"https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n",
