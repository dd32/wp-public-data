        "faq": "\n<h4>I am not getting a countdown. All I see is &#8220;No scheduled Posts&#8221;.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For this plugin to create a countdown timer there needs to be atleast one post scheduled to be posted at a future time. If you do not have any posts scheduled then you will not see a countdown because there is nothing to countdown to. I would suggest scheduling a test post so you can play around with the plugin and get the formatting how you want it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I schedule a post to be posted at a later time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you have completed writing a post, you have the option of posting it right away or scheduling it to post at a later time. You can do this by clicking on the &#8220;edit&#8221; link beside &#8220;Publish immediately&#8221; which is just above the save and publish buttons.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
