        "faq": "\n<h4>What Do I Enter in the Options Page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin Options page just has couple of text boxes where you put the bits of CSS you want to apply to highlighted comments. Don&#8217;t include <strong>{</strong> or <strong>}</strong>: just the CSS. For example, by default the plugin applies the CSS <code>padding: 1em</code> which &#8216;indents&#8217; the comment a little all round. If you wanted to also make the text red, for example, you would use <code>color: red; padding: 1em</code>.</p>\n<p>You can style the body of the comment itself and/or the link to the comment author.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>CSS Styling&#8230; What&#8217;s That?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is too complex a subject to go into here. A good resource is provided by the <a href=\"http://htmlhelp.com/reference/css/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Design Group</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How About Some Examples?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s where some artistry would be a help! In lieu of skill here are some examples to play with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>padding: 1em;</li>\n<li>padding-left: 20px;</li>\n<li>background-color: #FFFF95;</li>\n<li>border-left: 1em solid #DDD; padding: 1em;</li>\n<li>background: white url(http://www.yourblog.com/images/fluffy-clouds.gif) </li>\n<li>background-color: silver; margin-left: -2em; padding: 1em 1em 1em 2em; </li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How Does It Know Which Comments to Highlight?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin simply compares the email of the post author with the email of the commentor. This works fine as long as a post author is logged in when commenting. It will fail if the author is not logged in and uses a different email.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
