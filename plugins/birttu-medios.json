You can view the comments in real time, its content: text, if you share photos, Gifs, links, emoticons; the article in which the comment is made; the date and time; view the history of a commentator; access to data from commentators etc.</p>\n<p>Also in the <strong>Configuration</strong> menu you can choose whether you want the system to be <strong>&#8216;open&#8217;</strong> or with <strong>&#8216;previous revision&#8217;</strong>, even to apply a <strong>filter of words</strong> that, if contained, will keep the comment in &#8216;revision&#8217; even if the system is open. The system allows you to establish an email to receive notifications when there are comments, options such as choosing the color of the Widget, displaying the Widget displayed or in the <strong>form of a bar, enabling or disabling options</strong> such as sharing links, photos, gifs &#8230;</p>\n<p>Another <strong>&#8220;Speaks On / Off&#8221;</strong> menu allows you to activate or deactivate the comments Widget in a specific article</p>\n<p>Through the <strong>Ticket</strong> menu the site to transfer any doubt, development request or incident.</p>\n<p><strong>VALUE FOR THE USER</strong></p>\n<p>The comments system allows the user, in a novel way, to share text, but also insert images, GIF, external links, Birttu emoticons, respond to other users, name others in a conversation (which increases traffic flow) , vote for or against a certain comment (Ok and Ko)</p>\n<p>Some of the above functions can be disabled by the administrator of the site, if you consider it, from your Control Panel (Speak Panel)</p>\n<p>The Widget contains a chronological order (time line) but you can also sort the comments by the most valued or the most penalized (Incinerator)</p>\n<p>Birttu is designed to overcome the &#8216;digital barriers&#8217; for the user, and in this way the Widget makes it possible to comment as a &#8216;user&#8217; with a fast registration that only asks to choose an alias and a key to keep it in future uses, or as &#8216;profile&#8217; that records more complete data. If you choose the first mode, the user does not face a time-consuming record, and preserves their privacy with an alias. To receive notifications of answers, mentions and control the flow of comments in a story where you have commented, you must then complete the profile, for which you will have to validate a greater range of information that is provided as big data to the site that Birttu uses; and that is shown in its control panel, always with previous authorization of the user when creating the alias or profile, fulfilling the RGPD.</p>\n<p>The system is able to recognize a user as logged in, so you will not have to activate your alias and password for other comments, either in that or other URLs of the same website, or other sites that use Birttu.

In Birttu.com there are elements that follow as reference and sites that are available in the Comments Widget.

It has its commentator page to modify and change the settings. In this same profile, you can also receive notifications about new comments in articles where you have commented, mentions of users to call attention to an article, also receive notifications of response to your comments, can change the profile picture, etc.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>In the Plugins menu of your WordPress administrator Search for &#8220;Birttu&#8221; and download and start the installation</p>\n<p>Once downloaded and opened the Installation menu, 2 options appear: Login or Register. Only in the case that you have already installed the Start Session option on the Birttu site. If this is the first time you install Birttu on this site, choose Register and fill in the fields: Email, Password, Site name, URL of the site, Contact phone, Name of a responsible person, a User Tag and end by clicking on the button To register.</p>\n<p>With this step, the comments Widget will be launched in the articles of your site and users will be able to use it.</p>\n<p>Then the Birttu button will be enabled in the menu on the left of your WordPress administrator. Pressing displays the Control Panel window (Speak Panel). Enter the user&#8217;s email with which you previously registered and the password and you can now enter the panel. It is incompatible to have logged in as a comment manager and use that profile as a commentator.</p>\n",

Automatically send a report ticket to Birttu, which will analyze if the user&#8217;s behavior and contents contravene the Declaration of Rights and Responsibilities (DDR) and the Birttu Data Policy and may establish a temporary or definitive block of the user.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20contact%20birttu%3F'>\nHow do I contact Birttu?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>24-365 through the Ticket menu.

Birttu is served by loading in parallel so that the site loads on the one hand by calling your server and uploading it by calling your own server. Also keep in mind that it is served by encryption protocol https. In the same way, the content generated in the comments: text, photos, gifs etc, does not occupy a place in your server because Birttu cedes a partition in its servers to store all the content, and is also responsible for its protection.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20they%20use%20malicious%20code%20in%20the%20comments%3F'>\nCan they use malicious code in the comments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Birttu has provided tools against the implementation of malicious code through comments, and continuously implements security improvements that are applied with the update of the plugin (we recommend that you always keep the plugin updated with the latest version). In addition, as everything that the user dumps in the comments loads by the Birttu server, it will never interfere in the security or load of the site. There are also measures applied against Spam or the intervention of masked Bots in the form of real users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20birttu%20comply%20with%20the%20rgpd%20and%20how%20can%20i%20value%20the%20commentators%3F'>\nHow does Birttu comply with the RGPD and how can I value the commentators?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Birttu complies with all current legislation in the field of Data Protection, and maintains continuous audits for compliance with the RGPD.</p>\n<p>In addition, the relationship between users and the comments system is protected by a Data Policy and a Declaration of rights and responsibilities accepted by users and legally protected. The user is responsible for all comments made and Birttu is also responsible for protecting the sites in those behaviors that violate the rules.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the data of the profiles that Birttu provides in the Control Panel to the sites is previously accepted by Birttu users when the profile is created and all of them have access to the uses and services of the Data Policy, as well as tools to limit and configure your privacy options. In any case, the sites must also know the limitations on the use of the information they visualize about the commentators.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
