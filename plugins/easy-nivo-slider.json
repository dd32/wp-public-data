        "faq": "<p>Q: Why are there three slider sizes?  Does that mean I can only have three sliders on my site?</p>\n<p>You can have as many sliders as you like on your site.  You can even have multiple sliders in a single post, page, or in the sidebar.</p>\n<p>The slider sizes represent three <em>configurations</em> of sliders.  Each configuration specifies a slider size and behaviour.  You then add sliders to a page and indicate which of the three sizes to use.</p>\n<p>Q: How does the resizing work?</p>\n<p>Thanks to the awesome Filosofo Custom Image Sizes plugin, WordPress can generate scaled, cropped copies of images for you.</p>\n<p>Q: The NextGen sliders aren&#8217;t sizing correctly.</p>\n<p>NextGen has its own way of working with images, and this plugin doesn&#8217;t yet have the ability<br />\nto resize the images for the slider.  For now, NextGen sliders will be the actual size of the<br />\nimages in the galleries.</p>\n",
