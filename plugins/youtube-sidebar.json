        "description": "<p>YouTube Plugins are nothing new but I like to add my own approach to every plugin. This plugin allows the insertion<br />\nof a video ID for displaying with a specific post. The video is displayed instantly. This differs from plugins that<br />\nmay allow a single video to be added using an entire widget &#8211; not great use of a widget in my opinion. The YouTube<br />\nwidget management would become very busy if every widget was THAT basic. So the widgets in YouTube Sidebar will handle<br />\nmultiple videos and even ads when no videos are available.</p>\n<p>If this still is not enough.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Method 1: Move folder inside the .zip file into the &#8220;wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory if your website is stored locally. Then upload the new plugin folder using your FTP program.</li>\n<li>Method 2: Use your hosting control panels file manager to upload the plugin folder (not the .zip, only the folder inside it) to the &#8220;wp-content/plugins/&#8221; directory.</li>\n<li>Method 3: In your WordPress admin click on Plugins then click on Add New. You can search for your plugin there and perform the installation easily. This method does not apply to premium plugins.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I hire you to customize the plugin for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can pay the plugin author to improve the plugin to suit your needs. Many improvements will be done free so<br />\npost your requirements on the plugins forum first. However even a donation goes a long way to getting some priority.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>0.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Beta released 17th March 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>When To Update</h4>\n<p>Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not<br />\nhelp you &#8211; look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want<br />\nto avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version &#8211; do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation<br />\n(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different<br />\nenvironment for WTG Task Manager &#8211; possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common<br />\nin software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.</p>\n"
