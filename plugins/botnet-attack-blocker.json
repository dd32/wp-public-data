My plugin essentially ignores the different IP addresses and locks out all admin login attempts in a configurable way &#8211; so if you have it set to 5 failed attempts (default) then those 1,000 different computers will only have a total between them of 5 attempts.</p>\n<p>You can select how many login failures causes the lockout, how much time to allow between failures, how long to block logins for and also you can input a whitelisted IP address (or multiple addresses separated with commas or spaces) which can bypass the lockdown and always log in &#8211; so you can still always get into your site even in the middle of an attack.
