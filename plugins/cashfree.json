        "installation": "<p>Please note, this payment gateway requires WooCommerce 3.0 and above. To ensure seamless payment integration, it is necessary to comply with payment regulations by whitelisting your domain. Please click on the <a href=\"https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/developers-whitelisting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">link</a> provided to whitelist your domain.</p>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the WooCommerce Cashfree plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Cashfree&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can install it by simply clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;, then &#8220;Activate&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation\" rel=\"ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20cashfree%20payments%20plugin%20free%3F'>\nIs Cashfree Payments Plugin free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

Please reach out to cashfree?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You might be facing this issue because your domain is not yet whitelisted. But don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve got you covered! To resolve this, simply click on the <a href=\"https://docs.cashfree.com/docs/developers-whitelisting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">link</a> provided to whitelist your domain.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20should%20i%20do%20if%20i%27m%20using%20the%20cashfree%20payments%20plugin%20on%20multiple%20woocommerce%20domains%20and%20encounter%20duplicate%20order%20ids%3F'>\nWhat should I do if I&#8217;m using the Cashfree Payments plugin on multiple WooCommerce domains and encounter duplicate order IDs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No worries, we&#8217;ve got a simple solution for you! If you&#8217;re managing the Cashfree Payments plugin across multiple WooCommerce domains and you notice the possibility of duplicate order IDs due to sequential generation. To ensure a unique identification for orders originating from different domains, consider enabling the &#8220;Order ID Prefix&#8221; feature in the plugin&#8217;s configuration settings.<br />\nEnabling the order ID prefix guarantees a seamless experience for you and your customers. By adding a unique prefix to each order ID, you&#8217;ll effortlessly distinguish orders across your various domains.<br />\nDisabling the Enable Order Id Prefix after it&#8217;s been enabled might break post-order flows. Consider the implications before making changes.<br />\nPlease be mindful of the impact on your order management process before toggling this setting.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
