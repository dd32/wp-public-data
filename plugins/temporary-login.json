        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20need%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy do I need to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Temporary Login is a useful plugin that allows you to create an easy login option for temporary access to your website. If you need a support agent to help troubleshoot a problem or a colleague to make a simple change, just grant access and provide them with the URL. As soon as the work is done, you can disable access immediately.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20extend%20the%20access%20period%3F'>\nCan I extend the access period?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Access can be extended up to 1 week from the original expiration date by simply clicking the ‘Extend Access’ button and confirming the action.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20secure%20is%20the%20url%3F'>\nHow secure is the URL?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The URL is very secure. In fact, it would be easier for a hacker to determine your username and password than to figure out the encryption we use here.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20forget%20to%20revoke%20access%3F'>\nWhat if I forget to revoke access?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not to worry. The URL is automatically disabled at the expiration time with no action needed on your part.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20deleted%20the%20plugin%20but%20forgot%20to%20revoke%20access%20first%3B%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nI deleted the plugin but forgot to revoke access first; what should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing! We disable the access as soon as you delete the plugin, so there’s nothing for you to worry about.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
