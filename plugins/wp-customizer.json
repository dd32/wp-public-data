For a lot of people, WordPress out of the box plus one of the stock WordPress themes is enough. But the possibilities for customization are endless; you can add plugins and other themes. Sometimes these do just what you want. Sometimes you need to &#8230; tweak WordPress. A very high proportion of the customization advice you&#8217;ll find on the web starts with these lines &#8230; <em>add the following to the end of your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code></em> or even worse, advises that you modify the source code of your theme or your plugins. This is <em>bad</em> for many reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> makes <em>theme specific</em> customizations; change your theme and your customizations will no longer get loaded.</li>\n<li>When your theme and plugins get updated you&#8217;ll find all your careful hand crafted customizations get overwritten and lost.</li>\n<li>A lot of theme and plugin authors won&#8217;t offer support for changes you might have made to the source code.</li>\n<li>Your customizations might work; but you might also inadvertently make some other changes which will stop things working.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t yet support a way for site specific customizations to be made and loaded without touching theme, plugin or core files; that&#8217;s what this plugin is for. When WordPress does support such a way, this plugin will thankfully be obsolete.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get help or support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In short, very easily. But before you read any further, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.vicchi.org/codeage/asking-for-wordpress-plugin-help-and-support-without-tears/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Asking For WordPress Plugin Help And Support Without Tears</a> before firing off a question. In order of preference, you can ask a question on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-customizer\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress support forum</a>; this is by far the best way so that other users can follow the conversation. You can ask me a question on Twitter; I&#8217;m <a href=\"http://twitter.com/vicchi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@vicchi</a>. Or you can drop me an email instead. I can&#8217;t promise to answer your question but I do promise to answer and do my best to help.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a web site for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. Go to the <a href=\"http://www.vicchi.org/codeage/wp-customizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Customizer home page</a> for the latest information. There&#8217;s also the official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-customizer/\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress plugin repository page</a> and the <a href=\"http://vicchi.github.com/wp-customizer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">source for the plugin is on GitHub</a> as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve installed this plugin but it doesn&#8217;t do anything?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default the plugin installs with no customizations loading; you&#8217;ll need to enable them as you need. See the <em>Installation</em> section for more details on how to do this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t know PHP or JavaScript or jQuery or CSS; what customizations do I need?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To answer the first part of this question, it&#8217;s probably best to start at the beginning and get a solid grounding in these tools and technologies before you start making customizations.</p>\n<p>To answer the second part of this question, if you don&#8217;t know what customizations you need then this plugin probably isn&#8217;t for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want to load all of the functions, scripts or CSS files I have; can I select which ones get loaded?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Customizer looks in each of the directories that you&#8217;ve configured (or left as the default) for each type of customization to load. To stop a specific file loading, simply rename it so that the first character of the file name is the underscore (<code>_</code>) character and that file will be skipped over when the plugin is looking for files to load. If other words, just rename <code>foo.php</code> to <code>_foo.php</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m a WordPress power user and want to specify things like dependencies for my scripts or make my CSS customizations load in the page footer; can I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Take a look at the <em>Filter Support and Usage</em> section for information on how to use the plugin&#8217;s filters to do all of this and more. In fact, by using the plugin&#8217;s filters you can specify every single option that the WordPress <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>wp_enqueue_script</code></a> and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>wp_enqueue_style</code></a> API calls accept.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve enabled functions/scripts/css and supplied a path but my function/script/css isn&#8217;t loading?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a couple of things that might be happening here. Your file type might be incorrect; your path might not exist or be readable, your file might not exist or be readable or your file might be disabled (starting with an &#8216;_&#8217;). The plugin&#8217;s Debug tab is designed to help<br />\ndiagnose this sort of thing. The Debug tab performs a dry run, without actually loading any files, and checks that files and directories exist and are readable. If you see any entries highlighted in yellow then this will indicate that a file is probably disabled. If you see any entries highlighted in red then this will indicate that a file or directory either doesn&#8217;t exist or is not able to be read.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WP Customizer has crashed my website/killed my cat/made it rain; what do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is unlikely but always possible. A customization file with errors in it can have unforeseen consequences. If this does happen firstly disable all your customization files by renaming them to have an underscore (<code>_</code>) as the first character. Hopefully things will be OK again. Now rename each customization file back by removing the underscore, one by one, to narrow down which one breaks things. Now would also be a good time to define <code>WP_DEBUG</code> in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file to get some helpful error messages in your PHP log file.</p>\n<p>For the cases of expired felines or sudden precipitation, this is way outside what a WordPress plugin can do; it&#8217;s probably an unfortunate coincidence.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is all this talk of &#8220;customization&#8221;; I&#8217;m British and it&#8217;s spelt &#8220;customisation&#8221; &#8230; ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m British too and yes, it&#8217;s spelt <em>customisation</em> over here, not <em>customization</em>. As both Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw are quoted as saying <a href=\"http://www1c.btwebworld.com/quote-unquote/p0000149.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8216;<em>(Britain and America are) two nations, separated by a common language</em>&#8216;</a>. By default, WP Customizer uses American English, but if you&#8217;re British and you want British English instead, simply define <code>WP_LANG</code> to have a value of <code>en_GB</code> in your site&#8217;s <code>wp-config.php</code> and WP Customizer will automagically become WP Customiser.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>WP Customizer isn&#8217;t available in my language; can I submit a translation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress and this plugin use the gettext tools to support internationalisation. The source file containing each string that needs to be translated ships with the plugin in <code>wp-customizer/lang/src/wp-customizer.po</code>. See the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">I18n for WordPress Developers</a> page for more information or get in touch for help and hand-holding.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to amend/hack/augment this plugin; can I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Totally; this plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLV2).
