Collect social security numbers on job applications, medical information like intake paperwork, and anything else you want secured with our plugin.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to get setup. Install our plugin, request the API key, and then set the forms you wish to be routed through our secure API &amp; stored securely, instead of on your server in plaintext. Only Administrators &amp; those with the role of Secure Forms can view form data through our plugin. Every request is logged, so you can see who viewed what form, their IP address, and their action taken.</p>\n<p>When a form is submitted, it is encrypted server side first, transmitted securely to our server, and then encrypted again. We double encrypt it to give your data the safeguards it deserves.</p>\n<p>Our API key makes sure that only your site can read the data, too. The API key is mapped to your domain name, ensuring nobody can steal the API key and then read the data on a different domain.</p>\n<p>Our free plan includes 1 form covered &amp; 25 form entries per month.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20hipaa%20compliance%3F'>\nWhat is HIPAA Compliance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAA is the law enacted by the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services. It establishes a set of policies &amp; procedures that forces medical practices &amp; anyone collecting or storing health information about anyone to maintain strict security &amp; establish safeguards.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20encryption%3F'>\nWhat is encryption?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Encryption is almost the same as HIPAA compliance, except there is no agreement required to be signed by both parties.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20encryption%20%26%20hipaa%20compliance%20different%3F'>\nHow are encryption &amp; HIPAA compliance different?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>HIPAA establishes what is called business associates, meaning anyone who is a vendor, contractor, agency, or provider of any services to a business that collects or has access to health information must sign a business associate agreement (BAA). The only difference between what we call encryption &amp; HIPAA compliant forms is HIPAA compliant forms are required to sign a BAA, whereas simply encrypted forms do not. Both services have the exact same fundamental security, one simply requires an agreement.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20uses%20encrypted%20forms%3F'>\nWho uses encrypted forms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Law firms, schools, accountants, or anyone who needs to collect sensitive information that should be protected. Use cases include client intake forms, school registration papers, and applications that require social security numbers, drivers licenses, etc.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
