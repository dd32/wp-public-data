Thats it! You could now access your tracker via accessing the page you just created. The UI could easily be styled via the style file included.</p>\n<p>For best appearance, use a single-column page template for the tracker (no sidebar) and disable comments and pingbacks. but it will work either way.</p>\n<p>Settings for the plugin could be found under Settings &gt;&gt; Issue Tracker</p>\n",
