Please read the information about it in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/dofollow-case-by-case/faq/\" title=\"FAQ section\" rel=\"ugc\">FAQ section</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>What can I do with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>This plugin allows you to set links in comments to be dofollow instead of nofollow. When editing a comment, now you have the option to remove the rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; attributes from the links contained in them.<br />\nTo make it easier, you can also setup commenters emails whose links in comments should always be dofollow and you can even set their Author URL when commenting to be dofollow.<br />\nOn the other side you can also define URLs that when contained in a comment are always dofollow, so that you can setup links to your own sites to be always dofollow.</p>\n<p>In order to add commenter&#8217;s emails or URLs to the white list, please go to <strong>DoFollow &gt; DoFollow</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>DoFollow &gt; White List Email</strong>: The Email White List contains a list of emails of commenters, whose links in comments are allways dofollow.

Instead of removing the re=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; from all comments links and have the possibilty to add the rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; case by case, we wanted to leave the rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; and all comments and have the possibility to remove them only from some comments.</p>\n<p>And the last plugin we liked is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-dofollow/\" title=\"Smart DoFollow\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart DoFollow</a> which lets you automatically give DoFollow links to authors of comments that are longer than a given number of chars. This is intersting, but very dangerous as today all comment spam is quite long and has many characters.</p>\n<h4>DoFollow Case by Case Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>This first release is avaliable in English and Spanish.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20dofollow%20case%20by%20case%20good%20for%3F'>\nWhat is Dofollow Case by Case good for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Links have a value. With Dofollow Case by Case you can decide yourself where the value goes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20make%20use%20of%20the%20dofollow%20case%20by%20case%20seo%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy should I make use of the Dofollow Case by Case SEO Plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you work with WordPress you normally have no chance to decide yourself if a link should be a real link or not. All your comment links and comment author links are deactivated for search engines by default. But for good reasons you might want to punish only those links that really seem to be spam. To make it easier for you the plugin comes with nofollow links by default but you can follow the links that are valuable.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20nofollow%20case%20by%20case%20make%20changes%20to%20the%20database%3F'>\nDoes Nofollow Case by Case make changes to the database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. It creates a new table: &#8220;nodofollow&#8221;.<br />\n* If you activate the plugin and the table doesn&#8217;t exist, the plugin creates it.<br />\n* If you desactivate the plugin, the table isn&#8217;t deleted.<br />\n* If you delete the plugin, the table is deleted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20check%20out%20if%20the%20plugin%20works%20for%20me%3F'>\nHow can I check out if the plugin works for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After activating Dofollow Case by Case visit a post with comments and have a look into the source code of that page. All your comments should have rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; or rel=&#8221;external nofollow&#8221; attributes.</p>\n<p>Now visit your admin page and edit one of the comments for testing purposes: Check the dofollow checkbox.</p>\n<p>Visit your post and make sure that every link works fine. Have a look into the source code again. Your modified comment links should now be follow links. All the other links in comments should be left as nofollow links.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='something%20seems%20not%20to%20work%20as%20expected.%20why%20not%3F'>\nSomething seems not to work as expected. Why not?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The primary job of Dofollow Case by Case is to find and replace variants of rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221;. For this to work we need a proper link that can be analyzed and replaced. WordPress has several functions included. Some deliver a URL only, other functions deliver a complete link including an anchor, a link text and so on.</p>\n<p>Theme developers and plugin authors can choose from all these functions to include some links into the system whereever this makes sense. Dofollow Case by Case is normally not able to modify a single URL. This can not be modified by PHP directly because it hooks into other functions somewhere else (later). Those functions can be modified but not the original input, not the &#8220;comment author url&#8221; itself. Whenever possible you should use a standard function like &#8220;get_comment_author_link&#8221; to receive a complete link in your template that later can easily be modified with standard functions of Dofollow Case by Case. Let us know if you have issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20remove%20dofollow%20case%20by%20case%3F'>\nHow can I remove Dofollow Case by Case?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can simply activate, deactivate or delete it in your plugin management section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20known%20incompatibilities%3F'>\nAre there any known incompatibilities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>The plugin should not be used together with other plugins with similar funcionalities</strong> like: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nofollow-case-by-case/\" title=\"Nofollow Case by Case\" rel=\"ugc\">Nofollow Case by Case</a>,<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nofollow-case-by-case/\" title=\"Nofollow Case by Case\" rel=\"ugc\">Nofollow Case by Case</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nofollow/\" title=\"Ultimate Nofollow\" rel=\"ugc\">Ultimate Nofollow</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nofollow-free/\" title=\"Nofollow Free\" rel=\"ugc\">Nofollow Free</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-dofollow/\" title=\"Smart DoFollow\" rel=\"ugc\">Smart DoFollow</a>.
