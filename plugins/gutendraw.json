        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20gutendraw%3F'>\nWhy should I use GutenDraw?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By using GutenDraw, you can elevate your content with visually appealing diagrams that enhance understanding and engagement, all while enjoying a seamless and efficient creation process.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20installed%20the%20plugin%3B%20what%27s%20next%3F'>\nI installed the plugin; what&#8217;s next?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once activated, the plugin will automatically create a menu where you can create diagrams and set up plugin options. Just go to &#8220;GutenDraw&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;All Diagrams&#8221; and start creating your own sketches and schemas.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20for%20any%20user%20to%20create%20and%20modify%20diagrams%3F'>\nIs it possible for any user to create and modify diagrams?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Everything is under the control of the administrator. Our GutenDraw plugin has fine-grained permission settings, allowing you to customize the security policy differently for each role. For example, some roles can create, view, edit, and publish diagrams, while others are only allowed to view them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20gutendraw%20work%20with%20gutenberg%3F'>\nDoes GutenDraw work with Gutenberg?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely! GutenDraw is compatible with the new block editor called Gutenberg.

If your page builder or third-party plugin uses the standard WordPress media modal dialog to select images, the plugin will also work and display folders.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20sites%20is%20a%20gutendraw%20pro%20license%20valid%20for%3F'>\nHow many sites is a GutenDraw Pro license valid for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The GutenDraw Pro license is valid for one domain (including subdomains).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20developer%20version%20hosted%3F'>\nWhere is the developer version hosted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The developer version is available <a href=\"https://github.com/yalogica/gutendraw\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27d%20like%20access%20to%20more%20features%20and%20support.%20how%20can%20i%20get%20this%3F'>\nI&#8217;d like access to more features and support.
