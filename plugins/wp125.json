Not only do you have to find advertisers to sponsor your blog, you have to manually edit your template to put the ad in, and then head over to your favorite calendar app to set an alert to remind you when to take the ad down.</p>\n<p>Time consuming practices like those are a thing of the past. The WP125 plugin can help you manage your ads more efficiently, leaving you with more time to write new posts. The plugin adds a new &#8220;Ads&#8221; menu to the WordPress admin, featuring submenus for tweaking display settings and adding and removing ads.</p>\n<p>Features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One or two column ad display, and support through template tags to implement your own unconventional design.</li>\n<li>Show as many ads as you want, and in either manual or random order</li>\n<li>Keep track of how many times an ad is clicked</li>\n<li>When creating a new ad, you don&#8217;t have to calculate the end date yourself. Just input how many days you wish the ad to run for, and the correct date will be applied. The ad will be automatically taken down when the time comes.</li>\n<li>When an ad run is over, the record is archived on the Inactive ads screen, so you can check on the final click count, or revive the ad for another run.</li>\n<li>When an ad slot is empty, a placeholder ad of your choice will be displayed. This could be a &#8220;Your Ad Here&#8221; image linking to a page with statistics and pricing, or an affiliate link.</li>\n<li>Optionally recieve email notifications when an ad expires. Useful if you send follow-up messages to advertisers, or if you just want to stay in the know.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Upgrading</h3>\n<p>You may upgrade the plugin via the automated system in WordPress 2.5 or greater, or &#8220;old-style&#8221; by downloading the new one and then<br />\n1.

Reactivating plugin</p>\n<h3>Known Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have WP Super Cache installed on your blog, it may conflict with WP125&#8217;s click tracking feature. To fix this, add &#8220;index.php&#8221; on a new line in the &#8220;Rejected URLs&#8221; field of the WP Super Cache options page. This will disable caching for yourblog.com/index.php. If someone goes to yourblog.com, they will still get the cached version, but since WP125&#8217;s click tracker URLs look like &#8220;/index.php?adclick=1,&#8221; they will avoid the cache.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having a problem with the plugin, try posting on the official WordPress forum at https://wordpress.org/support/ (be sure to use the tag &#8220;WP125&#8221;!).

The tag will return one ad with minimal formatting (simply <a></a>). You can use multiple instances of the tag in your template to set lay your ad slots out in whatever way you choose.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='one%20of%20my%20ads%20hit%20it%27s%20expiration%20date.%20where%20did%20it%20go%3F'>\nOne of my ads hit it&#8217;s expiration date. Where did it go?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When an ad&#8217;s time duration is over, it disappears off your site, and is removed from the Active ads page in the WordPress admin. To access the record, just click the &#8220;Inactive&#8221; link on the Manage screen. The page should update to show all of your inactive ads.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20want%20an%20ad%20to%20be%20taken%20down%20automatically%3F'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t want an ad to be taken down automatically?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just select &#8220;I&#8217;ll remove it manually&#8221; for the expiration date when you go to create the ad.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20style%20my%20ads%20different%20than%20the%20default%3F'>\nHow do I style my ads different than the default?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, uncheck the Default Style box on the Settings page. This will remove the default styling. Next, make use of your mad CSS skills to re-style the ads. Here&#8217;s what the default CSS looks like:</p>\n<p>`/* Styles for one-column display */</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='wp125adwrap_1c%20.wp125ad%20%7B%20margin-bottom%3A10px%3B%20%7D'>\nwp125adwrap_1c .wp125ad { margin-bottom:10px; }\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>/* Styles for two-column display */</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='wp125adwrap_2c%20.wp125ad%20%7B%20width%3A125px%3B%20float%3Aleft%3B%20padding%3A10px%3B%20%7D%60'>\nwp125adwrap_2c .wp125ad { width:125px; float:left; padding:10px; }`\n</h4>\n<p></p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20make%20the%20ads%20open%20in%20a%20new%20window%3F'>\nHow do I make the ads open in a new window?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you absolutely <em>must</em> have your ads open in a new window when clicked, open the wp125.php file and find the <code>define(...</code> line near the top and remove the first <code>//</code> from the beginning.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20slot%20dropdown%20missing%20when%20i%20try%20to%20add%20a%20new%20banner%3F'>\nWhy is the Slot dropdown missing when I try to add a new banner?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Turn off AdBlock. It indiscriminately zaps page elements containing the word &#8220;ad,&#8221; which means you&#8217;re going to have a bad time managing ads&#8230;</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20ads%20don%27t%20appear%20in%20two%20columns%2C%20even%20though%20i%20have%20the%20option%20set%21%20how%20do%20i%20fix%20this%3F'>\nMy ads don&#8217;t appear in two columns, even though I have the option set! How do I fix this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The parent DIV that the ad code is inside probably isn&#8217;t wide enough. You really need a <em>minimum</em> of 250px of horizontal space to have two ad columns, more if you use the default CSS. You could try reducing the CSS padding around the ads from 10px to something lower.</p>\n<pre><code>#wp125adwrap_2c .wp125ad { padding:4px; }\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
