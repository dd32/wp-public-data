        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I test that the plugin is working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add the query parameter ?cctestmode=accept to accept all cookies regardless of settings.  Add the query parameter ?cctestmode=decline to decline all cookies regardless of settings.</p>\n<p>For example: http://www.mycompliantsite.com/mypage.html would become http://www.mycompliantsite.com/mypage.html?cctestmode=decline</p>\n<p>By using the decline option, you can conduct a manual cookie audit on your site and hopefully see that no intrusive cookies are being set (remember to clear your cookies first).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use my own &#8216;privacy settings&#8217; link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you like, you can define your own links to the privacy settings dialog.  Just create a link and add a class of cc-privacy-link.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will probably want to use this in conjunction with the Hide Privacy Settings Tab option in &#8216;Settings&#8217; -&gt; &#8216;Cookie Confirm&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who made this awesome script?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The original script was built by Skilltide and you can find more info here &#8211; http://silktide.com/cookieconsent. Fish Can&#8217;t Whistle just turned it into a WordPress plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How much does it cost to use this service?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing! The good folks at Skilltide have made this a free project!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will using this plugin make my site EU Compliant</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using Cookie Confirm is not a guarantee of compliance with the new law. You are responsible for the cookies which your website sets. This plugin is designed to help you gain consent for (and control the usage of) cookies on your website.
