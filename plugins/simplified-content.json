We didn&#8217;t want to generate alternative content for such old browsers, but we wanted to offers visitors &#8216;something&#8217; to work with, even if that content was degraded.  As we developed the plugin, we realised that it would also be useful for our WordPress based intranet systems.  For example, one system we have is for IE11, only.  Any body visiting the intranet site from other browsers is presented with a friendly reminder message.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
