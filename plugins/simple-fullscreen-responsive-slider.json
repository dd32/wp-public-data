        "description": "<p>Simple Fullscreen Responsive Slider (or Simple Slider) is exactly that—an<br />\neasy-to-use, lightweight, responsive slider plugin designed to add a fullscreen<br />\nslide show to your front page. It supports multiple post thumbnails for slide<br />\nbackgrounds, has no branding, and you can edit all the CSS directly from the<br />\noptions page (or add it into your stylesheet and leave the custom CSS blank).</p>\n<p><strong>DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY</strong></p>\n<p>Or perhaps this section should read &#8220;client-friendly&#8221; as the plugin has no<br />\nbranding on the slide editor or options page. Our goal was to create a useful<br />\nslider that other developers would feel comfortable with and enjoy using on<br />\nclient projects. Note: The plugin is intended for developers and changing its<br />\nappearance requires customizing the default CSS.</p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOMIZABLE</strong></p>\n<p>The plugin provides either a fading or sliding transition (with customizable<br />\nslide and effect durations), slide overlays, and allows developers to edit all<br />\nCSS directly from the options screen. Alternatively, you can leave the custom<br />\nCSS blank and add the required styles into your main stylesheet.</p>\n<p><strong>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</strong></p>\n<p>When combined with Chris Scott/VOCE Platform&#8217;s awesome Multiple Post Thumbnails<br />\nplugin (see <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/multiple-post-thumbnails/\" rel=\"ugc\"><br />\nMultiple Post Thumbnails</a>), users can attach up to six separate images for a<br />\ntrue responsive slider. The plugin will prompt for six different backgrounds and<br />\nuse those images according to the device used (instead of sending large images<br />\nto mobile devices and/or low resolution images to retina and 4K displays). If<br />\nyou leave a slot open, it will search subsequently smaller sized images so, at<br />\na minimum, you must attach an image to the smallest slot.</p>\n<p>The slider uses Patrick Kunka&#8217;s EasyFader jQuery plugin (visit<br />\nhttps://github.com/patrickkunka/easyfader for more information).</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p><strong>INSTALLING THE PLUGIN</strong></p>\n<p>The plugin can be installed and activated in the usual fashion. See<br />\n<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Managing<br />\nPlugins</a> if you need help with this.</p>\n<p><strong>ADDING THE CODE</strong></p>\n<p>You will need to manually edit your theme and insert the following code to display<br />\nthe slider. This is typically added after your opening body or header tag and<br />\nit will only work on your front page. The slider will not display properly if<br />\nthis is wrapped in additional tags.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if (shortcode_exists( 'simple-slider' )) : do_shortcode( '[simple-slider]' ); endif; ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>SAVING THE OPTIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Lastly, you will need to, at a minimum, visit the slider options page and save<br />\nthe default options to the options database. You can do this from the newly<br />\ncreated &#8220;Settings &gt; Slider Options&#8221; page. From here, you can style the slider<br />\nby customizing the default CSS. As this plugin is designed for other developers<br />\nthe default CSS is quite basic.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Let us know if you have any questions or suggestions!</p>\n<p>Q.  What happens if I use MultiPostThumbnails but do not fill (attach) all of the image sizes?<br />\nA.  The plugin will search for subsequently smaller sized images and use them to construct the media queries. As a result, the first (and smallest) image slot is required.</p>\n<p>Q.  What are the image sizes used by Simple Slider?<br />\nA.  On its own, Simple Slider provides one featured image slot for a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; background. If you have Multiple Post Thumbnails installed, Simple Slider will instead prompt for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smartphones: 888px by 888px (max-width: 1136px)</li>\n<li>Tablets: 1366px by 768px (max-width: 1599px)</li>\n<li>Laptops: 1600px by 900px (max-width: 1919px)</li>\n<li>Desktops: 1920px by 1080px (max-width: 2559px)</li>\n<li>Retina Displays: 2560px by 1600px (max-width: 3839px)</li>\n<li>4K Displays: 3840px by 2160px (min-width: 3839px) </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Q.  I can&#8217;t get my slider to show up on my home page?<br />\nA.  Chances are it&#8217;s getting wrapped with another tag that does not have the correct CSS.</p>\n<p>Q.  How do I style the slider?<br />\nA.  The slider is intended for web designers and so customizing the appearance requires changing the default CSS.</p>\n",
