        "faq": "\n<h4>\nCan I get multiple valuations using the Flippa plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. Once installed the Flippa Online Business Valuation plugin can be used at any time to get an up-to-date valuation for your online business.  The Flippa plugin relies on real-time sales data for your online store, benchmarked against historical sales data from the Flippa marketplace, so your valuation is likely to be changing all the time.  It pays to keep the plugin installed and check it often.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo I have to pay for this valuation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the Flippa Online Business Valuation plugin and the valuations you’ll receive from Flippa are totally free, and you can use it as many times as you like.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I use the Flippa plugin without registering at Flippa?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can use the Flippa Online Business Valuation plugin without being a Flippa member.  You just need a WooCommerce store, and the Flippa plugin installed, and you’re up and running.  Of course if you do register at Flippa, you can keep an eye on businesses like yours that are selling, and educate yourself about the market, and how to maximize your valuation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs the Flippa Valuation accurate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Flippa has more historical sales data than anyone else, and is the largest marketplace for buying and selling digital businesses, with over 10 years of sales history.  Most of the information we need about your business to calculate your valuation is extracted from your past WooCommerce sales data. However, there are a few extra data points that we’ll need you to provide us with to complete your valuation.  If the information you provide is accurate, your valuation will be in the ballpark of what you could expect to sell it for on the Flippa marketplace.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow do I sell my business?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you wish to list your online store for sale, or chat to us about your business, head on over to <a href=\"https://flippa.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Flippa</a> or <a href=\"https://flippa.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact Us</a>, we’d love to hear from you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
