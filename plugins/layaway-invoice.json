        "faq": "<p>What do you mean by &#8220;Own Your Own Layaway Program&#8221;? 100% of the &#8220;layaway&#8221; or &#8220;bill pay&#8221; plugins on the WooCommerce market are built by providers that run credit checks on your customers for a simple layaway. With our plugin, you own it. You decide you can enter the layaway. You decide the terms and you decide how much money is due at time or purchase all the way through the last payment. You can even leave it up to the customer to make appropriate payments as they see fit, as long as it’s paid in full by the deadline you set. You own the layaway program.<br />\n    Can I use this plugin as a bill pay plugin instead? One example of how the layaway plugin can be used as a bill pay plugin would be as a simple services invoice. Let’s say you own a mechanics shop and serviced a customer’s car. Simply enter the total bill due in the layaway plugin along with the customer’s information and e-mail. This would allow the customer to either pay the bill in its entirety from their phone/PC/tablet or to make payments as you set forth for larger repairs.<br />\n    What if I own a Brick-and-Mortar store? Can I use this for instore layaway? Yes! With our layaway plugin, you can start the sale in store by either taking 30% down (or whatever percentage you decide) immediately or by taking the information from the customer and entering it into the layaway plugin. If you take the 30% down in store, you’d simply enter the remaining balance due in the plugin. When paid off in full, the customer gets the product.<br />\n    How do I use this plugin? The Layaway Plugin enables partial invoice payments. Simply enter the customer&#8217;s name, email, and send them the invoice to pay directly within WooCommerce My Account using Authorize.net.<br />\n    Are there any credit checks or prerequisites for my customers? No. Unlike other similar plugins/programs out there, our Layaway Plugin does not require anything from the customer other than 30% down (or whatever amount you decide to require). This way, more customers are able to take advantage of the program you offer, thus increasing sales to new customers.<br />\n    Can I use the layaway plugin for simple invoice payment requests? Yes, one of the most popular ways our plugin is used for is invoicing customers. Rather than allowing payments over time, you can simply send an invoice to a customer for $X. This allows the customer to receive an automated e-mail, showing bill amount, date due, AND allow payment by clicking the link in the e-mail and arriving to your WooCommerce website.<br />\n    How do I uninstall the plugin? Simply deactivate and delete the plugin.<br />\n    Does it work with WooCommerce orders? Yes, it works seamlessly with WooCommerce orders and the checkout process.</p>\n",
