        "description": "<p>This plugin started from an older plugin named WoWpi. That plugin was developped with the gamer in mind. But then, it seemed that a lot of guilds wanted to use the plugin for their needs. So that plugin kept evolving until it couldn&#8217;t anymore.</p>\n<p>This time I am working on a plugin that revolves around guilds in World of Warcraft. I hope it will evolve further, becoming the go to tool for a guild&#8217;s website needs.</p>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<p><strong>Guild Roster</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Character post types</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recruitment Widget</strong></p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Roster</h4>\n<p>After installation, it is time to use it. Until now, we have access to the guild roster by using a shortcode:</p>\n<p>&#8216;[wowpi_guild_roster]&#8217; allows you to show your guild&#8217;s members. The shortcode also accepts additional parameters. These are:</p>\n<p><em>ranks=&#8221;0|1|2&#8243;</em> &#8211; this will only show the guild roster with the ranks 0 (Guild Master), Rank 1 and Rank 2</p>\n<p><em>ranks=&#8221;0:Guild Master|1:Wolves|2:Pups&#8221;</em> &#8211; this will allow you to have custom names for your ranks in the roster.</p>\n<p><em>id=&#8221;your_custom_id_for_table&#8221;</em> &#8211; this will add the <code>id</code> attribute to the table. Only do this if you want to radically change the way the table looks.</p>\n<p><em>class=&#8221;custom_css_class&#8221;</em> &#8211; this will allow you to add/change a CSS class to your table.</p>\n<p><em>rows=&#8221;25&#8243;</em> &#8211; this will allow you to paginate your table, each page having 25 or any number of members you wish per page.</p>\n<p><em>rows=&#8221;all&#8221;</em> &#8211; this will allow you to have the whole guild roster shown, without pagination.</p>\n<p><em>order_by=&#8221;level desc&#8221;</em> &#8211; this will allow you to set an ordering of the listing; the possible choices are: &#8216;name&#8217;, &#8216;level&#8217;, &#8216;rank&#8217;. The next value is &#8216;asc&#8217; or &#8216;desc&#8217;, depending on which type of ordering you want &#8211; ascending or descending.</p>\n<p><em>show_search=&#8221;0&#8243;</em> &#8211; if you don&#8217;t want to show the search field above the roster you can set the show_search to 0</p>\n<p><em>show_select_page_length=&#8221;0&#8243;</em> &#8211; if you don&#8217;t want to allow the users to choose how many rows to see per page set this parameter to 0</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>[wowpi_guild_roster ranks=\"0:Guild Master|1:Wolves|2:Pups\" rows=\"25\" order_by=\"rank\" show_select_page_length=\"0\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can set as many rosters you wish on a page.</p>\n<h4>Members post type</h4>\n<p>If you are a developer, or know a thing or two about creating templates for custom post types, now you can create character pages for you guild members, in which you can have a personal description. I didn&#8217;t use the body of the post thinking that this would be a great way to allow players to tell their own story about their character.</p>\n<p>Later on, I will concentrate on that part by making default templates that will allow any admins to have an idea about how they can change the pages themselves.</p>\n<h4>Recruitment widget</h4>\n<p>Do you need to increase your ranks with specific classes and/or specializations. You can use the new WoWpi Recruitment Widget in order to tell the world what are your guild&#8217;s needs.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nIs this plugin a new version of WoWpi plugin ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this is a total different breed. It adds custom post types specific to characters, taxonomies specific to races, classes, specializations, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs this de go to tool?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, but it aims to be. With the help of your inputs, I will keep on working on this plugin. Also, please become a patreon of my work (https://www.patreon.com/wowpi).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
