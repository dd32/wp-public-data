        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the TOCC plugin to your <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory and activate it.</li>\n<li>Edit the TOCC settings using the admin page located under settings.</li>\n<li>Place <code>&lt;!-- toc-creator --&gt;</code> anywhere on a page or use the page generator on the admin page. Use the HTML editor when placing the tag.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>When I add a new page or post, do I need to tell TOCC?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. TOCC will automatically add new pages, blog categories and entries, forum comments and links to the table of contents. A new table of contents is generated every time the page is displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where does the Summarizer get its text from?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Summarizer is a great feature of TOCC that automatically produces a short summary of each page or post. It first attempts to retrieve the summary from the All in One SEO Plugin. If none was found, it then looks inside a custom META tag, then the post excerpt, then the post content. If all this fails, a message is displayed indicating that no description exists for this page or post. The summary is then stripped of any HTML tags and truncated to a configurable length before it is displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is it that some static pages don&#8217;t display in the table of contents?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Private pages are not included in the table of contents. Furthermore, you can inhibit pages from displaying using the admin settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is an anchor link?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anchor links are <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags that have been marked with a special class. For example, TOCC may be configured so that any anchor tags that include the text <code>class=\"tocc\"</code> will be included as a link in the table of contents. Note that the class identifier can be changed via the admin settings page. This feature may be used to include pages on other websites, download links, PDFs and so on.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I edit the way the table of contents is displayed?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Definitely! There are many options on the admin settings page that allow you to individualise the way the the TOC is displayed. TOCC also ships with a tocc.css file that can be customised to display different icons, text colors and so on. All individual elements within the TOC can be formatted within the css file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I display more than one TOC with different options?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, however you need to override the options using the trigger tag (AKA short tag). For example, <code>&lt;!-- toc-creator show_menu=yes|icon_set=2|show_static=|@blog_exclude=5,20,3,15,85 --&gt;</code> will display a TOC with an options menu, the square icon set, no static pages and multiple excluded blog categories. The blog and post category IDs are shown within the TOC settings page. All TOC option names are listed in an array at the top of the source code.</p>\n<p>The option syntax is as follows: text to the left of the equals sign is the option name, text to the right is the value (leave blank to disable the option), <code>|</code> separates options, and <code>@</code> is used to indicate to the preprocessor that the option value is actually a comma separated array list.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want to allow my visitors to sort by author. How do I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All pull-down menu entry texts are configured within the general options pane within the plugin settings page. To disable any option within the menu, simply delete the text after the comma. Do not remove the comma.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some of my pages are place holders only. How do I stop TOCC from adding a link to these pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two ways to do this. First, you can exclude pages using the TOCC settings page. This will also exclude all children of the page and therefore may not suite all users. The other way is to allow TOCC to display the page, but not include a link to the page. This is done by setting a short tag override. To determine the ID of all pages you do not want to show links for, open the TOCC settings page and expand the Static Page Options pane. All pages should be listed here with their ID in brackets. To exclude links, modify the TOCC short tag as per the following example: <code>&lt;!-- toc-creator @link_exclude=749,765 --&gt;</code>. This will not display links for pages with IDs of 749 and 765.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add the TOC to the 404 page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Within the WordPress theme editor, add the following line within the 404.php file&#8230; <code>&lt;?php if(function_exists('tocc_show')) {tocc_show();} ?&gt;</code>. Note that this line can also be added to any page, post or template file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I note that there is a page and category exclude option, but what if I only want to include a couple of pages or categories?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have many pages and categories, and you only want to include a couple of these in the TOC, it may be tedious to individually exclude all other categories or pages. Instead, you could use the <code>@page_include</code> and <code>@blog_include</code> short code overrides. For example <code>&lt;!-- toc-creator @page_include=13,187|@blog_include=8 --&gt;</code> will only display pages with IDs 13 and 187 and categories with ID 8 only.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it possible to exclude specific posts from the TOC?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Use the <code>@blog_postExclude</code> short code override. For example, <code>&lt;!-- toc-creator @blog_postExclude=23,31,45|show_postIDs=yes --&gt;</code> will exclude posts with IDs 23, 31 and 45. Post IDs can be determined by temporarily enabling the <code>show_posIDs</code> short code override. This will show the post ID next to each post in the TOC. Remove this override once you have determined the IDs of the posts to exclude.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.6.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add Persian translation by <a href=\"http://www.u2u.ir/\" title=\"HamidReza Kazemi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HamidReza Kazemi</a>. Thank you Hamid.</li>\n<li>Reduced file size of all icons (by around half) and standardised all icon sets using GIF alpha format. This will increase page load time.</li>\n<li>Added dynamic removal of non UTF-8 characters from the summary. This was causing some sites to not correctly validate as XHTML.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added table of contents sidebar widget. All widget options are set through the TOCC plugin settings page, however several options have been hardcoded as some options will not work within a widget.</li>\n<li>Add French translation by <a href=\"http://www.lyfoung.com/\" title=\"Txia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Txia</a>. Thank you Txia.</li>\n<li>Replaced &#8220;show help&#8221; option with a selection to display the help text always, never, by default or hidden by default. Shown and hidden by default options are supplemented<br />\nwith a help icon to toggle the help text on and off.</li>\n<li>Now automatically clears wp-supercache cache when TOCC options are updated.</li>\n<li>Added new short code overrides called @blog_include and @page_include. These allow you to specifically identify which pages and categories are to be included in the TOC.</li>\n<li>Added new short code override called @blog_postExclude to allow specific posts to be excluded from the TOC. Also added a new short code override called show_postIDs to allow post IDs to be temporarily displayed on the TOC.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed self_URL function and now instead use the post permalink as this was incompatible with some servers. </li>\n<li>TOCC url parameters now append to existing page parameters if they already exist (for example, if using default WordPress permalink settings).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new option to hide summaries for parent (pages with children), children (non-root pages), none or all pages and posts.</li>\n<li>Added new option to display the page or post comment count next to each page or post listing.</li>\n<li>Added new option to inhibit listing of posts under categories and instead show all posts as one large list.</li>\n<li>Added new option to displat a help icon.

Tocc used common class names such as &#8220;footer&#8221; and &#8220;date&#8221;. This conflicted with some themes. The prefix should make all css classes unique, and as such the table of contents should now appear the same across different sites.</li>\n<li>Modified self_URL function to work with both IIS and Apache. The previous function worked with Apache only. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue with automatic page creator adding the incorrect short code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Relaxed reliance on PHP5 by removing function reference parameters with default values.

The message goes away after refreshing the page.</li>\n<li>Added CSS2 bullet clearing when displaying icons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to select one of five different icon sets. Icons sets now include none, handdrawn (original), blue, square and bling. None selected by default, except when upgrading and show icons checkbox was selected. In this case, handdrawn is automatically selected to ensure that existing site maps retain the current look.</li>\n<li>The settings page now utilises collapsible menues as the number of options was becoming too large and overwhelming to display all at once.</li>\n<li>Added option (off by default) to show all entries as list items if not displaying icons. Currently only blog posts and forum comments are displayed as list items. Enabling this option allows easier integration into some themes.</li>\n<li>Fixed display issues with IE6. Found bug in IE6 render engine that stopped the icons from being displayed if the list item consists entirely of an anchor tag. Added a space to the end of all list items fixes this bug. Thank&#8217;s Microsoft, can I have mny day back now?</li>\n<li>Added option to display pages, posts and forum comments as separate lists each with individual headings. Heading texts can also be set.</li>\n<li>Added option to display a &#8220;more&#8221; prompt at the end of the blog post and forum comments if not all of the posts or comments are shown. When clicked, the link will display a page of all posts or forum comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modified internal English strings be i18n WordPress translation compatible.</li>\n<li>Added translation &#8220;please help&#8221; message to the settings page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Post count now pulled from database as $cat-&gt;count does not match the number of posts pulled from the database in some (rare) cases.</li>\n<li>Modified post retrieval query slightly as it sometimes got confused with posts that have multiple categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>get_posts() method used to retrieve wordpress blog posts sometimes return incorrect (empty) results. I have therefore implemented a new method to directly retrieve posts from the database. Retrieval falls back to get_post if no posts were found using the database method.</li>\n<li>Removed bullets from forum comments and blog posts when displaying icons.</li>\n<li>Hardcoded title formatting removed and added by default to the title. A blank title tag is now also allowed.</li>\n<li>Additional desscriptions added to settings page to guide users on the use of the <code>create page</code> and <code>update options</code> buttons.</li>\n<li>Added options to show blog and forum last update date and author.</li>\n<li>Added date format specifier for blog and forum last update dates.</li>\n<li>Added forum and blog author prefix text setting (for blogs using a language other than English)</li>\n<li>Added forum and blog warning text setting (for blogs using a language other than English)</li>\n<li>Added optional formatting to CSS file (such as removing bullets, adding anchor decoration etc). Instructions included in the CSS file.</li>\n<li>Added ability to determine previous version during upgrade. This will allow future versions to tweak existing settings to match the look and functionality of previous versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Renamed function display_posts to tocc_display_posts and moved out of hook function as it conflicted with a function of the same name when display category posts. This update is a must for anyone using version 1.1 or 1.2 of this plugin!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modified default settings to disable icons and show all blog entries (looks more professional).</li>\n<li>Now shows blog entries as list items if icons are not selected. This provides better intergration with existing site themes and looks better when icons are not displayed.</li>\n<li>Now uses configurable blog title if not displaying static pages. The blog title may be left blank.</li>\n<li>Removed excessive use of nested &amp;ltdiv&amp;gt tag. This may have caused an issue with oulder browsers.</li>\n<li>Now ensure blog posts are sorted by date rather than rely on WordPress defaults (as this may change in later WordPress versions).</li>\n<li>Split the show posts/comments warning option into individual forum and blog sections.</li>\n<li>New option (on by default) to show total number of posts in each category.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Posts will now be displayed if there is no static post page. Prior to this release, a static blog page was required.</li>\n<li>Now shows blog entries if blog page or static pages are excluded from the table of contents.</li>\n<li>Now show forum comments if forum page or static pages are excluded from the table of contents.</li>\n<li>Added option to remove author acknowledgment.</li>\n<li>Now displays a message indicating the last number of posts if the number of posts exceeds the selectable maximum number of displayed posts.</li>\n<li>Now displays a message indicating the latest number of forum comments.</li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> nesting when static pages are excluded. </li>\n<li>Fixed bug where anchor links would be displayed even though static pages were disabled.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where forum page would always default back to the first page in the settings editor.</li>\n<li>Now allow extended help to be displayed if the option is disabled. This my be help the user to determine why the option is disabled in the first place.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial public release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
