We&#8217;d recommend <code>bimbler-exclude-posts</code>.</li>\n<li>Upload <code>bimbler-exclude-posts.php</code> and <code>class-bimbler-exclude-posts.php</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/bimbler-exclude-posts</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I change the posts to exclude?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Open class-bimbler-exclude-posts.php using your favourite editor (or in the plugin editor within WordPress) and<br />\nexamine the <code>exclude_category</code> method. Here you&#8217;ll find <code>$query-&gt;set(...</code>. The comma-separated list are the<br />\npost categories (prefixed with &#8216;-&#8216; to imply &#8216;remove&#8217;) which will not be displayed.</p>\n<p>To determine which categories are suitable for you, navigate to the Posts -&gt; Categories menu within the<br />\nWordPress GUI and hover your mouse over each of the categories listed. The URL displayed in your browser&#8217;s<br />\nstatus bar will contain something along the lines of <code>yourblog.com/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?...tag_id=nnn...</code>.<br />\n&#8216;nnn&#8217; is the ID you&#8217;re interested in.</p>\n<p>Amend the list to the categories you&#8217;d like to exclude and save the file. The post list on the main page of<br />\nyour blog should now no longer show posts which have the selected categories set.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is / are Bimblers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Bimblers is a cycling group in Brisbane. I decided I&#8217;d use WordPress to create a website for the group, and<br />\ndeveloped a range of plugins to implement the functionality I needed.</p>\n<p>I take the philosophy of creating simple, specific plugins to address a particular issue, rather than implementing<br />\nan ever-convoluting code-base.</p>\n<p>Some of the plugins are generic, and have been implemented over and over by others, but I wanted to create clean,<br />\nstandalone plugins rather than re-using and adapting others wherever possible. This decision was largely to aid<br />\nin learning how to write WordPress plugins other than any other reason.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What other plugins do you have?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please have a look at http://bimblers.com/plugins/ to see if anything else is of use to you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
