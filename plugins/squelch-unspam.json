Once installed there&#8217;s nothing<br />\nto configure, and nothing changes to your visitors: No captcha or silly games. Once installed<br />\nthe plugin will simply randomize the names of the fields in the comments form on your blog and reject comments that are sent to the<br />\nstandard WordPress field names, or where bots have blindly submitted data to the honeypot fields.</p>\n<p>What this means for spammers is that they have to do quite a lot more work to send spam to your website. It may also make sending<br />\nspam to your website unreliable as changes to your theme may upset their spam submission tools. Or they may have to resort to using<br />\nhumans to send spam to your website (not much I can do about that I&#8217;m afraid) which will cost them more money.</p>\n<p>Currently implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Names of fields are randomized every night at 12:00,</li>\n<li>Submissions to the standard WordPress field names are automatically deleted,</li>\n<li>Honeypot fields added to comments form,</li>\n<li>WooCommerce support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional (planned) features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7 integration</li>\n<li>Statistical collection,</li>\n<li>Automated blocking of persistent IPs,</li>\n<li>Opt-in centralized collection of comment spam and statistics for additional research.</li>\n</ul>\n",
