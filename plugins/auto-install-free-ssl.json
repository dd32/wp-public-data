No computer or hacker in between can read your users&#8217; encrypted data. Only the intended recipient (users&#8217; browser or your server) can decrypt and read the encrypted data. The data may be credit card-like necessary payment details, user input with a contact form, or a simple login form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Display PADLOCK:</strong> Installing an SSL certificate is not optional anymore, even if your WordPress website doesn&#8217;t accept credit cards. Since July 2018, with version 68, Google Chrome has started to mark all HTTP (no SSL) websites as &#8216;Not secure&#8217;, even if it doesn&#8217;t accept user input. All other browsers followed the same path. When users visit an SSL-secured website, all browsers display a secured PADLOCK in the address bar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Boost the Search Engine Ranking:</strong> Google and other search engines aim to create a secure web. So, search engines now favor SSL-secured HTTPS websites and discourage insecure ones in the search results. If your WordPress website doesn&#8217;t have an SSL certificate installed, you are missing something significant regarding SEO and staying away from potential customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gain the trust of your users:</strong> If users see the secured PADLOCK and HTTPS connection in the URL, they are assured that your website is secured. Now you are gaining the trust of your potential customers. They are confident to purchase your product or service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://freessl.tech/wordpress-letsencrypt-free-ssl-certificate-documentation/?utm_source=wp_org&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=aifs_free&amp;utm_content=documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here</a> for the documentation.</p>\n<h3>Support and Report a Bug</h3>\n<p>Please check the existing topics in the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/auto-install-free-ssl\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> before creating a new topic for support or reporting a bug.</p>\n<h3>&#8216;AUTO-INSTALL FREE SSL&#8217; IN YOUR LANGUAGE?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/auto-install-free-ssl/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Translations can be added easily here</a> if you want to translate in your language.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt™</a></li>\n<li>I developed this plugin based on the PHP client/app <a href=\"https://freessl.tech/?utm_source=wp_org&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=aifs_free&amp;utm_content=credits\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8216;FreeSSL.tech Auto&#8217;</a>, which I developed with a massive rewrite of <a href=\"https://github.com/analogic/lescript\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lescript</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cpanel.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cPanel</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt™ is a trademark of the Internet Security Research Group.

You have two methods, HTTP-01 and DNS-01, to verify your domain ownership. You need to complete any one method. We are discussing only the HTTP-01 method, the most popular, easiest, and time-saving method.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>HTTP-01</h3>\n<p>Please follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your web server with an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla) or the file manager of your web hosting control panel.</li>\n<li>Browse to the document root of your WordPress website.

Create a directory, <strong>&#8216;.well-known&#8217;</strong> and another directory, <strong>&#8216;acme-challenge&#8217;</strong>, inside the <strong>&#8216;.well-known&#8217;</strong> directory.</li>\n<li>Click the links&#8217; Challenge File 1&#8242; and &#8216;Challenge File 2&#8217; to download the HTTP-01 challenge files. Please remember that if the <strong><em>www.</em></strong> alias of your WordPress website doesn&#8217;t point to your web server (i.e., offline), you get only one challenge file.</li>\n<li>Upload the downloaded challenge files to the <strong>&#8216;acme-challenge&#8217;</strong> directory.</li>\n<li>Uploaded files should be available at &#8216;Link 1&#8217; and &#8216;Link 2&#8217;. Please click the links. The content/text of the links should EXACTLY match the content of the downloaded files. If it matches correctly, click the &#8216;Verify Domain (HTTP-01) &amp; Generate Free SSL&#8217; button, and in the confirmation dialog box, click &#8216;OK&#8217;.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now wait a few seconds, and you will see a free SSL certificate has been issued to your WordPress website.

Free TLS certificates are designed to secure domain names, providing encrypted connections between users and websites. Using SSL certificates with domain names is considered the industry&#8217;s best practice.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to secure a website, it&#8217;s recommended to associate a domain name with the IP address rather than using the bare IP address.

Let&#8217;s Encrypt SSL&#8217;s lifetime is 90 days. You need to get and install another SSL certificate before the expiration of the current SSL. If you provide your cPanel username and password (or API Token), this plugin will do this repeated job automatically. All your credentials remain safe in your database.

However, this caused issues for some websites to generate free ssl cert, especially those using CDNs. In this update, we&#8217;ve adjusted our approach: by default, only the &#8216;mail.&#8217; alias A record is verified, as was the case in version 3.6.2 and earlier. However, the user can enable A record verification for all domain aliases if needed by setting &#8216;aifs_verify_ip_for_all_domain_alias&#8217; to true.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.6.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved the detection process (and fixed a related bug) of the server&#8217;s IPv4 address where the WordPress website is hosted.</li>\n<li>Updated the Freemius WordPress SDK to version 2.5.12.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.6.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolved a loading issue with the theme editor in the WordPress 6.3 dashboard when Force HTTPS is activated.</li>\n<li>Enhanced IP address verification logic for all available domain aliases, as opposed to solely the &#8216;mail.&#8217; alias in previous versions. Now, it filters out the domain alias (when generating the free TLS certificate) if its A record differs from the server&#8217;s IP address. Note that if the option &#8216;aifs_verify_ip_for_mail_dot_domain_alias_only&#8217; is set to true, it will verify the IP address of the &#8216;mail.&#8217; alias exclusively. However, if the option &#8216;aifs_selected_verification_method_dns01&#8217; is set to true (making DNS-01 the default method), the above verification will not occur.</li>\n<li>Updated the Freemius WordPress SDK to version 2.5.11.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.6.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced error handling logic for cases where after submitting a request to the &#8216;finalize&#8217; URL, the response from Let&#8217;s Encrypt contains an empty &#8216;certificate&#8217; key (location value).</li>\n<li>Resolved an issue where the &#8216;finalize&#8217; response in the cert free generation process was unintentionally removed from the database.</li>\n<li>Introduced a new capability to activate the option &#8216;aifs_log_all_ca_server_response&#8217; by accessing the following URL (login required):<br />\nhttp://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=auto_install_free_ssl&amp;log_all_ca_server_response=yes    (Please replace &#8216;www.example.com&#8217; with your domain name.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.6.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the issue with character encoding for sending automated email notifications to support multilingual characters.</li>\n<li>Added feature to write Let&#8217;s Encrypt free https cert server response details in the log files for every API call (if the option &#8216;aifs_log_all_ca_server_response&#8217; is set to true).

The data may be credit card-like necessary payment details, user input with a contact form, or a simple login form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Display PADLOCK:</strong> Installing an SSL certificate is not optional anymore, even if your WordPress website doesn&#8217;t accept credit cards. Since July 2018, with version 68, Google Chrome has started to mark all HTTP (no SSL) websites as &#8216;Not secure&#8217;, even if it doesn&#8217;t accept user input. All other browsers followed the same path. When users visit an SSL-secured website, all browsers display a secured PADLOCK in the address bar.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Boost the Search Engine Ranking:</strong> Google and other search engines aim to create a secure web. So, search engines now favor SSL-secured HTTPS websites and discourage insecure ones in the search results. If your WordPress website doesn&#8217;t have an SSL certificate installed, you are missing something significant regarding SEO and staying away from potential customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gain the trust of your users:</strong> If users see the secured PADLOCK and HTTPS connection in the URL, they are assured that your website is secured. Now you are gaining the trust of your potential customers. They are confident to purchase your product or service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://freessl.tech/wordpress-letsencrypt-free-ssl-certificate-documentation/?utm_source=wp_org&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=aifs_free&amp;utm_content=documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here</a> for the documentation.</p>\n<h3>Support and Report a Bug</h3>\n<p>Please check the existing topics in the WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/auto-install-free-ssl\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> before creating a new topic for support or reporting a bug.</p>\n<h3>&#8216;AUTO-INSTALL FREE SSL&#8217; IN YOUR LANGUAGE?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/auto-install-free-ssl/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Translations can be added easily here</a> if you want to translate in your language.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt™</a></li>\n<li>I developed this plugin based on the PHP client/app <a href=\"https://freessl.tech/?utm_source=wp_org&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=aifs_free&amp;utm_content=credits\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8216;FreeSSL.tech Auto&#8217;</a>, which I developed with a massive rewrite of <a href=\"https://github.com/analogic/lescript\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lescript</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cpanel.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">cPanel</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt™ is a trademark of the Internet Security Research Group.
