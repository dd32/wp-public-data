Enhance your site with SEO friendly Schema.org markup!</p>\n<p><strong>The plugin includes a Gutenberg contact card block as well as a contact card shortcode, so you can display your business info, with included structured data, on any page, no matter which page editing system you are using.</strong></p>\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add LD+JSON structured data to any or every page or post on your site</li>\n<li>Support for all organization schema types</li>\n<li>Support for all schema rich results types</li>\n<li>Customize general/global schema data on the post edit screen</li>\n<li>Create an SEO-friendly contact card that you can add via Gutenberg block or shortcode</li>\n<li>Easily include a Google map, opening hours and all your business details</li>\n<li>Add multiple locations</li>\n<li>Test any page on your site using Google&#8217;s Rich Results Test</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Five Business Profile and Schema is very user friendly and comes with a walk-through that runs automatically when you activate the plugin and will help you add your business info, create your contact card and add a schema rule.</em></p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QuDl7m2okYc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h4>Add Structured Data to Any Page</h4>\n<p>The plugin comes with a database of every organization type schema and every rich results type. With this you can easily create a new schema element and assign a specific structured data type to a page, an individual post, an entire post type, or to your site as a whole.</p>\n<p>Each schema and rich results type comes with its corresponding properties/fields, as per schema.org. When you add a schema element, you can fill in each of these properties with defaults that you want to apply to all posts/pages that have the schema. You can then customize each property directly on the post edit screen, should you need to make a change for a specific page or post.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re running your website for a local business, a corporation, a restaurant, a specific project, a sports team, or any other type of organization, with just a few clicks, you can have the correct schema added to your pages, to help enhance your results in search engines!</p>\n<h4>Business Profile Contact Card</h4>\n<p>The Five Star Business Profile and Schema plugin is also perfect for adding your contact details to any page on your site. It comes with a handy form to help you fill in your info, which then gets automatically included on your site both as a contact card and as schema structured data, using the new LD+JSON format.</p>\n<p>Your contact card can be quickly added anywhere on your site using a block, shortocde or widget, which will display the folling info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Phone number with separate click-to-call phone number</li>\n<li>Cell phone number with click-to-call functionality</li>\n<li>Whatsapp number with click-to-call functionality</li>\n<li>Fax number</li>\n<li>Contact page link or email address</li>\n<li>Link to Google Map with directions to your establishment</li>\n<li>Google Map showing your location</li>\n<li>Opening hours</li>\n<li>Exceptions for opening hours, to specify days that are closed or have different hours (e.g. holidays)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all of this information, the correct schema.org markup is added LD+JSON format. This helps search engines, like Google, discover your address, phone number and opening hours, so they can display them with your listing on Google.</p>\n<p>Choose from a wide array of microdata item types for your business schema, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corporation schema</li>\n<li>Organization schema</li>\n<li>Local Business schema</li>\n<li>Restaurant schema</li>\n<li>Many more!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Google Maps Structured Data</h4>\n<p>The integrated Google Maps features allow you to enhance your location structured data by displaying a business map on your site with full schema support. Your business location, including the business address, will be displayed on a map (with the correct map schema), as well as in text with the correct location microdata.</p>\n<h4>Multiple Locations</h4>\n<p>Business Profile supports multiple locations. This powerful feature works great for businesses that have several offices, for delivery services, for restaurants with multiple locations, etc. Business location schema is added to each entry and you can showcase your details using the Gutenberg schema block, via the location shortcode or with the included widget. For help getting started with this, you can visit:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doc.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/business-profile/user/multiple-locations\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://doc.fivestarplugins.com/plugins/business-profile/user/multiple-locations</a></p>\n<p>The multiple location structured data for your business also syncs up with the Five Star Restaurant Reservations to automatically offer a dropdown in your reservation form, so people can pick which location they want to book at.</p>\n<p>You can choose separate organization schema, corporation schema or local business schema for each new location you create, so each schema shortcode and each page&#8217;s contact info is uniquely optimized with SEO and search results in mind.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NIB0iFC4tCM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<h4>Premium Schema Features</h4>\n<p>The premium version of the Five Star Business Profile and Schema plugin comes with several extra features that will help you set up and refine your structured data more quickly and more accurately.</p>\n<p>These include a default helper functionality for your schema. This option adds a large list of default values to the plugin and allows you to easily populate each schema property with one of these values. No need to be familiar with all the different schema properties and types. Just choose the default you want from the included list and you&#8217;re off and running!</p>\n<p>The premium version also includes new integrations that will help you automatically apply specific structured data to certain areas of your site. For example, the WooCommerce Integration option will automatically add full Product schema to your WooCommerce shop, helping to enhance the search results for your products.</p>\n<p>There is also a posts integration option, which will automatically add Article rich snippets to the default Posts post type. This way, all your articles and blog posts can have the correct schema, without the need for manually inputting it each time you add a new post.</p>\n<p>The premium version also syncs with our Five Star Restaurant Manager mobile app (available for iOS and Android) and lets you update your business and contact card info on the go, from a phone or tablet, and without having to be logged in to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Key premium features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Schema default helpers, which let you choose defaults for all schema properties.</li>\n<li>Post rich snippets, to automatically add full Article schema.org markup to posts</li>\n<li>WooCommerce Integration, to automatically add full Product structured data to your shop.</li>\n<li>Access to the Five Star Restaurant Manager mobile app, to manage your business and contact card info on the go. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This schema structured data and contact card plugin is one part of our suite of plugins designed to give you the best WordPress business and restaurant experience.

Once you’ve got the right coordinates you can go back and restore your original address, and save the form without touching the coordinates again.</p>\n<p>If you’re unable to get Google to recognize your location, the best thing to do is to leave the Google Map out when you print your contact card. You will also want to hide the Get Directions link, because Google will guide your customers to the wrong location.</p>\n<p>There’s not much I can do about this, unfortunately. Even if you were able to manually set the latitude and longitude, Google would still show bad directions, because it uses the address, not the coordinates, for this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%E2%80%99s%20a%20schema%20type%3F'>\nWhat’s a schema type?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This allows you to let search engines like Google know exactly what kind of business you run.</p>\n<p>That way, when someone looks for a real estate agent or a restaurant in your area, they’ll know to include you in their search results.</p>\n<p>You may not find a type that’s a perfect match for your business.

With this you can easily create a new schema element and assign a specific structured data type to a page, an individual post, an entire post type, or to your site as a whole.</p>\n<p>Each schema and rich results type comes with its corresponding properties/fields, as per schema.org. When you add a schema element, you can fill in each of these properties with defaults that you want to apply to all posts/pages that have the schema. You can then customize each property directly on the post edit screen, should you need to make a change for a specific page or post.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re running your website for a local business, a corporation, a restaurant, a specific project, a sports team, or any other type of organization, with just a few clicks, you can have the correct schema added to your pages, to help enhance your results in search engines!</p>\n<h4>Business Profile Contact Card</h4>\n<p>The Five Star Business Profile and Schema plugin is also perfect for adding your contact details to any page on your site. It comes with a handy form to help you fill in your info, which then gets automatically included on your site both as a contact card and as schema structured data, using the new LD+JSON format.</p>\n<p>Your contact card can be quickly added anywhere on your site using a block, shortocde or widget, which will display the folling info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Phone number with separate click-to-call phone number</li>\n<li>Cell phone number with click-to-call functionality</li>\n<li>Whatsapp number with click-to-call functionality</li>\n<li>Fax number</li>\n<li>Contact page link or email address</li>\n<li>Link to Google Map with directions to your establishment</li>\n<li>Google Map showing your location</li>\n<li>Opening hours</li>\n<li>Exceptions for opening hours, to specify days that are closed or have different hours (e.g. holidays)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all of this information, the correct schema.org markup is added LD+JSON format. This helps search engines, like Google, discover your address, phone number and opening hours, so they can display them with your listing on Google.</p>\n<p>Choose from a wide array of microdata item types for your business schema, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Corporation schema</li>\n<li>Organization schema</li>\n<li>Local Business schema</li>\n<li>Restaurant schema</li>\n<li>Many more!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Google Maps Structured Data</h4>\n<p>The integrated Google Maps features allow you to enhance your location structured data by displaying a business map on your site with full schema support. Your business location, including the business address, will be displayed on a map (with the correct map schema), as well as in text with the correct location microdata.</p>\n<h4>Multiple Locations</h4>\n<p>Business Profile supports multiple locations. This powerful feature works great for businesses that have several offices, for delivery services, for restaurants with multiple locations, etc. Business location schema is added to each entry and you can showcase your details using the Gutenberg schema block, via the location shortcode or with the included widget.
