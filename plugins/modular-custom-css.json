This plugin adds a plugin CSS option for CSS that&#8217;s global and persists across theme changes.</p>\n<p>With the Customizer, your CSS is instantly live-previewed, offering the ability to see exactly how your site will look before you publish your changes. The plugin CSS option is stored as an <code>option</code>.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20custom%20css%20stored%3F'>\nWhere is the Custom CSS Stored?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Theme CSS was stored as a <code>theme_mod</code> prior to WordPress 4.7, meaning it is a theme-specific option, part of the theme_mods_$theme option in the database. Each theme has its own <code>theme_mod</code> for the custom CSS, so if you switch to a new theme, the theme-specific custom CSS will be empty. When you switch back to a previously customized theme, the CSS that you added to it will still be there. In WordPress 4.7 and newer this plugin migrates to the core CSS functionality for theme-specific CSS, which is stored with a custom post type.</p>\n<p>Plugin CSS is stored as a regular <code>option</code> in the database. It is used for every theme, so it&#8217;s best used for things that are plugin-related or anything else you want to persist between different themes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20wordpress%204.0%20required%3F'>\nWhy is WordPress 4.0 required?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Customizer features many improvements in WordPress 4.0, including the textarea control type that this plugin uses. WordPress 4.9 is recommended, as it includes the new CSS editor with syntax highlighting and other features.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
