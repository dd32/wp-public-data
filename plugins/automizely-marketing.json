The templates they have are great and are very simple to edit! Their support team replied to my questions almost instantly and kept me up to date with everything I needed help with.&#8221;<br />\n  &#8211; GroovyLED</p>\n<p>&#8220;Very happy: I was using the Kalviyo free version but wanted to try a different app as I did not want to spend $20 extra. Luckily while looking for apps, I found Automizely. Best thing about this app is there are many functions or apps in just one app. I use pop ups, free shipping headers, email flows, and newsletters. Very happy with the instant support system. Thank you so much for making this app.&#8221;<br />\n  &#8211; Jazz &amp; Milly Women&#8217;s Clothing</p>\n<p>&#8220;Love this app, it&#8217;s so easy to use&#8230; I am not a techy person, so the simple instructions and templates are of great help, plus their technical support is the best. 5 stars!!!&#8221;<br />\n  &#8211; WYLDESIGNS Australia</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
