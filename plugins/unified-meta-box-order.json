        "description": "<p>Intuitively harmonize meta box positions and screen column layout for all backend users of your WordPress installation.</p>\n<p>Credit: This plugin is derived from the abandoned <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/global-meta-box-order\" rel=\"ugc\">Global Meta Box Order plugin</a> with hopes to be more stable and better support new versions of WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Quick Overview</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Install and activate the plugin</li>\n<li>Switch to a post, a page, a custom post type, or the dashboard</li>\n<li>Change the order and position of a meta box (or all of them)</li>\n<li>Change the column layout</li>\n<li>Switch to a different user (maybe with the help of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/\" rel=\"ugc\"><em>User Switching</em></a> plugin)</li>\n<li>See your changes applied   </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Installation</h4>\n<p>Download and unpack, then move the folder &#8216;global-meta-box-order&#8217; into your &#8216;plugins&#8217; folder. Head over to your WordPress installation and activate the plugin in the admin area.</p>\n<h4>Rollback</h4>\n<p>The plugin doesn&#8217;t write anything to the database, it just reads. So it never touches any user settings, but instead filters them on a per request basis. Though all applied changes <em>appear</em> to be permanent from a user&#8217;s perspective, they are not. Just deactivate the plugin and see all changes disappear. Activate it again, and they will all be reapplied.</p>\n<h4>How It Works</h4>\n<p>The plugin operates on a blueprint user whose screen settings for meta boxes (visibility, position and ordering), and column layout are cloned for all other backend users on the fly.</p>\n<p>By default, this blueprint user is the first admin user found, so you&#8217;ll need to be logged in as <strong>that user</strong> to globally change screen settings. For how to change the default blueprint user as well as other settings, please refer to the <em>Configuration</em> section below.</p>\n<h4>Where It Works</h4>\n<p>By default, the plugin kicks in when a user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>edits a post</li>\n<li>edits a page</li>\n<li>edits a custom post type</li>\n<li>hits the dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What It Changes</h4>\n<p>It will always change</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the meta boxes visibility, ordering, and column positions</li>\n<li>the column layout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When told so, it will also</p>\n<ul>\n<li>remove the screen options box</li>\n<li>immobilize all boxes, so they can&#8217;t be moved around by your users anymore</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Log in as your blueprint user. By default, the is the first admin user found in your system.</p>\n<p>Select an editing screen (post, page, custom post type) or the dashboard, move the meta boxes around, change their screen settings and the screen&#8217;s column layout. Switch to some user to review your settings, switch back to adjust them.</p>\n<p>When done, you might want to lock your views down by removing the screen options box and by locking the boxes&#8217; sort order. Your blueprint user, of course, wil not be affected by this.</p>\n<h4>Configuration</h4>\n<p>The backend integration is kept to a minimum. No navigation entry, no options page, no entry in the database. Instead, the place to go to configure the plugin is your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em>.</p>\n<p>By the way: You don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to configure the plugin. As long as it finds an admin user, it will work just fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>\n<p>Fire up an editor, load your <em>functions.php</em>, and copy and paste the following code into it. The idea is to have some sort of container to do the configuration in, but do it any way you like.</p>\n<p>For brevity, we&#8217;ll assume the plugin is loaded and active, so we won&#8217;t check for that (see this nice <a href=\"http://queryloop.com/how-to-detect-if-a-wordpress-plugin-is-active/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">write-up</a> on <em>QueryLoop</em> on some ways to do it, though).</p>\n<pre><code>if (is_admin()) {\n\n    // The path to the configuation is rather long, so let's\n    // make us a shorthand.\n    class_alias('\\GlobalMetaBoxOrder\\Config', 'MetaBoxConfig');\n\n    // Add MetaBoxConfig below this line\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we are ready to add some of the configuration settings below to adjust the plugin&#8217;s default behaviour. You might also want to have a look at the example configuration near the end of this document.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that you need to be logged in as any user but your blueprint user to see a setting applied. Again, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/\" rel=\"ugc\"><em>User Switching</em></a> plugin might come in handy.</p>\n<p><strong>Screens To Operate On</strong></p>\n<p>By default, the plugin operates on the post, page, and custom post type editing screens, and the dashboard.</p>\n<p>You can change this as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>// Operate on post and page screens only, leave the dashboard alone.\n// This will still include custom post types.\nMetaBoxConfig::$filter = array('post', 'page');\n\n// Exclude custom post types\nMetaBoxConfig::$include_cpts = false; \n\n// Allow custom post types...\nMetaBoxConfig::$include_cpts = true; \n\n// ...but not all of them\nMetaBoxConfig::$exclude = array('acme_product');\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>MetaBoxConfig</em> in the example above is assumed to be an alias to <em>\\GlobalMetaBoxOrder\\Config</em> as shown in the preparation section above.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing the Blueprint User</strong></p>\n<p>Register a function that returns a user id, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>MetaBoxConfig::$getBlueprintUserId = function () { return 1; };\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, more involved:</p>\n<pre><code>MetaBoxConfig::$getBlueprintUserId = function () { \n\n    $user = get_user_by('slug', 'jane');\n    return $user ? $user-&gt;ID : false; \n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>MetaBoxConfig</em> in the example above is assumed to be an alias to <em>\\GlobalMetaBoxOrder\\Config</em> as shown in the preparation section above.</p>\n<p><strong>Locking Views</strong></p>\n<p>By default, all users will be able to interact with the screen options box, and to move around the meta boxes themselves. There is a rationale behind it, but to cut things short, this is how you might want to change it:</p>\n<pre><code>// No screen options \nMetaBoxConfig::$remove_screen_options = true;\n\n// Meta boxes can't be moved anymore \nMetaBoxConfig::$lock_meta_box_order = true; \n</code></pre>\n<p><em>MetaBoxConfig</em> in the example above is assumed to be an alias to <em>\\GlobalMetaBoxOrder\\Config</em> as shown in the preparation section above.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Configuration</strong></p>\n<pre><code>if (is_admin()) {\n\n    // Make sure plugin is active\n    if (class_exists('\\GlobalMetaBoxOrder\\Config')) {\n\n        // Make a long name short. \n        class_alias('\\GlobalMetaBoxOrder\\Config', 'MetaBoxConfig');\n\n        // Settings\n\n        MetaBoxConfig::$filter = array('post', 'page', 'dashboard'); // default\n        MetaBoxConfig::$include_cpts = true; // default\n        MetaBoxConfig::$getBlueprintUserId = function () { return 1; };\n        MetaBoxConfig::$exclude = array('acme_product');\n        MetaBoxConfig::$remove_screen_options = true;\n        MetaBoxConfig::$lock_meta_box_order = true; \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>On Moving the WYSIWYG Editor</h4>\n<p>The position of WordPress&#8217; WYSIWYG editor is fixed, and can&#8217;t be changed out of the box (mostly because it lacks a box around it). There are reasons for this, but if you want to have a positionable editor anyway, you might want to have a look at our very own <a href=\"https://github.com/pontycode/wordpress-movable-editor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><em>Movable Editor</em></a> plugin.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, if you want to place one specific box <em>above</em> the editor, you might want to check out <a href=\"http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/88103\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this answer</a> on <em>stackexchange</em>.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If you have any issues with this plugin feel free to reach out to the maintainer, bdombro@gmail.com.</p>\n",
