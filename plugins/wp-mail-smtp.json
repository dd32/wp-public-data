You&#8217;re not alone. 3+ million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send emails reliably.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make email deliverability easy so that your emails always reach the inbox.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability issues by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.</p>\n<p>Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP is free and has everything you need to reliably send your WordPress emails!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>WP Mail SMTP Pro</strong></a> unlocks even more powerful features like email logging, advanced email reporting and stats, backup connections, email alerts, smart conditional routing, and much more.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYJuPyiKKZc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?</h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry-standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by adding authentication to the emails sent from your site.</p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers, so they check whether emails are originating from a genuine sender. If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, emails either go in the SPAM folder or, worse, disappear.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites. By default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo-wpmailsmtp&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPForms</a>.</p>\n<p>But most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress hosting companies</a> don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.</p>\n<p>This is why WordPress emails aren’t delivered.</p>\n<h4>How does WP Mail SMTP work?</h4>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by changing the way your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()</code> function to use proper SMTP host credentials or an SMTP mail provider.</p>\n<p>With our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. Even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails will still be sent successfully.</p>\n<p>This helps you fix all <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress not sending email</a> issues.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP mailers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)</li>\n<li>Mailgun SMTP</li>\n<li>SendGrid SMTP</li>\n<li>Postmark SMTP</li>\n<li>SparkPost SMTP</li>\n<li>SMTP2GO</li>\n<li>Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Amazon SES SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Zoho Mail SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Other SMTP</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails too.</p>\n<p>All of these powerful features make WP Mail SMTP the best SMTP solution for WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know which mailer to choose, see our <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/docs/a-complete-guide-to-wp-mail-smtp-mailers/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Complete Guide to WP Mail SMTP Mailers</a>.</p>\n<h4>SendLayer</h4>\n<p>SendLayer is our #1 recommended transactional email service.</p>\n<p>Its affordable pricing and simple setup make it the perfect choice for sending emails from WordPress.

Just click Import to copy your settings over.</p>\n<p>Our one-click migration tool supports all of these plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy WP SMTP</li>\n<li>FluentSMTP</li>\n<li>Post SMTP Mailer</li>\n<li>SMTP Mailer</li>\n<li>WP SMTP</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20wp%20mail%20smtp%20available%20in%20other%20languages%3F'>\nIs WP Mail SMTP available in other languages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We know that majority of people do not speak English, so we professionally translated WP Mail SMTP and WP Mail SMTP Pro into the following languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish (Spain),</li>\n<li>German,</li>\n<li>Portuguese (Brazil),</li>\n<li>Italian,</li>\n<li>French,</li>\n<li>Japanese,</li>\n<li>Polish,</li>\n<li>Dutch,</li>\n<li>Russian,</li>\n<li>Turkish</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20increase%20plugin%20security%3F'>\nHow can I increase plugin security?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The WP Mail SMTP team takes security very seriously. Not only does the plugin follow all security best practices, but we have several options available to ensure your site is safe and secure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Direct SMTP mailer integrations (recommended), such as SendLayer, SMTP.com, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark, SparkPost and SMTP2GO, use the official provider APIs. This means you never enter your username or password in the plugin settings and these credentials are not stored in the database. Instead, we use tokens or API keys which are much more secure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using Other SMTP mailer, we provide the option to insert your password in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, so it&#8217;s not visible in your WordPress settings or saved in the database.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20found%20a%20bug%2C%20now%20what%3F'>\nI found a bug, now what?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve stumbled upon a bug, the best place to report it is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/awesomemotive/wp-mail-smtp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Mail SMTP GitHub repository</a>.

You&#8217;re not alone. 3+ million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send emails reliably.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make email deliverability easy so that your emails always reach the inbox.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability issues by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.</p>\n<p>Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP is free and has everything you need to reliably send your WordPress emails!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>WP Mail SMTP Pro</strong></a> unlocks even more powerful features like email logging, advanced email reporting and stats, backup connections, email alerts, smart conditional routing, and much more.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYJuPyiKKZc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?</h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry-standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by adding authentication to the emails sent from your site.</p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers, so they check whether emails are originating from a genuine sender. If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, emails either go in the SPAM folder or, worse, disappear.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites. By default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo-wpmailsmtp&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WPForms</a>.</p>\n<p>But most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress hosting companies</a> don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.</p>\n<p>This is why WordPress emails aren’t delivered.</p>\n<h4>How does WP Mail SMTP work?</h4>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by changing the way your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()</code> function to use proper SMTP host credentials or an SMTP mail provider.</p>\n<p>With our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. Even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails will still be sent successfully.</p>\n<p>This helps you fix all <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress not sending email</a> issues.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP mailers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)</li>\n<li>Mailgun SMTP</li>\n<li>SendGrid SMTP</li>\n<li>Postmark SMTP</li>\n<li>SparkPost SMTP</li>\n<li>SMTP2GO</li>\n<li>Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Amazon SES SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Zoho Mail SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Other SMTP</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails too.</p>\n<p>All of these powerful features make WP Mail SMTP the best SMTP solution for WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know which mailer to choose, see our <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/docs/a-complete-guide-to-wp-mail-smtp-mailers/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Complete Guide to WP Mail SMTP Mailers</a>.</p>\n<h4>SendLayer</h4>\n<p>SendLayer is our #1 recommended transactional email service.</p>\n<p>Its affordable pricing and simple setup make it the perfect choice for sending emails from WordPress.
