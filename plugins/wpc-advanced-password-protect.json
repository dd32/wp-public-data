        "description": "<p><strong>WPC Advanced Password Protect</strong> provides ultimate protections for your online stores with sophisticated accessibility rules to restrict visitors from accessing the shop or certain product categories, tags, brands, collections, types, attributes, etc. It’s the best solution for on-site security and membership management in online businesses.</p>\n<p>The basic feature of WooCommerce for password protected products is merely insufficient for large stores with a massive number of products. Remarkably, WPC Advanced Password Protect offers password protection for products in bulk with more highly improved features for configuring the password authentication and password forms. The Premium version excels in that it provides the protection by user role and by user as well. Combining with date-time conditions and other password expiry settings, store managers can easily set up access for multiple products or product listings, multiple users with different roles or even multiple passwords for the same source of subjects.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there are features for preventing illegal attempts of probing the password and keeping any potentially harmful scammers out of your site. Password authentication will expire after the designated time to make sure no unauthorized users can sneak in the site.</p>\n<h4>Live demo</h4>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://demo.wpclever.net/wpckid/product-category/color/\" title=\"live demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">live demo</a> here to see how this plugin works.</p>\n<h4>Advantages &amp; benefits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Storewide or selected products protection</li>\n<li>Restrict password probing, scammers</li>\n<li>Suitable for sites with multiple roles: wholesale, members only, …</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Key features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage and preview all rules from the same page</li>\n<li>10+ sources for storewide or partial protection of products</li>\n<li>Complex date &amp; time conditions for each rule to be activated</li>\n<li>Management: name, password form’s title &amp; message for each rule</li>\n<li>Multiple objects can be added for the same source</li>\n<li>Multiple passwords allowed for the same subject with different date/time</li>\n<li>Duplicate/remove, collapse/expand &amp; drag-drop to rearrange the order</li>\n<li>Force all protected products to become unpurchasable</li>\n<li>Password authentication expiry time: how long the password will be required again</li>\n<li>Limit the number of unsuccessful login attempts</li>\n<li>Customizable text boxes for incorrect password &amp; maximum attempt alerts</li>\n<li>Customizable universal password form texts for all rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not what you needed?</h4>\n<p>Please try other plugins from us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-product-bundle/\" title=\"WPC Product Bundles\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Product Bundles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-composite-products/\" title=\"WPC Composite Products\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Composite Products</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-bought-together/\" title=\"WPC Frequently Bought Together\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Frequently Bought Together</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-grouped-product/\" title=\"WPC Grouped Product\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Grouped Product</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-force-sells/\" title=\"WPC Force Sells\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Force Sells</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>External Service</h4>\n<p>This plugin used WordPress.org API (https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/) to get WPClever&#8217;s plugin listing once a day.
