If it is not passed in, the code will attempt to get the current author of the page/post.\n</code></pre>\n<p>A second version of this function exists whereby you can pass in width and height to display the image.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php the_wp_custom_author_image_size($width, $height, $author_id = null); ?&gt;\n\nThis $author_id parameter is optional.  If it is not passed in, the code will attempt to get the current author of the page/post.\n</code></pre>\n<p>To configure your WP Custom Author Image, browse Users / Your Profile in the admin area.</p>\n<h4>Setting WP Custom Author Image Size</h4>\n<p>You can adjust the actual display size in the WP Custom Author Image widget or by using the_wp_custom_author_image_size function call.</p>\n<p>If you do not specify a size the width and height of the actual image will be used.</p>\n<h4>Shortcode</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>You can use [wp-custom-author-image] to display the uploaded WP Custom Author Image in your page/post content.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Multi-Author Sites</h4>\n<p>For sites with multitudes of authors, the widget offers the ability to insert a link to the author&#8217;s posts &#8212; his archives.</p>\n<h4>Single Author Sites</h4>\n<p>Normally the widget will only display an WP Custom Author Image when it can clearly identify who the content&#8217;s author actually is. In other words, on singular pages or in the loop.</p>\n<p>If you run a single author site, or a site with multiple ghost writers, be sure to check the &#8220;This site has a single author&#8221; option. The widget will then output your image at all times.</p>\n<h4>Alternate About Page Link</h4>\n<p>Normally the widget will use the author&#8217;s posts page (/author/authorname/) is the image is clicked on.   If your site has a dedicated page for the author, such as an &#8216;About Me&#8217; page,</p>\n<p>there is a new field in &#8216;Your Profile&#8217; called &#8216;About Me Page&#8217;.  Entering a url in this field (/about-me/) will cause the widget to use this link as opposed to /author/authorname.</p>\n<h4>Retrieving Author Url</h4>\n<p>You can retrieve the url to the respective WP Custom Author Image by calling the function</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php the_wp_custom_author_image_url($author_id = null); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If $author_id is blank the plugin will attempt to determine the current author and retrieve his/her image.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Make the <code>wp-content</code> folder writable by your server (chmod 777)</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Image Style</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the <code>.entry_wp_custom_author_image</code> CSS class to customize where and how the image appears.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<pre><code>.entry_wp_custom_author_image {\n  float: left;\n  border: solid 1px outset;\n  margin: 1.2em 1.2em 0px .1em;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Overriding CSS Floats</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When displaying wide videos, images or tabular data, it becomes desirable to bump the content below the author&#8217;s image. To achieve this, insert the following code in your post:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div style=\"clear:both;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Set Uploaded Image Max Width and Height</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Two constants can be set in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file to set the max size of the uploaded image.  These values are in pixels.</p>\n<pre><code>define('wp_custom_wp_custom_author_image_WIDTH', 100);\ndefine('wp_custom_wp_custom_author_image_HEIGHT', 120);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The default values for these settings are 250 x 250.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I Make changes to the Author&#8217;s Bio Before it is Displayed</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is a filter called wp_custom_author_image_bio that can be used to modify the bio text.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Nothing is Displaying</h4>\n<p>\n<p>More than likely you have place the the_wp_custom_author_image function call outside of your template&#8217;s posts loop so the author cannot be determined.  Trying passing in an author id directly.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
