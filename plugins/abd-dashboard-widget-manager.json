It&#8217;s quite possible that a future version will include this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I display a different custom widget for different roles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This only works for one set of user roles. The user roles that you select will see the dashboard that you&#8217;ve specified, including custom widget. All other user roles will see the WordPress default set of widgets.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
