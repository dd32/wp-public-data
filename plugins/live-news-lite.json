        "description": "<p>The Live News Lite plugin generates a fixed news ticker that you can use to communicate the latest news, financial news, weather warnings, election results, sports results, etc.</p>\n<p>By default, the news ticker includes a <strong>Featured News</strong> section in red and a <strong>Sliding News</strong> in black, and it&#8217;s similar to the ones used by networks like Fox News, CNN, Sky News, etc.</p>\n<p>In terms of content, the news should be manually added by the website administrator or by users that belong to other configured roles.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://daext.com/live-news/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro Version</a> of this plugin, allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically generate news based on the posts</li>\n<li>Automatically generate the news based on a specified RSS feed (E.g., Your own RSS feed, the RSS feed of a tv channel, the RSS feed of a radio station.)</li>\n<li>Automatically generate the news based on a specified Twitter account</li>\n<li>Control the speed and the delay of the sliding news with advanced options of the news ticker</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<p>This plugin is highly customizable and comes with 46 options per news ticker, 4 options per featured news, 9 options per sliding news, and 4 general options.</p>\n<h4>Customizable Style</h4>\n<p>All the elements displayed in the news ticker are customizable in terms of colors and typography. The images used to represent the open and close buttons and the clock background are replaceable with your custom images.</p>\n<h4>Links in the News Ticker</h4>\n<p>You can optionally apply links to the news and open them in the same tab or new tabs based on your selections.</p>\n<h4>Applicable Globally or Only on Specific URLs</h4>\n<p>The news ticker can be applied to all the pages of your website or only to specific URLs. In case of a setup with news tickers assigned to different URLs, you can create an unlimited number of news tickers.</p>\n<h4>Sliding News Images</h4>\n<p>You can place small images before and after the text of the sliding news. Use this feature to display the news provider&#8217;s logo, represent financial trends, categorize different types of communications, and more.</p>\n<h4>Clock</h4>\n<p>The news ticker has an optional clock that displays the time in a custom format defined with <a href=\"http://momentjs.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Moment.js</a> token.</p>\n<p>In the plugin options, you can also decide if you want to display the server time, the user time, if you want to apply a time offset, and the frequency of the time updates.</p>\n<h4>Mobile Device Detection</h4>\n<p>The plugin uses the Mobile Detect Js library to detect the device of the user. The resulting value is used to display or hide the news ticker or specific news ticker elements based on the device type. This behavior is defined by the administrator in the news ticker settings.</p>\n<h4>Cached Cycled</h4>\n<p>The news ticker updates the news with AJAX requests at the end of each news cycle. With the <strong>Cached Cycled</strong> option, you can define the number of cycles per AJAX request.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Transients API</h4>\n<p>You can optionally store the news ticker data in a WordPress transient and limit the number of queries used to retrieve the news.</p>\n<h4>Support for RTL Layouts</h4>\n<p>We have included the <strong>Enable RTL Layout</strong> to allow the use of the plugin in RTL websites.</p>\n<h4>Suitable for Digital Signage Systems</h4>\n<p>You can use the plugin locally in a browser-based digital signage system.</p>\n<h4>Advanced Options</h4>\n<p>Advanced options to further customize the news ticker are also available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Sliding News Margin</strong> option to define the margin between the sliding news</li>\n<li>The <strong>Sliding News Padding</strong> option determines the padding on the left and the right of each sliding news. This option is also helpful to control the distance between the sliding news text and the optional images.</li>\n<li>Control the opacity of the news ticker with the <strong>Featured News Background Color Opacity</strong> and the <strong>Sliding News Background Color Opacity</strong> options</li>\n<li>And more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>For more information on how to implement this plugin, please see the <a href=\"https://daext.com/doc/live-news/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin documentation</a> published on our website.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>This plugin makes use of the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hgoebl/mobile-detect.js\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mobile Detect JS</a> licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MIT License</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://momentjs.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Moment.js</a> licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MIT License</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Chosen</a> licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MIT License</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
