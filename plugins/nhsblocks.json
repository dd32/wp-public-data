Add this block, and manually configure your previous and next links. Great<br />\nfor process flows or user guides.<br />\n* Action link &#8211; want to suggest a user follows a link, but don&#8217;t want a button. Use an action link<br />\n* Back link &#8211; let users step back a page.

You will need to click the three dots on the<br />\nblock editor and click &#8220;resolve&#8221; to repair.</li>\n<li>Corrected some funky and unusual css bugs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>IE10/11 compatibility with Hero Block</li>\n<li>Additional css filters for buttons, panels and promos</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked js filters to position hero at head of page</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved css and js from theme in to the blocks to enable standalone functionality</li>\n<li>Added css to avoid conflicts with LearnDash (Conflicts triggered by Gutenberg plugin, but not in our gift)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Base language (English) and ensured full internationalization.

Available either as standard reveal (down arrow) or expander (plus icon)</li>\n<li>Panels &#8211; Text areas with titles, text and buttons for call to action. Available as standard white panel, grey panel or white panel with coloured header.</li>\n<li>Promo &#8211; Linked boxes with text and optional images.
