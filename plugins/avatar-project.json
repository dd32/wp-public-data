It means that not only your post is good but your site becomes more and more popular and thrust-worthy. When comments start rolling in, you must make sure they display properly and look good. It’s great when a comment author has taken the time to upload a custom image of herself on her Gravatar account, but as we all know only a handful of people actually do that. This means that your precious comment area ends up filled with no-face, gray avatar thumbnails that look plane boring.</p>\n<p>Well, that ends here and now!</p>\n<p>Take control of the way your comment area looks by installing Avatar Project. Avatar Project is a plugin that will replace all avatar icons that don’t have a custom avatar assigned to it. Depending on your websites look, feel and theme, choose one of our Avatar Project icon packs. Currently you have a choice between colorful blobers, cups hoped up on caffeine, smug cat faces and a bunch of actual human portraits.<br />\nThis plugin will be useful for not only real, functioning blogs but for theme developers and designers as well. Install Avatar Project, write a couple of sample comments and make your comment area demonstration look much nicer than it would with the default avatars.</p>\n",
