It&#8217;s like having a cool WordPress developer as a friend ready to do your bidding.  Seriously.</p>\n<p>The widget has over 40 options to choose from.  You can list posts by category, tag, custom taxonomies, author, date, time, name, or anything you can imagine.  You can choose to show the full content, excerpts, or even a simple list.  You can order the posts in all sorts of ways.  Oh, and you can even show pages.</p>\n<p>This is the widget that keeps users out of the code and gives them the ability to display items on their site how they want.</p>\n",

This creates a massive barrier between users that can have <em>really</em> cool sites and those that have to use what their theme developer gave them.</p>\n<p>This plugin is about removing that barrier.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I set it up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s not a lot of work you have to do.  Just add the widget to your theme&#8217;s widget area(s).  If anything, you&#8217;ll probably be overwhelmed by the myriad of options.  I&#8217;ve included a handy guide on what each option means with supplemental reading material.  Just check out the <code>readme.html</code> included with the plugin download.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
