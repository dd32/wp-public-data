Unlike traditional affiliate systems that rely primarily on referral links, this plugin allows affiliates to share their unique coupon codes. These codes not only track sales for commission purposes but also offer customers immediate discounts or special offers, enriching the purchasing experience. However, the Coupon Affiliates system still maintains the flexibility of referral links; affiliates can share URLs that automatically apply their coupon at checkout, and even if a coupon isnt used, you can still make the link alone track referrals, ensuring affiliates receive credit for every sale referred‚Äã‚Äã.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20there%20be%20more%20features%20added%20in%20the%20future%3F'>\nWill there be more features added in the future?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!

This link can then be shared by the affiliate. Anyone that visits the website using that link, will have the coupon code automatically applied to their account on checkout. Clicks are also tracked, and any sales made via the coupon are tracked as conversions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20assign%20affiliate%20users%20to%20coupons%3F'>\nCan I assign affiliate users to coupons?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can assign affiliate users to coupons, which will give them direct access to their affiliates dashboard page, without needing to use a unique link. <a href=\"https://couponaffiliates.com/docs/assign-users-to-coupons\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Click here</a> to learn more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kind%20of%20coupon%20usage%20statistics%20are%20shown%3F'>\nWhat kind of coupon usage statistics are shown?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the coupon affiliate dashboard, you (and your affiliates) will be able to see a variety of statistics including total uses, discount type, orders total, amount saved, commission earned, and more.
