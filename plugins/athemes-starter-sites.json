We suggest picking your favourite and using that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20free%20starter%20sites%3F'>\nAre there any FREE starter sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will get several FREE pre-made websites. There are many more premium starters that can be accessed when you purchase our PRO version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20import%20a%20starter%20site%20on%20an%20existing%20website%3F'>\nCan I import a starter site on an existing website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is recommended to install and import a website demo on a fresh WordPress installation or a blank website to avoid overriding settings and page design. However, a page template can be imported on an existing website as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20install%20any%20other%20plugin%20before%20importing%20a%20starter%20site%3F'>\nDo I need to install any other plugin before importing a starter site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All you need to do is install the Starter Sites plugin and select the website demo you wish to import. This step will install and activate the necessary plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20you%20add%20more%20starter%20sites%3F'>\nWill you add more starter sites?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, of course!
