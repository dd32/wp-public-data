        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow does this work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For every word in the input string it searches for a post with that word in it and grabs the post_id.  That&#8217;s the first number in the keypair.</p>\n<p>Then it strips the html from the post, counts the words in the post, and figures out what number your word is.  That&#8217;s the send number.</p>\n<p>So 385:16 would be post_id 385, word number 16.</p>\n<p>Decyphering is a little easier, since we know the numbers.  I simply look up the post by ID, strip the html, and grab the proper word number.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy isn&#8217;t this secure?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because there&#8217;s no encyption happening at all.  It&#8217;s completely security through obscurity, and it&#8217;s not even very obscure.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIf it&#8217;s not secure, why did you make it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I made one long ago on my old blog because I think Ottendorf cyphers are neato.  Now that I have a new blog on WordPress I chose to port it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy do I sometimes get a key pair with one side missing?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because my selection code is very very simplistic, and sometimes it makes mistakes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
