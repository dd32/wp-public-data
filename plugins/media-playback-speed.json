It just scratches an itch to be able to broadly adjust media playback speeds using the HTML api.</p>\n<p>NOTE: This uses the HTML5 media Element API. Any browser not supporting these or using the Flash Player fallback will miss out on this functionality.</p>\n<h4>Developers</h4>\n<p>Two hooks are provided within this plugin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>media-playback-speed-generate-controls</code> provides a single argument which is a boolean. If you return this as false, this will stop buttons being added to a media player. This is intended for advanced setups where markup for controls might be placed manually elsewhere on the page such as a sticky footer. So long as controls follow the built-in markup (being within the body tag and have a playback-rate-button class (no default styling, used for enabling DOM access only).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;media-playback-speed-data&#8217; provides the default array containing arrays as items with <code>rate</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>label</code> entries, which set the playback rate, the title and aria-title for the buttons as well as adjust the button text.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Theme &amp; Front-end</h4>\n<p>The <code>.playback-rate-button.mejs-active</code> and/or <code>.playback-rate-button.active-playback-rate</code> CSS-selectors allow you to style the active speed (per-player).</p>\n<p>Initially mejs-active class was added in order to create media-playback-js compatible / familiar class names.</p>\n<p>Now that Gutenberg does not add these, it makes sense to for-now add two sets of classes.</p>\n<p>The <code>.playback-rate-button.mejs-active</code> selector will be deprecated in version 2.</p>\n<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>\n<p>This works with the traditional <code>audio</code>, <code>video</code> and <code>playlist</code> shortcodes so long as WordPress uses the JavaScript player.</p>\n<p>With the latest 1.1.1 release this also works for HTML5 audio and video too, however you will need to implement your own controls which have the <code>playback-rate-button</code> class and follow the patterns of this.</p>\n<p>HTML5 raw controls do not have a playlist the author is aware of, and they use global state, so playback rate is per-page.</p>\n<p>There is currently no history as part of this plugin, however a sister plugin could be authored and hooks added to it to store playback rate.</p>\n<p>Please ensure that you have no broken javascript, or wrap all functions in <code>(function() { // do things })()</code> blocks to ensure nothing interferes with this plugin.
