        "description": "<p>Block, Suspend, Report for BuddyPress is a must-have plugin for EVERY BuddyPress installation.</p>\n<p>For a full list of features, documentation, screenshots and videos, head to the <a href=\"https://www.bouncingsprout.com/plugins/block-suspend-report-for-buddypress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin page</a>.</p>\n<p>Each tool is explained further below.</p>\n<h3>Block</h3>\n<p>The Block tool allows your members to block another member. They simply click on a &#8216;block&#8217; button, either on another member&#8217;s profile, or on the member list. Once blocked, neither member can send a message to the other. Each member&#8217;s profile pages become inaccessible, and display a simple message. Neither can view each other&#8217;s activity updates, or replies, and neither can send a friend request to one another.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A simple solution to deal with disputes between members.</li>\n<li>Prevents escalation of abusive or unacceptable conduct between your members.</li>\n<li>Lets your members deal with disputes by themselves, saving you time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Suspend</h3>\n<p>The Suspend tool allows you, as an administrator, to suspend a member. Available only to administrators is a &#8216;suspend&#8217; button on your member&#8217;s profiles, the member directory, and the admin users screen. Once clicked by you, all of that member&#8217;s sessions are terminated, and they will be unable to log back in, instead seeing a custom message explaining the situation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly deals with members who have breached your acceptable standards policies.</li>\n<li>Allows you to disable an account &#8211; until now, you would have to delete the account, or mark them as a spammer.</li>\n<li>Keeps their profile, uploads, messages and other assets ready, should you decide they can return to the site.</li>\n<li>See all your suspended members from the back end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Report</h3>\n<p>Flag inappropriate, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour to the site administrator. Each member&#8217;s profile now incorporates a &#8216;report&#8217; button. This creates a new report, which administrators can see in the backend. You can specify a report type, similar to social media networks such as Facebook, to designate that report as &#8216;spam&#8217; or &#8216;abusive&#8217; and so on. You can set Block, Suspend, Report to email you when a new report is received.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gives your members peace of mind that the site is open to moderation.</li>\n<li>Allows you to deal with any report in your own time, without having to respond to internal messages or other notifications.</li>\n<li>Set a threshold to automatically suspend a user when a number of reports are received.</li>\n<li>Mark new reports as read/unread</li>\n<li>Mark reports as unsubstantiated</li>\n<li>See number of unread reports from the menu or the dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Block, Suspend, Report for BuddyPress Premium Editions</h3>\n<h4>The Premium editions adds the following features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-approval system for new activities and group posts</li>\n<li>A &#8216;Latest Reports&#8217; box in the dashboard</li>\n<li>A &#8216;Most Blocked&#8217; box, showing your site&#8217;s worst offenders</li>\n<li>Integration with Paid Memberships Pro &#8211; enable blocking and reporting for certain levels only.</li>\n<li>Assign a role to a suspended user</li>\n<li>Automatically receive new features as they are built</li>\n<li>Ability to add custom CSS to match your theme&#8217;s styling perfectly</li>\n<li>Premium email support</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Plus, a super-charged report system:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can allow a huge range of content to be reported and moderated, not just members themselves:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress Comments<br />\nActivity Updates<br />\nActivity Comments<br />\nGroups<br />\nPrivate Messages<br />\nForum Topics<br />\nForum Replies<br />\nrtMedia Uploads</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create your own report types, or edit the default ones.</li>\n<li>Add your own reports from the backend, ideal for when your members flag content directly to you via a private message or similar.</li>\n<li>Whitelist any user roles that cannot be reported</li>\n<li>Blacklist members so they can&#8217;t send reports (ideal for malicious complaints)</li>\n<li>Quickly moderate (hide) any activity from the dashboard</li>\n<li>Add your own moderators who have front-end access to the reporting system</li>\n<li>Let your moderators deal with reports, suspensions, activity moderation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fully Tested With</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Youzify</li>\n<li>Beehive Theme</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wordplus.org/downloads/bp-better-messages/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">BP Better Messages</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Not compatible with</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Vikinger Theme</li>\n</ul>\n",
