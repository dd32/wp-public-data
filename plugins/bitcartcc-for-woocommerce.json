        "installation": "<p>This plugin requires Woocommerce. Please make sure you have Woocommerce installed.</p>\n<p>To integrate Bitcart into an existing WooCommerce store, follow the steps below.</p>\n<h3>1. Install Bitcart WooCommerce Plugin</h3>\n<h3>2. Deploy Bitcart</h3>\n<p>To launch your Bitcart instance, you can self-host it, or use a third party host.</p>\n<h4>2.1 Self-hosted Bitcart</h4>\n<p>There are various ways to <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcart/bitcart-docker\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">launch a self-hosted Bitcart</a>. If you do not have technical knowledge, use the <a href=\"https://launch.bitcart.ai\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">web-wizard method</a> and follow the video below.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BTYj-SVl4M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>2.2 Third-party host</h4>\n<p>Those who want to test Bitcart out, or are okay with the limitations of a third-party hosting (dependency and privacy, as well as lack of some features) can use one of the third-party hosts.</p>\n<h3>3. Connecting the store</h3>\n<p>Bitcart WooCommerce plugin is a bridge between your server (payment processor) and your e-commerce store. No matter if you\\&#8217;re using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 2, the connection process is identical.</p>\n<p>Go to your store dashboard. WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Payments. Click Bitcart.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the field Bitcart URL, enter the full URL of your Bitcart API instance(in most cases api.somedomain.tld) (including the https) â€“ https://api.mydomain.com</li>\n<li>In the field Bitcart Store ID enter the id of your store(click on copy icon near your store in admin panel to get it), usually it is ID 1 for the first store on your instance.</li>\n<li>In the field Bitcart Admin Panel URL enter the url(including the https) of your admin panel, like https://admin.mydomain.com</li>\n<li>You have successfully connected your store! Congratulations!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>4. Connecting your wallet</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to connect your wallet(s) to your store in admin panel, they will be used for checkout!</p>\n<h3>5. Testing the checkout</h3>\n<p>Making a small test-purchase from your own store, will give you a piece of mind. Always make sure that everything is set up correctly before going live.</p>\n",
