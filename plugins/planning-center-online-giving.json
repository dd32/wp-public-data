Talk to your web host for further details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I Find My Church Subdomain?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is the unique string that is used when you give online, or manage your PCO account. It is the portion inside the brackets of -[yourchurchsubdomain].churchcenteronline.com.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Do I Insert My Button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can insert the button into your page content using the shortcode <code>[pco-giving]</code>. It will use the Church Subdomain, Button Text and styling class defined in the plugin settings, but can be overidden by using the additional attributes in the format <code>[pco-giving button=\"Donate Now\" subdomain=\"firstballard\" class=\"button\"]</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What additional attributes can I use with the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong><code>button</code></strong><br />\nThis replaces the string of text displayed within the button.</p>\n<p><strong><code>subdomain</code></strong><br />\nThis is the subdomain associated with your &#8216;Planning Center Online&#8217; account.</p>\n<p><strong><code>class</code></strong><br />\nThis can be used to add CSS classes your theme might use for button or link styling.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whilst PCO processes payments securely &#8211; we recommend you only use the give button on  a page that is protected with SSL encryption. It&#8217;s pretty cheap to add and usually costs around $30-50 a year depending on the service. Talk to your hosting provider to find out more details.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
