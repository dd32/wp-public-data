Amathia is about not wanting to learn, not wanting to see things from another side, or from a different perspective.<br />\nMany awfull deeds in human history have been done under amathia, which we often incorrectly ascribe it to plain evil.<br />\nIt&#8217;s not a fault in intelligence, but it&#8217;s a fault in character.</p>\n<p>It is easy to apply this to accessibility. Many healthy people, including web developers, don&#8217;t consider accessibility as important.<br />\nIt is a good thing to see things from a different perspective. A year from now we might be going slowly blind for example.<br />\nAnd all of us are getting old (hopefully), with all the baggage that comes with that.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
