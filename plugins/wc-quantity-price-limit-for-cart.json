        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20the%20quantity%20and%20price%20limits%3F'>\nHow do I set the quantity and price limits?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After activating the plugin, navigate to WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Quantity &amp; Price Limit. From there, you can set the limits for individual products and for the entire cart.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20the%20latest%20version%20of%20woocommerce%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with the latest version of WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Quantity &amp; Price Limit for WooCommerce Cart is fully compatible with the latest version of WooCommerce.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20different%20limits%20for%20different%20products%3F'>\nCan I set different limits for different products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can set different quantity and price limits for each individual product.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20exclude%20certain%20products%20from%20the%20global%20rules%3F'>\nCan I exclude certain products from the global rules?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin allows you to exclude specific products from all minimum and maximum rules. Additionally, you can override global settings with local adjustments for individual products.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20limits%20for%20the%20entire%20cart%2C%20not%20just%20individual%20products%3F'>\nCan I set limits for the entire cart, not just individual products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin allows you to set overall minimum and maximum quantities for the entire cart, ensuring customers adhere to your defined purchase limits for their entire order.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20disable%20category%20limits%20for%20a%20specific%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I disable category limits for a specific product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you disable category limits for a specific product, the category rules will not apply to that product. This allows you to have more flexibility and control over individual product settings, independent of the category rules.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20quantity%20step%20feature%2C%20and%20how%20do%20i%20use%20it%3F'>\nWhat is the quantity step feature, and how do I use it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The quantity step feature allows you to define the increments by which quantities increase. For example, setting a step of 2 means customers can only purchase in multiples of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 6). This is particularly useful for products sold in packs. To use this feature, adjust the quantity step setting in the individual product settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20restrict%20customers%20from%20purchasing%20more%20than%20the%20maximum%20quantity%3F'>\nWill the plugin restrict customers from purchasing more than the maximum quantity?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the WC Quantity &amp; Price Limit for Cart plugin will enforce the maximum quantity limits you set. Customers will not be able to add more than the specified maximum quantity to their cart, ensuring that your sales rules are followed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20set%20quantity%20limits%20across%20my%20entire%20store%20or%20only%20for%20specific%20products%3F'>\nCan I set quantity limits across my entire store or only for specific products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can set quantity limits both globally across your entire store and for specific products. This flexibility allows you to manage purchase limits effectively based on your store&#8217;s requirements.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20do%20not%20set%20the%20cart%20rule%3F'>\nWhat if I do not set the cart rule?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not set cart rules, the cart will not enforce any minimum or maximum limits. Customers will be able to purchase any quantity and total value allowed by the individual product and category settings.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
