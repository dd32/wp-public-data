        "description": "<p>NGAZE Gateway is a custom plugin installed on restaurant websites for marketing enablement. It is custom code developed for WordPress websites to integrate with the NGAZE platform.</p>\n<p>What is the purpose?<br />\nThe primary purpose of the NGAZE Gateway is to capture the ordering customer information to enable remarketing campaigns through email and SMS marketing channels. The goal is to drive repeat orders and guest loyalty.</p>\n<p>What are the benefits?<br />\n(a) For those restaurants that have POS and online ordering systems that do not have an open API, it becomes difficult for marketing platforms (such as NGAZE) to integrate. Without access to customer data, marketing campaigns cannot be created. The NGAZE gateway is an innovative solution to build a customer database for remarketing.<br />\n(b) The alternative of manually exporting customer data from POS and online ordering systems every month is inefficient.<br />\n(c) NGAZE gateway works for 3rd party ordering &amp; delivery platforms (GrubHub, UberEats, Doordash, etc). This is critical because 3rd party platforms do not share customer information.</p>\n<p>How does it work?<br />\nThe gateway plugin is installed on the restaurant website and configured. When the customer clicks on the order button or order link on the restaurant website, the gateway screen popups up and presents the user with ordering relevant information (curbside, delivery time, pre-payment, offers) and input fields. The user provides name, email, and phone info and clicks the “Start My Order” button. This captures the customer info and seamlessly directs to the menu page for the customer to continue the ordering process.</p>\n<p>How is the customer experience?<br />\nThe NGAZE gateway presents a step to the user with useful ordering-related information and promotion before they start the ordering process. Through this extra step, it is a value addition especially for new customers placing orders for the first time.</p>\n<p>To Signup as a user of The Digital Restaurant, go through the following link https://thedigitalrestaurant.com/signup/.</p>\n",
