Feel free to leave a message on the &#8220;Support&#8221; tab of the plugin page, and I&#8217;ll follow up as soon as possible.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My forms are no longer submitting, with this plugin installed. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please make sure that you have updated to the latest version of Contact Form 7. Contact Form 7 Goal Tracking Extension only supports versions 4.2.0 or higher. If everything is up to date and you&#8217;re still experiencing problems, please post a message on the [Support Page].</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my forms no longer using Ajax, when I install this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to ensure that all forms are submitted properly, and that users can be redirected to success pages from some of your forms, I have had to disable Contact Form 7&#8217;s JavaScript for all forms. This means that you won&#8217;t be able to use Ajax to submit forms. In future updates, I hope to change this functionality, so that Ajax is only disabled for the forms that have a redirect page defined. Please note that disabling CF7&#8217;s JavaScript does not affect your forms&#8217; ability to send messages properly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
