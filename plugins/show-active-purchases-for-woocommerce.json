When a user comes across a product they&#8217;ve already purchased, the &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221; button will be replaced by a line of text that you can customize in the admin panel. This plugin will also prevent users from purchasing a product they already own.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s use a simple scenario. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re selling 2 subscription types: a basic subscription, and a premium subscription. A user buys the basic subscription. As long as the subscription is active, they won&#8217;t be able to buy another basic subscription. Instead, when they see that product on your site, the button will be replaced with custom text that you can set to something like &#8220;Already Subscribed&#8221; (which again can be customized in the Admin panel).</p>\n<p>This is great for preventing members from double subscribing, and it also ensures that you are able to focus their attention on the products the CAN buy.</p>\n<p>And, that&#8217;s it!
