        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20find%20my%20uid%3F'>\nWhere can I find my UID?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to obtain a UID, you must have an account with us over at <a href=\"https://admin.contentignite.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">admin.contentignite.com</a>. Within our platform simply set up your publisher (all that&#8217;s needed is the domain name) and we will create a UID. You can find that UID in your publisher table here: <a href=\"https://admin.contentignite.com/publisher\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">admin.contentignite.com/publisher</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20control%20the%20ads%3F'>\nHow do I control the ads?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is all done inside <a href=\"https://admin.contentignite.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our platform</a>, this plugin just helps you get the tag on page without development input.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use a single tag to enable a suite of powerful monetisation features, our tag is highly optimised and will not impact your site directly, however, you should always work closely with your account manager to ensure ad density is kept at a sensible level. You can even view your sites latency in platform!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20will%20this%20cost%20me%3F'>\nHow much will this cost me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no upfront fee for using our tag, we are usage based only. For using our demand we work off a rev share model, so we only make money when you make money (and most of it goes to you!), paid out on speedy Net30 terms. If you would like to use your own demand, we charge on banded CPM&#8217;s. Speak to your account manager about your specific terms.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
