The engine will automatically activate a dark screen when your visitors are inactive, which darkens the colors and hides animations and effects, so that the monitors do not waste energy generating those and simply because dark colors, on many monitors, require less energy to display than brighter ones.</p>\n<h4>The goal</h4>\n<p>Online Leaf aims to reduce the overall CO2 emissions from displaying websites, without any loss of visitor experience. You can still use visual effects, animations and heavy graphics to improve your website&#8217;s overall quality, since the standby engine does not conflict with any of those (as it is only activated when your visitors are inactive). The only change is that your blog will be a <a href=\"http://www.onlineleaf.com/Green-Websites/\" title=\"Green Website\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Green Website</a> and help in making the web a much greener place to surf.</p>\n<h4>CO2 neutralized</h4>\n<p>The usage of Online Leaf is CO2 neutralized, by acquiring CO2 quotas, which are cleared with the state authorities in EU.<br />\nPlease read more about <a href=\"http://www.co2neutralwebsite.com/?utm_source=onlineleaf_01&amp;utm_medium=onlineleaf_01&amp;utm_campaign=onlineleaf_01\" title=\"CO2 neutralized websites\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CO2 neutralized websites</a> if you are interested.</p>\n",
