If you links already have some<br />\nexisting parameters, it will append those on the end of your link.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20pass%20click%20ids%2Fsub%20ids%20from%20my%20website%20links%3F'>\nCan I pass click ids/sub ids from my website links?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Just add <code>{click_id}</code> to both links and any parameter within the placeholder will pass on to the<br />\ntarget link as well. For example, to support Partnerize links use the following:</p>\n<p>Source URL:<br />\n    <code>/my-offer/{click_id}</code></p>\n<p>Target URL:<br />\n    <code>https://prf.hn/click/camref:123/pubref:{click_id}</code></p>\n<p>Then, use links like <code>/my-offer/test1</code> to pass the click id to Partnerize.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
