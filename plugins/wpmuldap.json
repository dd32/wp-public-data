Assuming user credentials authenticate against the LDAP server, creating local accounts and blogs follows this<br />\nalgorithm:</p>\n<p>Create a new WPMU User, with LDAP username and a randomly generated password.<br />\nSome user information, such as first and last name, is extracted from the<br />\n  information returned from the LDAP server.<br />\nActions for user creation and activation are triggered.<br />\nThe user&#8217;s domain / URL are created depending on plugin configuration (i.e.,<br />\n  VHost vs SubDir).<br />\nIf the option is set, a blog is created, with path and name based on the LDAP<br />\n  username and the blog is activated with the user being Administrator, and<br />\n  appropriate actions are triggered.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that even though a random password is created for a user (for WPMU accounts), it is never displayed to the user.  This is intentional so that there is no confusion as to which password should be used; it will always be using LDAP credentials.  As a result, though, if ever LDAP is disabled or if the server is unavailable, users created with LDAP authentication will be unable to log in unless their passwords are reset.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>New Installation</h4>\n<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unzip the plugin contents to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/wpmuldap/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is recommended to also change the welcome message that is sent to users upon account creation.  By default, WordPress includes the user&#8217;s password in the message, even though this password is <em>not</em> used by this plugin.  The password sent is purely the password attached to the WPMU account that ties to the user&#8217;s LDAP login.  To change the welcome message, log in as a Network Admin and go to Network Admin -&gt; Options, and edit &#8220;Welcome Email&#8221; appropriately.</p>\n<h4>Migrating from older versions</h4>\n<p>If you currently have the WPMU Ldap Authentication plugin configured, migration is fairly simple</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you have a network admin enabled non-ldap account setup and available in the blog</li>\n<li>Remove the current plugin from mu-plugins (all configuration options will stay in the WP database)</li>\n<li>Install version 4.x of the plugin into the standard plugins folder</li>\n<li>Network Activate the plugin</li>\n<li>Thats it! The plugin should now be re-activated with all of your previous settings.</li>\n</ol>\n",
