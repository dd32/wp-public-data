        "faq": "\n<h4>Is it secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not really, no. It depends on WordPress working as intended, and the user name and password is sent in clear text across the wire.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I protect posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, only pages and their subpages can be protected by this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My protected page shows up in the page list?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s actually considered a feature (at least for now). The point being, that a hidden page really doesn&#8217;t need to be protected, and that it makes it work cleaner for e.g. members-only pages. Don&#8217;t worry, as you have probably discovered, the contents of the page are not visible without the correct user name and password.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t it work for me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You might be running WordPress on PHP using CGI, and that often makes it impossible to handle the authorization features of HTTP &#8211; the appropriate headers simply don&#8217;t get passed on to PHP/WordPress by the web server.</p>\n<p>If you wan&#8217;t to make sure that&#8217;s the problem, try creating a protected post with a user name and password of debug/debug.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have translated the plugin into another language, now what?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great, thanks!
