        "faq": "<p>Can I use HTML in the animation?</p>\n<p>Yes, you can enter HTML in the rows before generating a shortcode. You can also wrap the shortcode itself in HTML tags.</p>\n<p>Can I edit the settings of the animation?</p>\n<p>You can change a variety of settings such as the speed that the text is typed out, a delay before the animation begins, the speed at which the text is backspaced (deleted) and a delay before the backspacing begins. Ticking the &#8216;Loop&#8217; box will mean the animation continues to repeat over and over. Entering a number in the &#8216;Loop count&#8217; box will define how many times it will repeat &#8211; e.g. entering &#8216;3â€™ would type out and then backspace the text 3 times.</p>\n<p>Can I preview my animation?</p>\n<p>Yes, when you click &#8216;Generate Shortcode&#8217;, a preview will automatically be generated.</p>\n<p>Demo</p>\n<p>To view a demo of the original animation <a href=\"http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">click here</a></p>\n",
