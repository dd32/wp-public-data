This will be available as a toggle option in a future version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan editors and authors play the game from within wp-admin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Support for playing the game within wp-admin is coming is coming in a future version, but for now, if you preview a post or publish it, you can still play on the front end. If you want only logged in users to be able to play, consider making a private post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow are high scores saved?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now, high scores are only saved until you close the tab that you are playing in. In the future, we have planned support for automatically saving user\\&#8217;s high scores if they are a logged in WordPress user.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
