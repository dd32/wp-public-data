        "installation": "<p>Install the Melu plugin directly from the plugins admin section of your WordPress site, or download and install from wordpress.com.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is activated, visit the Melu control panel via the main admin menu on the left and enter your unique Melu code and click &#8216;Apply&#8217;. This will activate the Melu live chat widget on all pages of your website.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t have a Melu code? Sign-up for your free 14 day trial here &#8211; https://meluchat.com/try-melu.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>What is Melu?<br />\nMelu provides live chat software for your website, as well as a team of highly trained human chat operators that look after your website visitors for you.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of Melu is to help convert more of your website visitors into leads. When a visitor has questions or isn&#8217;t sure about something, they often leave and go elsewhere. Melu gives them the option to use live chat and get the answers they need. If we can&#8217;t answer, or if they want to speak to someone, we find out what they need and take their details in a friendly and efficient manner. We then pass their details onto you to follow up and turn into a new customer!</p>\n<p>How does Melu work?<br />\nWhen you create an account, we set you up on our system and put together a shared FAQs document that you have access to. Our operators use your FAQ document to help answer any questions your visitors have.</p>\n<p>When a someone is on your website, we send them an invite to chat &#8211; &#8216;Hi, how can I help you today?&#8217;. This shows the visitor that live chat is available to them.</p>\n<p>If the visitor wishes to chat, they can respond to the invite or start a chat themselves. Normally visitors ask questions about your products and services or tell us directly what they need. The job of our operators is to answer their questions and get their contact details on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Depending on your requirements, we can also send visitors to action points on your website, such as sign-up forms and calls to action, simply by offering them a link to follow.</p>\n<p>If your visitors ask questions that aren&#8217;t in your shared FAQs document, we&#8217;ll add them in and let you know so you can help improve the knowledge base of answers.</p>\n<p>On average Melu converts 60% of chats into leads for our clients.</p>\n<p>Is Melu free?<br />\nWe offer a free 14 day trial for all new users.</p>\n<p>Do I need to have a credit or debit card to sign-up?<br />\nNo! You can sign-up without commitment at https://meluchat.com/try-melu. Your first 14 days are free.</p>\n<p>Is there a minimum contract?<br />\nNo! We offer a rolling monthly contract so you can cancel at any time and use until the current paid month is over.</p>\n<p>Does Melu use real human operators?<br />\nYes! This is core to our business model &#8211; real people get better results. We never use chat bots or operators that don&#8217;t have English as their first language.</p>\n<p>Where are Melu&#8217;s operators based?<br />\nOur operators are all based in the UK and are employed by Melu. We don&#8217;t outource any of our operations.</p>\n<p>Do you invite our visitors to chat?<br />\nYes &#8211; we send invites to visitors by default, but you can tell us not to do this if you wish. We send an automatic invite to the visitor after 30 seconds of them landing on your website. If they choose to close the invite, our operators can see that, and therefore no more invites are sent. We will only send an invite to a visitor once, so they&#8217;re not bombarded with invites every time they move to a different page.</p>\n<p>What are your operating hours?<br />\nOur standard hours are between 8am and 10pm (your local time) 7 days a week. We also offer 24/7 coverage if you require it!</p>\n<p>What happens outside of operating hours?<br />\nDuring these times the Melu chat widget goes into message mode, which is basically a contact form so visitors can leave a message. We can change this to instead link directly to your own form on your website if you&#8217;d prefer. Alternatively, we can hide the Melu chat widget completely when we&#8217;re not available.</p>\n<p>What is a lead?<br />\nA lead is a chat that requires your follow-up. In most cases this is where the visitor is interested in being contacted about your products and services, so it&#8217;s important to act fast when it comes through! On some occasions a visitor may use live chat to report an issue with your website, or a typo or something similar. We&#8217;ll raise this as a lead so you are notified, even though it&#8217;s not really a lead.</p>\n<p>What happens when a chat isn&#8217;t a lead?<br />\nWhen we handle a chat that doesn&#8217;t get the visitors details, or it doesn&#8217;t require you to follow-up, it&#8217;s sent direct to your client portal. You won&#8217;t receive an email notification, but you can view the full transcript via your client portal.</p>\n<p>Do I get notified when a lead comes through live chat?<br />\nYes &#8211; as soon as a lead is raised in our system an email is sent to you with the details of the visitor and the full chat transcript. This data is also logged in your client portal.</p>\n<p>Can I track my leads and chat sessions?<br />\nYes! Once your trial has started you&#8217;ll be sent details to login to our website and access your client portal. Here you&#8217;ll be able to see all of the chat sessions and transcripts, as well as traffic reports and other analytics. You can also export your chats into a .csv file. Many of our clients find it very useful to review their chat sessions, as it helps them improve the FAQs document and enhance the way we handle their visitors.</p>\n<p>Is Melu GDPR compliant?<br />\nYes it is! We take your data protection very seriously. Once a chat is completed by one of our operators and sent to your portal, they no longer have access to any of the data. Only you can see it within your client portal. The portal also gives you the ability to remove data upon request.</p>\n<p>If I want to stop using Melu, what do I do?<br />\nAt the end of your trial we&#8217;ll send you a report so you can see how things went. If you don&#8217;t want to continue using Melu, let us know via email (hello@meluchat.com), then deactivate it via the Melu control panel in WordPress. Once deactivated you can then remove the plugin completely if necessary.</p>\n",
