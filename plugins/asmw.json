The player itself is hosted on <a href=\"http://amiestreet.com/?pytr=asmw\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Amie Street</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use v3.x</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Now even easier.  Just copy the link location in your browser of the song and paste it in brackets [].  You can look at http://amiest.musicwednesday.com/howto for more information</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the Uber Tracker</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Uber Tracker is where all of the pingbacks/trackbacks go.  This is nothing more than a WordPress page that tracks when an ASMW post goes up.  This allow everyone a central place to go and look for music that has been posted by people that use ASMW plugin.  This will also help drive some traffic to your site. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n"
