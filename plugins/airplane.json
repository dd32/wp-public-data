It is a movie considered by critics to be one of the greatest movies of all time. Many would postulate that it is better than The Godfather.</p>\n<h4>Really? Better than The Godfather?</h4>\n<p>Yes, really. And don&#8217;t question me again.</p>\n<h4>I heard there is a sequel. Is it any good?</h4>\n<p>It is hilarious. Much better than anything Steven Spielberg or Martin Scorcese could ever create.</p>\n<h4>I just watched the movie and I didn&#8217;t think it was that great.</h4>\n<p>You are an idiot.</p>\n<h4>Is there anything factually incorrect about the movie?</h4>\n<p>At the real airport, the white zone is for loading and unloading of passengers only, and there&#8217;s no stopping in the red zone (except for transit buses).</p>\n<h4>Surely, that can&#8217;t be true.</h4>\n<p>It is true, and don&#8217;t call me Shirley.</p>\n",
