That means you&#8217;ll never be punished by having to pay more for a successful community.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re setting up for the first time or have just updated to the new version of the plugin, you’re going to love what we’ve done to make implementing Muut in your WordPress website easy and flexible.</p>\n<h4>Why Muut?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Unified system for both forums and commenting. Same users and design</li>\n<li>Full featured forums makes your WordPress site conversational</li>\n<li>Flat or threaded commenting for small or big topics</li>\n<li>Real-time. No page reloads – posts, replies, likes and users appear in real-time</li>\n<li>Spam filtering, email notifications and 20+ different language versions</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Built For WordPress</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Skinnable style the discussion directly from the WordPress CSS editor</li>\n<li>Focus on content. Text focused, uncluttered and linear user interface</li>\n<li>Comes with five widgets, all of which update in real-time </li>\n<li>Single Sign-On. Use the WordPress login, users and avatars</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Optimized for SEO</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Micro format optimized static content</li>\n<li>Static content served from your domain</li>\n<li>Custom S3 bucket support for Developer accounts</li>\n<li>Escaped fragment support for Google</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>New! Widget Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Online Users</em> – Now the Online Users list isn’t limited to just your main forum page and channel embeds. You can use the Online Users widget on any of your pages to show who is currently logged in (and how many other people are viewing the site). Watch users’ portraits appear on the fly as they sign in to join the discussion.</li>\n<li><em>Latest Comments</em> – Since Muut is so great to use as the commenting system on your posts and pages, the Latest Comments widget keeps track of which posts have received the latest comments and who made them, and all the users on your website can see it update in real-time as they participate in the discussions on all your posts.</li>\n<li><em>Trending Topics</em> – If you want to help users stay on top of which posts are getting the most activity on your forum, the Trending Posts widget does just that, with real-time updates to comments and likes—not to mention the trademark Muut green “currently typing” circle.</li>\n<li><em>Discussion Channel</em> – You can now embed a single specific channel in your website’s sidebar. Users can watch and join the discussion without having to stop browsing the rest of your website.</li>\n<li><em>My Feed</em> – By using the My Feed widget, users can keep track of all the activity on all the discussions they’ve joined and postes they’ve made right in your website’s sidebars.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information about Muut at our <a href=\"https://muut.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a> and read the full <a href=\"http://learn.muut.com/integrations/wordpress/getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin documentation</a>.

You simply can deactivate the “Use Muut for post commenting” Muut setting in the Muut administration page. Alternatively, you can disable or enable Muut commenting on specific posts by enabling that global setting and then activating/deactivating “Use Muut for commenting” option on a post-by-post basis.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I embed a Muut channel with content surrounding it, before and after?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can, although we are planning to make it easier in a future release. For now, the best way is to use the old shortcode ([muut path=&#8221;/the/channel/path&#8221;]) in the content editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get more help with the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several great ways to learn more about and get help with the plugin. The first is our full <a href=\"http://learn.muut.com/integrations/wordpress/docs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin documentation</a>; you can also ask for help on our <a href=\"https://muut.com/forum/#!/wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum</a> or submit a support ticket right here on the WordPress plugin page.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Note that the <em>actual displayed content</em> is always pulled from the embed properly and NOT the WordPress database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bug Fixes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed problem for websites who use Muut for forums and another plugin for commenting.</li>\n<li>Muut embedding using the template tags has better support for unique uses.</li>\n<li>Removed the S3 bucket settings section in favor of having that entirely managed on Muut end.

Both templates can be overridden in a muut directory in the active theme root.</li>\n<li>Added a bunch of helpful template tags so that websites can, for example, add extra customizations on their own page templates.</li>\n<li>Powered by many more actions and filters that can be used for extra customizations.</li>\n<li>Modified and standardized Muut terminology; what was called a “sub-forum” or “category” is now known as a Channel.</li>\n<li>Moved the administrative settings to its own admin menu item “Muut” (rather than a sub-menu item under Plugins).</li>\n<li>Adds a global constant ‘MUUT_VERSION’ that can be defined as a specific Muut version if an older version should be used (the plugin defaults to the latest version).</li>\n</ul>\n"
