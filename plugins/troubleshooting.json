        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20disable%20troubleshooting%20mode%3F'>\nHow can I disable Troubleshooting Mode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Troubleshooting Mode has various ways to be disabled, depending on your situation. Normally you would either click the &#8220;Disable Troubleshooting Mode&#8221; button within your admin dashboard, or from the &#8220;Troubleshooting Mode&#8221; menu item in the admin bar.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to access your admin dashboard, or your admin bar for any reason, either signing out from your website, clearing all cookies for your website, or closing all your browser windows will also remove the cookies used to declare your current account as being in Troubleshooting Mode.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20website%20looks%20broken%20after%20using%20troubleshooting%20mode%21'>\nMy website looks broken after using Troubleshooting Mode!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, some caching solutions are either so complex, or so aggressive, that they do not respect Troubleshooting Mode&#8217;s directives to not cache any content.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to clear your caches after completing your troubleshooting, this can usually be done from your caching plugin&#8217;s settings, or by disabling and re-enabling the caching plugin. Note that your hosting provider may also have a dedicated button to clear its caching from their own control panel, if this is offered to you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20contribute%20to%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I contribute to this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin is open source and available on the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/site-health-troubleshooting\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress/site-health-troubleshooting GitHub repository</a>, and we welcome all types of contributions!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
