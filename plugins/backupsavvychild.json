It should be something like in this example:</p>\n<p>&lt;fastCgi&gt;<br />\n     &lt;application fullPath = &#8220;C:\\php\\php-cgi.exe&#8221; arguments = &#8220;&#8221;<br />\n         monitorChangesTo = &#8220;&#8221; stderrMode = &#8220;ReturnStdErrIn500&#8221; maxInstances = &#8220;4&#8221;<br />\n         idleTimeout = &#8220;300&#8221; activityTimeout = &#8220;80&#8221; requestTimeout = &#8220;1000&#8221;<br />\n         instanceMaxRequests = &#8220;10000&#8221; protocol = &#8220;NamedPipe&#8221; queueLength = &#8220;1000&#8221;<br />\n         flushNamedPipe = &#8220;false&#8221; rapidFailsPerMinute = &#8220;10&#8221;&gt;<br />\n         &lt;environmentVariables&gt;<br />\n             &lt;environmentVariable name=&#8221;PHP_MAX_REQUESTS&#8221; value=&#8221;5000&#8243; /&gt;<br />\n         &lt;/environmentVariables&gt;<br />\n     &lt;/application&gt;<br />\n &lt;/fastCgi&gt;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why backups are not uploading to dropbox or aws cloud on windows server?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) Download and extract for cacert.pem https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html<br />\n 2) Put it on cert folder of yours php version (for example C:\\Program files\\php\\v5.6\\extras\\ssl\\cacert.pem)<br />\n 3) In your php.ini put this line in this section (&#8220;C:\\Program files\\php\\v5.6\\php.ini&#8221;) find and change curl.cainfo:</p>\n<p>curl.cainfo = &#8220;C:\\Program files\\php\\v5.6\\extras\\ssl\\cacert.pem&#8221;</p>\n</p>\n\n"
