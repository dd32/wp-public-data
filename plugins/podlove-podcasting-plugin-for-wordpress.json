        "changelog": "<h4>4.1.15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>security: disable unsafe Twig Template filters &#8220;filter&#8221;, &#8220;map&#8221; and &#8220;reduce&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>security: add nonces to template actions</li>\n<li>security: use output escaping for episode slug</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>add transcripts to import/export</li>\n<li>add confirmation button on modal to input episode image url</li>\n<li>fix: selecting an episode image updates the preview</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>new: when selecting a file for Auphonic, its name is suggested to be used as episode slug</li>\n<li>fix: PHP deprecation warnings</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>new: support <code>podcast:license</code> tag in RSS feed</li>\n<li>fix: imports correct chapter times from Auphonic (when using features that affect the episode duration)</li>\n<li>maintenance: update various javascript dependencies</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: bug introduced in latest patch that created duplicate database entries for media files</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.9</h4>\n<p>Various fixes regarding adjusted media file handling introduced in version 4.0.11:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dashboard shows a grey bar again when the file is inactive</li>\n<li>RSS feed correctly skips items with inactive files again</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>changes in an episode immediately affect the RSS feed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are various caches in place to ensure efficient delivery of the RSS feed<br />\nto podcast clients. However it can be hard to guess how long it will take for a<br />\nchange to appear in the feed and podcatchers. Now, any change to the episode<br />\nmetadata or enabling/disabling an asset immediately clears the cache for that<br />\nfeed item, resulting in the change to be visible in the RSS feed immediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>transcripts: contributors in voices selection are sorted alphabetically</li>\n<li>fix: episode license and explicit value are not emptied when saving the episode</li>\n<li>maintenance: fix various notices from WordPress Plugin Check tool</li>\n<li>maintenance: js dependency updates</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>fix <code>itunes:explicit</code> RSS tag. It now contains the valid values &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221;.</li>\n<li>fix typo in API: <code>explicit</code> field was mistyped as <code>expicit</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows Settings: sort Auphonic presets alphabetically</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hotfix: Creating Auphonic productions works again</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Auphonic: reduce preset cache to 10 seconds so manual refreshing is not necessary (and remove broken refresh button on module page)</li>\n<li>Auphonic: select configured show preset when selecting a show</li>\n<li>Auphonic: fix status updates when opening an episode with an already running production</li>\n<li>performance: don&#8217;t try to fetch file headers twice for unreachable URLs</li>\n<li>performance: faster saving of slug changes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shows selection in the episode was rewritten for the new frontend stack. It is now compatible with the Automatic Numbering module again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>transcripts: include json link in RSS again when &#8220;Publisher Generated&#8221; is selected</li>\n<li>transcripts: polish timestamp rendering in preview (shorter, monospaced, right aligned, unselectable)</li>\n<li>chapters: fix &#8220;unknown&#8221; durations</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>security: add nonces to tools actions</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.0</h4>\n<p><strong>Feature: Better control over transcripts in RSS feed</strong></p>\n<p>There is a new feature under <code>Podlove &gt; Podcast Feeds</code> called &#8220;Episode<br />\nTranscripts&#8221; to control how episode transcripts should be referenced in your RSS<br />\nfeed. The default is &#8220;Publisher Generated vtt&#8221;, which is nearly the same<br />\nbehavior as before (In previous versions, three variants were referenced: vtt,<br />\njson and srt. The json and srt URLs still work but they are not referenced in<br />\nthe RSS feed any more as they are not neccessary and removing them reduces feed<br />\nsize). There is a dedicated &#8220;Do not include in feed&#8221; option, in case you do not<br />\nwant the transcripts in your RSS feed.</p>\n<p>Finally, you may prefer to host your transcript assets externally, just like<br />\nyour audio files. If you have configured a transcript asset, you can now select<br />\nit in this setting. Then the RSS feed will reference this external file<br />\ndirectly.</p>\n<p><strong>Auphonic improvements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>add button to always access the import screen</li>\n<li>add button to delete a track</li>\n<li>show status in production selection</li>\n<li>rearrange / polish various some button and information positions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Other</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>add: capability &#8220;podlove_manage_contributors&#8221; for contributors settings screens</li>\n<li>fix: sometimes missing voices in Podlove Web Player transcripts</li>\n<li>fix: sometimes an enabled asset is disabled a few moments later</li>\n<li>fix: show files as &#8220;not found&#8221; when they become unreachable</li>\n<li>transcripts: rename &#8220;delete&#8221; action to &#8220;clear&#8221;</li>\n<li>transcripts: show timestamps in editor preview</li>\n<li>upgrade heroicons (icon library) from v1 to v2</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>security: add nonces to jobs management</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>add: migrate episode license selector user interface</li>\n<li>change: show unknown duration as &#8220;&#8211;:&#8211;:&#8211;.&#8212;&#8221; instead of &#8220;00:00:00.000&#8221;</li>\n<li>fix: auto-generate file slug from episode-post-title</li>\n<li>fix: ensure slug field is always usable (wide enough, and prefix shortened if necessary)</li>\n<li>security: fix SQL injection vulnerability in Related Episodes module</li>\n<li>security: ensure only administrators can manage jobs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.13</h4>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Templates: new <code>active</code> accessor for <code>File</code> objects.
