        "faq": "\n<h4>What is adz.world really?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>adz.world is the brainchild of composer, human rights advocate, and entrepreneur dainis w michel. The goal of adz.world is for website publishers to be able to generate income without necessarily charging money for access to content. Dainis W. Michel was confronted with a dilemma, when his father left a project behind that they had planned to do together.</p>\n<p>Upon the passing of Rev. Dr. Walter L. Michel, his son Dainis found numbered and labeled VHS tapes, almost perfectly arranged, in a closet, dust-free, as if they‚Äôd planned to meet and continue where they‚Äôd left off 20 years prior.</p>\n<p>Dainis had the tapes digitized, but found himself in a quandary regarding how he could offset the expenses of putting his father‚Äôs digitized lectures online.</p>\n<p>Instead of charging for access or creating a physical product, Dainis developed the adz.world plugin to give web publishers a way to create healthy advertising ecosystems that their audiences would enjoy ‚Äî so that websites that provide content that people generally don‚Äôt pay for could become self-sustaining and could generate revenue &amp; ensure their longevity.</p>\n<p>One of the first websites to deploy the adz.world plugin is https://www.bible-experts.com, where visitors can increase their knowledge of the Bible while experiencing faith-related advertisements that help finance the website. As is one of the fundamental purposes of the adz.world plugin, while learning about the Bible, if visitors have expressed interest in other products in their adz.world accounts, then bible-experts.com can receive affiliate commissions for the purchase of really any products purchased while visiting bible-experts.com.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the difference between the free and premium versions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The only difference is revenue sharing. With the free plugin, you share advertising space and revenue with our network. With the premium version, you have the option to share revenue with our network or not in your adz rotations.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
