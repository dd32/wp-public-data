        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20for%20free%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin for free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely! You can use this plugin free of cost, without any sort of restrictions or pricing.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20always%20seeing%20a%20%22generating%20preview%22%20screenshot%20when%20hovering%20on%20my%20links%3F'>\nI am always seeing a &#8220;Generating Preview&#8221; screenshot when hovering on my links?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Well, this is a kind of limitaion from mShots. They need some time to fetch the website&#8217;s screenshot for the first time, in their server. Once they have a screenshot in their server for that specific link, you will not see that &#8220;Generating preview&#8221; message anymore. So to get rid of this, after publishing any new post or page, hover on all the links you added there so that mShots generates a preview of that, and your visitors do not see that message anymore.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20don%27t%20like%20the%20current%20preview%20box%27s%20style.'>\nI don&#8217;t like the current preview box&#8217;s style.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can change the styling/design of the preview box easily by applying styles in the &#8220;.on-hover-link-prev&#8221; class. You can change the background colour, padding, body-shadow etc. If even after applying styles doesn&#8217;t reflect any changes, try using the &#8220;!important&#8221; property.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20exclude%20the%20preview%20from%20certain%20pages%3F'>\nHow can I exclude the preview from certain pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently, it&#8217;s not possible to exclude the preview from certain pages. But, you can exclude the preview in specific Elements (Ex: h1, h2 ), Classes (Ex: .class1, .another-class ) or even specific IDs (Ex: #my-id, #id1).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%27s%20functionality%20slow%20my%20pages%20down%3F'>\nWill this plugin&#8217;s functionality slow my pages down?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Seemingly impossible! Only one JS file is being loaded on the frontend, which is a minified version, having a size of 1.13 KB. And the request to get the previews are loaded on hover, means, it will not have any impact of the TTFB or the first contentful paint. The previews are cached as well, to avoid sending multiple preview requests.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
