Because of this, any article that is currently listed on the alert will be automatically replaced when you attempt to delete it. The only way to remove the article is to (a) wait for the article to no longer be listed on the alert feed and then delete it or (b) delete the feed and then delete the article. You can also &#8216;Delete Old Articles&#8217; which will delete all articles from the database. WPGAlerts will then reload the XML alerts and the database will then only contain the newest articles from the feeds.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Articles are not updating</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently WPGAlerts only updates the articles available when you visit the WPGAlerts page from the WordPress Admin panel. Because all articles require approval, WPGAlerts does not automatically check feeds.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
