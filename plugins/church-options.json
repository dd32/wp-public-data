In fact, at Quixotic Studios we design and develope custom themes for churches that work with our Church Options plugin for free, as long as we are allowed to then sell that theme on <a href=\"http://quixotic-studios.com/themes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our themes page</a>. If you would prefer to keep your theme unique (not letting us sell it), then contact us for a quote.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to use all the post types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can use only the ones you need. They can be chosen in the <em>Church Options</em> plugin settings page by clicking the appropriate checkbox and then <em>Save Changes</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use the custom post types in my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Church Options compliant themes available at <a href=\"http://quixotic-studios.com/themes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Quixotic Studios</a> include several custom widgets and page templates for displaying the post types.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
