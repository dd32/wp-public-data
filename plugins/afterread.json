        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>afterread' folder to the</code>/wp-content/plugins/` directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Navigate to the afterRead settings page found under the &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu</li>\n<li>Select a different suggestion or use the default</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What is a Suggestion?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A Suggestion is anything you want to encourage the reader to do once they have finished reading, commonly a link to other posts. A Suggestion file is a php file which afterRead core uses to generate a Suggestion.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need PHP or HTML knowledge to use afterRead?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, I have attempted to make afterRead extremely usable for anyone with limited knowledge or no knowledge of HTML and PHP. If there is a feature you&#8217;re confused about just tell me so that I can improve the documentation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have an idea for a new Suggestion</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Perfect, the more Suggestions the better. If you get me an image of what you would like it to look like then I can see about coding it, I can&#8217;t promise I will be able to add it but I will certainly consider it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When using tag based Suggestions the links seem random</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is quite confusing to see, but it&#8217;s actually logical. To illustrate this say we have a post, this post was made on the 20th and has a &#8216;cooking&#8217; tag. Say there is then another post made on the 18th that had the &#8216;cooking&#8217; tag and a &#8216;book&#8217; tag, this will cause the 20th&#8217;s post to link to the 18th&#8217;s, now pretend that there was a post made on the 19th that only had the book tag, this will cause the 18th&#8217;s post to link to the 19th&#8217;s post and not the post made on the 20th.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When using category based Suggestions the links seem random</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The same thing can happen for categories as happens with tags in the above question, it is less common because it is rather rare to add a post in two categories.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The Add Suggestion field in the settings page does not work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can happen if the unix write permmisons do not allow the script to create new files. To fix it you have to change the write permisions and reactivate afterRead.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
