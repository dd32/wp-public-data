How often do you use them? This is essential for SEO (search engine optimization) reasons. You want to use your keywords a bunch, but not too much.</p>\n<p>But when you write, you&#8217;re often faced with the problem: how many times did I use this keyword, or that one? Usually, there&#8217;s a manual process: control-F (or command-F for Mac lovers!) to find and count the number of times you used it, look up the total number of words, do some division &#8212; and this gets frustrating before you even start.</p>\n<p>But look no further! The Keyword Counter &amp; Density Calculator is here to help.</p>\n<p>Here is how it works. Once installed and activated, when you write a post or a page, above the text editing box, there is a new button called &#8220;Count Keywords&#8221;. Click it, and a chart will come up. For all keywords, it lists their frequency, so you can see how many times you&#8217;ve used it. For the first few keywords, it also lists their density &#8212; both, as compared to the total # of words you wrote, and also as compared to the total number of non-small words you wrote (excluding words like &#8220;in&#8221;, &#8220;of&#8221;, and &#8220;but&#8221;, for example). You also get, for the first few keywords, a red/yellow/green alert as to how on target the density is, so you know what you need to improve.</p>\n<p>There are some useful settings, too. You can turn on/off whether you want the count to include the small words or not. You can also add in words to exclude, as well. We also offer a premium version that, in addition to these features, as a few other advanced features as well, that you can read about here: &lt; https://www.wpsos.io/wordpress-plugin-keyword-counter-and-density-calculator/ &gt;.</p>\n<p>For more information and support, check out: https://www.wpsos.io/wordpress-plugin-keyword-counter-and-density-calculator/</p>\n<h3>Which options do you modify?</h3>\n<p>You can choose between the following options.</p>\n<h3>General Settings tab</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Include/exclude small words</li>\n<li>Configure additional words to exclude</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Pro Features</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Configure word stemming.
