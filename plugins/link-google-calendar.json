        "": "<p>2.0\nAdded the ability to use up to 5 different calendars.</p>\n\n<p>1.2\nThis version creates a very small change to the shortocde output which fixes warning issues when users have their site in development mode with WP_DEBUG enabled.If you upgraded to version 1.1 then you might want to go ahead and install this version so you will not see any warnings if for some reason you have WP_DEBUG enabled.</p>\n\n<p>1.1\nThis version allows the user to place the calendar shortcode anywhere on the page and have the calendar appear exactly where you place the shortcode.\nThe first version still works fine. It places the calendar at the top of the page. New version places the calendar exactly where you place the shortcode on the page.</p>\n\n<p>1.0\nInitial Commit</p>"
