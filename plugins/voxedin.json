        "faq": "\n<h4>Is any personal information transferred to VoxedIn?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We don&#8217;t need to know anything about you or your users, all we do is check that<br />\nthe voice registered against a unique ID is the same voice logging in. In this<br />\nplugin the unique ID is created by hashing the user&#8217;s username together with<br />\nthe access key that we provide to you. This ensures that VoxedIn cannot in<br />\nany way reverse engineer your usernames from the unique IDs it receives.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How is the interaction between my site and VoxedIn secured?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We communicate with your site via the users browser, which marshals the login<br />\nprocess between our two systems; there are no new routes needed in or out of<br />\nyour servers.  Messages are encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption and a shared<br />\nkey that we both hold secret.</p>\n<p>When the user initiates a login, your site forwards an encrypted message to our<br />\nsite via a form post.  We handle the voice biometric authentication and send the<br />\nresults back via another encrypted form post to your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The iPhone app hangs while uploading audio, what to do ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is usually due to a network interruption. You can cancel and scan the<br />\ncode again, or wait.  We&#8217;re working on making this smoother.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
