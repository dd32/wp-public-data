This Add-On supports creating or updating Constituent records as well as Surveys.</p>\n<p>To use this Add-On, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have an licensed, active version of Gravity Forms &gt;= 1.9.3</li>\n<li>Have a working Luminate instance, as well as Luminate API credentials (key, username, and password)</li>\n<li>Make sure the IP address of the server(s) you&#8217;re running this Add-On on is whitelisted with Luminate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you meet those requirements, this plugin is for you, and should make building new forms and passing constituent data and/or survey responses into Luminate much easier than manually mucking with HTML forms provided by the platform.</p>\n<p><em>Initial development of this plugin was funded in part by the <a href=\"http://www.cvt.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Center for Victims of Torture</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Need custom support on Luminate or WordPress?</strong> Contact Cornershop Creative to get help with a custom designed Luminate donation form, email marketing support, or supporting your WordPress website. <a href=\"https://cornershopcreative.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact us</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>gravityforms-luminate</code> directory to your plugins directory (typically <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code>)</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Navigate to Forms &gt; Settings in the WordPress admin</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Luminate Constituents API&#8221; in the lefthand column of that page</li>\n<li>Enter your organization&#8217;s servlet (domain), organization short name, API key, API username, and API password</li>\n<li>Edit the &#8220;Settings&#8221; of individual forms to configure how data is fed into Luminate</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20with%20ninja%20forms%2C%20contact%20form%207%2C%20jetpack%2C%20etc%3F'>\nDoes this work with Ninja Forms, Contact Form 7, Jetpack, etc?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. This is specifically an Add-On for Gravity Forms and will not have any effect if installed an activated without it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20version%20of%20gravity%20forms%20do%20i%20need%3F'>\nWhat version of Gravity Forms do I need?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must be running at least Gravity Forms 1.9.3.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kinds%20of%20data%20can%20this%20pass%20to%20luminate%3F'>\nWhat kinds of data can this pass to Luminate?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Right now, this Add-On supports pushing Gravity Forms responses into Constituent records, into Survey responses and/or adding users to Luminate Groups. It does not support advocacy forms or donation forms. It can pass data into any built-in Constituent field in Luminate, as well as map Constituent profile data in response to published Surveys.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20survey%20data%20isn%27t%20making%20it%20into%20luminate%20how%20i%20expected.%20is%20this%20plugin%20broken%3F'>\nMy survey data isn&#8217;t making it into Luminate how I expected. Is this plugin broken?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to the flexibility of Luminate&#8217;s survey tool, it&#8217;s not possible at this time for this plugin to perform any validation on the field values being fed from the user into Luminate. The survey tool can be very particular about what it accepts: a minor mismatch in a field&#8217;s value (such as a misspelling) can cause Luminate to ignore/reject a provided value. If you&#8217;re having problems, your best bet is to triple-check that the Gravity Forms-generated field values <em>exactly</em> match the valid, acceptable field values defined in your survey. If you&#8217;re having problems, you should enable Gravity Forms logging (or install the Gravity Forms logging plugin if the Gravity Forms version is less than version 2.2) to see the data that is sent to Luminate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20site%27s%20ip%20address%20keeps%20changing%20and%20the%20plugin%20stops%20sending%20information%20to%20luminate.%20what%27s%20happening%3F'>\nMy site&#8217;s IP address keeps changing and the plugin stops sending information to Luminate. What&#8217;s happening?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Due to limitations with Luminate&#8217;s API, you must whitelist the IP address API requests are coming from. If your website is hosted on a service such as Pantheon or another service where your site&#8217;s public IP address frequently changes, this plugin may not work for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20luminate%20site%20uses%20a%20custom%20domain%2C%20will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20my%20custom%20luminate%20domain%3F'>\nMy Luminate site uses a custom domain, will this plugin work with my custom Luminate domain?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin will work with custom Luminate domains. If your secure site is not https://secure.convio.net or https://secure2.convio.net and is instead something like https://secure.my-domain-here.org, this plugin should work for you. On the plugin settings page, use your custom secure domain when entering in the Luminate servlet.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20form%20submissions%20are%20not%20showing%20up%20in%20luminate%2C%20why%20is%20this%20happening%3F'>\nMy form submissions are not showing up in Luminate, why is this happening?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Enable Gravity Forms logging and you will see a log file being generated for this plugin. The log file should contain information about why your submissions are not appearing in Luminate. If you are unable to resolve the issues in the log file, please contact Cornershop Creative support or add a ticket to the plugin support forum.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
