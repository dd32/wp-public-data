        "installation": "<p><strong>Automatic installation</strong></p>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of our affiliate plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type “Hurricane WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found our affiliate plugin for WooCommerce you can install it by clicking &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Manual installation</strong></p>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the affiliate plugin for WooCommerce and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving your custom subdomain</strong></p>\n<p>The only thing you need to do to start using this plugin is save your custom subdomain in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed and activated go to Settings -&gt; Hurricane and enter the custom subdomain you selected when creating your Hurricane account. <strong>You should only enter the subdomain, not the entire URL.</strong></p>\n<p>Once your subdomain is saved in the plugin settings, WooCommerce will start sending the information for new sales to Hurricane. Hurricane will appropriately award commissions to your affiliates as they refer customers to your store.</p>\n<p><strong>Updating</strong></p>\n<p>Automatic updates for the Hurricane affiliate plugin for WooCommerce should work like all other plugins. You should always ensure you backup your site just in case when installing or updating any plugin.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>How do I configure the plugin?</h4>\n<p>After installing and activating the plugin, go to Settings -&gt; Hurricane and enter the custom subdomain you selected when you created your Hurricane account. You don&#8217;t need to enter the entire URL, just the subdomain. The subdomain is the part in bold http://<strong>SUBDOMAIN</strong>.hurricane.io</p>\n<p>After saving your subdomain in the plugin settings, WooCommerce will start sending new orders to Hurricane and Hurricane will appropriately award commissions to your affiliates for referring customers to your store.</p>\n<h4>How are commissions calculated?</h4>\n<p>Hurricane uses the order total after all discounts have been applied to calculate commissions for the order. The shipping and tax amounts are not included in the order total for calculating commissions.</p>\n<h4>Do you keep a percentage of the sale or the reward?</h4>\n<p>No. We don&#8217;t roll like that. It&#8217;s all for you.</p>\n<h4>How does the A/B testing work?</h4>\n<p>When you create an ad you can upload multiple images for that ad. All of the images for a particular ad should be the same dimensions. Each time the ad gets displayed on your affiliates sites one of the provided images is randomly displayed. Hurricane keeps track of all the impressions, clicks, and conversions for each ad image so you can see which images are performing the best.</p>\n<h4>Where can I find out more?</h4>\n<p>For more answers to common questions and information about running your own affiliate program, please visit <a href=\"http://hurricane.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://hurricane.io</a></p>\n",
