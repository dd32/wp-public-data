Will pluging work on older wordpress builds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Zamango Page Navigation uses few features which were implemented in WordPress v.2.8.0 so it will not work correctly on older versions.<br />\nAlthought I use it myself on wordpress 2.7.4 with few limitaions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t want to use quick links on post page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just uncheck both &#8220;before post&#8221; &amp; &#8220;after post&#8221; checkboxes on a <code>Quick links on single post</code> tab of plugin options page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using WordPress theme already had quick links and they confuse visitors</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To make native theme navigation bar absolutely invisible just add following string into plugin&#8217;s CSS (without apostrophes):<br />\n    .navigation {display:none;}<br />\nIt must help in most themes. If not then it&#8217;s needed to edit your theme files (but do it on your own responsibility).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
