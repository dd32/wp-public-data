I didn&#8217;t like working with it, I don&#8217;t trust it and I don&#8217;t want any of it to touch my WordPress installation. I don&#8217;t want the two to share databases and I don&#8217;t want to interface directly with MyBB code. Therefore, I do a couple of simple database queries and when things get more complex (e.g. posting a thread), I have WordPress connect to MyBB via HTTP and post just like a regular user.

It was messy to deal with and in the end I felt that comments are less community oriented than a forum, so I&#8217;d rather point my users to the forum saying &#8220;Hey look, there is a real community, not just a blog post with comments, join in, have fun!&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Cross-Posts are to be updated from the edit page of the original post, directly updating a cross-post using your forum will result in the changes being lost the next time you update the original post.</li>\n<li>Deleting an original post will leave the cross-post untouched (you can manually link it to a different original post from the MyBBXP settings page).</li>\n<li>Deleting a cross-post using your forum will cause the original post to behave as if it were never cross-posted (it can be cross-posted anew).</li>\n</ul>\n",

I will keep it updated for as long as I need it and try and fix any bugs you may encounter, but I&#8217;m quite happy with the features as they are. If you&#8217;d like more functionality, you&#8217;ll either have to convince me that I really want that feature, pay me a ton of money, program it yourself, or find someone else to do the job for you. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin come with support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. I like to think of myself as a nice guy, so if you run into trouble, I&#8217;ll try to help out. However I might not check in often to see if people are having trouble.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I fork your plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s licensed GPLv3+, go nuts.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
