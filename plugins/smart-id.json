Supported methods among others are: Belgian eID card, Latvian Personas apliecība, Latvian eParaksts Mobile, Lithuanian Asmens tapatybės kortelė and M. parašas, Portugese Cartão de Cidadão, Estonian ID card + Mobile-ID, Smart-ID. Each method can be turned on and off individually.</p>\n<p>Plugin implements eideasy.com Oauth 2.0 protocol like Facebook and Google login.</p>\n<p>After plugin installation you need to register your site to activate your site and get the Oauth credentials. Also your e-mail needs to be verified.</p>\n<h3>Filters and actions</h3>\n<p>There are several filters for customizing the plugin behaviour using add_filter() WordPress function.<br />\n1. Filter &#8220;eideasy_login&#8221; enables customizing the page where user will be redirected after login completed.<br />\n2. Filter &#8220;eideasy_new_user_email&#8221; enabled setting user e-mail to something else that default idcode@local.localhost<br />\n3. Filters to customize login buttons look and feel are: &#8220;ee-id-card-login, ee-mobile-id-login, lv-id-card-login, lt-id-card-login, lt-mobile-id-login, pt-id-card-login, smart-id-login&#8221;<br />\n4. Action eideasy_user_created. Will be executed when new user has been created. Will get new user ID and user data as arguments.<br />\n5. Action eideasy_after_logged_in. Will be executed every time when user info has been received and just before setting login cookie. Gets user data and user ID as arguments.<br />\n6. Action eideasy_user_identified. Runs immediately after user data has been received and includes array of data returned by eID Easy.</p>\n<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>\n<p>Use shortcode [eid_easy] to get login button,<br />\nUse shortcode [contract id=&#8221;123ABC&#8221;] to create document signing page. Get the actual contract ID value from https://id.eideasy.com</p>\n<p>Since WordPress needs user e-mail and e-mail for users is not part of the data received during identification then fake e-mail is created. Change the new user account e-mail with add_filter() and filter eideasy_new_user_email. By default email will be idcode@local.localhost</p>\n<p>Support email: help@eideasy.com<br />\nSupport phone +372 555 29 332</p>\n",
