It&#8217;s also compatible with YITH Infinite Scrolling plugin, with Swiper being initialized for AJAX loaded products.</p>\n<p>Some WooCommerce Blocks are not fully compatible with this plugin as they do not use standard WooCommerce filters for generating thumbnails. This is a known limitation of WooCommerce Blocks and not specific to this plugin. You can fix this by using WooCommerce shortcodes instead of the WooCommerce Blocks.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any conflicts with other themes or plugins, please report them to us.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
