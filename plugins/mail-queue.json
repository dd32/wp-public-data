        "faq": "\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20configure%20anything%3F'>\nDo I need to configure anything?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Once activated please go into the Settings of the Plugin to do some configurations.</p>\n<p>You can enable the Queue, control how many emails and how often they should be sent.</p>\n<p>You can enable the Alerting feature and control at which point exactly you want to be alerted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does this plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If enabled this plugin intercepts the wp_mail() function. Instead of sending the mails directly, it stores them in the database and sends them step by step with a delay during the WP Cron.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20change%20the%20way%20how%20the%20emails%20are%20sent%3F'>\nDoes this plugin change the way HOW the emails are sent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This plugin does not change HOW the emails are sent. For example: If you use SMTP for sending, or a third-party-service like Mailgun, everything will still work.</p>\n<p>This plugin changes WHEN the emails are sent. By the email Queue it gives you control about how many emails should be sent in which interval.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%2C%20if%20i%20have%20a%20caching%20plugin%20installed%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work, if I have a caching Plugin installed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, WP Rocket or any other caching solution which generates static HTML files and serves them to visitors, you&#8217;ll have to make sure you&#8217;re calling the wp-cron file manually every couple of minutes.</p>\n<p>Otherwise your normal WP Cron wouldn&#8217;t be called as often as it should be and scheduled messages would be sent with big delays.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20proxy-caching%2C%20e.g.%20nginx%3F'>\nWhat about Proxy-Caching, e.g. NGINX?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Same situation here. Please make sure you&#8217;re calling the WordPress Cron by an external service or your webhoster every couple of minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20form%20builder%20supports%20attachments.%20what%20about%20them%3F'>\nMy form builder supports attachments. What about them?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You are covered. All attachments are stored temporarily in the queue until they are sent along with their corresponding emails.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20queue%20alerts%3F'>\nWhat are Queue alerts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a simple and effective way to improve the security of your WordPress installation.</p>\n<p>Imagine: In case your website is sending spam through wp_mail(), the email Queue would fill up very quickly preventing your website from sending so many spam emails at once. This gives you time and avoids a lot of trouble.</p>\n<p>Queue Alerts warn you, if the Queue is longer than usal. You decide at which point you want to be alerted. So you get the chance to have a look if there might be something wrong on the website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20add%20emails%20with%20a%20high%20priority%20to%20the%20queue%3F'>\nCan I add emails with a high priority to the queue?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can add the custom <code>X-Mail-Queue-Prio</code> header set to <code>High</code> to your email. High priority emails will be sent through the standard Mail Queue sending cycle but before all normal emails lacking a priority header in the queue.</p>\n<p><em>Example 1 (add priority to Woocommerce emails):</em></p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('woocommerce_mail_callback_params',function ( $array ) {\n    $prio_header = 'X-Mail-Queue-Prio: High';\n    if (is_array($array[3])) {\n        $array[3][] = $prio_header;\n    } else {\n        $array[3] .= $array[3] ? \"\\r\\n\" : '';\n        $array[3] .= $prio_header;\n    }\n    return $array;\n},10,1);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Example 2 (add priority to Contact Form 7 form emails):</em></p>\n<p>When editing a form in Contact Form 7 just add an additional line to the<br />\n    Additional Headers field under the <code>Mail</code> tab panel.</p>\n<pre><code>X-Mail-Queue-Prio: High\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Example 3 (add priority to WordPress reset password emails):</em></p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('retrieve_password_notification_email', function ($defaults, $key, $user_login, $user_data) {\n    $prio_header = 'X-Mail-Queue-Prio: High';\n    if (is_array($defaults['headers'])) {\n        $defaults['headers'][] = $prio_header;\n    } else {\n        $defaults['headers'] .= $defaults['headers'] ? \"\\r\\n\" : '';\n        $defaults['headers'] .= $prio_header;\n    }\n    return $defaults;\n}, 10, 4);\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20send%20emails%20instantly%20without%20going%20through%20the%20queue%3F'>\nCan I send emails instantly without going through the queue?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this is possible (if you absolutely need to do this).</p>\n<p>For this you can add the custom <code>X-Mail-Queue-Prio</code> header set to <code>Instant</code> to your email. These emails are sent instantly circumventing the mail queue. They still appear in the Mail Queue log flagged as <code>instant</code>.</p>\n<p>Mind that this is a potential security risk and should be considered carefully. Please use only as an exception.</p>\n<p><em>Example 1 (instantly send Woocommerce emails):</em></p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('woocommerce_mail_callback_params',function ( $array ) {\n    $prio_header = 'X-Mail-Queue-Prio: Instant';\n    if (is_array($array[3])) {\n        $array[3][] = $prio_header;\n    } else {\n        $array[3] .= $array[3] ? \"\\r\\n\" : '';\n        $array[3] .= $prio_header;\n    }\n    return $array;\n},10,1);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Example 2 (instantly send Contact Form 7 form emails):</em></p>\n<p>When editing a form in Contact Form 7 just add an additional line to the<br />\n    Additional Headers field under the <code>Mail</code> tab panel.</p>\n<pre><code>X-Mail-Queue-Prio: Instant\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Example 3 (instantly send WordPress reset password emails):</em></p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('retrieve_password_notification_email', function ($defaults, $key, $user_login, $user_data) {\n    $prio_header = 'X-Mail-Queue-Prio: Instant';\n    if (is_array($defaults['headers'])) {\n        $defaults['headers'][] = $prio_header;\n    } else {\n        $defaults['headers'] .= $defaults['headers'] ? \"\\r\\n\" : '';\n        $defaults['headers'] .= $prio_header;\n    }\n    return $defaults;\n}, 10, 4);\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20multisite.%20can%20i%20use%20mail%20queue%3F'>\nI have a MultiSite. Can I use Mail Queue?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but with limitations.</p>\n<p>Do not activate the Mail Queue for the whole network. Instead, please activate it for each site separately. Then it will work smoothly. In a future release we&#8217;ll add full MultiSite support.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20mail%20queues%20favorite%20song%3F'>\nWhat is Mail Queues favorite song?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/425GpjTSlS4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</p>\n\n",
