When new content is added (posts, pages, comments, etc.) the cache is automatically deleted. But your entire blog will only be cached when somebody re-visits every single page. Generate Cache plugin keeps track of your cache directory and if its size drops below the value you specify, new cache for your entire blog will be automatically regenerated.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What kind of script actions are behind this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When there is no cache for some page, a script is executed which determines the size of the cache directory and compares it to the limit you specify. If the limit is not reached, a background process is triggered getting the contents of every blog item (post, page, category, tag, home) so that new cache is generated. After all pages have been called, the process is terminated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How long will it take to generate cache for my entire site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All pages are called within 1-2 second intervals. So if your blog has 100 pages, its full cache will be generated in about 100-200 seconds.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
