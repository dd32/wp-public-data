The next time the user tries to log in, the user just clicks his username (see the screenshot), we pick a random picture and send it to user&#8217;s two devices: his computer and his phone (with our free app installed). The user makes sure the pictures match and taps &#8220;Yes&#8221; on his phone. We decrypt the password, fill it in, and submit the form.

        "faq": "<h4>Do I have to pay?</h4>\n<p>No.</p>\n<h4>Do my users pay anything?</h4>\n<p>No, nothing, apart from tiny network costs according to their data plan. Also see our <a href=\"https://www.TeddyID.com/faq.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">users&#8217; FAQ</a>.</p>\n<h4>How are passwords secured?</h4>\n<p>In simple words, each password is split into two parts, one is stored in user&#8217;s browser, the other is stored in our server, and the two parts meet only in the browser. One part without the other is useless for an attacker. On our site you&#8217;ll find <a href=\"https://www.teddyid.com/sites.php#1.5factor\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more detailed security analysis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teddyid.com/password_manager_technical_description.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">description of all the cryptography behind it</a>.</p>\n<h4>How is it better than just saving passwords in browser that every modern browser can already do?</h4>\n<p>A second factor &#8211; mobile phone &#8211; is required for login. This is more secure in case an attacker gains access to the user&#8217;s computer.</p>\n<h4>How is it better than using a password manager like LastPass?</h4>\n<p>First, there is no master password that can be weak or forgotten like any other password. We check possession of the mobile phone instead. Second, few people actually bother using password managers, that means they use weak passwords, reuse the same password, and often forget them. With TeddyID, you are giving them both better security and better convenience.</p>\n",
