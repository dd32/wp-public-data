The first was bringing editor comments into Gutenberg with my <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/markdown-comment/?utm_source=wp-org&amp;utm_medium=todo-list-block&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Markdown Comment block</a>, and this Todo List block.</p>\n<p>Todo List is a simple, editor-only block designed to quickly add tasks directly within the editor.</p>\n<p>Todo List makes it easy to keep track of those tasks, all in the context of a particular post. You may also use it to add a publishing checklist to the post, such as using a headline analyzer, adding featured images, adding social images, etc.</p>\n<h4>Transforms</h4>\n<p>I’m a huge fan of blocks transforms and how they improve the WordPress publishing experience. Being able to morph a block into another, without loosing content/attributes, is a powerful way to level-up editing.</p>\n<p>That saying, you may transform paragraph text, list items and even editorial comments added by Markdown Comment directly into actionable todos, just like you can in the iOS Notes app for example. You may even take multiple blocks of the sort and convert them all into a single todo list.</p>\n<p>Todo List also supports block prefixes, which are keyboard shortcuts in a sense, to toss blocks in the editor with a few keystrokes. Adding <code>[]</code>, or <code>-[]</code> plus the <code>space</code> key will add a Todo List to the page.</p>\n",
