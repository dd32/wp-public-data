If an automated bot tries to spam your form, they will get blocked.</p>\n<p>It is based on our very successful FormSpammerTrap for Comments plugin, which uses the same techniques to effectively block Contact Form Spammers.</p>\n<p>More details about how it all works &#8211; and a Contact form that uses the same effective spambot-blocking technique &#8211; is on our <a href=\"http://www.FormSpammerTrap.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FormSpammerTrap.com Site</a>. There&#8217;s a Contact form there that has never been successfully &#8216;spam-botted&#8217; (defined as submitting many comments within a very short period of time).</p>\n",

Or download, then upload/install via the Add Plugin page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress. Activation will check to ensure that Contact Form 7 is installed and activated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usage information in Settings, FormSpammerTrap for Contact Form 7, Info/Usage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20shortcodes%20used%3F'>\nWhat are the shortcodes used?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just place the shortcode [formspammertrap] in your Contact Form 7 form. Then make sure there is at least one required field in your form. That&#8217;s all you have to do! That will block form spammers from using your Contact Form 7 form.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20use%20the%20shortcodes%3F'>\nWhere do I use the shortcodes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just place it anywhere in the Contact Form 7 form when you create/edit the contact form. We like to place it at the top to make it easily visible.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20with%20any%20theme%3F'>\nWill this work with any theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>More than likely. It only requires Javascript on the client computer &#8211; and Javascript is needed for WordPress. A message will display asking to enable Javascript if disabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20settings%3F'>\nAre there any settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nope. The &#8216;Info/Usage&#8217; (Settings) screen just contains information on the plugin, and the shortcodes used.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20have%20problems%20or%20suggestions%3F'>\nWhat if I have problems or suggestions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out the Settings page for troubleshootting steps. Or just contact us via the plugin&#8217;s Support page. Or via www.CellarWeb.com  or www.FormSpammerTrap.com .</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20other%20plugins%3F'>\nDo you have other plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>FormSpammerTrap for Comments</strong> : enhances comment forms so that bots can&#8217;t spam your comments. Uses a more clever technique than just hidden fields or captchas or other things that don&#8217;t always work. Also lets you change the text/headings of the comment form. (We also have a free standalone version; take a look at www.FormSpammerTrap.com (that&#8217;s the page that comment bots will see, but also contains all the info about the &#8216;trap&#8217;).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>URL Smasher</strong> : automatically shortens URLs on all URLs in pages/posts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AmazoLinkenator</strong> : adds your Amazon Affiliate ID to any Amazon product link in pages/posts/comments. It&#8217;s your site, so use your Amazon Affiliate ID.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All plugins are free and full-functioned. No premium features. Just search for them on the Add Plugins page.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
