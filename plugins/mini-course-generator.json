LMS tools are great, however they can be frustrating and time-consuming if all you need is to create and deliver without thinking too much. We are the only tool specialized for coaches, consultants, trainers, online course creators to create micro-learning journeys simply, and with the help of AI.</p>\n<p>Our AI-Assistant makes content creation fast beyond imagination.

You can position them to grab the attention of your leads on your websites, blog pages, and socials. Collect emails and grow your mailing list with lower unsubscribe rates. Use our sign-up wall right in the middle of a mini-course to collect emails and automate subscriptions to your newsletter with webhooks.</p>\n<p>üéØ You are looking for ways to nurture your leads and convince them for bigger offers.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with email courses, eBooks, PDFs, or video links is they lack engagement and provide one-sided communication only. Besides that, the hesitancy to start is undeniable for the end user. Results? Emails are deleted before opening, eBooks are closed after the first page, and videos are watched for only a minute.  Mini-courses are interactive, simple, and flexible. They are far better than eBooks.</p>\n<p>üéØ You have a membership site.</p>\n<p>You can enrich your membership site with us. Mini-courses are great for creating content easily and fast. Create micro-learning materials with our simple and flexible structure, and embed them on your private pages with this plugin.</p>\n<p>üéØ You offer workshops &amp; coaching/consulting programs.</p>\n<p>With MCG, you can reinforce your programs with recaps &amp; warmups. Create easy-to-digest, bite-sized series of easy-going tutorials for various educational purposes, like a follow-up to reinforce learning, preparatory activities, etc. Micro-learning dripping is the cure for shrinking attention spans. A mini-course takes so little time and effort to both create and consume. Kill the hesitancy to start something new, create quick wins, and give a sense of achievement in a short time. Keep people coming back to your website!</p>\n<p>üéØ You are a content creator and want to repurpose your existing content.</p>\n<p>Creating high-quality content needs significant time. Once you finalize, it is the best strategy to get the most out of it by repurposing. For instance, if you have created an engaging podcast, why not get its transcription and divide it into a series of mini-courses to embed on your WordPress website? Build mini-courses by repurposing social posts, youtube videos, or podcasts to gain new followers on for your website.</p>\n<p>üéØ You are an executive coach and you‚Äôd like to start monetizing your content targeting individuals.</p>\n<p>Experienced professionals working on B2B level can get frustrated with macro course builders even before getting started with B2C teaching. Mini-courses are the best option to dive into B2C market and get paid for your know-how with easy Stripe integration. Monetize your know-how through mini-courses and mini-course collections.</p>\n<p>üéØ You run a community and conduct educational programs to build engagement.</p>\n<p>Presenting a mini-course on a regular basis allows you to keep your audience engaged with your organization. This is the power of interactive content in micro-learning. Especially suitable for NGOs.</p>\n<p>üéØ Part of your job is to educate customers and new employees.</p>\n<p>As mini-courses are interactive and easy-to-follow, there is no better thing than a mini-course for onboarding programs. If you‚Äôre an after sales representative, or responsible for the education of new employees; you can create mini-courses. It is a more engaging and effective way to educate than booklets, manuals or eBooks, and also a more cost-effective tool than macro-cost builders to use for this purpose.</p>\n<h3>‚û°Ô∏è¬†Features of Mini Course Generator</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy embed with this plugin.</li>\n<li>AI-Assistant for fast content creation.</li>\n<li>Uploading countless images and videos.</li>\n<li>Embedding media from any source including YouTube, Spotify, Vimeo, etc.</li>\n<li>Stripe integration to get payment.</li>\n<li>Password protection, wholly or partially.</li>\n<li>Collecting emails with signup wall.</li>\n<li>Integrations with other tools via webhooks and workflows, including mailing platforms and Google Spreadsheets.</li>\n<li>Fully customizable interfaces to reflect your branding choices.</li>\n<li>Customizing share links by adding custom domains.</li>\n<li>SEO-friendly settings.</li>\n<li>Analytics report for each mini-course to track end-user activity.</li>\n<li>Creating collections of mini-courses.
