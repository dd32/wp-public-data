This requires you have an application registered with Disqus: https://disqus.com/api/applications/</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are no posts showing up?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Verify you have entered the correct Disqus API Key and Disqus Shortname.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take a look at the setting under Posts for Count Over How Many Days. If you have that set to a low value then try increasing it. What will happen is if you have that set to something like 1 day but you didn&#8217;t have any comments during that time then you will have no results and nothing will show. The same is true if you are saving results and notice the last update was a long time ago. If it has nothing new in that time period then it will not update.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>I have results set to save and update every X hours but it&#8217;s not updating.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Follow the steps in the above question, Why are no posts showing up?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I adjust the look of the results beyond the options available in the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each element within the results has its own class. You can edit your theme&#8217;s CSS and put in entries for the classes used in the results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Article Container Class</strong> = dpp_result (div that holds all the below items)</li>\n<li><strong>Featured Image Class</strong> = dpp_featured_image</li>\n<li><strong>Post Title Class</strong> =  dpp_post_title</li>\n<li><strong>Article Date Class</strong> = dpp_post_date</li>\n<li><strong>Article Comments Class</strong> = dpp_comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because the widget creates a <code>style</code> entry on the <code>div</code> tags, you may need to use the <code>!important</code> flag on your CSS entries to override any margins you may be setting.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

I also relabled &#8220;Comments Text&#8221; to &#8220;After Comment Count&#8221;. Further info on both fields is in the widget.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.0</h4>\n<p>Released: August 23rd, 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some web hosts may disallow the use of file_get_contents() for security. I have added a fallback method of using cURL in these instances. So, if anyone was having problems with getting posts to show up, this may be the fix you needed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.5</h4>\n<p>Released: July 29th, 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where if you saved results, and then changed the amount of posts to show to a lower value than previously set, that it would still show the previous amount until new results were fetched again. Man, that was a long sentence&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.4</h4>\n<p>Released: February 23rd, 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code cleanup to remove warnings that would appear with WP_DEBUG on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.3</h4>\n<p>Released: February 4th, 2016</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just adjusting some code documentation, and WordPress 4.4.2 validation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.2</h4>\n<p>Released: September 14th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Clear All Saved Data</em> option under <em>Debugging</em> relabled <em>Clear All Saved Results</em> to be more clear and a note provided to explain the feature better.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Clear All Saved Results</em> feature will now work properly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.1</h4>\n<p>Released: June 16th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the logic for showing an article to only show it if it has a title to display and or an image. This will avoid showing odd results if the page can&#8217;t be found for whatever reason.</li>\n<li>Moved the text for <em>Comments Text</em> to be outside the link to comments. Disqus automatically updates the text inside the link to comments if it&#8217;s being loaded and will use the settings you define in Disqus. By moving this text outside the link it will show up regardless of what is set in Disqus.</li>\n<li><em>Comments Text</em> will no longer default to the word Comments if left blank. You can now delete the text to have nothing show.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The widget will now properly save the information the first time you drag it into the sidebar. Previously it wouldn&#8217;t save the first time and you had to enter information a second time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.0.0</h4>\n<p>Released: May 8th, 2015</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> After upgrading go to <em>Posts</em>-&gt;<em>Count Over How Many Days</em> and set that value. By default it will use 90 days if you don&#8217;t set this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disqus Popular Posts can now be done with a shortcode! You will find the configuration for this under the WordPress Settings menu.</li>\n<li>Under <em>Debugging</em> there is now an option to <em>Clear All Saved Data</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put a check in place where if results need to be pulled from Disqus and it fails then it will instead show saved results if you have them.</li>\n<li>Added a <em>Disqus API Call URL</em> to the <em>Debugging</em> area to help track down any issues.</li>\n<li>Changed the field for <em>Count Over How Many Days</em> under <em>Posts</em> to a drop down. I had not realized Disqus offers only certain values to be used here, so the drop down only offers the values available. If you had problems getting posts to show up before then this may be a likely reason. <strong>You need to save this option once you upgrade.</strong></li>\n<li>Lots of coding changes and optimizations to make future versions easier to implement.</li>\n<li>Added some more questions to the FAQ section.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the error that would appear when adding the widget. It was trying to connect to Disqus without any settings defined yet.</li>\n<li>Settings if using more than one widget will now work correctly. Previously the settings of one widget would be applied to all widgets when being displayed.</li>\n<li>Results if using more than one widget will now also properly save per-widget.</li>\n<li>Fixed the error that showed up if it tried to get results from Disqus and failed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<p>Released: April 16th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup a proper class called dpp instead of having a bunch of functions.</li>\n<li>Added more function documentation.</li>\n<li>Redid this readme file to be easier to read through.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.3</h4>\n<p>Released: March 20th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Debugging</em> area on the widget that displays useful information I can use to diagnose issues with the widget.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added fallback methods for getting a post ID from Disqus to use to show the featured image and post date.</li>\n<li>Put a check in place if results are set to save but the period of time to save them is not set.</li>\n<li>The shown article title now pulls from WordPress &#8211; if a post ID can be fetched, instead of using the one return by Disqus because sometimes Disqus won&#8217;t have the current title correct.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A big thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/icstee/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">icstee</a> for helping me with fixing the bugs.</p>\n<h4>1.6.2</h4>\n<p>Released: March 19th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only render the featured image <code>div</code> and post date <code>div</code> if there are values to show.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Featured images and post dates should now show if they weren&#8217;t previously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.1</h4>\n<p>Released: March 19th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had a bug introduced in 1.6.0 (like 2 hours ago!), that would disallow you from managing other widgets in your sidebar that appeared below this one. All fixed now and one of these days I can push out an update without needing to immediately fix issues&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.6.0</h4>\n<p>Released: March 19th, 2015</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>See when saved results were last updated. Shown under the <em>Posts</em> group.</li>\n<li>You can change the text that appears beside the comment count. Previously it would always show as something like: 12 Comments.
