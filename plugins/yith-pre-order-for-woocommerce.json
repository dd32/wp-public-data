        "description": "<p>With YITH Pre-Order for WooCommerce you can enable a pre-sales system in your shop, increase your customers&#8217; interest in soon-to-be-released products and get cash flow in advance to cover the costs of production/promotion.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>With this free plugin, you can easily manage the pre-sale of your products and create a marketing strategy similar to that used by large e-commerce stores such as Amazon, Apple, Nike, and Nintendo. You’ll be able to change the &#8220;Add to cart&#8221; button label to &#8220;Pre-order&#8221;, set a release date for your products, and send an email notification to your customers when the products they pre-ordered become available in your store.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to offer an incentive to push customers to pre-order products?</strong> The winning strategy is to offer a special discount on the price of your products only to those who pre-order them (e.g. &#8220;Get $50 off only if you pre-order the new smartphone now!&#8221;).</p>\n<h4>Free version options</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Select in which products to enable the pre-order mode</li>\n<li>Disable pre-order mode manually or automatically if you select a release/availability date (and time)</li>\n<li>Customize the label and colors of the &#8220;Add to cart&#8221; button in the &#8220;Frequently Bought Together&#8221; section</li>\n<li>Set a fixed price for products in pre-order mode (e.g. $100 when pre-order mode is enabled, $120 when it is disabled)</li>\n<li>Apply a discount (or the opposite, increase the product price) when customers purchase a pre-order product</li>\n<li>Charge the product price the moment the customer places the pre-order</li>\n<li>Receive an email as admin when a customer pre-orders a product</li>\n<li>Send an email to customers when they pre-order a product</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to see the plugin in action?
