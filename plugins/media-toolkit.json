Media Toolkit allows you to change that value globally.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='big_image_size_threshold%20vs%20media%20toolkit'>\nbig_image_size_threshold vs Media Toolkit\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; max image size is set to 2560px by default. Though, if an image is uploaded bigger than the threshold, WordPress does not just scale down the original image to the threshold.<br />\nInstead, WordPress stores the original image and simply provides the 2560px image as the biggest image available to the users.</p>\n<p>Media Toolkit actually replaces the original image with the threshold defined in the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
