        "description": "<p>Are you looking for a way to improve your WordPress site search and make it easier for your visitors to find what they need? If so, you need <strong><a href=\"https://webberzone.com/plugins/better-search/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Better Search</a></strong>, the plugin that replaces the default WordPress search engine with a more powerful and relevant one.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Search</strong> is not just a simple search plugin. It is a complete solution that gives you full control over your site search results. You can customize the output, fine tune the relevance, search within different fields and post types, track the popular searches, and much more.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Better Search</strong>, you can make your site search more user-friendly and engaging. You can display a &#8220;search heatmap&#8221; of the most popular searches on your site, either as a widget or a shortcode. You can also use your own template file and CSS styles to match your theme perfectly.</p>\n<p><strong>Better Search</strong> has its own caching system and is also compatible with caching plugins like WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about performance issues. It also has a profanity filter that lets you block unwanted words from search queries. And it is translation ready, so you can use it in any language.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the main features of <strong>Better Search</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic</strong>: Just activate the plugin and enjoy better search results right away</li>\n<li><strong>Seamless integration</strong>: No need to edit any code or create custom search templates</li>\n<li><strong>Relevance</strong>: Sort the results by relevance or date, and assign different weights to title and content</li>\n<li><strong>Control the results</strong>: Search within title, content, excerpt, meta fields, authors, tags and other taxonomies and comments</li>\n<li><strong>Popular searches</strong>: Show a heatmap of the most popular searches on your site, either as a widget or a shortcode</li>\n<li><strong>Customisation</strong>: Use your own template file and CSS styles for the ultimate look and feel</li>\n<li><strong>Supports cache plugins</strong>: Works seamlessly with caching plugins like WP-Super-Cache and W3 Total Cache</li>\n<li><strong>Profanity filter</strong>: Filter out any words that you don&#8217;t want to appear in search queries</li>\n<li><strong>Translation ready</strong>: Use the plugin in any language</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to take your site search to the next level, download <strong>Better Search</strong> today and see the difference for yourself.</p>\n<h4>mySQL FULLTEXT indices</h4>\n<p>On activation, the plugin creates three mySQL FULLTEXT indices (or indexes) in the <code>*_posts</code> table. These are for <code>post_content</code>, <code>post_title</code> and <code>(post_title,post_content)</code>. If you’re running a multisite installation, then this is created for each of the blogs on activation. All these indices occupy space in your mySQL database but are essential for the plugin to run.</p>\n<h4>Contribute</h4>\n<p>Better Search is also available on <a href=\"https://github.com/WebberZone/better-search\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a><br />\nSo, if you&#8217;ve got some cool feature that you&#8217;d like to implement into the plugin or a bug you&#8217;ve been able to fix, consider forking the project and sending me a pull request.</p>\n<h4>Plugins by WebberZone</h4>\n<p>Better Search is one of the many plugins developed by WebberZone.
