How to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>RSS campaigns send out a digest of blog posts on a schedule using your RSS feed URL. Further details can be found here: https://kb.benchmarkemail.com/how-do-i-create-an-rss-to-email-campaign/</p>\n<p>Inside your WordPress Admin area, select Benchmark &gt; Interface. Navigate to Emails &gt; Create &gt; RSS Email &gt; Drag/Drop.</p>\n<p>Enter your WordPress URL, which is your website followed by /feed. You may wish to filter the posts by category or tag, for example: https://codedcommerce.com/category/marketing-tips/feed. You may also use category IDs and filter nagatively to exclude a comma-separated list of them, for example: https://codedcommerce.com/?cat=-52047&amp;feed=rss2</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q3%3A%20can%20i%20use%20contact%20form%207%20%28gravity%20forms%2C%20etc.%29%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nQ3: Can I use Contact Form 7 (Gravity Forms, etc.) with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin does not directly use any form frameworks other than native Benchmark Email signup forms. As with most WordPress projects, you can bridge the two together with custom code. We&#8217;ve assembled an example based on Contact Form 7. Install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/\" rel=\"ugc\">Code Snippets plugin</a>, import the <a href=\"https://dev.codedcommerce.com/connect-contact-form-7-form-with-benchmark-email-contact-list.code-snippets.json\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sample code file</a>, edit the code snippet to change the list ID mappings within the code and tailor the form field names to match your form (or visa-versa), then enable the code snippet and test.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q4%3A%20can%20i%20programmatically%20filter%20the%20html%20email%20campaigns%3F'>\nQ4: Can I programmatically filter the HTML email campaigns?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. In v3.3 we&#8217;ve added new hooks you can use in your custom functions. The new hooks are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>add_filter( 'wpbme_post_title', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );</code></li>\n<li><code>add_filter( 'wpbme_post_content', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );</code></li>\n<li><code>add_filter( 'wpbme_email_type', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );</code></li>\n<li><code>add_filter( 'wpbme_email_html', function( $value, $post ) { return $value; }, 10, 2 );</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These filter the blog post title, the content body, the email type and generated HTML body. The email type is <code>DD</code> for the drop-down email editor and can be changed to <code>Custom</code> when doing raw HTML.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
