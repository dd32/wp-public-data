But it also makes it easy to show images for your site&#8217;s logo, url, smartphone bookmark, and social sharing at sites such as Facebook.</p>\n<p>For styles, first create a style sheet for the theme you want to adjust. For example, if you have a theme called soverycool, you might name your style sheet soverycool.css. Your file only needs to contain those style elements you&#8217;d like to change.</p>\n<p>Next, upload it via the Upload File form. Once your file is uploaded, just insert its name into the css filename box and press Set Style. If you have several themes, you can keep all of your custom style sheets in that directory as long as they have different names. Then just enter the name for whichever theme you&#8217;re using at the time.</p>\n<p>To stop using your custom style, just remove the name from the css filename box and press Set Style. You do not need to actually delete your files from the uploads directory.</p>\n<p>For icons, upload them via the Upload File form and repeat for each icon. The names have to be favicon.ico, phone.png, share.png, and logo.png. Changing them is as easy as uploading new files with the same name. For your site logo to appear, the following code needs to be added to your theme&#8217;s header in the place you want it to appear: <code>&lt;?php thtw_logo(); ?&gt;</code></p>\n",

The style sheet name should still be set from before, if you used that.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20important%20how%20i%20name%20the%20files%3F'>\nIs it important how I name the files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For styles, only the extension (.css) matters, but it would be a good idea to name the file after the theme it overrides. For icons, they must be named exactly as shown in the Description.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20those%20icon%20files%20anyway%3F'>\nWhat are those icon files anyway?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The favicon.ico file is the site url image that appears in the address bar of your browser. There are free services online where you can create your own, and tutorials for making it with whatever graphics program you may have. It can&#8217;t just be .png or .jpg and renamed, but must be created as an .ico file.</p>\n<p>The phone.png image is what will appear if someone bookmarks your site via their smartphone. The size isn&#8217;t critical, though roughly square is ideal, but it has to be a .png file.</p>\n<p>The share.png image also has to be a .png file, but beyond that you can make it any shape or size. This icon is what will appear if someone shares a post from your blog on a site such as Facebook, rather than picking the first image it sees. Facebook recommends an image that is at least 200px at its minimum dimension.</p>\n<p>The logo.png image must be a .png file as well, and like the other images, it will only appear if the file is uploaded. This one requires code added to the header.php file of your theme where you want it to appear: <code>&lt;?php thtw_logo(); ?&gt;</code></p>\n</p>\n\n",
