You can sign up for a trial <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>, but you have to pay to use this API.<br />\nCurrent pricing is about $0.06 for 4 000 characters. Both prompt and response are included in that pricing, so for example:<br />\nIf you have written 500 characters, you will get a response with 250 characters (I have limited it so).<br />\nYou will pay about $0.011 for that use.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='that%20does%20not%20seem%20much%2C%20but%20how%20can%20i%20be%20protected%20from%20accidental%20usage%3F'>\nThat does not seem much, but how can I be protected from accidental usage?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have limited the API calls to one per minute.
