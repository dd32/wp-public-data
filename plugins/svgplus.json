        "description": "<p><strong>SVGPlus</strong> is a comprehensive WordPress plugin designed to empower your website with secure and efficient handling of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files. Whether you&#8217;re a designer, developer, or site administrator, SVGPlus offers a robust solution for managing SVG assets, ensuring they are safely uploaded, sanitized, and seamlessly integrated into your Elementor-powered designs.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Secure SVG Uploads with Automatic Sanitization</strong>: Easily upload SVG files directly to your WordPress media library, with automatic sanitization to remove potentially harmful code. This feature protects your website from malicious SVG uploads, ensuring enhanced security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Role-Based Upload Permissions</strong>: Control which user roles are permitted to upload SVG files. Administrators can select specific roles (e.g., Editor, Author) that are allowed to upload SVGs, enhancing security by limiting access.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Option to Remove Width and Height Attributes</strong>: Choose to automatically remove width and height attributes from SVG files upon upload. This feature helps in making SVGs responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Elementor Compatibility and Design Flexibility</strong>: Seamlessly integrate SVGs within Elementor&#8217;s native widgets like Image, Icon, Image Box, and Icon Box without needing a dedicated widget. Leverage the scalability and crispness of SVGs within Elementor&#8217;s powerful design tools, and add specific classes for enhanced CSS styling and consistency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shortcode Support for Flexible Embedding and Ease of Use</strong>: Embed SVGs anywhere on your site using the <code>[svgplus id=\"123\"]</code> shortcode, where <code>123</code> is the attachment ID of your SVG. Customize your SVGs by adding custom classes, alt text, and enabling lazy loading directly within the shortcode, simplifying SVG management and providing greater control over their presentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Performance Optimizations for Improved Load Times</strong>: Optimize your site&#8217;s performance with lazy loading for SVG images, ensuring they load only when they enter the viewport. Sanitized SVGs are stripped of unnecessary code, reducing file sizes and enhancing page load times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Centralized Settings for Consistency and Control</strong>: Access a dedicated settings page (<code>Settings &gt; SVGPlus</code>) in the WordPress admin dashboard to configure plugin options. Enable animations, control upload permissions, remove width and height attributes, and add global custom CSS to style all SVGs managed by SVGPlus, maintaining a consistent design aesthetic across your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SEO and Accessibility Enhancements</strong>: Easily add descriptive alt text to SVGs to improve both SEO and accessibility. Clean and optimized SVGs contribute to better SEO practices by reducing file sizes and ensuring your graphics are search-engine friendly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<h3>Uploading and Managing SVGs</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Upload SVGs:</strong> Go to the WordPress media library (<code>Media &gt; Add New</code>) and upload your SVG files as you would with any other media type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Sanitized SVGs:</strong> SVGPlus automatically sanitizes your SVG uploads to ensure they are safe and optimized for use on your website.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Configuring Plugin Settings</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access Settings:</strong> Navigate to <code>Settings &gt; SVGPlus</code> in the WordPress admin dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Allow SVG Animations:</strong> Toggle the option to allow animated SVGs across your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Remove Width and Height Attributes:</strong> Enable this option to remove width and height attributes from SVG files during upload, making them more responsive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Select Allowed User Roles:</strong> Choose which user roles are permitted to upload SVG files to your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Add Custom CSS:</strong> Input any custom CSS to style your SVGs globally. This CSS will be applied to all SVGs managed by SVGPlus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Save Changes:</strong> Click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button to apply your settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; version 2 of the License.</p>\n",
