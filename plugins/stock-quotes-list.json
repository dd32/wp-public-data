        "description": "<p>Stockdio&#8217;s Stock Quotes List contains a plugin and a widget that provide the means to display a list of stock prices, market indices, currencies and commodities with their variations. Over 65 different stock exchanges and a large number of market indices, currencies and commodities are supported. Optionally, an interactive price chart can be included with the list.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the standard Gutenberg editor, the easiest way to include this plugin on your page is using the Stock Quotes List block, which is included in the Stockdio Financial Visualizations category.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a different editor o prefer to use the shortcode, below is a sample to help you start. Please be aware that most of the parameters listed below are optional, and are also available through the plugin&#8217;s settings page.

If not specified, its default value is 365 days.</p>\n<p><strong>loadDataWhenVisible</strong>: Allows to fetch the data and display the visualization only when it becomes visible on the page, in order to avoid using calls (requests) when they are not needed. This is particularly useful when the visualization is not visible on the page by default, but it becomes visible as result of a user interaction (e.g. clicking on an element, etc.). It is also useful when using the same visualization multiple times on a page for different devices (e.g. using one instance of the plugin for mobile and another one for desktop). We recommend not using this by default but only on scenarios as those described above, as it may provide the end user with a small delay to display the visualization (optional).</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20integrate%20the%20stockdio%20widgets%20list%20in%20my%20page%3F'>\nHow do I integrate the Stockdio Widgets List in my page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are three options to integrate it: a. Using the Stock Quotes List block, b. Using the short code, or c. Through the use of the widget in your sidebars.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20if%20the%20stock%20exchange%20i%20need%20is%20supported%20by%20stockdio%3F'>\nHow do I know if the Stock Exchange I need is supported by Stockdio?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Stockdio supports over 65 different world exchanges. For a list of all exchanges currently supported, please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/exchanges\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/exchanges</a>. If the stock exchange you&#8217;re looking for is not in the list, please contact us to info@stockdio.com. Once you have found in the list the stock exchange you need, you must pass the corresponding Exchange Symbol using the stockExchange parameter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20specify%20the%20symbols%20to%20display%3F'>\nHow do I specify the symbols to display?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can specify as many symbols as you want, from the selected exchange, separated by semi-colon (;). If any of the symbols you want to display does not show up, you can go to <a href=\"http://finance.stockdio.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://finance.stockdio.com</a> to verify if the symbol is currently available in Stockdio. If the symbol you require is missing, please contact us at info@stockdio.com.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20combine%20more%20than%20one%20stock%20exchange%20on%20the%20same%20list%3F'>\nCan I combine more than one stock exchange on the same list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The exchange you define in the stockExchange parameter will be the default stock exchange to be used. However, if you want to include symbols from a different exchange, you must prefix the symbol with the exchange code and a colon (:). For example, if you want to include two symbols from NYSE/Nasdaq but additionally include one symbol from London Stock Exchange, you would specify stockExchange=&#8221;NYSENasdaq&#8221;, and symbols=&#8221;AAPL;MSFT;LSE:BAG&#8221;. This will also allow you to combine stocks with commodities and currencies in the same quote list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20include%20one%20or%20more%20market%20indices%20in%20the%20quotes%20list%3F'>\nCan I include one or more market indices in the quotes list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can include indices in the symbols parameter, using the ^ prefix. For example, use ^SPX for S&amp;P 500 or ^DJI for the Dow Jones.

You must use <strong>COMMODITIES</strong> as the stockExchange and then specify one or more commodities in the symbols parameter. For example, use GC;SI;CL for Gold, Silver and Crude Oil. For a complete list of commodities currently supported by Stockdio, please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/commodities\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/commodities</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20create%20a%20currencies%20list%3F'>\nCan I create a Currencies list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

For example, use EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD for Euro vs. USD, USD vs. Japanese Yen and British Pound vs. USD. For a complete list of currencies currently supported by Stockdio, please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/currencies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/currencies</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20would%20like%20to%20specify%20a%20custom%20name%20for%20a%20given%20symbol.%20can%20i%20do%20that%3F'>\nI would like to specify a custom name for a given symbol. Can I do that?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we understand there are several scenarios in which you may want to display your own name, such as if you would like to display a commodities ticker in your own language. This can be easily done by specifying your custom name between parenthesis, right after you have specified the symbol. For example, you can create a commodities ticker in Spanish specifying the following in the symbols parameter: GC(Oro);SI(Plata);CL(Petr�leo Crudo). This works for any symbol, index, commodity or currency pair.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20specify%20the%20numbers%20and%20dates%20format%20used%20in%20my%20country%2Fregion%3F'>\nCan I specify the numbers and dates format used in my country/region?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Stockdio supports a number of cultures, used to properly display numbers and dates. For a complete list of cultures currently supported by Stockdio, please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/cultures\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/cultures</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20specify%20my%20own%20colors%20for%20the%20list%3F'>\nCan I specify my own colors for the list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin is provided with a number of predefined color palettes, for ease of use. For a complete list of color palettes currently supported by Stockdio, please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/palettes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/palettes</a>. However, if you need specific color customization, you can use the Stock Quotes List block, or you can use the Stockdio iframe available at <a href=\"http://services.stockdio.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://services.stockdio.com</a>, which supports more options.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20list%20data%20real-time%20or%20delayed%3F'>\nIs the list data real-time or delayed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In most cases the data is delayed but the delay time may vary between 1 minute and 20 minutes, depending on the exchange. For details of intraday delay time for each exchange please visit <a href=\"http://www.stockdio.com/exchanges\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">www.stockdio.com/exchanges</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20company%20logo%20for%20one%20of%20the%20symbols%20is%20not%20correct%20or%20updated%2C%20can%20this%20be%20fixed%3F'>\nThe company logo for one of the symbols is not correct or updated, can this be fixed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure!

    "description": "<p>Stockdio&#8217;s Stock Quotes List contains a plugin and a widget that provide the means to display a list of stock prices, market indices, currencies and commodities with their variations. Over 65 different stock exchanges and a large number of market indices, currencies and commodities are supported. Optionally, an interactive price chart can be included with the list.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the standard Gutenberg editor, the easiest way to include this plugin on your page is using the Stock Quotes List block, which is included in the Stockdio Financial Visualizations category.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a different editor o prefer to use the shortcode, below is a sample to help you start. Please be aware that most of the parameters listed below are optional, and are also available through the plugin&#8217;s settings page.

Use includeLogo=false to hide the logo (optional).</p>\n<p><strong>logoMaxHeight</strong>: Specify the maximum height allowed for the logo. The height may be smaller than the maximum, depending on the logo width, as it maintains the logo&#8217;s aspect ratio (optional).</p>\n<p><strong>logoMaxWidth</strong>: Specify the maximum width allowed for the logo.

Use includeVolume=true to show it (optional).</p>\n<p><strong>showHeader</strong>: Allows to display the list header. Use showHeader=false to hide it (optional).</p>\n<p><strong>showCurrency</strong>: Allows to display the currency symbol next to the price, depending on the culture settings.</p>\n<p><strong>allowSort</strong>: If enabled (true), it allows the end user to sort the data by any of the fields, by clicking on the header, if this is visible.</p>\n<p><strong>culture</strong>: Allows to specify a combination of language and country settings, used to display texts and to format numbers and dates, e.g. Spanish-Spain (optional). For a list of available culture combinations please visit http://www.stockdio.com/cultures.</p>\n<p><strong>motif</strong>: Design used to display the visualization with specific aesthetics, including borders and styles, among other elements (optional).

If not specified, its default value is 365 days.</p>\n<p><strong>loadDataWhenVisible</strong>: Allows to fetch the data and display the visualization only when it becomes visible on the page, in order to avoid using calls (requests) when they are not needed. This is particularly useful when the visualization is not visible on the page by default, but it becomes visible as result of a user interaction (e.g. clicking on an element, etc.). It is also useful when using the same visualization multiple times on a page for different devices (e.g. using one instance of the plugin for mobile and another one for desktop). We recommend not using this by default but only on scenarios as those described above, as it may provide the end user with a small delay to display the visualization (optional).</p>\n",
