Stay tuned for more to come in EBD v6.x and above!</p>\n<p>Email Before Download (EBD) presents your users with a form where they submit information, like their name and email address, prior to receiving a download. This plugin integrates with the popular <a href=\"http://bit.ly/dNzVJd\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact Form 7</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ifff4y\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Download Monitor</a> plugins, allowing you to create any form you like and manage/monitor your file downloads.  You can also EXPORT a list of users that have downloaded files from the plug-in&#8217;s settings page.  Prior to installing Email Before Download, please confirm each of the dependent plugins is already installed and working independently.</p>\n<p>As an option, you can configure Email Before Download to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Display a link to your file directly under the contact form once it is submitted.

We store a log of the form submissions and generated links. You can view and export a CSV file of them from the Email Before Download settings page in your admin screens.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20use%20the%20contact%20form%207%20and%2For%20download%20monitor%20plugins%3F'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t use the Contact Form 7 and/or Download Monitor Plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will not be able to use this version of Email Before Download without these dependent plugins.  If you have specific reasons to avoid using the dependent plugins, please contact us and let us know the reason so we can take it into consideration.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='anything%20special%20i%20need%20to%20do%20with%20my%20contact%20form%3F'>\nAnything special I need to do with my contact form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you decide to configure the Email Before Download option to send the user an email with a link to the download, then you will want to name the email field &#8220;your-email&#8221; as shown in the example screenshots.

You can even provide both the inline link as well as the email if you choose.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20changing%20any%20of%20my%20file%20or%20directory%20permissions%3F'>\nAre you changing any of my file or directory permissions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress allows direct access to files in your upload directories using a direct URL and we do not change those permissions.
