But it&#8217;s highly recommended that you configure openssl to enable the encryption of the API key.<br />\nIn the file planeupload-client.php &#8211; you can change the encryption method ($encryptionMethod)<br />\nor disable this feature (not recommended) with $apiKeyEncryptionEnabled</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the PlaneUpload plugin to your WooCommerce, activate it and go to PlaneUpload Settings on the main menu.</li>\n<li>Register your account on <a href=\"https://app.planeupload.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">planeupload.com</a>, connect your first cloud and add an API key <a href=\"https://app.planeupload.com/api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></li>\n<li>Copy the API key and paste it in your WooCommerce PlaneUpload Settings, click on &#8220;Save API Key&#8221;</li>\n<li>You are all set. Now on your product view, cart view and orders there should be PlaneUpload widget installed.<br />\nIf they are not, please contact the support, as there may be some differences in your WooCommerce theme.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next step is customizing the button so it fits your store. On the PlaneUpload settings page click on &#8220;Upload button settings&#8221;<br />\nIt will open the Prototype button &#8211; all other buttons on your website are copies of this specific prototype.<br />\nSo if you change any settings here, it will reflect on others. You can change the looks here by changing the color manually, or setting up your custom CSS code.</p>\n"
