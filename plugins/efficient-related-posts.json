        "description": "<p>There is a <a href=\"http://bluedogwebservices.com/problem-related-post-plugins/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">problem<br />\nwith related posts plugins</a>, and Efficient Related Posts is fixing that by<br />\napproaching the problem from a different direction and offering a very different<br />\nsolution.</p>\n<p>Basically, current related post plugins build the list of related posts on the<br />\nfly when the user needs to view it.  Since blogs tend to be viewed far more<br />\noften than they are updated (often hundreds of times more often), these queries<br />\nare run way more times than they need to be.  This not only wastes CPU cycles,<br />\nbut if the queries are slow (which they will be if you have 1000s of posts and<br />\ntags) then the user gets a poor experience from slow page loads.</p>\n<p>Efficient Related Posts moves all this effort into the admin section, finding<br />\nrelated posts when a post is saved rather than when the user views it.  The<br />\nadvantage is that if the query is slow it happens less often and the post writer<br />\nis the one that waits rather than the user (which I think is WAY better).</p>\n<p>There are limitations.  For example, since the related posts are stored as post<br />\nmeta data, we only store a certain number of them (10 by default, but you can<br />\nset it to whatever you want).  This means that if you decide you need to display<br />\nmore than 10, you need to have the plugin re-process all posts.  I generally<br />\ndisplay up to 5 related posts, but store 10 just in case I decide to display<br />\nmore in some areas.  Also, since the related posts are calculated when a post is<br />\nsaved, manually adding a tag through the database will have no effect on the<br />\nrelated posts, although I recommend not doing that anyway.</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I add a list of related posts to my posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can configure Efficient Related Posts to add related posts automatically in<br />\nSettings -&gt; Related Posts.  Alternatively you can use the shortcode<br />\n[relatedPosts] or the you can use the &#8216;erp-show-related-posts&#8217; action or<br />\n&#8216;erp-get-related-posts&#8217; filter in your theme files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How exactly do you use the [[relatedPosts]] shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To use the default settings (from Settings -&gt; Related Posts) you just need to<br />\nadd <code>[relatedPosts]</code> to your post or page where you want to list to be.  You can<br />\nalso add some attributes to it such as num_to_display (Number of related posts<br />\nto display), no_rp_text (Text to display if there are no related posts), and<br />\ntitle (Title for related posts list, empty for none) like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[relatedPosts title=\"Most Related Post\" num_to_display=\"1\"]</code></li>\n<li><code>[relatedPosts num_to_display=\"1\" no_rp_text=\"No Related Posts Found\"]</code></li>\n<li><code>[relatedPosts title=\"Try these related posts:\" num_to_display=\"3\" no_rp_text=\"No Related Posts Found\"]</code></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add this to my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the &#8216;erp-show-related-posts&#8217; action or &#8216;erp-get-related-posts&#8217;<br />\nfilter to display a list of related posts in your theme.  They need to be used<br />\nin &#8220;the loop&#8221; and the only difference is that the &#8216;erp-get-related-posts&#8217; filter<br />\nreturns the list and the &#8216;erp-show-related-posts&#8217; action echos the list.  You<br />\ncan also pass an associative array of arguments to it such as num_to_display<br />\n(Number of related posts to display), no_rp_text (Text to display if there are<br />\nno related posts), and title (Title for related posts list, empty for none) like<br />\nthis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;?php do_action('erp-show-related-posts', array('title'=&gt;'Most Related Post', 'num_to_display'=&gt;1)); ?&gt;</code></li>\n<li><code>&lt;?php echo apply_filters('erp-get-related-posts', array('num_to_display'=&gt;1, 'no_rp_text'=&gt;'No Related Posts Found')); ?&gt;</code></li>\n<li><code>&lt;?php do_action('erp-show-related-posts', array('title'=&gt;'Most Related Posts', 'num_to_display'=&gt;3, 'no_rp_text'=&gt;'No Related Posts Found')); ?&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How do the theme helper functions work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The theme helper functions still exist, but the new actions and filters<br />\nmentioned above are preferred.  Hopefully the helper functions will be removed<br />\nin the future, so PLEASE don&#8217;t use them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If it calculates related posts when a post is saved, won&#8217;t a post only be related to older posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Efficient Related Posts finds all the posts related to the one being saved,<br />\nand if the current post is more closely related to one of those posts than the<br />\nleast related post that is currently stored, it re-processes that post.  Simple<br />\nright?  Well, maybe it&#8217;s not so simple, but rest assured that your posts can and<br />\nwill show the posts they are most related to regardless of post date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What metrics are used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Posts are considered related based on tags.  This may be extended in the future,<br />\nbut I wanted to keep the queries as clean as possible.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
