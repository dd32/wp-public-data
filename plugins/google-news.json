        "description": "<p>Google aggregates news from over 4500 news sources, updated<br />\ncontinously. The results can be retrieved as a number of<br />\nRSS feeds, where you can create your own specific feed by<br />\nspecifying one of more than 40 regions/languages, and an<br />\noptional topic ranging from Domestic to Most Popular to<br />\nEntertainment. Currently there are nine topics, including,<br />\nof course, All. In addition to this, any feed can be filtered<br />\nthrough a search query so that only news items matching your<br />\nquery will be shown. Note that not all combinations of<br />\nregion/language and topic has been enabled by Google but<br />\nit should degrade gracefully.</p>\n<p>This plugin works both as a widget, as inline content<br />\nreplacement and can be called from themes. Any number of<br />\ninline replacements or theme calls allowed, but only one<br />\nwidget instance is supported in this release.</p>\n<p>For widget use, simply use the widget as any other after<br />\nselecting which feed it should display. For inline content<br />\nreplacement, insert the one or more of the following strings in<br />\nyour content and they will be replaced by the relevant news feed.<br />\nFor theme use, add the do_action function call described below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><code>&lt;!--google-news--&gt;</code></strong> for the default feed</li>\n<li><strong><code>&lt;!--google-news#feedname--&gt;</code></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Shortcodes can be used if you have WordPress 2.5 or above,<br />\nin which case these replacement methods are also available.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><code>[google-news]</code></strong> for the default feed</li>\n<li><strong><code>[google-news name=\"feedname\"]</code></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Calling the plugin from a theme is done with the WP do_action()<br />\nsystem. This will degrade gracefully and not produce errors<br />\nor output if plugin is disabled or removed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><code>&lt;?php do_action('google_news'); ?&gt;</code></strong> for the default feed</li>\n<li><strong><code>&lt;?php do_action('google_news', 'feedname'); ?&gt;</code></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Enable plugin, go to the Google News page under<br />\nDashboard-&gt;Settings and read the initial information. Then<br />\ngo to the Google News page under Dashboard-&gt;Manage and<br />\nconfigure one or more feeds. Then use a widget or insert<br />\nrelevant strings in your content or theme.</p>\n<p>Additional information:</p>\n<p>The available options are as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>Name:</strong> Optional feed name, that can be used in the<br />\nwidget or the inline replacement string to reference<br />\na specific feed. Any feed without a name is considered<br />\n&#8220;default&#8221; and will be used if the replacement strings do<br />\nnot reference a specific feed. If there are more than<br />\none feed with the same name, a random of these is picked<br />\nevery time it is used. This also applies to the default<br />\nfeed(s).</p>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> Optional, which when set will be used in the<br />\nwidget title or as a header above the news items when<br />\ninline. If the title is empty, then a default title<br />\nof &#8220;Google News : &lt;region&gt; : &lt;feed type&gt;&#8221; is used. Note<br />\nthat as per Google Terms of Service it is a requirement<br />\nto state that the news come from Google.</p>\n<p><strong>News region:</strong> A dropdown list of 40 choices, determining<br />\nthe region/language of the feed.</p>\n<p><strong>News type:</strong> Another dropdown list, determining what type of<br />\nnews you are after. Sci/Tech, Business, Health etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Output type:</strong> Some Google feeds come with just text,<br />\nsome pictures or pictures on nearly every news item. Chose<br />\nwhich one you want here.</p>\n<p><strong>News item length:</strong> Short or long. The short version is really just<br />\nthe news item title as a one liner but probably the one most<br />\nWP admins will use. The long version is a 3-4 line teaser that<br />\nhas been severely stripped of useless markup that Google insists<br />\non passing along, including tables, links, colour/font/style<br />\nsettings etc. I&#8217;ve tried to clean it up so it won&#8217;t mess up your<br />\ntheme. For the short version, the long text without html tags is<br />\navailable as a mouse rollover/tooltip.</p>\n<p><strong>Max items to show:</strong> As the title says, if the feed has<br />\nsufficient entries to fulfil the request.</p>\n<p><strong>Optional query filter:</strong> One of the most important parts of<br />\nthe Google News RSS Feed is the ability to filter the news<br />\nwith your very own search query. Get relevant, up to date<br />\nnews on the exact topic you want. Note that if you add a<br />\nsearch query, then the short item length will include an<br />\n&#8220;all N news articles&#8221; link curtesy Google. If you choose<br />\nto add a query, then you most likely want to set a title<br />\nas well. To explain to the viewer what kind of news you have<br />\nselected for them to see. The News Query isn&#8217;t like a standard<br />\nGoogle Query, so you can&#8217;t use || between words to search<br />\nfor one or the other. So IFF you start your query with<br />\nthe word <strong>OR</strong> then the rest of the words will be or&#8217;ed<br />\ntogether. I.e. a query string of &#8216;OR this that&#8217; will look<br />\nfor news containing either this or that. This is really<br />\njust a test, so the actual query language used here may change in<br />\nfuture versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Cache time:</strong> The feeds are now fetched using WordPress<br />\nbuiltin MagpieRSS system, which allows for caching of feeds<br />\na specific number of seconds. Cached feeds are stored in<br />\nthe backend database.</p>\n<p>Clicking on a news item will of course take you via Google to<br />\nthe news site with the relevant article, as per Google Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>If you want to change the look&amp;feel, the inline table is<br />\nwrapped in a div with the id &#8220;google-news-inline&#8221; and the<br />\nwidget is wrapped in an li with id &#8220;google-news&#8221;.
