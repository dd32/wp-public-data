        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I change the look of the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, simply modify the included crypto-ticker.css file, located in the plugin&#8217;s /css directory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about support for other cryptocurrencies?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I may add the smaller altcoins in the future if there is enough interest. If you can&#8217;t wait, adding them yourself should be a trivial task; just keep in mind that because of the way the btc-e API is set up, each additional currency means an additional request, which will impact performance on cache misses. If I do decide to add the other altcoins, I&#8217;ll probably re-write the widget so that the requests are asynchronous.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a referrer ID at Coinbase. Can I use it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Version 1.2 and up allows you to enter your Coinbase referral ID in the widget settings. Please note that if you don&#8217;t have your own referral ID, a default one will be used.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The ticker is showing different prices on all of my site&#8217;s pages, and/or doesn&#8217;t seem to be updating &#8211; help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You most likely have a WordPress caching plugin installed that is either misconfigured or out-of-date. Make sure that you&#8217;re running the latest version. Older versions of W3 Total Cache will cause this problem (the most recent release should be fine).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
