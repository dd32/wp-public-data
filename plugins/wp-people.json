I took his original idea and used another<br />\nhack (acronymit) as a guide to make this work. The original worked with the my-hacks script used in<br />\nWordPress 1.0.1, so this is beyond the functionality of the original.</p>\n<p>If you were using the version 2 of Word Press People, then you will be able to see any current people in<br />\nWP People and COPY them to the XFN database.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>wp-people</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to the WP People administration page under the Tools section.  The first time there will create the &#8220;WP People&#8221; Category</li>\n<li>Go to the Links administration page. Add new Links or add the WP Category to those people who you want to be included in WP People.</li>\n<li>Optionally Install the &#8216;WordPress Force Word Wrapping&#8217; plugin (http://www.seocompany.ca/seo-blog/wordpress-force-word-wrapping-plugin/) to prevent the description text from extednig past the popup window area.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>What is the field mapping from the Link to WP People?</h4>\n<p>The field on the Links form match up the following way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name is the Real Name (searched name) in WP People</li>\n<li>Description is the Nick Name (displayed name) in WP People</li>\n<li>Web Address is the Link in WP People</li>\n<li>Advanced Notes is the Description/Bio in WP People</li>\n<li>Advanced Image Link is the Photo in WP People</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How do people get highlighted in my posts and pages?</h4>\n<p>The filter goes through the posts and pages and find matches to full names.  When it finds a full name, it replaces the name with a nick name and adds the link.</p>\n<h4>Should I always use full names for people?</h4>\n<p>Yes. WP People will replace the full name with a nickname is stated.  However, it can&#8217;t distinguish between &#8216;John&#8217; and &#8216;John&#8217;.  It is better to have &#8216;John Tiberius Smith&#8217; and &#8216;John Jimmy Smith&#8217; in order to have unique records for each.</p>\n<h4>Do I have to add a person to WP People before putting them in a post?</h4>\n<p>No.  If the person&#8217;s name matches any name in WP People it will be highlighted, no matter when it was put on the blog.</p>\n<h4>Do I need to add a person through the Links area?</h4>\n<p>As of version 3.1.0, you can add people using the WP People Tool directly into the XFN Links.  The form will only show the fields used by WP People and will automatically give the link the category for WP People.</p>\n<h4>Can I update the style of the popup?</h4>\n<p>The popup style sheet is in the WP People folder (wp-people-css.css)</p>\n<h4>What size is the image?</h4>\n<p>The image is set at 100px x 100px.  It is best to resize the image to fit this value.</p>\n<h4>What if I don&#8217;t have a photo for the person I am linking?</h4>\n<p>Included with WP People is the &#8220;nophoto.jpg&#8221; file.  Copy this image into the <code>images</code> directory of any theme you are using.</p>\n<h4>Are older version of WP People upgradeable?</h4>\n<p>As of version 3.1.0, you can now upgrade your older version of WP People and Copy records from the WP People table to the XFN Database.  When you are done copying and removing old record, the application will ask you to delete the old table.</p>\n<h4>Can I alter the text that is seen when you hover of the link?</h4>\n<p>The pre-text can be altered by the site administrator.  The name shown is the nickname value of the person being linked to.</p>\n",
