Why did you remove support for other roles from Version 2.1?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I removed support for menu items for roles other than Subscriber. WP Hide Dashboard is a simple plugin, and was built for the Subscriber role. While I appreciate that some users need this type of functionality for other roles, most don&#8217;t require it, so I don&#8217;t want to bloat the plugin with unnecessary code for the majority of users.</p>\n<p>If you need to hide admin sidebar menu links from roles other than Subscriber, I recommend using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-menu-editor/\" title=\"Admin Menu Editor plugin\" rel=\"ugc\">Admin Menu Editor plugin</a> to accomplish that goal. Currently it only removes links in the admin sidebar menu. The plugin author has indicated they may add support for removing admin bar menu links in a future version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. How do I change this to hide the Dashboard link, Tools menu, Personal Options, and Help options from other roles besides Subscriber?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A. Sorry, I no longer support this plugin working for any role other than Subscriber.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
