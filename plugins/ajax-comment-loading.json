The generation of the comment HTML and the delivery of all that HTML can slow down your page loads. <strong>This plugin has pages load without comments, and then uses a secondary AJAX request to pull down the comments.</strong> Navigating through the pages of comments is also handled via AJAX. On my test install with 100 comments per page, the <code>onload</code> event fires 2x faster. The HTML is generated by the server 6x faster. The HTML downloads 3x faster. The uncompressed size of the HTML is reduced by a factor of 17.</p>\n<p>Initial development of this plugin was commissioned by Google — many thanks!</p>\n",

The plugin was developed against the Twenty Ten theme. Try another theme, or try standardizing your theme&#8217;s HTML. I don&#8217;t plan to add support for other markup — I&#8217;d rather that people work on standardizing their theme comment markup instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Doesn&#8217;t this prevent search engines from seeing comments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t! Through the magic of Google&#8217;s &#8220;AJAX Crawling&#8221; specification, search engines (currently Googlebot and Bingbot) will be made aware that the page includes AJAX-fetched content, and will request your page with a special URL that will have this plugin skip AJAX-generation and instead give the full HTML to the crawler.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
