        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I display multiple galleries in the same page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, that was a reason this plugin was created, there was no decen slideshow plugin that would do that, so this post-slideshow-gallery was created.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the look and feel of the slideshow?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That feature is not suported. The only available settings are the slideshow dimmensions. Considering the size of this plugin code base I would recomend you to modify (a fork of) this plugin directly. Using another galleria theme should be an easy peasy if you know some basic PHP.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
