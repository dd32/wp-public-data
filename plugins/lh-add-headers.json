That is it.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin cause problem if you use server side caching?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Quite possibly depending on your setup. It could prevent caching or even break your site if you are using server side caching (including Varnish). This plugin should NOT be used on hosts like WPEngine or DreamPress as it will break caching.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I check if it is working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install one of the the view live HTTP headers tools in your browser. Visit your website and then refresh the page. On your second visit the website should return a 304 not modified response.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there other reason why a 304 header is not being return when I haven&#8217;t changed the content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to to return 304 the hash of the returned content must be the same (IE the html must be identical between requests.<br />\nUnfortunately, some plugin adding dynamic and varying content to each page output returned. Try disabling each plugins to find the culprit.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the benefits?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This helps visitors and search engines. If your page or post has not been updated since the last visit, then your page will sent a <code>304 Not Modified Header</code>. On receipt of this header search engines know nothing has changed (and therefore there is no need to re crawl your site), likewise a normal visitors browser will get a 304 and will use the browser side cache of the page (thus speeding up the visitors experience).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
