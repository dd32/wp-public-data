Dynamic content e.g. generated by shortcodes etc is not monitored.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20does%20the%20stale%20content%20alert%20appear%3F'>\nWhere does the stale content alert appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the tab is in the background there is no alert, the tab will simply be refreshed. If the tab is currently focussed by default it will appear as the first child element of the first  element. This behaviour can be adjusted in Settings-&gt;Reading area.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat if something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Fresh Content, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-fresh-content/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-fresh-content/</a> . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
