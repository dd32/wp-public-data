Switching it on hides the Edit With Elementor button and links so if you have a website where some posts use custom fields for instance and the main edit box would not be used, Elementor can be hidden as an option. When it is set to hidden, the Edit With Elementor link is also hidden in the admin bar when viewing that page or post and the Edit With Elementor link is removed in the WordPress admin post/page list.</p>\n",
