        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Log in to your WordPress site and go to Plugins &gt; Add New. Search for &#8220;Gravity Forms CardConnect&#8221; in the &#8220;Add plugins&#8221; section, then click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;. Once it installs, you will see a link that says &#8220;Activate&#8221;. Click that link, and the link should update to &#8220;Active&#8221;. Alternatively, you can upload the directory directly to your plugins directory (typically /wp-content/plugins/)</li>\n<li>Navigate to Forms &gt; Settings in the WordPress admin</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;CardConnect&#8221; in the lefthand column of that page</li>\n<li>Enter your CardConnect Merchant ID number, username, password, and API URL. You will need to contact CardConnect&#8217;s <a href=\"https://support.cardconnect.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support</a> to verify these details for your account.</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve entered your CardConnect account details, create a form or edit an existing form&#8217;s settings. You&#8217;ll see a &#8220;CardConnect&#8221; tab in settings where you can create a &#8220;CardConnect Feed&#8221;. This allows you to send payment data collected by the form to CardConnect. If you&#8217;ve configured payment feeds for other PayPal add-ons before, the interface will be familiar. If not, see Gravity Forms&#8217; <a href=\"https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-paypal-payments-pro-feeds/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">guide</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n",

This is specifically an Add-On for Gravity Forms and will not function properly if installed and activated without it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20version%20of%20gravity%20forms%20do%20i%20need%3F'>\nWhat version of Gravity Forms do I need?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must be running at least Gravity Forms 1.9.18.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20add-on%20to%20set%20up%20recurring%20transactions%20or%20subscriptions%3F'>\nCan I use this add-on to set up recurring transactions or subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With a workaround! The CardPointe gateway does not offer native support for recurring transactions, so the plugin itself cannot create a recurring transaction. However you can request a Profile ID. This Profile ID, as well as the other required data, are then available through the GF Export feature for all entries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20add-on%20to%20authorize%20payments%20and%20capture%20them%20later%3F'>\nCan I use this add-on to authorize payments and capture them later?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! When you configure a CardConnect feed for your form, look for the &#8220;Capture payments immediately?&#8221; radio button, and select &#8220;No, authorize only&#8221;. Users who submit your form will not be charged until you capture their authorized payments using the CardPointe portal.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
