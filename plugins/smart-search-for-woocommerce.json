        "description": "<p>Smart Search and Product Filter from Searchanise is the all-in-one live search solution to improve your store’s conversion rate. Our clients report at least a 20% rise in conversion, with some reaching as much as 60% in just several months.</p>\n<p>Our feature-packed product search and filter plugin for WooCommerce, trusted by over 14,000 brands (including CBS, Durex, Lonely Planet, Fossil, Media Markt, Decathlon, Himalaya Wellness, and Ergo Baby), aims to enhance your customers’ experience as it guides them through your website. Starting with:</p>\n<h3>Typing a search query</h3>\n<p>Your potential future customers have probably come to your site with at least a rough idea of what they want. Their first point of contact will thus be the search bar – and our advanced search engine has everything you might possibly need, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Predictive search with typo autocorrection and synonyms</li>\n<li>“Did you mean” suggestions</li>\n<li>Site search both across products &amp; site content</li>\n<li>Personalized instant search results</li>\n<li>In-search product previews</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Navigating the search results page</h3>\n<p>After your visitors get to the search results page, they will likely need a way to narrow down the results. With our powerful filtering system, they can do that. We offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both basic and product attribute filters. The former includes all the usual suspects (price, categories, manufacturer, etc.), while the latter can be set up to match specific product attributes.</li>\n<li>Multiple smart filter selections.</li>\n<li>Top and/or side advanced filters. Choose where you want your filters to be.</li>\n<li>Customizable look and feel. Display your search filters as open or closed, and tinker with settings to deploy different looks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will also be able to add View Details or Add to Cart button to your search results page’s products – and provide a snappy route to checkout.</p>\n<h3>Exploring products</h3>\n<p>We can further fuel your visitors’ interest in your goods via recommendations blocks. Our Upsell and Cross-sell widgets will help you out here.</p>\n<p>Some of them are ready out of the box (like Customers Who Bought This Also Bought), while you can easily configure others. Just select a common denominator for the products you’d like to promote, name the resulting recommendation block, and choose a page where to insert it.</p>\n<h3>It gets even better</h3>\n<p>The list of our navigation features doesn’t end here. Our product filter &amp; search widgets are fully customizable to blend in with your store’s theme; we help promote goods in-search and beyond via product merchandising rules, while our in-depth analytics will explain your customers’ behavior.</p>\n<p>We are also integrated with other WordPress plugins, such as Weglot and Yotpo, and are a mobile-friendly bunch: our smart search and filters look just as good on smartphones as they do on laptops.</p>\n<p>You can install the app in just one click – no coding skills required. Give it a whirl – the first 14 days are on us.</p>\n<h3>Pricing</h3>\n<p>Our plans start at just $99 per year (a little over $8 a month, if an annual plan is chosen!) and we offer a 14-day trial period if you want to give the app a test run.</p>\n<p>For more information on our paid plans, head over <a href=\"https://searchanise.io/pricing/woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.

        "installation": "<p>NOTE: Before the installation, please check the version of your WooCommerce plugin. You can find it in your WordPress admin panel in Plugins &gt; Installed plugins. If it’s 3.0.0 or higher, you’re good to go.</p>\n<p>You can install Smart WooCommerce Search by Searchanise in 3 ways &#8211; two simple ways and the advanced one.</p>\n<p><strong>Through WordPress plugin search</strong><br />\nIt’s the easiest way. All you need to do is:<br />\n1. Log in to WordPress admin panel.<br />\n2. Go to Plugins &gt; Add new and enter &#8220;Searchanise&#8221; into the search bar on the right.<br />\n3. Click Install now and wait a couple of seconds for the plugin to install.<br />\n4. Click Activate and the indexation of your store will start.<br />\n5. Searchanise is installed and you can go play with its settings. The control panel can be found at Products &gt; Searchanise.</p>\n<p><strong>Through WordPress admin plugin upload</strong><br />\nThis one is pretty simple too. Just do the following:<br />\n1. Download the plugin zip archive by clicking the blue <strong>Download</strong> button above.<br />\n2. Log in to your WordPress admin panel.<br />\n3. Go to Plugins &gt; Add new and click Upload plugin at the top.<br />\n4. Browse and select the &#8220;smart-search-for-woocommerce.zip&#8221; archive you have downloaded earlier.<br />\n5. Click Install now and wait a second.<br />\n6. Click Activate plugin as the installation is done. Indexation of your store has started.<br />\n7. Now you can go to Products &gt; Searchanise to start setting up the plugin you installed so easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Manually through FTP/SFTP</strong><br />\nThis method is a bit harder than the previous two. You may need it in case your provider has file restrictions that could prevent you from installing a plugin from the admin area. This is what you should do:<br />\n1. Download the plugin zip archive by clicking the blue <strong>Download</strong> button above.<br />\n2. Extract the archive to your computer. You’ll get a folder named &#8220;smart-search-for-woocommerce&#8221; with a bunch of files in it.<br />\n3. Open the FTP client on your computer and access your website with FTP/SFTP credentials. If you don’t have any, contact your hosting provider to obtain them.<br />\n4. Go to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your website and upload the folder you extracted at step 3 there.<br />\n5. Log in to your WordPress admin panel.<br />\n6. Go to Plugins &gt; Installed plugins and find Smart WooCommerce Search by Searchanise. It’s already there!<br />\n7. Activate the plugin and the indexation starts.<br />\n8. Now go to Products &gt; Searchanise and start setting your new plugin up.</p>\n",

Important note: yearly subscriptions can’t be refunded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20a%20problem%21%20where%20can%20i%20get%20help%3F'>\nI have a problem! Where can I get help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’ve collected solutions for some common issues in our <a href=\"https://docs.searchanise.io/article-categories/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation</a>. If the answer’s not there, use the Feedback form in your Smart Search by Searchanise control panel to reach our support team.</p>\n<p>In urgent situations, mention @searchanise on Twitter to speed up the investigation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20add%20this%20one%20really%20useful%20feature%3F'>\nCan you add this one really useful feature?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We’ll be happy to!

Otherwise, Searchanise falls back to the default timezone which is UTC.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20search%20supposed%20to%20replace%20the%20whole%20search%20module%3F'>\nIs the search supposed to replace the whole search module?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Searchanise replaces the built-in search and processes all search queries remotely. If, for some reason, Searchanise is not ready to process search requests (e.g. indexing in progress,) the default search is temporarily used. If Searchanise Smart Search does not work in your store, please contact us, we will investigate the case.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
