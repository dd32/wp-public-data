Thankfully the new database and API made it as easy as I had hoped for.</p>\n<p>I ended up with this plugin, that was created as a wrapper of the default category menu.</p>\n<p>It is lightweight and can easily plug-in, plug-out. Furthermore, being an extension of the default category menu, means that none of the functionality (sorting, post count etc.) is lost. In fact it can be easily extended and could support future versions of the blogging platform for years to come.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>After you upload an activate the plugin through your admin panel, all you need to do is call the custom function wp_author_categories() that will create an author&#8217;s menu for you. Notice that this only works in author pages and will revert to the default category menu in any other case.</p>\n<p>If you are using the default template, you can easily find this line in &#8220;sidebar.php&#8221; (that displays the category menu):<br />\n            &lt; ?php wp_list_categories(&#039;show_count=1&amp;title_li=Categories&#8217;); ?&gt;</p>\n<p>You can replace it with this condition that will use the wp_author_categories() function instead, when you are visiting the author pages</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;?php \n        /*\n        * First write down the arguments you want to use for you menu and store them in a variable. \n        * These are the same for the default menu (\"wp_list_categories\") and the author menu (\"wp_author_categories\")\n        * you can find more information on the options you can use here: https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_categories\n        */\n        $args = 'show_count=1&amp;title_li=&lt;h2&gt;Categories&lt;/h2&gt;';\n        if($author){\n            wp_author_categories($args); \n        } else{\n            wp_list_categories($args); \n        }\n        ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, and if you already have an &#8220;author.php&#8221; file in your template folder, you can simply rename &#8220;wp_list_categories()&#8221; to &#8220;wp_author_categories()&#8221;, passing the same arguments.</p>\n<p>To uninstall, it&#8217;s as easy as doing the reverse actions. Delete all references of the wp_author_categories() function from your template files and uninstall the plugin through that WordPress&#8217;s admin panel.</p>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>This work is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License:<br />\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt</p>\n",
