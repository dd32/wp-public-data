You have to sign a contract with IfthenPay in order to activate this service. Go to <a href=\"https://ifthenpay.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://ifthenpay.com</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%E2%80%99m%20a%20individual%20and%20not%20a%20registered%20business.%20can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nI’m a individual and not a registered business. Can I use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. IfthenPay only provides this service to registered businesses and equivalent (like tax registered freelancers, for example). You should <a href=\"https://ifthenpay.com/#contactos\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact them</a> if you need additional details on this matter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20generated%20multibanco%20reference%20does%20not%20contain%20the%20order%20number.%20how%20do%20i%20know%20which%20order%20was%20paid%3F'>\nThe generated Multibanco reference does not contain the order number. How do I know which order was paid?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IfthenPay will send you an email each time a reference is paid, but the reference does not contain the order number. By design, our plugin does not include the order number in the reference due to the way WooCommerce/WordPress set orders/posts IDs.<br />\nAnyway, you do not need the order number in the reference, because our plugin uses a callback mechanism. IfthenPay automatically notifies WooCommerce when a specific Multibanco reference is used for payment. The order is linked to the reference in the database and, also automatically, will be set as paid.<br />\nIf you still need to know to which order a reference is linked to, use the search box in the WooCommerce Orders administration screen.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20test%20the%20callback%20call%20to%20simulate%20a%20payment%20and%20foresee%20what%20happens%20when%20a%20real%20payment%20is%20made%20by%20a%20customer%3F'>\nCan I test the callback call to simulate a payment and foresee what happens when a real payment is made by a customer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. Edit your wp-config.php file and set WP_DEBUG to true. Then, place a test order in the frontend using Multibanco, MB WAY or PayShop. Go to the order edit screen and click the “Simulate callback payment” button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20issue%20an%20mb%20way%20or%20credit%20or%20debit%20card%20refund%20within%20woocommerce%3F'>\nHow to issue an MB WAY or Credit or debit card refund within WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just like in any other WooCommerce payment gateway that supports refunds.<br />\nCheck out the instructions carefully <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-refunds/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here (Automatic refunds, step 4)</a> and <a href=\"https://helpdesk.ifthenpay.com/pt-PT/support/solutions/articles/79000130517-devoluc%C3%B5es-de-pagamentos-aos-ordenantes\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here (WooCommerce specific instructions)</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20%2F%20ifthenpay%20service%20on%20more%20than%20one%20website%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin / IfthenPay service on more than one website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but not with the same Multibanco entity and subentity, MB WAY, Credit card or Payshop Keys. Ask IfthenPay for different credentials for each website you need the service to be available. There is no extra costs involved, and you can even route payments to distinct bank accounts.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20payment%20instructions%20look%20and%20feel%20in%20the%20%E2%80%9Cthank%20you%E2%80%9D%20page%20and%2For%20the%20new%20order%20email%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20sms%20message%20format%3F'>\nCan I change the payment instructions look and feel in the “Thank you” page and/or the new order email, as well as the SMS message format?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can! But you should know your way around WordPress filters. There are filters to do this and you can find examples within <code>hooks-examples.php</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20payment%20gateway%20icon%20in%20the%20checkout%20page%3F'>\nCan I change the payment gateway icon in the checkout page?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are also filters for this.

How should I do it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You shouldn’t! To our knowledge, it’s illegal under <a href=\"https://www.bportugal.pt/sites/default/files/anexos/legislacoes/dl3ano2010.PDF\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Portuguese law</a> and a <a href=\"https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/finance-funding/making-receiving-payments/electronic-cash-payments/index_en.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">European directive</a> to charge an extra fee based on the payment method chosen by the customer.<br />\nIf you don’t care about legislation, plugins are available that allow you to set extra fees per payment method. Please, don’t ask us for support on this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20time%20does%20the%20customer%20have%20to%20pay%20with%20mb%20way%3F'>\nHow much time does the customer have to pay with MB WAY?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The MB WAY payment requests expire after 5 minutes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20the%20customer%20receive%20an%20email%20when%20paying%20with%20mb%20way%3F'>\nWhy doesn’t the customer receive an email when paying with MB WAY?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The MB WAY payment needs to be approved immediately after checking out, just like when using a credit card or PayPal.<br />\nWooCommerce only sends payment instruction emails for payment methods that require later, and not immediate payment, like Multibanco, Payshop and bank transfer for example.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='%5Bwpml%5D%20my%20website%20is%20multilingual.%20will%20i%20be%20able%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\n[WPML] My website is multilingual.
