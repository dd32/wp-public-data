        "faq": "\n<h4>Will this change the admin bar in the admin menu itself or just while viewing/editing pages on the site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is only intended to alter the admin bar while viewing or editing pages on the actual site while logged in. The admin bar looks and functions great when in the administrative menus in our opinion but leaves some to be desired when live editing the site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this work on Internet Explorer?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe. If you&#8217;ve got a recent version that supports CSS3 transitions, the hover states for transparencies should work fine and the overall position should be okay. As per older IE versions, we do not intend to support them. Upgrade your browser!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the transparent hidden menu work on my mobile device?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While our plugin does support moving the admin bar to different areas of the screen on mobile devices, we do not support the transparency for smaller screen sizes due to the lack of a hover state.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What level users can edit the settings for the WordPress Admin Bar Mover?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only administrators. Anyone editor level or down does not have the ability to change this item. This should allow you to use this on your sites which have subscriber through editor level access and modernize your user experience!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
