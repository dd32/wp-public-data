This means that it applies its changes to the more link after all other changes (up to 19). It discards the previous more link entirely, therefore any changes up to 19th in the queue will be discarded. If your theme, or another plugin uses a higher priority than 20, then ActionPress may be over-ruled by that theme or plugin.<br />\nIf you want to filter the ActionPress text, make the filter priority in your theme &gt; 20.</p>\n<p>Any other problems, tweet me <em>@nickpcousins</em></p>\n</p>\n\n",
