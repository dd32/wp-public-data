It allows a WordPress administrator to embed a link on<br />\nany page (or post if you want) that gives other WordPress users the ability to easily logout without having to fuss<br />\nwith the WordPress Dashboard. There are three shortcodes that can be used, and each one has a different redirect<br />\noption: Redirect to Home, Current Page, or the WordPress Default wp-login.php page.</p>\n<p>The Logout Button plugin uses the default log out functionality provided by WP through wp_loginout(). It checks to<br />\nsee if the user is logged in. If the user is logged in, a Log Out link will be displayed to them. If the user is not<br />\nlogged in, nothing will be shown to the user.</p>\n<p>Future releases will include the ability to choose &#8220;Themes&#8221;. Right now, a simple link is displayed and the CSS from<br />\nthe currently activated theme is used on that link.
