You may consider a Premium Plan if the Essential Plan cannot meet your needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20my%20plan%20later%20on%3F'>\nCan I change my plan later on?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When you upgrade your subscription plan from Essential to Premium:<br />\nThe new plan will be billed and in effect immediately. The amount charged is prorated. It&#8217;s based on the differences in price and the number of days remaining in the billing cycle. Changing your subscription from a quarterly to a yearly plan will also incur a prorated amount, and your subscription duration will be extended automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you change your subscription plan from Premium to Essential:<br />\nWhen downgrading from a higher pricing plan to a lower pricing one, the new plan will not take effect until the end of the current plan billing cycle. When changing your subscription from a yearly to a quarterly plan, it will only take effect at the end of your current subscription period.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20perfect%20corp.%20store%20my%20customers%27%20photos%3F'>\nDoes Perfect Corp. store my customers&#8217; photos?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Photos taken within the virtual try-on experience are saved locally on the customers&#8217; device only and not stored anywhere else.<br />\nWe do not save users&#8217; photos on our servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20online%20service%20come%20with%20mobile%20app%20support%3F'>\nDoes Online Service come with mobile app support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Online Service only comes with in-browser support.<br />\nOur Enterprise solution however, works omnichannel.
