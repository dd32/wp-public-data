        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Upload <code>/wordpress-wordle</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is no admin screen to configure. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n<p>Use the [wordle&#095;tags] shortcode on any page/post or the wordle&#095;tags() function in templates. Both of these take 3 optional parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$include    Comma separated list of Term IDs to be included.</li>\n<li>$exclude    Comma separated list of Term IDs to be excluded. Include id overrides this.</li>\n<li>$number     The number of tags to be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n<p>simple use:<br />\n[wordle_tags]</p>\n<p>include term ids 1,2:<br />\n[wordle&#095;tags include=&#8221;1,2&#8243;]</p>\n<p>exclude term ids 3,4:<br />\n[wordle&#095;tags exclude=&#8221;3,4&#8243;]</p>\n<p>limit to top 100 tags:<br />\n[wordle&#095;tags number=&#8221;100&#8243;]<br />\n[wordle&#095;tags include=&#8221;1,2&#8243; number=&#8221;100&#8243;]<br />\n[wordle&#095;tags exclude=&#8221;3,4&#8243; number=&#8221;100&#8243;]</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What is a Wordle?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A Wordle is a &#8220;beautiful word cloud&#8221;. You can put them on tshirts or posters they look so good. Check out <a href=\"http://www.wordle.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the Wordle site</a> for more info.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This just makes text. What use is it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin only outputs text which can then be used to create the Wordle. It doesn&#8217;t actually produce the image. The output will therefore not be particularly helpful for ordinary viewers of your site. It is recommended that you make a private page and use the shortcode on it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make the Wordle?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to http://www.wordle.net/create and paste in the text. You can then customise the output.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I discover the term ID for my tags?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each tag has a unique term ID. You can discover the ID for a term by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Log in as admin and go to admin dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click on &#8220;Tags&#8221; in the &#8220;Posts&#8221; section on the left hand side of the dashboard. You will see a list of tags.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mouseover the tag you are interested in and take a look in the info bar at the bottom of the screen. You should see the tag_ID as a param for the tag link. This is the Term ID.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I see it in action?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http://topicmap.com/wordle/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">output page</a> produced this <a href=\"http://topicmap.com/1484/topic-maps-wordle\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Topic Maps Wordle</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
