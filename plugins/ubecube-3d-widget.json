Not so beautiful, but it work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use html tags in the text fields?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, but if you are a developer you can easy change this.<br />\nOpen ubecube_3d.php with your favorite editor. Go to line 252 and edit it:</p>\n<p>&#8216;print esc_html( $this-&gt;news_to_display[0][&#8216;text&#8217;] );&#8217; <strong>=&gt;</strong> &#8216;print $this-&gt;news_to_display[0][&#8216;text&#8217;]; &#8216;</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the aspect of the cube?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you must do any modify manually on the stylesheet.<br />\nSo, if you are a developer I give you some reference for modify it faster.</p>\n<p>Open style_jU3D.css:</p>\n<p>-Text Color: line 23.<br />\n-Face Color: line 213.<br />\n-Face&#8217;s border Color : line 214.<br />\n-No-3D Face Color: line 323.<br />\n-No-3D Face&#8217;s border Color : line 324.</p>\n<p>However, the buttons and the dots scroll are images, so you can&#8217;t modify it by the CSS.</p>\n<p>N.B. Please, don&#8217;t modify the dimensions of the cube if you don&#8217;t know how works CSS 3D transforms.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the time to wait between news&#8217;s changes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, you must do this modify manually in the script.<br />\nFor developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open animations_jU3D.js.  </li>\n<li>Go to line 289.  </li>\n<li>Edit this line &#8220;Ubecube._loopID = setInterval( Ubecube.nextFace, 1000 * XXX );&#8221; where the XXX are equivalent to the seconds.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
