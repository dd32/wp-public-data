This is especially good for Webcomic or Art sites and replicates the archive that is on the Megatokyo.com website. If you want a more customized archive you may enter custom options for CSS, name, archive parameters, and add custom locations all from the admin options area. The newest version of the plugin now allows you to place the archive in a post or page by using the code %%awsomarchive%%, so now you can place the archive anywhere you want.
