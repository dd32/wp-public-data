        "description": "<p>This addon adds buttons below your posts (or somewhere else) to make it easy to get reactions to the post, but without the hassle of writing a whole comment. It makes it easier for the reader to interact with you. The buttons are configurable (how many, what text, position) and simply are counters to how often they were clicked. There is also a widget and a shortcode to show the top x posts with the most clicks for each button.</p>\n<p>The idea is inspired by a <a href=\"http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-feature-reactions.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blogger feature</a> and since it&#8217;s been my first addon, I borrowed the structure from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/\" rel=\"ugc\">sociable</a>.</p>\n<h3>Restrictions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When using plugins to cache the pages, the buttons won&#8217;t be up to date. They will increment through the javascript, but when the page reloads the old count will show again, until the cache is deleted. Check the FAQ on possibilities how to change that.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Nothing fancy, just like any wordpress addon:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload and unzip the plugin to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Optionally configure the plugin in the settings tab</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>You can also use the widget to show the top x posts with the most clicks for each button in your sidebar. Or alternatively you can use the shortcode [reaction_buttons_most_clicks] to insert the same information somewhere in your post. The default is [reaction_buttons_most_clicks limit_posts=3]. It takes the following arguments:\n<ul>\n<li>limit_posts: specify the number of posts to show per button. (default 3)</li>\n<li>excerpt_length: number of words of the article to show as an excerpt. 0 deactivates the excerpt. (default deactivated)</li>\n<li>only_buttons: comma separated list of buttons to show. Default is to show all</li>\n<li>show_post_thumb: if the widget should try to display a post thumbnail, true or false (default)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There is another shortcode for the reaction summary. Engage with your users by including the most clicked button in a summary, e.g. &#8220;Most people found this post interesting!&#8221; while &#8220;interesting&#8221; is the most clicked button. Activate it in the options or place it anywhere with the shortcode [reaction_buttons_reaction_summary], which takes summary_text as an argument. In the summary text you can use %s as a place holder for the most clicked button, e.g. [reaction_buttons_reaction_summary summary_text=&#8221;Most people found this post %s!&#8221;] for the example above.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Reaction buttons require at least PHP 5.2.</li>\n<li>Do you use a cache plugin? When the page is cached as soon as you reload the page your vote isn&#8217;t shown anymore until the cache is cleared. See below.</li>\n<li>(This shouldn&#8217;t apply since version 2.0.0 anymore.) Do you use any special characters like exclamation marks in your button names?</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to deactivate reaction buttons in certain situations</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Next to the normal options (categories, page types, post options, &#8230;) you can set the global variable $reaction_buttons_deactivate to true e.g. in your plugin or certain theme regions to deactivate reaction buttons during the execution of that code. But don&#8217;t forget to set it to false again when you are done!</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can the plugin work with plugins that cache the posts to increase page performance?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>I added an option to refresh the cache of a page after a button was clicked. But the cache plugin has to be supported by reaction buttons.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>What cache plugins are supported for automatic cache refresh?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>W3 Total Cache</li>\n<li>Quickcache seems to be working with an easy workaround, check <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/adding-support-for-quick-cache?replies=3#post-4573581\" rel=\"ugc\">hengxis solution in the forums</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler/\" rel=\"ugc\">Cache Enabler Plugin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>My plugin isn&#8217;t listed, can you add support?</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sure, use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/reaction-buttons?forum_id=10\" rel=\"ugc\">wordpress support forums</a> with a link to the plugin and I&#8217;ll check it out next time I&#8217;ve got time for the plugin. If you want it fast, check the documentation of the cache plugin and find me the function to delete single page caches. Then it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem to implement shortly.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I prevent users from voting twice?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an option &#8220;Use cookies&#8221; in the settings that sends cookies to prevent the user to vote twice on the same post/button (depending on other settings).</p>\n<p>It surely is not secure against somebody with bad intent, since they can just delete the cookie and reload the page. If I would save the IP instead, most users could reconnect their internet connection and get a new IP and sometimes on high traffic sites, a user wouldn&#8217;t be able to react, because somebody else with this IP already clicked. This plugin wants to make it easy to get the users reactions and easy and secure don&#8217;t work together.  The only secure way is letting them log in, but then you wouldn&#8217;t get any reactions at all, since 99,9% wouldn&#8217;t bother.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>2.1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You should be able to use apostrophes in button names now. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/cache-enabler/\" rel=\"ugc\">Cache Enabler Plugin</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/matthiaspabst/\" rel=\"ugc\">@matthiaspabst</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed v2.0 upgrade routine</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter to conditionally disable the output based on post type.

Thanks Matt Cromwell!</li>\n<li>Fixed deprecated syntax when adding the settings menu, thanks flufftron!</li>\n<li>fixed some typos and such</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added css-class &#8216;rb-chosen&#8217; that is added to the clicked button when only one click is allowed.
