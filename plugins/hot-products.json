This feature provides insights into product popularity, which can guide marketing and sales strategies.

It can also help determine which items may need to be restocked or are overstocked. Additionally, store owners can leverage this information to enhance cross-selling and upselling opportunities.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Hot Products Plugin allows store owners to evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.
