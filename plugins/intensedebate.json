        "description": "<p>IntenseDebate Comments enhance and encourage conversation on your blog or website. Custom integration with your WordPress admin panel makes moderation a piece of cake. Comment threading, reply-by-email, user accounts and reputations, comment voting, along with Twitter and friendfeed integrations enrich your readers&#8217; experience and make more of the internet aware of your blog and comments which drives traffic to you!</p>\n<p>Full comment and account data sync between Intense Debate and WordPress ensures that you will always have your comments stored locally on your own server.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: IntenseDebate is currently being maintained, but not actively developed.</strong></p>\n",
        "installation": "<p><em>Note: As is the case when installing any new plugin, it&#8217;s always a good idea to backup your blog data before installing.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>After downloading the IntenseDebate plugin, unpack and upload the file to the wp-content/plugins folder on your blog. Make sure to leave the directory structure of the archive intact so that all of the IntenseDebate files are located in &#8216;wp-content/plugins/intensedebate/&#8217;</li>\n<li>You will need to activate the IntenseDebate plugin in order to see your new comment system. Go to the Plugins tab and find IntenseDebate Comments in the list and click <strong>Activate</strong>.</li>\n<li>After activating proceed to the plugin settings page (under Settings &gt; IntenseDebate) to configure your plugin. Don&#8217;t forget to visit your account at <a href=\"http://intensedebate.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IntenseDebate.com</a> for <em>additional customization options</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='having%20connection%20issues%20during%20install%3F'>\nHaving Connection Issues During Install?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order for our plugin to work properly, our servers need to be able to get in contact with yours. Some common causes for communication errors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You&#8217;re attempting to install IntenseDebate on a local development server &#8211; your site must be online on the &#8220;public&#8221; internet</li>\n<li>Your site is password protected (.htaccess or similar)</li>\n<li>Your server is behind a firewall or</li>\n<li>A caching plugin might be configured incorrectly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further assistance, please contact IntenseDebate support at support@intensedebate.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20data%20synchronization%3F'>\nWhat is data synchronization?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Comments made in IntenseDebate are automatically backed-up to your WordPress comment system, while your existing WordPress comments are automatically imported into IntenseDebate. You always have all of your comments so uninstalling is a one-click process if you change your mind. Syncing your accounts enables auto-login so logging into WordPress automatically logs you into IntenseDebate. Profile sync also means that comments you make are synchronized to both profiles so you maintain ownership of your profile.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20seo%3F'>\nWhat about SEO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IntenseDebate outputs the standard WordPress comments enabling your comments to still be indexed by search engines that ignore JavaScript, while ensuring that visitors surfing with JavaScript disabled will be able to interact with comments made in IntenseDebate. Readers with JS disabled can comment in the original WP system and those comments will be imported into IntenseDebate.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20sync%20my%20accounts%3F'>\nHow do I sync my accounts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After installing and activating the IntenseDebate plugin you will need to update your account settings in your Plugin Settings page and either create an IntenseDebate account or login to your IntenseDebate account. Your data synchronization and comment import will start as soon as you have successfully logged in.</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><br />\nYour comments may take several hours to import. The time of your import is dependent on how many other import requests we are receiving in addition to how many comments are currently being imported.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
