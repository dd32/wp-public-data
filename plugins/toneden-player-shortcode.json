This plugin will let you embed our player into your WordPress blog just as easily as the SoundCloud player- in fact, if you&#8217;ve used the SoundCloud Shortcode Plugin, you can replace the [soundcloud] tags with [tonedenplayer] tags and the ToneDen player will automatically replace the SoundCloud player (though any custom styles you applied to the SoundCloud player won&#8217;t apply to the ToneDen player).</p>\n",

The URLs can point to an artist, set, single track, or any combination of the three. The URLs parameter can be provided either between the [toneden] tags (<code>[tonedenplayer dom=\"#player\"]https://soundcloud.com/giraffage,https://soundcloud.com/flume/sintra[/tonedenplayer]</code>) or as a &#8216;urls&#8217; parameter in the shortcode (<code>[tonedenplayer dom=\"#player\" urls=\"https://soundcloud.com/giraffage,https://soundcloud.com/flume/sintra\"]</code>).</li>\n</ol>\n",

Help.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feel free to email us at support (at) toneden.io if you need any help setting up the player.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I customize the player?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose from 4 different skins, and 2 different visualizer types. For a more extensive overview of the different configuration parameters available, view the documentation at https://github.com/ToneDen/toneden-sdk. NOTE: Parameters that are in camelCase in the GitHub documentation are in all lowercase in the shortcode version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s ToneDen?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Good question. We make it really easy to turn musicians&#8217; SoundCloud accounts into awesome websites, and give them the tools they need to market themselves.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
