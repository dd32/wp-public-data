        "installation": "<h4>Minimum Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>MailPoet</li>\n<li>Gravity Forms</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of MailPoet Gravity Forms Add-On, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;MailPoet Gravity Forms Add-On&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found my plugin extension you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you&#8217;re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading my plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it</li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s wp-content/plugins/ directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Setting up the Plugin</h4>\n<p>When you edit your form or your creating a new form, under &#8220;Standard Fields&#8221; select the MailPoet button. A new field will be added to your form. Now edit that field to setup.</p>\n<p>Fill in the required field id numbers for First Name, Last Name and Email address.</p>\n<p>If you wish to enable a multi-list selection then enable it and select the lists your users can then select.</p>\n<p>If you want just a simple single checkbox then make sure that you have selected the lists from the settings page under &#8220;Gravity Forms -&gt; Settings -&gt; MailPoet&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once you are happy with the settings, press &#8220;Save Form&#8221;. If you haven&#8217;t added the form to a post/page yet then insert the form to that post/page.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<h4>Upgrading</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",

This has been corrected to only load once and no more.</p>\n\n<p>Translation of the brand name &#039;MailPoet&#039; only has been removed as it is not needed to be tranlsated.</p>\n\n<p>Also this lovely &quot;Upgrade Notice&quot; has been added to show you the changes made.</p>"
