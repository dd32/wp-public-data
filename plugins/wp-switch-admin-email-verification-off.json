So no, it will not slow WordPress down.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20update%20management%20plugins%3F'>\nIs this plugin compatible with update management plugins?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

It does nothing with the database. Limiting the code base is a security best practice.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20there%20be%20future%20updates%20to%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWill there be future updates to this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we will release a new version every 10 months or so. A new version will not mean new code. It is just to avoid the plugin being marked as abandoned. New code will only be added if WordPress needs it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
