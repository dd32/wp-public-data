        "description": "<p>Subpage Listing allows you to take full advantage of WordPress Pages&#8217; hierarchy by generating a navigational tree of the pages below them (subpages).</p>\n<p>For example, say you have a parent page called &#8220;Parent.&#8221; Now, say you have 3 pages under &#8220;Parent,&#8221; called &#8220;Child1,&#8221; &#8220;Child2,&#8221; and &#8220;Child3.&#8221; Now, say that you have 2 pages under &#8220;Child2&#8221; called &#8220;Grandchild1&#8221; and &#8220;Grandchild2.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Subpage Listing would create a navigation tree for &#8220;Parent&#8221; that looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Child1</li>\n<li>Child2\n<ul>\n<li>Grandchild1</li>\n<li>Grandchild2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Child3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This allows you to very easily create a complex hierarchical structure that can be browsed.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>\n<p>Blank pages will automatically be given a navigation tree. This allows you to quickly create &#8220;container&#8221; pages (all you do is fill in a title, and choose the page&#8217;s parent.)</p>\n<p>If you would like to insert the navigational tree manually (that is, surrounded by text of your choosing), use the &#8220;Subpage Listing&#8221; quicktag that will show up on the Write Page screen (sorry, no RTE support at this time). This will insert the tag: <!--%subpages%--> which will be replaced by the listing of the subpages.</p>\n<p>Note: when inserting the tag manually, make sure that there is a blank line both above and below the tag, so as to ensure proper handling of your surrounding paragraphs by WordPress.</p>\n<p>Version 0.6 was a massive update that added a bunch of new functionality. The ability to show the current page&#8217;s parent has been added, as well as the ability to show the current page&#8217;s siblings. You can also suppress the showing of children, and show only siblings, parents, or both. To use these features within a post, use this syntax: <!--%subpages(5,1,1)%--> The first &#8220;parameter&#8221; is the depth you want to show. You can set this to 0 to suppress display of children. The second &#8220;parameter&#8221; is a boolean switch for display of the parent page. The third &#8220;parameter&#8221; is a boolean switch for display of sibling pages. All are optional, although if you want to set the second &#8220;parameter&#8221;, you also have to set the first, and if you want to set the third, you have to set all three.</p>\n<p>There is also a new function for use in your templates. Many people wanted to show subpages or siblings in their sidebar, so now you can do that. <code>&lt;?php txfx_wp_subpages(); ?&gt;</code> is the most basic form, but it can take many parameters.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php txfx_wp_subpages(5, false, false, '&lt;ul&gt;', '&lt;/ul&gt;', true); ?&gt; will show 5 pages deep (first parameter), hide the parent (second parameter), hide the siblings (third parameter), wrap the whole thing in '&lt;ul&gt;' and '&lt;/ul&gt;' (fourth and fifth parameters), and will echo the result (sixth parameter). These happen to be the default settings, that I have just illustrated.\n</code></pre>\n",
