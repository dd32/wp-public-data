        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20validar%20work%3F'>\nHow does Validar work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Validar installs on your Thank You page during checkout.  We&#8217;ll pull the shipping address entered by your customer and check it for obvious errors (e.g. incorrect postal code for the address) and check it against any rules you might have active (e.g. &#8220;No Post Office Boxes&#8221;).  If there are any problems, we&#8217;ll ask the customer immediately to help fix it, or to accept our suggested changes.  This small addition to your checkout helps you save money by avoiding shipping issues before they happen.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20anything%20else%20to%20use%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need anything else to use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, a free Validar account is required to validate shipping addresses for your WooCommerce store (we&#8217;ll create one for you on install, automatically!).

In addition to address validation, we also allow you to apply shipping rules like &#8220;No Post Office Boxes&#8221; (which is a common rule for UPS shipments), or things like &#8220;No Military Addresses&#8221; (which can cause delivery issues with many carriers).  The rules are something you can turn on or off for your store.
