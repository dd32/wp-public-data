The biggest threat to website or any technology security is &#8216;Social Engineering&#8217; where people are tricked into revealing credentials.

Once installed it will start protecting you from spam.

It does not track users.  It does not collect any personal data.</p>\n<h3>Go Pro</h3>\n<p>Our view is the free version should deal with the most prolific spam elements that come with the free blogging platform, namely comments.</p>\n<p>And the Pro version should be affordable to the smallest of businesses and deal with the more sophisticated spam elements that plague them, namely contact forms and registration forms.</p>\n<p>Upgrade to &#8216;Pro&#8217;  from within your WordPress dashboard to get these further pro anti spam features</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Three extra levels of spam protection</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Blocklist checking using industry spam list</li>\n<li>Statistical text analysis to determine spam probability</li>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) natural language server to beat the most creative spammers</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help with GDPR and privacy laws</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option to not send any third party data to the AI server but still have local AI spam detection through machine learning textual analysis, no need for a DPA / SCC</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protect forms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetpack contact form</li>\n<li>Contact Form 7</li>\n<li>Gravity Forms</li>\n<li>WP Forms</li>\n<li>Quick Contact Form</li>\n<li>Fluent Forms<br />\n( and more in the pipeline )</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Message Store</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store message for ham / spam review and deletion for plugins that don&#8217;t have their own message store (optional)\n<ul>\n<li>Contact Form 7</li>\n<li>WP Forms Lite</li>\n<li>Fluent Forms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stops phantom registrations</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce</li>\n<li>WordPress users</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No limits on number of detections</p>\n</li>\n<li>Automatically block and discard the worst spam</li>\n<li>Control spam retention</li>\n<li>Automatic spam statistics reporting</li>\n<li>Optional spam notifications alerts, so you can review them</li>\n<li>Set your own Allow or Deny lists of IP addresses, email patterns and text patterns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Free trial, sign up directly from the plugin settings page.</p>\n<p>Or visit the <a href=\"https://fullworksplugins.com/products/anti-spam/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro product page</a></p>\n<h3>Privacy and GDPR</h3>\n<p>This free plugin does not collect, process or send any website visitor personal data anywhere unless you chose to opt in to sharing the spam comments you mark as spam or ham with our spam detection server.</p>\n<h3>PHP 8.3</h3>\n<p>Tested against PHP 8.3</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20use%20this%20plugin%20and%20not%20one%20of%20the%20others%3F'>\nWhy use this plugin and not one of the others?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A great question.  The most popular anti-spam plugin for WordPress is Akismet. Akismet is shipped wil the initial install of WordPress giving the impression that it is the most appropriate<br />\nplugin for comment spam. It is not until you try and use Akismet that you find out that that you have to sign up for an API Key, and then discover that for the vast majority of websites Akismet<br />\nis not a free anti-spam plugin.  Akismet is not free for any website that has any commercial purpose, that means if you hav ean affiliate link or a single advert or sell something or advertise something for sale, or just simply use your website as a brochure for your business<br />\nyou have to pay Akismet a fee. And it not cheap. They also say that they monitor and check for licence abuse.</p>\n<p>Another popular WordPress anti spam plugin, Clean Talk, is not free at all, for anything. You need to sign up to a plan.</p>\n<p>After that, there are loads of anti spam plugins that have been around a while. Because they have been around awhile they have built up a high number of users, but a high number of users for an anti spam plugin doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it is effective.<br />\nMany of these established plugin are free and have no sustainable revenue stream to pay for developments and improvements in the fight against WordPress spam.</p>\n<p>And then there are security plugins, that also do anti-spam. There are many good security plugins, but there strength is security, not necessarily anti spam.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Fullworks Anti Spam is a relatively new entrant (2019) to an area with lots of competition. Competition is healthy. What Fullworks Anti Spam  has going for it is free for Comment spam and it is new so uses the latest techniques. Also with a pro offering, it has funding to keep<br />\ndeveloping in the never ending fight against spammers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses techniques to detect automated spam (bots). Bot have certain characteristics that can be detected by our software. When a comment is submitted by a bot it is marked as spam and appears in your comment list under a separate tab as spam.<br />\nThe comment is there for you to review. The plugin also cleans up after a certain number of days, that you set in settings. After a while, once you are convinced all the comments are really spam<br />\n ( we are confident, but we understand you may want to check things out ) you can set the time to zero days and then never see automated spam again. This is why we call it Stop WordPress Spam.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20settings%3F'>\nWhere are the settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As a &#8216;set and forget&#8217; plugin the settings a under Dashboard&gt;Settings&gt;Anti Spam</p>\n<p>There is only one setting, enable or disable blocking of bot (automated) comment spam, by default this is on.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='it%20only%20handles%20automated%20spam%2C%20what%20about%20human%20spam%3F'>\nIt only handles automated spam, what about human spam?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our statistic shows that automated comment spam makes up 99.5% of spam comments, that means that in a typical unprotected blog that gets 600 spam comments you have 3 humans spam comments to deal with.<br />\nI&#8217;m sure that is manageable, but of course if you want to eliminate those you can always <a href=\"https://fullworks.net/products/anti-spam/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">upgrade to Pro</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20form%20protection%20only%20in%20pro%2C%20can%27t%20it%20be%20in%20free%3F'>\nWhy is form protection only in Pro, can&#8217;t it be in free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is important for plugins to be commercially viable. If they are not, they wither and die. You see so many abandoned free plugins. Isn&#8217;t that just annoying when you find after a couple of years<br />\n you need to find an alternative?  We have chosen to put contact form anti spam and registration form anti spam in the Pro version so we can have a revenue stream to keep developing anti spam protection.<br />\n Contact form spam is the higher volume issue, and most websites with contact forms or WooCommerce registration forms are business websites that should easily be able to afford our modest fees<br />\n for the Pro version.  It is surprisingly small investment &#8211;  why not upgrade? <a href=\"https://fullworks.net/products/anti-spam/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to Pro</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20to%20the%20spam%20comments%3F'>\nWhat happens to the spam comments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each spam comment is stored under the comments&gt;spam tab for your review and deletion as required</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20on%20contact%20or%20registration%20forms%3F'>\nDoes it work on contact or registration forms?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The free plugin is an anti-bot, built to protect WordPress comments from spam bots which is 99% of the issue. The Pro version has more sophisticated spam detection techiques including<br />\nmachine learning to prevent human spam and integration to most forms packages.  As most sites that have forms are commercial in some form we feel that<br />\nit is only right that they pay a small amount towards the cost of software and hardware required to provide these features.<br />\nYou can upgrade to a free trial of pro directly from your WordPress plugins page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20opt%20in%20or%20use%20and%20api%20key%3F'>\nDo I have to Opt In or use and API key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whilst there is an Opt In form, if you skip it the free plugin works exactly the same.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20free%20version%20limited%20to%20bot%20based%20comment%20spam%3F'>\nWhy is the free version limited to bot based comment spam?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have chosen to limit the free version to bot based comment spam to keep this WordPress.org plugin absolutely free.<br />\nBy putting contact form anti spam and registration form anti spam in the Pro version we can have a revenue stream to keep developing anti spam protection.<br />\nSpammers don&#8217;t stop so we need to keep developing.<br />\nMost websites with contact forms or WooCommerce registration forms are business websites that should easily be able to afford our modest fees<br />\n for the Pro version.  It is surprisingly small investment &#8211;  why not upgrade? <a href=\"https://fullworksplugins.com/products/anti-spam/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to Pro</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
