Plugin now checks to see if the correct value exists before attempting to display it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated tested up to version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Reverted plugin suggestions from v1.2.6</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated translation file.</li>\n<li>Added suggestions for plugins in relevant contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Detection of the pro version of the plugin did not fully remove this version&#8217;s admin menu, which caused paying users to have a confusing experience when clicking on the wrong menu.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added automatic deactivation when the pro version of this plugin is installed as the two plugins should not be used together.</li>\n<li>Automatic deactivation migrates Simple Full Screen Background Image to Pro&#8217;s settings so the site&#8217;s layout won&#8217;t be changed by deactivating the Simple Full Screen Background Image plugin.</li>\n<li>Added uninstall.php to clean up when the plugin is deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Included support for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/instant-images/\" rel=\"ugc\">Instant Images</a> plugin. This provides users with an easy way to search for and upload images from Unsplash.com locally to their WordPress site. The Instant Images button is now included on the Appearance &gt; Fullscreen BG Image settings page. This requires that the Instant Images plugin be installed and active.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Included alt tag in background image to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The background image is considered decoration, and so an empty alt tag (i.e. alt=&#8221;&#8221;) is an acceptable way to allow assistive technology to ignore the image.</li>\n<li>Update: Improved translatable POT file.</li>\n<li>Update: Added subtle upsell (dismissible) messaging in the plugin to inform users of the pro version of this plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated contributor/author</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added missing text domains for translation</li>\n<li>Added a .pot file</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the admin page to use the improved media manager UII</li>\n<li>Fixed function name conflicts with the Pro version.</li>\n<li>Improved data validation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with images loading via http when on an https site</li>\n<li>Did some general code cleanup and improvement</li>\n</ul>\n"
