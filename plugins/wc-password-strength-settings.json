There, you can choose the strength of the required passwords as well as change the messaging that appears as a user enters their password, change colors, and change any password guidelines.</li>\n<li>Save and enjoy!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='q%3A%20what%20does%20each%20level%20do%3F'>\nQ: What does each level do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The levels range from 0 (lowest) to 4 (highest). As passwords are typed, the strength meter will dynamically update &#8211; this will disable the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button until the requirements have been met. It should be noted that Level 0 accepts any password, so messaging isn&#8217;t shown (and therefore doesn&#8217;t have admin fields).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20where%20does%20this%20meter%20show%20up%3F'>\nQ: Where does this meter show up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This should appear wherever the Password Strength Meter appears &#8211; in the &#8220;My Account&#8221; page or during Checkout.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20how%20is%20the%20password%20strength%20determined%3F'>\nQ: How is the password strength determined?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: The password strength is determined by code in WordPress core, more specifically using a library called &#8220;zxcvbn&#8221;, created by Dropbox. There&#8217;s a more in-depth description of how this works in the <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielSantoro/wc-password-strength-settings/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin documentation</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20how%20can%20i%20require%20numbers%2C%20special%20characters%2C%20or%20a%20certain%20length%3F'>\nQ: How can I require numbers, special characters, or a certain length?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This plugin doesn&#8217;t allow for that functionality, because it&#8217;s not part of the built-in WordPress password strength algorithms. Those restrictions have also been proven to be ineffective and frustrating for users. See <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielSantoro/wc-password-strength-settings/wiki/How-Password-Strength-is-Determined\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How Password Strength is Determined</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20why%20is%20my%20password%20marked%20as%20weak%3F'>\nQ: Why is my password marked as weak?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This is the most common question I get, and the short answer is I don&#8217;t know, but you can likely figure it out with the guide on <a href=\"https://github.com/DanielSantoro/wc-password-strength-settings/wiki/How-Password-Strength-is-Determined\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How Password Strength is Determined</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20this%20allows%20weak%20passwords%20during%20account%20creation%20in%20checkout%20-%20what%20gives%3F'>\nQ: This allows weak passwords during account creation in checkout &#8211; what gives?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: This is unfortunately unavoidable. As of writing, WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t validate the password strength in the checkout page, so while the strength meter will show it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> enforce it. This isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m able to work around, so share that you want validation on the password strength requirements in the official WooCommerce <a href=\"http://ideas.woocommerce.com/forums/133476-woocommerce\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ideas Board</a> &#8211; once it&#8217;s active in WooCommerce, it will automatically be active here. ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='q%3A%20my%20site%20was%20recently%20hacked.%20is%20this%20plugin%20vulnerable%2C%20or%20does%20it%20cause%20vulnerabilities%3F'>\nQ: My site was recently hacked. Is this plugin vulnerable, or does it cause vulnerabilities?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: No, this plugin does not create any vulnerabilities. It does create additional displays for the <em>client-side</em> (in the user&#8217;s browser), but not server-side where vulnerabilities are found. It is using the Password Strength Meter that is already in WordPress, and doesn&#8217;t store or handle any information &#8211; WordPress or WooCommerce are the only ones that see and manage passwords, not this plugin.
