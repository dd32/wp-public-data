        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I upgrade from Now Reading or Now Reading Reloaded? How?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please read the Upgrade section under Installation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I found a bug, what should I do? (or, this plugin is broken!)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please leave a note on the <a href=\"http://blog.ashodnakashian.com/projects/now-reading-redux/\" title=\"project home page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">blog.ashodnakashian.com/projects/now-reading-redux/</a>. That is probably the easiest way. However, you may also log bugs on <a href=\"https://github.com/Ashod/Now-Reading-Redux\" title=\"GitHub\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github.com/Ashod/Now-Reading-Redux</a> or on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/now-reading-redux/\" title=\"wordpress\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/now-reading-redux/</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where is the old changelog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please find the original Now Reading Relaoded readme with the changelog in the readme.old file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does NRR on your website (blog.ashodnakashian.com) look different from mine?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>What the plugin ends up looking like is controlled mainly by two things: templates and CSS.</p>\n<p>The templates folder contain a single php file for each page or element on the screen, with the exception of &#8216;shelf.php&#8217; which renders the actual book shelves (starting with v6.5).<br />\nWith a little PHP and HTML knowledge it&#8217;s relatively easy to customize these files to fit your needs. However, before doing that I urge you to look into the CSS and make the most of it, failing that, consider making a suggestion on the plugin homepage and everyone may benefit from your suggestion in an upcoming version.</p>\n<p>The second method to control the look and style of NRR is via the CSS script. Starting with version 6.5 library, search and sidebar allow you to write a custom CSS script in the options page. The plugin is highly customizable if you know your CSS. For example, lists are rendered in a table-style (images only) using CSS.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I just updated to the latest version and some stuff got messed up. What&#8217;s up with that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With new versions new options are added for ease of use and flexibility. Every effort is done to keep backwards compatibility, however, in some cases this isn&#8217;t possible. It&#8217;s also desirable to cleanup and refactor old options.</p>\n<p>To avoid problems and surprises, please revisit the NRR options page after every update. Check your old options and learn about the new ones. Sometimes default values aren&#8217;t set correctly and therefore PHP defaults are effective. This sets some values to false and texts to blank.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is searching for books broken?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you get a warning such as &#8220;URL file-access is disabled in the server configuration&#8221; then you need to edit your PHP.ini file. Searching relies on PHP&#8217;s file_get_contents() function. This function is subject to security permissions. Specifically, allow_url_fopen must be set to &#8216;on&#8217; in PHP.ini (which is the default). More information <a href=\"http://phpsec.org/projects/phpsecinfo/tests/allow_url_fopen.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">file_get_contents&#8217;s reference</a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">allow_url_fopen&#8217;s reference</a>.</p>\n<p>Note: Starting from v6.7.0 file_get_contents has been replaced by Snoopy/cURL controlled from the Options page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the number of items shown in the sidebar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting with version 6.5 there is an option that controls the maximum number of books shown for each shelf.</p>\n<p>To customize older version, you&#8217;ll have to change the query string in the section in question.<br />\nUnder the section heading in question, find the following line (exact values may be different):\n    </p>\n<p>This is a PHP function call (named have_books) and the string between the quotes is the query string. To change the number of items returned by this call simply add &#8220;&amp;num=4&#8221; (without the double quotes.) Here I chose to return 4 items, but you can set it to any number. If you set it to -1 you&#8217;ll get all!</p>\n<p>Here is how you may set it to return 7 finished books: have_books(&#8216;status=read&amp;orderby=finished&amp;order=desc&amp;num=7&#8217;)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the attributes of nrr_shelf and what are the defaults?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any number of attributes can be used. Leaving out an attribute gives it the default value.</p>\n<p>style   =&gt;  &#091;list&#042;, numbered, table&#093;.<br />\nstatus  =&gt;  &#091;unread, reading, onhold, read, all&#042;&#093;.<br />\norderby =&gt;  &#091;reading, read, onhold, finished&#042;&#093;.<br />\norder   =&gt;  &#091;asc, desc&#042;&#093;.<br />\nsearch  =&gt;  A substring to match author, title.<br />\nauthor  =&gt;  The author to show books by.<br />\ntitle   =&gt;  The book title to show.<br />\nrating  =&gt;  Book rating Between 1 and 10 inclusive.<br />\nreader  =&gt;  The user&#8217;s ID who added the book.<br />\nstarted_year    =&gt;  The started year in decimal.<br />\nstarted_month   =&gt;  The started month in decimal.<br />\nfinished_year   =&gt;  The finished year in decimal.<br />\nfinished_month  =&gt;  The finished month in decimal.<br />\nnum     =&gt;  The maximum number of items to show. -1 for all (default).<br />\nviz     =&gt;  hide, show_text&#042;, show_image, show_image_text.<br />\nitems_per_row   =&gt;  Number of books per row.
