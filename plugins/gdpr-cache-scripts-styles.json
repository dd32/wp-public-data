Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This plugin does not provide any guarantees of making your website GDPR-compliant. As a website operator, you are always responsible to verify if this plugin works for you and collect consent for external scripts before loading them in the visitor&#8217;s browser.</p>\n<h3>2. How it works</h3>\n<p><strong>Short</strong>: External files are downloaded to your WordPress installation (into the uploads-folder) and then served from there.</p>\n<p><strong>More details</strong>:</p>\n<p>The plugin scans every URL that is enqueued via <code>wp_enqueue_script()</code> and <code>wp_enqueue_style()</code>. When detecting an external URL, that file is saved to your uploads-folder and served from there.</p>\n<p>It also scans the contents of CSS files for external dependencies and also saves those files to your uploads-folder!</p>\n<p>Heads-up: For technical reasons, we cannot scan the contents of JS files for such dependencies &#8211; JS files can always inject external assets</p>\n<p><strong>No Output Buffer</strong>:</p>\n<p>This plugin does not add any &#8220;output buffering&#8221; but scans the URLs which are enqueued via recommended WordPress functions.</p>\n<p>As a result, <em>GDPR Cache Scripts &amp; Styles</em> has practically no performance impact on your response time, no matter how big your website is.</p>\n<p><strong>Background worker</strong>:</p>\n<p>To speed up your website&#8217;s loading time, all assets are downloaded in a background process: When a new asset is detected, or a cached file expires, a worker-task is enqueued.</p>\n<p>The queue is then processed in an asynchronous process; while the queue is processed, your website could still serve the external assets for a while &#8211; usually the queue is processed within one or two minutes.</p>\n<h3>3. Options Page</h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find the plugin options page at &#8220;Tools &gt; GDPR Cache&#8221;. On that page you can refresh and purge your website&#8217;s cache.</p>\n<p>Here you can also review a full list of all files that are locally cached, and review the expiration date of each file &#8211; when a file expires, the plugin downloads a new version of it from the remote server.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you <strong>deactivate</strong> the plugin, the entire cache is purged (all files are deleted and relevant DB values are reset)</p>\n<h3>4. Tested with</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tested this plugin with the following themes and plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Block Editor</strong> (embedding Google Fonts via the Customizer&#8217;s &#8220;Additional CSS&#8221;)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://divimode.com/go/divi/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Divi</strong></a> (see &#8220;Configuration for Divi&#8221; below)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/\" rel=\"ugc\"><strong>Elementor</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\" rel=\"ugc\">Jetpack</a> (specially with Performance options like &#8220;site accelerator&#8221;)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/olympus-google-fonts/\" rel=\"ugc\">Fonts Plugin | Google Fonts Typography</a></li>\n<li>Works on <strong>multisite</strong> networks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most other plugins and themes will work with this plugin as well. If you encounter any issues, please let us know, so we can improve this plugin üëç</p>\n",

Some scripts (such as Google Maps scripts) will load external assets that cannot be detected or cached by this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='configuration%20for%20divi'>\nConfiguration for Divi\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the Divi Theme, you need to <strong>disable</strong> the Theme Option &#8220;Improve Google Fonts Loading&#8221;.</p>\n<p>You can find that option in wp-admin &gt; Divi &gt; Theme Options &gt; General &gt; Performance</p>\n<p>When this option is enabled, this plugin cannot detect the Google Fonts, and your website will make some external requests to load those font-files.</p>\n<p>Screenshot: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divimode/gdpr-cache-script-styles/main/docs/divi-config.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">divi-config.png</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20still%20see%20some%20requests%20to%20google%27s%20servers'>\nI still see some requests to Google&#8217;s Servers\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Common reasons are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cache is not ready yet</strong>. The initialization takes some time &#8211; check the status on &#8220;wp-admin &gt; Tools &gt; GDPR Cache&#8221; to see the state.</li>\n<li>A <strong>browser plugin</strong> loads external assets on every request. Test the page in an <em>Incognito</em> or <em>Private</em> window.</li>\n<li>Some scripts, like <em>Google Maps</em>, can <strong>dynamically load Google Fonts</strong> or other external resources. This cannot be prevented by this plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, some themes or performance plugins can embed the external resources in a way that our plugin cannot detect. If this is the case for you, please let us know. We might be able to adjust this plugin, or provide you with instructions on how to configure the plugin/theme to be compatible with <em>GDPR Cache Scripts &amp; Styles</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20work%20on%20multisite%20networks%3F'>\nDoes it work on multisite networks?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. When used in a multisite network, each site will start to create its own GDPR cache</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each site in the network will start to download external files automatically.</li>\n<li>The local cache is stored in the respective sites ‚Äúuploads‚Äù folder (there‚Äôs no overlapping between sites).</li>\n<li>Each site only maintains assets that are used by that site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is NO network-wide overview, or &#8220;Purge All Sites&#8221; function in the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
