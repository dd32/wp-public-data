And then, there&#8217;s the rest that makes us different from any other related posts plugin.</p>\n<h4>How is it different from any other related posts plugin?</h4>\n<p>Okay, let us take a deep breath;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We bring you new and engaged traffic from other websites similar to yours, based on our Readers Exchange Ecosystem (REE)</li>\n<li>We got lots of display options for you to choose from</li>\n<li>We drive related traffic to your Facebook fan page</li>\n<li>We supply tracking and monitoring tools to track how your readers use the plugin ( CTR, incoming and outgoing traffic and more)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What is the Readers Exchange Ecosystem?</h4>\n<p>We offer your readers related posts on your site as well as on other awesome related sites in our network.</p>\n<p>For every user that clicks on an outgoing post, you will receive credits that will drive you a new, engaged reader, back to your site.</p>\n<p>You can also track all this readers&#8217; traffic exchange on our website at engageya.com</p>\n<h4>Do I have only one display option?</h4>\n<p>NO, we have MANY different display options to choose from, we got something to suit everyone;</p>\n<p>From text only, to thumbnails in different sizes, font, static or slide-in, just try us out. </p>\n<h4>Will this plugin slow down my site like some other plugins do?</h4>\n<p>NO, unlike some other related content recommenders, we do not analyze your content on your site, but rather on our servers, so no slowing-down can occur to your site. </p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t host any images on my site, can you still display related thumbnails?</h4>\n<p>YES. If you host your images or videos on another website, we will automatically detect and use it as your thumbnail.</p>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have images in your posts, we can automatically generate related default images to make your site get that extra stylish touch.</p>\n<h4>OK, I&#8217;ve installed the plugin but I don&#8217;t see any change to my site?</h4>\n<p>Thanks for installing the plugin. Your site has so much great content that we need a couple of hours to read it all and analyze it properly. This should usually take about 2-4 hours.
