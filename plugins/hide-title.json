        "faq": "\n<h4>I upgraded to 1.0.2 and the plugin stopped working. Why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is possible that your theme does not have the wp_head function in it&#8217;s header.php file. In general all themes are suppose to have it, and version 1.0.2 looks for it to prevent adding bad code to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> area of the page. If you have access to your theme file simply add <code>&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&gt;</code> to header.php just before the <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag. If not, this plugin will no longer be compatible with your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Hey! This plugin is hiding things I don&#8217;t want hidden!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default this plugin looks for the <code>.entry-title</code> class and hides it. If it doesn&#8217;t find it it will look for any <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> elements that contain the title and hide them instead. To change the default <code>.entry-title</code> selector to something that makes more sense to you, add the following code to the functions.php file of your current theme:</p>\n<pre><code>global $DojoDigitalHideTitle;\n// Be sure to replace \".your-selector\" with your selector!\n$DojoDigitalHideTitle-&gt;set_selector('.your-selector');\n</code></pre>\n<p>As noted in the comments, you&#8217;ll need to replace the string <code>.your-selector</code> with the css selector you&#8217;d like hidden. It can be any valid css selector such as <code>h1</code>, <code>.myclass</code>, <code>#myid</code>, etc. I recommend using a class or id to avoid accidentally hiding unforeseen elements.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want to edit my theme files, can&#8217;t you just add an option page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I could, but I&#8217;d like to avoid adding Yet Another Options Page if I can. If enough people request it though, I&#8217;ll go ahead and bite the bullet.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who is the author of this plugin anyway?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was originally was developed by Randall Runnels of Dojo Digital. In March 2015, the plugin was not compatible with the latest version of WordPress. After finding the problem, Brandon Kraft reached out with a solution, but didn&#8217;t hear a response. He contacted the Plugins team at WordPress.org with an offer to assume development to bring it up date. The plugins team reached out and either recieved the approval of Randall, did not hear back at all, or the e-mail bounced.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
