Once an Endpoint URL and Authorization Token are submitted for the Grant Contributor&#8217;s first posted grant, the Grants Portal will automatically sync every 24 hours.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20does%20the%20grants%20portal%20sync%3F%20can%20i%20force%20a%20sync%3F'>\nHow often does the Grants Portal sync? Can I force a sync?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Grants Portal automatically syncs every 24 hours. However, Grant Contributors have the option to force a sync of all published grants by navigating to their Grants Dashboard in the California Grants Portal. Once there, select &#8220;force sync&#8221; next to any grant. Note: When &#8220;force sync&#8221; is selected on any grant in the Grants Dashboard, all of the Grant Contributor’s published grants will also sync. Grant drafts will remain unpublished.

Grant Contributors should reference the State Grantmakers Guide <strong>(state agencies must log in prior to accessing this link)</strong> for instructions on submitting opportunities through the online form. Grant Contributors should note that grants submitted via WordPress plugin must be edited in the WordPress admin dashboard while grants submitted via online form must be edited in the Grants Portal.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
