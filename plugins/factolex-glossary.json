How can I change that?</h4>\n<p>You can do this by creating your own lexicon at <a href=\"http://www.factolex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Factolex.com</a> by clicking the checkboxes for facts that you find relevant. After you specify your username in the <em>Factolex Glossary Settings</em> the definitions are updated accordingly.</p>\n<h4>Will it degrade the performance of my blog?</h4>\n<p>This should not be a problem. All the data is cached in your local WordPress database.</p>\n<p>Just when you browse your own blog (still logged on to your blog account), we refresh your own lexicon (if you have specified a username). This might cause some slowdowns, but those don&#8217;t happen for your users.</p>\n<h4>How can I customize the look and feel?</h4>\n<p>You can customize color, width and height through the Factolex Glossary Settings. If that&#8217;s not enough, you can also edit the file <code>/wp-content/plugins/factolex-glossary/factolex-glossary.css</code>. Be careful when updating the plugin. You could consider copying your changes into your theme CSS file.</p>\n"
