Short answer, there is no &#8220;best one&#8221;. No spamfilter and no method for spamfiltering is perfect.<br />\nSlightly longer answer, you could try about twenty and choose the one that fits your needs best.</p>\n<p>But there is also a really long answer.<br />\nThere are different methods that can be used against spam, and every method has its drawbacks.<br />\nIn my opinion, having a low number of false positives is more important than perfectly marking all spam, you don&#8217;t want to miss out on important people or information. Nagging the user in some way has a similar effect, the user might not even want to bother with that and just walk away.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third party services: Services like Akismet, OOPSpam, Stop Forum Spam and also reCAPTCHA offer third party services to check for spam. This can be very effective, but you are giving user submitted data away to these third parties and are also giving your users up for tracking them.</li>\n<li>Captcha&#8217;s, reCAPTCHA and Quizz Questions: You are annoying your users and probably sending some of them away. This especially counts for reCAPTCHA for visitors who have third party cookies disabled.</li>\n<li>Blacklists: Often running behind the facts. That goes for the way of getting users off that list, and also in getting users on that list.</li>\n<li>Referer check: check if the Referer header is set correctly. You can never trust it is set correctly. Modern browsers are limiting the use of Referers, though for now that is mostly for third-party domains.</li>\n<li>JavaScript methods: Spammers often (always?) don&#8217;t use JavaScript, they just post the form with spammy data. Drawback for this method is that statistics say that about 1 percent of users has JavaScript disabled. Also, some websites have broken JavaScript, which might make the spamfilter break as well.</li>\n<li>Activation email for registering users. Users only get activated after clicking a link in an activation email. You still have all the non-activated users in your site however.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You could have a bright idea about combining several methods, but then you get the drawbacks of all the methods you use.</p>\n<p>Another complication of choosing a good plugin is that most antispam plugins don&#8217;t tell you what methods they use. The documentation doesn&#8217;t tell you, and looking at the source code just leaves you confused at the chaos that it often is.</p>\n<p>My main motivation for writing this plugin is to offer a plugin that does spamfiltering with JavaScript methods in a simple and effective way.<br />\nThe claimed 1 percent of users that has JavaScript disabled will also be tech-savy enough to enable it again for your website.</p>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ClassicPress</a>.</p>\n<h4>Contributions</h4>\n<p>This plugin is also available in <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/cyclotouriste/la-sentinelle-antispam\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Codeberg</a>.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Installation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Install the plugin through the admin page &#8220;Plugins&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, unpack and upload the contents of the zipfile to your &#8216;/wp-content/plugins/&#8217; directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>License</h4>\n<p>The plugin itself is released under the GNU General Public License. A copy of this license can be found at the license homepage or in the la-sentinelle.php file at the top.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20there%20no%20%22best%22%20or%20%22perfect%22%20antispam%20solution%3F'>\nWhy is there no &#8220;best&#8221; or &#8220;perfect&#8221; antispam solution?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Spam is a social problem, while antispam solutions are technical. There is no way that a technical solution to a social problem will have a 100% perfect match ratio on spam with a 0% perfect match ratio on real messages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20false%20positives'>\nI get false positives\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It could be that you have a JavaScript error. That way the spamfilters won&#8217;t work and all messages get flagged as spam.<br />\nYou could go to your form page, right click on the page, select &#8220;Inspect Element&#8221; &gt; Console-tab. Reload the page and see if there are errors in your console.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20am%20being%20targeted%20by%20a%20spammer'>\nI am being targeted by a spammer\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That is unfortunate. The default spamfilters in this plugin only protect against general spambots that are targeting any form on any website.<br />\nFirst thing you can do is enable the &#8216;Stop Forum Spam&#8217; spamfilter, that should help against most human spammers and targeted attacks, though only for default forms in WordPress Core.<br />\nIf that doesn&#8217;t help, I advise to add an extra plugin in the form of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/oopspam-anti-spam/\" rel=\"ugc\">OOPSpam</a>, that should provide a good defense against human spammers and targeted attacks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20spambots%20start%20running%20javascript%20code%3F'>\nWhat happens if spambots start running JavaScript code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That makes this plugin less valuable. It will be more expensive to them though, which in general makes it a good thing.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Short answer, there is no &#8220;best one&#8221;. No spamfilter and no method for spamfiltering is perfect.<br />\nSlightly longer answer, you could try about twenty and choose the one that fits your needs best.</p>\n<p>But there is also a really long answer.<br />\nThere are different methods that can be used against spam, and every method has its drawbacks.<br />\nIn my opinion, having a low number of false positives is more important than perfectly marking all spam, you don&#8217;t want to miss out on important people or information. Nagging the user in some way has a similar effect, the user might not even want to bother with that and just walk away.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third party services: Services like Akismet, OOPSpam, Stop Forum Spam and also reCAPTCHA offer third party services to check for spam. This can be very effective, but you are giving user submitted data away to these third parties and are also giving your users up for tracking them.</li>\n<li>Captcha&#8217;s, reCAPTCHA and Quizz Questions: You are annoying your users and probably sending some of them away. This especially counts for reCAPTCHA for visitors who have third party cookies disabled.</li>\n<li>Blacklists: Often running behind the facts. That goes for the way of getting users off that list, and also in getting users on that list.</li>\n<li>Referer check: check if the Referer header is set correctly. You can never trust it is set correctly. Modern browsers are limiting the use of Referers, though for now that is mostly for third-party domains.</li>\n<li>JavaScript methods: Spammers often (always?) don&#8217;t use JavaScript, they just post the form with spammy data. Drawback for this method is that statistics say that about 1 percent of users has JavaScript disabled. Also, some websites have broken JavaScript, which might make the spamfilter break as well.</li>\n<li>Activation email for registering users. Users only get activated after clicking a link in an activation email. You still have all the non-activated users in your site however.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You could have a bright idea about combining several methods, but then you get the drawbacks of all the methods you use.</p>\n<p>Another complication of choosing a good plugin is that most antispam plugins don&#8217;t tell you what methods they use. The documentation doesn&#8217;t tell you, and looking at the source code just leaves you confused at the chaos that it often is.</p>\n<p>My main motivation for writing this plugin is to offer a plugin that does spamfiltering with JavaScript methods in a simple and effective way.<br />\nThe claimed 1 percent of users that has JavaScript disabled will also be tech-savy enough to enable it again for your website.</p>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ClassicPress</a>.</p>\n<h4>Contributions</h4>\n<p>This plugin is also available in <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/cyclotouriste/la-sentinelle-antispam\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Codeberg</a>.</p>\n",
