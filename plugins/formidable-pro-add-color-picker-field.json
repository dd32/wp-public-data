For instance, when creating a recurring entry in a calendar, you might want the user to be able to select a color for their entry so it&#8217;s easy to see among others.</p>\n<p>Any time you want users to be able to select colors for elements, use a color picker field, and then insert the value of that field as a style attribute or an inline style in a view. You could even create a view that&#8217;s nothing but a style sheet with dynamic values from your form. The possibilities are endless, really.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is this so simple?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It fixes a simple problem.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have more than one Color Picker Field in a Form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What about more display options?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Those will come later.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
