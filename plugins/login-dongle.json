Upgrading from previous versions to 1.3.0 is done by automatically associating to each user<br />\na login dongle with the same challenge &gt;&gt; response as the one that was already site-wide set.</p>\n<p>This makes it possible to upgrade hassle free, even if your blog had other users. Anyway, if that<br />\nis not what you want, you can configure the login dongle of each user from the <em>Users/All Users</em><br />\nmenu.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>It&#8217;s not working. What&#8217;s the problem?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to fix any new bugs you find, but please try the last stable version, maybe it&#8217;s already fixed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prior to version 1.4.0\n<ul>\n<li>the Theme My Login plugin and the Login Dongle plugin didn&#8217;t work together. See below.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to version 1.2.2\n<ul>\n<li>the jQuery library was not made available on the login page.</li>\n<li>the dongle didn&#8217;t work with Get New Password button.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to version 1.2.1\n<ul>\n<li>a valid login could be rejected if the challenge or response contained quotes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to version 1.2.0\n<ul>\n<li>the dongle encoding was not compatible with a SmartPhone browser. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to version 1.1.0\n<ul>\n<li>the challenge could interfere with other login fields.</li>\n<li>the dongle bypassed possible plugins associated to the submit button.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to version 1.0.4\n<ul>\n<li>the dongle and the activation procedure didn&#8217;t work due to last minute bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prior to version 1.0.3\n<ul>\n<li>it was impossible to install the plugin due to its file structure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve lost my login dongle. How can I access my blog now?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you lost your login dongle, you can disable this plugin very easily.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Access your blog by means of your usual remote file manager, like an FTP client. </li>\n<li>Edit the <em>login-dongle.php</em> file in the <em>login-dongle</em> plugin directory. </li>\n<li>Comment the line <code>$loginDonglePlugin = new LoginDonglePlugin();</code> by adding // at the<br />\nbeginning. </li>\n<li>Save the file back to your site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This emergency procedure will make the default <em>Log In</em> button work again. After logging in,<br />\nundo what you did above, otherwise this plugin will be marked as Active while being inactive. Then<br />\nyou can deactivate it with the WordPress button or leave it working.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Login Dongle compatible with other login plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login Dongle does not touch any element of the standard login functionality (page, fields, buttons,<br />\nprocessing &#8230;) of WordPress, so you should be able to run this plugin alongside any other login<br />\nplugin, like the wonderful Limit Login Attempts plugin. If you find issues, feel free to contact me<br />\nand I&#8217;ll have a look.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-my-login/\" rel=\"ugc\">Theme My Login</a> (at least up to v6.2.2) is<br />\nnot comptible with Login Dongle out of the box. In Login Dongle v1.4.0 I added support for Theme My<br />\nLogin. Unfortunately, you need to add a missing line into the code of that plugin. In fact WP 3.2<br />\nintroduced the <em>login_init</em> hook (that I use) but Theme My Login lacks it. To fix Theme My Login<br />\nyou&#8217;ll need to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>edit the file *theme-my-login/includes/class-theme-my-login.php*.</li>\n<li>search for the text &#8216;login_form&#8217;. That line and the one before should read:<br />\n    // allow plugins to override the default actions, and to add extra actions if they want<br />\n    do_action( &#8216;login_form_&#8217; . $action );</li>\n<li>add a line in between, reading:<br />\n    do_action( &#8216;login_init&#8217; );</li>\n<li>save the file</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use Login Dongle instead of Limit Login Attempts (or the likes)?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I would not. Login Dongle is designed to work in conjunction with brute force attacks repellers<br />\nlike Limit Login Attempts and the likes.</p>\n<p>What those plugins do is to block access to internet users trying to log in but not being allowed<br />\nmany times in a row. When that occurs, the recorded intruder&#8217;s IP is used to reject their following<br />\nlogin requests during some time, even before matching their credentials against the database.</p>\n<p>What Login Dongle does is to cut off the processing of the login form if it does not have a special<br />\nfield (question) or if that field does not contain the special value (answer) stored in the<br />\ndatabase of your blog, even before running the repeller or any special authentication plugins.</p>\n<p>To save your precious resources (CPU time and web availability) when under attack, Login Dongle<br />\nsimply exits with a configurable message, instead of incurring into another page generation cycle.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use a simple answer for my question?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, because if someone stole your dongle, they are<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.goodsecurityquestions.com/designing.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">supposed</a> to not know the correct answer,<br />\nwhich is only stored in the database. If they guess it, they only gain the right to process the<br />\nlogin form on the server, but they still need to guess your unknown (and<br />\n<a href=\"http://supergenpass.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">strong</a>) password. That means that soon they will be locked out by your<br />\nbrute forse attack repeller.</p>\n<p>However, if you allow your browser to fill in your credentials automatically, and someone is going<br />\nto use your unattended PC, you easily realize that in this scenario all security relies on the<br />\nunguessability of the response. If you think that such a scenario is going to happen some time,<br />\nyou better setup a strong response.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Limit Login Attempts (or the likes) notified me about some attacks. What can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login Dongle makes a brute force attack impossible without knowing the correct challenge &gt;&gt;<br />\nresponse. Anyway, if a brute force attack repeller notifies you of an attack, you only need to edit<br />\nthe Login Dongle section of your Profile. Change both the challenge and response, and you&#8217;re done.<br />\nAs soon as you save your changes, the attack will immediately stop because Login Dongle will expect<br />\nthe new challenge &gt;&gt; response to be submitted along with the login form.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Limit Login Attempts (or the likes) notified me about some attacks. How can it be?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The chance to get notified of an attack after installing Login Dongle is extremely little.<br />\nIf it occurred it&#8217;d mean that <strong>both</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>they know the question because\n<ul>\n<li>either you told them </li>\n<li>or they got access to your login dongle at least once since you changed it the last time\n<ul>\n<li>either you sent your dongle to them </li>\n<li>or they got access to the PC where your dongle is</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>they know the answer because\n<ul>\n<li>either you told them</li>\n<li>or it&#8217;s easy to guess (knowing the question), like <em>Holmes</em> for <em>Sherlock</em>, </li>\n<li>or they brute force attacked your site to find it out (note that no protection exists against<br />\na brute force attack perpetrated by evil hackers)</li>\n<li>or they listened to your internet traffic (if it doesn&#8217;t go through a secure connection), </li>\n<li>or they kept recording each and every keystroke of yours\n<ul>\n<li>this means that the integrity of your digital persona is badly compromised.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use HTML tags into the message field?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use whatever you like, up to 1000 characters.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What characters can I use into the challenge and response fields?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use whatever you like, up to 20 characters. Even kanji.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
