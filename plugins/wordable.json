        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20wordable%3F'>\nWhat is Wordable?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wordable is a tool that instantly exports Google Doc files to a WordPress, HubSpot, or Medium post or page. We transform document elements into clean, fast HTML. We import, compress, and optimize images. We even work with tables and other special formatting. Wordable allows you to write in your favorite app and export it to your CMS as-is, without spending hours reformatting in clunky editors.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20was%20wordable%20created%3F'>\nWhy was Wordable created?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wordable was created out of personal frustration spending hours copy &amp; pasting from Google Docs into WordPress and manually uploading all those images, cleaning HTML, and more. We also believed there was a better way to export, format, and optimize content than spending thousands of dollars each month on people (read: manual labor) to do these tedious, soul-sucking, and recurring tasks.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20is%20wordable%20for%3F'>\nWho is Wordable for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;re honest. Wordable isn&#8217;t for everyone. If you only publish 1-2 articles per month, you probably don&#8217;t need us. If you publish more than 5 pieces per month, or publish across multiple sites, or work with a team of writers, then Wordable will save you hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20wordable%20save%20me%20time%20and%20money%3F'>\nHow does Wordable save me time and money?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Wordable will save you roughly ~30-60 minutes per article. (Assuming you&#8217;re properly cleaning HTML, optimizing and compressing images, and optimizing content like we do.) Wordable is also automating work that you or hired employees will need to do. So take the number of articles you&#8217;re publishing, times the number of hours saved, times the effective hourly rate, and you&#8217;ll quickly see a GIANT ROI. Here&#8217;s how to calculate your own ROI.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20connect%20wordable%20to%20my%20site%3F'>\nHow do I connect Wordable to my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WordPress websites will use our plugin to connect, while HubSpot and Medium only require a few simple clicks! If you run into any troubles, our team is standing by and ready to jump in to help get you connected ASAP.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20sites%20can%20i%20connect%20to%3F'>\nHow many sites can I connect to?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no limit! Srsly. Our larger plans can accommodate hundreds (if not thousands) of sites. If you fall into this category, reach out to us via support@wordable.io and we can set up a call to discuss your unique needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20work%20with%20google%20team%20drives%3F'>\nDo you work with Google Team Drives?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can connect team members, import documents from each other&#8217;s Drives, and collaborate across departments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20transfer%20my%20account%20to%20another%20email%20address%3F'>\nCan I transfer my account to another email address?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, no problem. Please email support@wordable.io and we&#8217;ll transfer it over for you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
