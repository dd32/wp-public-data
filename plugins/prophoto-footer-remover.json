        "faq": "\n<h4>Why are footer links bad for SEO?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In 2012, Google introduced an algorithm called Penguin. The idea was to take a hardline and penalize people that attempted to game Google by unnaturally linking to themselves. Among others, this included site-wide footer links. This doesn&#8217;t only affect the site being linked to, but can also impact the site doint the actual linking.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>We really like ProPhoto. Why can&#8217;t we credit them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Many photographers really like the theme, and crediting them is not the problem. This plugin is designed to have them understand that they should be following Google&#8217;s Best Practices.<br />\nIt should also be pointed out that (even though ProPhoto sells outside of the WordPress licensing) it does go against WordPress&#8217;s guidelines to leave footer links in themes without a method of removing them freely.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What should ProPhoto do to fix this problem?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, they should reconsider holding people hostage by charging them $99 to remove a footer credit. This should be a free option, giving people the right to choose to promote them or not.</p>\n<p>Second, they should recode their footer text to contain &#8220;rel=NoFollow&#8221; so they do not violate Google&#8217;s guidelines on manipulating Page Rank.</p>\n<p>If they make these patches for versions 3, 4 and 5, we could consider this a success and take down this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
