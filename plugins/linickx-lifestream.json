        "description": "<p>LINICKX LifeStream is a plugin which allows you to lifestream any feed. Simply load up your RSS feeds into the plugin and posts will be created in wordpress.</p>\n<p>A new post is created for each lifestream entry you can then use standard WordPress themes &amp; plug-ins to customize these posts anyway you like.</p>\n",

        "faq": "<h4>How often are feeds checked ?</h4>\n<p>By default every 5 minutes, but you can change that.</p>\n<h4>Some users experience slowness on my website!</h4>\n<p>By default at the end of the 5minute period the next user to visit your site kicks off a &#8220;feed check&#8221; for that user it can take some time for your site to load as they have to wait for this to complete. Don&#8217;t worry tho&#8217;, by enabling <em>cron mode</em> you can fix this.</p>\n<h4>What is Cron Mode ?</h4>\n<p>You can configure Unix Cron to update your feeds, in the  WordPress dashboard, Settings -&gt; Lifestream, enable Cron updating, then configure cron to download http://you.com/WordPress/wp-content/linickx-lifestream/run.php</p>\n<h4>How do I configure Cron to update my Feeds ?</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got a file called <em>linickx-lifestream</em> in /etc/cron.d with this in it&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>*/5 * * * * nick wget -q --spider http://www.linickx.com/wp-content/plugins/linickx-lifestream/run.php </code></pre>\n<p>your mileage may vary tho.</p>\n<h4>What is the &#8220;Database Size / Expiry&#8221; option ?</h4>\n<p>LINICKX LifeStream downloads your feeds and saves them to a database, you get to decide how much is stored</p>\n<h4>Where is the Feed Database ?</h4>\n<p>By default it goes into WordPress, but if you have lots of big feeds this could slow things down. To speed things up, change to a <em>file</em> database, <strong>make sure wp-content is writable</strong> and you&#8217;ll see your feeds saved in <code>lnx_lifestream_feeddb.txt</code> get created.</p>\n<h4>What does &#8220;To Use Cron Updating you must create config.php, see FAQ or Config.Sample.php for more details&#8221; Mean?</h4>\n<p>If you want to run linickx-lifestream from cron then the plugin needs to know how to find WordPress. To find WordPress the plugin looks for config.php in ~/wp-content/linickx-lifestream , with the package there is an example config.sample.php. Rename config.sample.php to config.php and change the variable $WPDIR to where your wordpress is instlled, there are a couple of examples in there.</p>\n<h4>What is the Post Fail-Safe ?</h4>\n<p>Version 0.1.x had a frustrating double-post bug where by some feed items would not be saved in the feed DB thus be posted to WP multiple times. I cannot work out if this is a Bug in my plugin, wordpress, simplepie or even PHP so I cam up with this fail-safe mechanism. As of 0.2 Lifestream posts will be created with some meta_data in a key called <code>lnx_lifestream_id</code> if a feed ID matches this key then a new post will not be created.</p>\n<h4>Can the Post Fail-Safe be overridden?</h4>\n<p>Just like in your fav action movie there is a manual override where by you can force these skipped posts to be created. You will need to be using Cron mode and web-broswe to domain.com/wp-content/plugins/linickx-lifestream/run.php?fsoverride=1 &#8230; remember to see what cron mode is doing enable the <code>Verbose</code> option in the dashboard.</p>\n<h4>Can I post the Full Content, not just links?</h4>\n<p>What you need is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedwordpress/\" title=\"FeedWordPress by Charles Johnson\" rel=\"ugc\">FeedWordPress</a> ðŸ˜‰</p>\n",
