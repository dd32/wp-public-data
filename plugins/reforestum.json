For each project or category you will be asked to provide the amount of CO2 and also -optionally- the amount of CO2 for the shipping of your physical products.</p>\n<h4>TYPES OF PROJECTS</h4>\n<p>Upon availability, Reforestum’s marketplace will offer several projects to pick up from. The projects are divided in 2 different categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conservation projects: We select the best VCS certified projects from around the world. Your clients will then be able to purchase carbon credits to offset the goods they are buying.</li>\n<li>Reforestation projects: These types of reforestation projects are developed by Reforestum’s team and officially certified by the local governments (see the description of each project in our marketplace for further information). Your clients will be able to acquire forest shares.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In both cases, once the offset has been executed, your client will receive an email to activate their account in Reforestum’s marketplace so that they can keep track of their carbon credits or forest shares.</p>\n<p>Notice it&#8217;s your responsibility as a merchant, and accordingly to your local confidentiality legislation, to ask your customer consent so that Reforestum can receive your user´s Name and Email for the assignment of the carbon credit or forest shares. Typically, this will imply that you need to update the terms of the service of your e-shop.</p>\n",
