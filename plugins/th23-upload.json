This plugin allows you to disable this default and replace it with a setting accessible via the admin options.</p>\n<p>This plugin additionally allows a customized suffix for resized images, compared to the unchangeable default &#8220;-scaled&#8221; suffix.</p>\n<p>Also the plugin can prevent creation of additional intermediate sizes of all uploaded images, which due to their dimensions of 1536px and 2048px would be taking up much additional space on your webserver.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat is the ideal image to use as a watermark?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should use a PNG image as watermark with transparent background. Try it out locally over various backgrounds/ images &#8211; light ones as well as darker ones.</p>\n<p>The size depends largely on the size of your images to be marked. You can save a larger copy of the watermark PNG and limit the maximum space to cover via the plugin options. Make sure your watermark is still readable/ visible also when scaled down.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy can only JPG / JPEG images be watermarked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simple answer: Most images used in the internet are in the JPG format. Watermarking JPG images should meet most users needs.</p>\n<p>Technical answer: Other image formats can contain information and have special characteristics making their handling very tricky and error-prone. For example: PNG files can contain transparency levels, additionally they can be animated. Similar for GIF images.</p>\n<p>Honest answer: To limit complexity of the plugin ðŸ˜‰</p>\n</p>\n\n",
