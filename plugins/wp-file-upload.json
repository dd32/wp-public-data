        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20work%20in%20a%20mobile%20browser%3F'>\nWill the plugin work in a mobile browser?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugins will work in most mobile phones (has been tested in iOS, Android and Symbian browsers as well as Opera Mobile)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20have%20flash%20to%20use%20then%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need to have Flash to use then plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you do not need Flash to use the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20a%20safe%20mode%20restriction%20error%20when%20i%20try%20to%20upload%20a%20file.%20is%20there%20an%20alternative%3F'>\nI get a SAFE MODE restriction error when I try to upload a file. Is there an alternative?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your domain has probably turned SAFE MODE ON and you have restrictions uploading and accessing files. WordPress File Upload includes an alternative way to upload files, using FTP access. Simply add the attribute <strong>accessmethod=&#8221;ftp&#8221;</strong> inside the shortcode, together with FTP access information in <strong>ftpinfo</strong> attribute.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20the%20progress%20of%20the%20upload%3F'>\nCan I see the progress of the upload?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can see the progress of the upload. During uploading a progress bar will appear showing progress info, however this functionality functions only in browsers supporting HTML5 upload progress bar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20upload%20many%20files%20at%20the%20same%20time%3F'>\nCan I upload many files at the same time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, but not in the free version. If you want to allow multiple file uploads, please consider the <a href=\"http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/\" title=\"Wordpress File Upload support page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Professional</a> version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20files%20go%20after%20upload%3F'>\nWhere do files go after upload?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Files by default are uploaded inside wp-content directory of your WordPress website. To change it use attribute uploadpath.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20and%20download%20the%20uploaded%20files%3F'>\nCan I see and download the uploaded files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Administrators can view all uploaded files together with associated field data from the plugin&#8217;s Settings in Dashboard. The <a href=\"http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/\" title=\"Wordpress File Upload support page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Professional</a> version of the plugin allows users to view their uploaded files, either from the Dashboard, or from a page or post.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20filters%20to%20restrict%20uploaded%20content%3F'>\nAre there filters to restrict uploaded content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can control allowed file size and file extensions by using the appropriate attribute (see Other Notes section).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20upload%20file%20size%20limitations%3F'>\nAre there any upload file size limitations?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there are file size limitations imposed by the web server or the host. If you want to upload very large files, please consider the <a href=\"http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/\" title=\"Wordpress File Upload support page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Professional</a> version of the plugin, which surpasses size limitations.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20can%20upload%20files%3F'>\nWho can upload files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default all users can upload files. You can define which user roles are allowed to upload files. Even guests can be allowed to upload files. If you want to allow only specific users to upload files, then please consider the <a href=\"http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/\" title=\"Wordpress File Upload support page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Professional</a> version of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20security%20is%20used%20for%20uploading%20files%3F'>\nWhat security is used for uploading files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is designed not to expose website sensitive information. It has been tested by experts and verified that protects against CSRF and XSS attacks. All parameters passing from server to client side are encoded and sanitized. For higher protection, like use of captcha, please consider the <a href=\"http://www.iptanus.com/support/wordpress-file-upload/\" title=\"Wordpress File Upload support page\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Professional</a> version of the plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20connection%20is%20lost%20during%20a%20file%20upload%3F'>\nWhat happens if connection is lost during a file upload?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the free version the upload will fail. However in the Pro version the upload will resume and will continue until the file is fully uploaded. This is especially useful when uploading very large files.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20plugin%20does%20not%20look%20nice%20with%20my%20theme.%20what%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nThe plugin does not look nice with my theme. What can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an option in plugin&#8217;s settings in Dashboard to relax the CSS rules, so that buttons and text boxes inherit the theme&#8217;s styles. If additional styling is required, this can be done using CSS. The Professional version of the plugin allows CSS rules to be embed in the shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
