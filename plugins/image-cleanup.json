If yes, chances are that your content folder is full of unused and unreferenced images. These image leftovers will remain cluttering your content folder until the end of days.</p>\n<p>Image Cleanup will index these (and many more) unreferenced images. Unreferenced images are not indexed in the wordpress database and also not used by posts, scripts or backup restore meta data. Please note that images which have valid database metadata but are not used in posts are not indexed at this time. This is beyond the scope of this plugin.</p>\n<p>Image Cleanup will also find images without meta data and images with incorrect meta data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save space taken up by unreferenced/backup images!</li>\n<li>Fix incorrect metadata (sizes)</li>\n<li>Bulk repair/delete functionality</li>\n<li>Pagination for extremely large result sets</li>\n<li>Logs tabs easily visible for reviewing!</li>\n<li>Detailed information in log tabs!</li>\n<li>Full restore functionality!</li>\n<li>Especially useful for developers!</li>\n<li>Written as class to avoid any conflicts!</li>\n<li>Highly configurable to avoid memory and/or timeouts on some setups</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>On my one month old website with 50 files (and 250 attachment size variants) this plugin found 95 unreferenced images which I could remove without any conflicts.</em></p>\n<p><em>There has been a reported case where this plugin indexed and removed over 23.000 images on a website.

You could also check the logs in the ../wp-content/uploads/image-cleanup/ID/logs folder for full information about the index.</p>\n<p>If any problems are found you can revert the move of images by restoring them to their original locations.</p>\n<p>When no problems arrise after moving the images to another location it is possible to permanently remove the images.</p>\n<h4>Future planned additions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Index unused valid images </li>\n<li>Index missing image sizes (and option to generate missing images)</li>\n<li>Index missing images which are used in posts</li>\n</ul>\n",

Only after the move of images an permanently delete option will be available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I revert back to previous state?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can! Full restore functionality is present.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if the index is not finishing?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It might take a while for the plugin to index all the files. Please give it enough time to run!</p>\n<p>If the index is returning an error this will be clearly visible. An bold red text will appear with a link to the debug log. Please send me this and the other logs.</p>\n<p>If your image base is huge (50.000 or more images) you might want to exclude some parts of the image paths and work your way from year to year.</p>\n<p>For example: exclude all folders which have the text &#8216;/2010/&#8217;, &#8216;/2011/&#8217; etc. Do not remove the &#8216;/&#8217; slashes because without it will also remove filesnames containing &#8216;2010&#8217;. Scan only one year by excluding all the others.</p>\n<p>Then, after the index is done and you removed the images you are able to index other years of the content folder.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Did you get any help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, I would like to say thank you to: Kelly Rosal and Tali Walt for letting me test and debug the plugin on their websites. Their websites were very though to run a full index through and because of that I had to optimize the plugin a lot!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
