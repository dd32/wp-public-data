        "faq": "\n<h4>Is this plugin built/sponsored by IMAGELY &#8211; the author of NextGEN Gallery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, Assistant for NextGEN Gallery has no affiliation with IMAGELY.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the desktop app free to use?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the desktop app is a SaaS (Software as a Service) program that requires a small annual subscription fee. A free, no risk trial version is available.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you delete images or write images to disk?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, your images and disk are safe. Processed images are held in memory and not written to disk.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does image processing/upload times compare to NextGEN Gallery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;re WAY faster.</p>\n<p>For example, upload 100 images (total size 428.6MB), resizing to 1200&#215;1200 with jpg quality of 83%, no backup image. Images are dropped on the upload area.</p>\n<p>Desktop system &#8211; windows 10 &#8211; i7-3520M &#8211; 16GB memory &#8211; SSD<br />\nWeb server &#8211; StableHost.com starter system &#8211; 1 CPU &#8211; 2GB memory<br />\nmax_file_uploads: 50 upload_max_filesize: 400M post_max_size: 400M</p>\n<p>Assistant for NextGEN Gallery total time to upload &#8211; 16 seconds.<br />\nNextGEN Gallery total time to upload &#8211; 10 minutes 22 seconds.<br />\nWe&#8217;re <strong>39 times</strong> faster.</p>\n<p>Another upload with the previous setup but we add a watermark to the images.</p>\n<p>Assistant for NextGEN Gallery total time &#8211; 25 seconds.<br />\nNextGEN Gallery total time &#8211; 13 minutes 23 seconds.<br />\nWe&#8217;re <strong>32 times</strong> faster.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any benefits if I have already resized/optimized my images?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, use the &#8220;Just Upload&#8221; feature when uploading your images. Image thumbnails are created on your desktop system and uploaded to the gallery. This reduces your web server&#8217;s load and decreases your overall image upload time. Depending on your workflow, uploads times can be greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>For example, upload 149 images (total size 24MB), no resize and no backup image. The folder containing the images is dropped on the upload area.</p>\n<p>Desktop system &#8211; windows 10 &#8211; i7-3520M &#8211; 16GB memory &#8211; SSD<br />\nWeb server &#8211; StableHost.com starter system &#8211; 1 CPU &#8211; 2GB memory<br />\nmax_file_uploads: 50 upload_max_filesize: 400M post_max_size: 400M</p>\n<p>Assistant for NextGEN Gallery total upload time &#8211; 16 seconds.<br />\nNextGEN Gallery total upload time &#8211; 7 minutes 12 seconds.<br />\nWe&#8217;re <strong>25 times</strong> faster.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There are a lot of other plugins that optimize images, why should I use Assistant for NextGEN Gallery?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Moving all the image processing from your web server to your desktop reduces your web server load. Other solutions add additional web server load. Gallery thumbnails are also created on your desktop system which also reduces web server load. </p>\n<p>Also, our uploader will upload any size file even if it exceeds your server&#8217;s file size limit.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are my uploads slow?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your web hosting service could be limiting your upload speed or a plugin is limiting/disabling the uploads. As a test, disable all unneeded plugin and try your uploads. If you&#8217;re using the Wordfence plugin, as a test, try disabling all &#8220;file_upload&#8221; rules in the plugin&#8217;s firewall rules page http://yourwebsiteaddress.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=WordfenceWAF&amp;subpage=waf_options. You&#8217;ll need to click on &#8220;SHOW ALL RULES&#8221; to see all the plugin&#8217;s rules.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
