        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20many%20users%20can%20join%20my%20chat%3F'>\nHow many users can join my chat?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Up to 20 users can connect at once on the Free tier. If you expect more users, you can consider subscribing to a monthly or annual subscription.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20background%20or%20colors%3F'>\nCan I change the background or colors?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.
