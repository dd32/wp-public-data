        "installation": "<p>AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION<br />\nAutomatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Cryptothanks, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click “Add New”.<br />\nIn the search field type “cryptothanks” and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<p>MANUAL INSTALLATION<br />\nThe manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here: https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation</p>\n<p>UPDATING<br />\nAutomatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",
