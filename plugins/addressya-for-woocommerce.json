        "description": "<p>WooCommerce is a plugin that turns any WordPress site into a powerful e-commerce platform. With 3.8 million users, WooCommerce is one of the leading open-source e-commerce tools available. Addressya has created a plugin for WooCommerce to give e-commerce companies access to precise delivery locations enriched with pictures and directions provided by the Addressya user.</p>\n<p>Addressya also provides shoppers with a smoother checkout process on your site with the one field address checkout and simplified driver dispatch for more efficient home deliveries. For ecommerce platforms which provide credits or allow users to purchase products on credits, Addressya provides an easy platform which keeps a track of their end user’s address based on their contract duration.</p>\n<p>The Addressya for WooCommerce plugin can only be activated when the business has already installed WooCommerce to its site.</p>\n<h3>Features and Admin Functions</h3>\n<p>When a shopper enters their Addressya information, they receive a one-time password (OTP) in the app to authenticate that they are the ones giving access to their address. This security check ensures that the user’s address information is only shared by them. Users with multiple addresses can select the address they want to share in the Addressya app. Once given access, the Addressya user’s address information appears in the backend of the WooCommerce admin panel. If an order needs to be processed manually from the admin panel, you can also input the customer’s Addressya username and their address will show after permission is given.</p>\n<p>For websites which sells products on credit or just provide credit, there is an option in Addressya settings module to turn that functionality “ON”. The applicant has to add Addressya username, select the delivery address and verify the OTP like the usual checkout flow &amp; add their employer’s details also. After placing the order, the admin will review the applicant’s application and approve the credit request after checking the address score of the addresses provided by the applicant. If the approver is satisfied with the score the approver can add contract&#8217;s start &amp; end dates or reject the application. The debtor will receive a monthly notification to confirm their home address. If there&#8217;s a change then they are asked to update the address. A monthly report will be sent to the website owner alongwith the location updates of all the debtors so that they can keep a track of their location and can easily recover their money.</p>\n<p>The plugin functionalities can be controlled from the admin panel under “Addressya” menu. In Addressya Settings there are options to turn on/off Driver, Vehicle and Credit modules based on usage. The plugin also allows for a simplified process of managing deliveries where the admin first adds vehicles and assigns drivers to them. After adding the drivers, the admin can assign orders to drivers and share the customer location with one step. The driver can access this on the Addressya Android app or web app using any browser and view directions that will take them right to the customer location. The result is a seamless process for the customer who is ordering online from checkout to delivery. For the Credit module after the application is submitted, they are visible in the Applications module where the Admin approves/rejects the application which ends up in Orders after approval.</p>\n<p>Becoming more precise with address collection increases the time of delivery, reduces costs and makes customers happier with the experience of using your platform.</p>\n"
