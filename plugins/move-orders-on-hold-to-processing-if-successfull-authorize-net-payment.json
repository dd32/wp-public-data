Basically an issue comes up if someone orders with a payment type other than CC that puts the order on hold and then the person decides to pay with credit card. Even if the CC is successful the order stays as on hold because the plugin doesn&#8217;t change the order status. They have also seen cases where the person attempts a CC, it fails so its put on hold, they use another card and that is successful but it stays on hold.</p>\n<p>Move orders on-hold to processing if successful authorize.net payment. Cron job rans every 5 minutes and check on-hold orders to see if there any successful payment from Authorize.net. If yes change the order status to processing from on-hold.</p>\n",
