        "faq": "<p>What Is IDX?</p>\n<p>IDX stand for Integrated Data Exchange, simply put, we get raw listing data directly from the MLS and then we are able to develop this information in an easy to use and agent branding user interface. Your Users can search all the listings in your MLS and your photo and phone number is on EVERY listing regardless of who listed the property. IDX is the heart and soul of every real estate website.</p>\n<p>Will the Plugin work once I download and install it?</p>\n<p>There are two steps for activation, first you will need to purchase your purchase our Premium IDX 123 System from our website: www.realtytech.com/order-form which will give you the authorization code and will automatically send you the paperwork needed for your MLS. IDX data can only go to a Member of that MLS.  From this point you can add the pages and widgets to your website but there will be no listing data. Once your MLS board has approved the paperwork then your data will be activated and you are in business!</p>\n<p>Is your IDX index-able for SEO?</p>\n<p>Yes, the RealtyTech Word Press IDX Plugin is completely Indexed on Google or searchable by the search engines themselves, where each listing will create a page that can be optimized to improve your websites presence and placement online! More online listings means more leads for you!</p>\n<p>Will this Plugin work on mobile?</p>\n<p>The IDX itself is completely responsive to all device types, including phones.  So as long as your Word Press template is also responsive you wont have any loss of tools or information. If your website is not mobile responsive let us know as we do have different options to assist you.</p>\n<p>Does your IDX come with lead capture functionalities?</p>\n<p>Yes, this is one of the most important aspects of the IDX, on each listing there are sections to schedule a showing, get more information on this listing save a listing, save a search, request automated listing alerts, add to favorites, etc. In addition to this you can setup rules for how many searches and listing details a user can view before being required to sign up for an account on your IDX.
