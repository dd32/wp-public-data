        "faq": "<p>Q: What does this WooCommerce Freight Extension do?</p>\n<p>A: It calculates the cheapest freight for your customers based on the weight and size of the combined products in their shopping cart.</p>\n<p>Q: Do you need WooCommerce installed for this WooCommerce Freight Extension to work?</p>\n<p>A: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q: Will this WooCommerce Freight Extension work for carts located outside Australia?</p>\n<p>A: No. The WooCommerce Freight Extension is specifically developed for Australian based businesses. However, the freight can be send worldwide.</p>\n<p>Q: Why is the WooCommerce Freight Extension better than the Australian Post plugin?</p>\n<p>A: The Australian Post plugin is great but it only uses services from 1 supplier &#8211; Australian Post (no surprises there). The WooCommerce Freight Extension on the other hand was commissioned by a prominent Australian eCommerce business with only one thing in mind; don&#039;t maximise Aus Post&#039;s profits but reduce my customers freight charges! So we did. WooCommerce Freight Extension uses Australian Post as well as a range of well known courier companies to find the cheapest freight quote in Australia. This simply means your customers will pay less for freight.</p>\n<p>Q: Is Woo Aus EZi Freight fully customisable?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. There are lots of variables you can customise such as unlimited types of boxes, tax rates, the &#8220;Freight Method Title&#8221; so you can brand your freight, additional packaging days, additional handling cost, maximum shipping services limit to display and much more.</p>\n<p>Q: Do I need to open any accounts?</p>\n<p>A: Yes. To take full advantage of the WooCommerce Freight Extension, you need to open an account with Australian Click and Send (FREE) and InterParcel (FREE).</p>\n<p>Q: What is the difference between the free version of WooCommerce Freight Extension and the paid version?</p>\n<p>A: First, there is no difference in functionality. The only difference is that the free version will display a little link in your client&#039;s shopping cart saying: &#8220;This plugin is not Licensed, please visit EZiHosting to active your plugin!&#8221;. Annoying, I know but we put a lot of effort into developing this extension and we like to recover some of the cost we incurred. Also, the Free trial version of the WooCommerce Freight Extension doesn&#039;t come with any updates or support. So please don&#039;t delay and obtain your license key and activate it so together we can eliminate world poverty.</p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The quickest method for installing Woo Aus EZi Freight is:<br />\nIn WordPress back-end Visit Plugins -&gt; Add New -&gt; Search for \\&#8221;Woo Aus EZi Freight\\&#8221;<br />\nClick \\&#8221;Install Now\\&#8221;<br />\nClick \\&#8221;Activate Plugin\\&#8221;<br />\nGo to the WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; Shipping -&gt; Woo Aus EZi Freight<br />\nYou are then ready to customise the plugin</p>\n<p>If you would prefer to do things manually then follow these instructions:</p>\n<p>Upload the Woo Aus EZi Freight folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory<br />\nActivate the plugin through the \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; menu in WordPress<br />\nGo to the WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; Shipping -&gt; Woo Aus EZi Freight<br />\nYou are then ready to customise the plugin</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcunvJuuik4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
