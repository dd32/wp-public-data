        "description": "<p>Watchful is a web developers toolbox for remotely managing and monitoring multiple WordPress websites. Simply add all your production and staging sites into the <a href=\"https://watchful.net\" title=\"Manage multiple WordPress websites\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Watchful Dashboard</a> and use our tools to monitor uptime, backups, updates to WordPress and core and plugins, and more. You&#8217;ll be amazed at how much time and money you save managing your WordPress sites with Watchful.</p>\n<h4>Top Features at-a-glance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Backup scheduler and monitor</li>\n<li>Powerful plugin updates, including auto updates</li>\n<li>Uptime monitor &amp; SSL certificate checker</li>\n<li>Best practice, malware, and filesystem scanners</li>\n<li>Early warning system for intruder detection</li>\n<li>SEO audit tool</li>\n<li>Plugin tracker to monitor when plugins have been added and removed</li>\n<li>Google Analytics integration</li>\n<li>Website reporting for your clients</li>\n<li>Customizable dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://app.watchful.net/free-trial.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Free Trial</a> will let you test up to 5 sites at once to see how much. You won&#8217;t believe how much time you&#8217;ll save!</p>\n<h3>Customizable Dashboard</h3>\n<p>With your entire portfolio of websites in a single dashboard, you can easily review and prioritize website maintenance tasks. Sort by core version, number of pending updates, backup date, tags and more to optimize Watchful to your workflow.</p>\n<h3>Powerful Update Technology</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to protect your websites is to keep WordPress and all of its plugins up-to-date. With Watchful, you can apply updates across your entire portfolio in just one click. Supported updates include WordPress, all of the plugins in the WordPress repo, as well as a growing list of the most popular paid plugins. You can even manage your commercial license keys and remotely register new domains with commercial WordPress software vendors.</p>\n<h3>Best Practice Scanner</h3>\n<p>The Site Audit is a best practice scanner that checks your site for security best-practices, hacked or modified core files, and malware. If any problems are detected, advice and/or simple tools are provided to help fix any issues.</p>\n<h3>SEO Audit</h3>\n<p>Be sure that the technical aspects of your website are properly configured with the SEO Audit. The audit detects problems such as broken links, missing sitemaps, and content relevance — and recommends fixes — to ensure that your site is performing at it&#8217;s very best when indexed by search engines.</p>\n<h3>Plugin &amp; Extension Tracker</h3>\n<p>The Plugin &amp; Extension Tracker allows you to easily browse all of the WordPress plugins added to your website and logs any changes for unexpected modifications. By correlating the dates of plugin installation/upgrade to any bugs that arise on your sites, this logging feature greatly improves the troubleshooting process. The tracker also integrates with our system-wide search tools. This makes it fast and easy to locate all of your sites with specific plugins — and even a specific version of a plugin — so that maintenance tasks such as addressing zero-day security issues can be applied quickly and efficiently to only the sites that need them.</p>\n<h3>Uptime Monitoring</h3>\n<p>The Uptime Monitor checks your sites every minute of every day to make sure it is online. If your site cannot be reached, a notification is sent and the problem recorded. The monitor displays the last 10 uptime/downtime events and calculates the percentage uptime for the last day, 7 days, 30 days, and throughout the lifetime of your site. This information can be included in your white-label reports (see below).</p>\n<h3>Google Analytics integration</h3>\n<p>The Google Analytics integration allows you to instantly get an overview of your website traffic, visitors, most viewed pages, top referral sources, and most commonly searched for keywords. This information can be included in your white-label reports (see below).</p>\n<h3>White-label Reports</h3>\n<p>Our white-label reporting tool makes it easy to generate reports for your clients. Reports can be generated on a per-site basis, or based on tags, giving you a lot of flexibility in the report contents. Each report contains data on website uptime, Google Analytics, and logs for the indicated time period showing software updates and other site activity. These great looking reports can be sent to your client(s) to showcase the value of your services.</p>\n<h3>There’s More!</h3>\n<p>Watchful has lots more features and tools and is adding more functionality regularly.
