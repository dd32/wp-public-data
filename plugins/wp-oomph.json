How come?</h4>\n<p>First, view the source of your WordPress-generated page and make sure you see a line similar to the following near the top:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://visitmix.com/labs/oomph/1.0/Client/oomph.min.js?ver=1.0'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>If you see that but there&#8217;s still nothing different about your page, then you probably don&#8217;t have any (valid) microformats. You might consider <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/tags/microformats\" title=\"Check out the various WordPress themes that support microformats out of the box!\" rel=\"ugc\">switching to a WordPress theme with built-in microformat support</a>, or modifying your theme&#8217;s code to add some of your own. You can <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">learn more about the support WordPress offers for microformats in the Microformat wiki</a>.</p>\n<h4>The plugin doesn&#8217;t let me do X thing that I want to do! Why not?</h4>\n<p>Most likely because I haven&#8217;t taken <em>X thing</em> into account. Sorry, I&#8217;m not a psychic (as much as I wish I were). However, you&#8217;re encouraged to leave a comment on plugin homepage or to contact me elsewhere to request that I add capabilities to the plugin. Better yet, if you&#8217;re comfortable doing so, send me or the <a href=\"http://visitmix.com/Lab/Oomph\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fine guys who wrote Oomph</a> a patch.</p>\n",
