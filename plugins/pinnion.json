        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get started with your<br />\nfirst Pinnion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>pinnion.zip</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>In your web browser, create an account at <a href=\"https://secure.pinnion.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">secure.pinnion.com</a>.</li>\n<li>Return to WordPress and locate Pinnion in the administration menu<br />\n(left-side menu)</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Settings&#8221; and enter the credentials that you created in step 3 </li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Editor&#8221; and login with the same credentials.

        "faq": "\n<h4>WordPress, Web, and Mobile</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>Is this only for my blog?</strong><br />\nNo. Pinnion is designed to work on any device, through many different distribution methods. Each Pinnion that you create can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posted to your WordPress sidebars via the Pinnion widget</li>\n<li>Embedded into any WordPress post or page via the Insert Pinnion button</li>\n<li>Embedded into non-WordPress web pages via the iFrame embed code</li>\n<li>Distributed through email, Facebook, Twitter, etc. via the Direct Link</li>\n<li>Viewed in a mobile web browser via the Direct Link</li>\n<li>Viewed on all smartphones via the Pinnion apps for iOS and Android, or from any web link thanks to our device auto detection technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The responses that you receive from all of these sources are combined into a<br />\nsingle set of results that can be viewed from within the plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I login to my Pinnion account from outside of WordPress?</strong><br />\nYes, at <a href=\"https://secure.pinnion.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://secure.pinnion.com</a>. We recommend<br />\nvisiting this site first to create your account. Afterwards, you can choose to<br />\naccess your account via the WordPress plugin or directly via<br />\nhttps://secure.pinnion.com. You will have the same experience and<br />\nfunctionality either way.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Creating Pinnions</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>I want to have an &#8220;other&#8221; option. How do I handle this?</strong><br />\nThis is possible to do by using the question branching (aka skip logic)<br />\ncapabilities of Pinnion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an answer option for &#8220;Other&#8221;</li>\n<li>Add Another Question and click &#8220;Advanced View&#8221;</li>\n<li>Set &#8220;Prerequisite Responses&#8221; to &#8220;any&#8221;</li>\n<li>Choose the prior question from the list and then check &#8220;Other&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyone who answers the previous question with &#8220;Other&#8221; will be able to type in<br />\nhis/her answer on this screen. Anyone who selected a different option will<br />\nskip this screen and go on to the next question.</p>\n<p><strong>What question/answer types are available?</strong><br />\nPinnion has six basic layouts available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkbox/Radio, ideal for answer options with lots of text. Single select questions automatically have Radio Buttons, while Multi-select questions show Checkboxes.</li>\n<li>Buttons, both full width and in a narrower coulmn format.</li>\n<li>Picker, Shown as a picker-wheel when a touch enabled device is detected, and as a drop-down when viewed on a computer with a mouse or trac-pad interface.</li>\n<li>Sliding Scale, ideal for ratings, set as many points as you wish.</li>\n<li>Open response, for situations when a typed response is necessary we support full-open, numeric only, URL entry, and Email entry types.</li>\n<li>Image Select, simply click on, or touch an image to select.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All answer types can be set as Required or Not Required.  Checkboxes and<br />\nButtons can be set as Single Select or Multi-Select (with options for min and<br />\nmax answer selections). Images can be included for each Channel, Pinnion,<br />\nQuestion, and Answer option.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Channels</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>What is a Channel?</strong><br />\nChannels are the main distribution and discovery method for Pinnions. You can<br />\ncreate as many channels as you like and distribute each Pinnion to one or<br />\nmultiple channels. If you set-up the Pinnion Plugin to use a Channel instead<br />\nof an individual Pinnion, then the plugin will always display the most-current<br />\nPinnion that has been assigned to that Channel. For instance, you might have<br />\none channel for your blog sidebar and another for the pages of your site. You<br />\ncould create some Pinnions that are only distributed to one channel or the<br />\nother and some Pinnions that are distributed to both channels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users will need to have the name of your channel in order to take your<br />\nPinnions using the iOS or Android apps. Once they are subscribed to your Channel, they will be notified whenever a new Pinnion is available. </li>\n<li>Each Channel also has its own webpage at</li>\n<li>secure.pinnion.com/(channelname).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How do I distribute my Pinnion to a Channel?</strong><br />\nStart by creating the Channels that you wish to have. You simply give your<br />\nchannel a name and decide whether or not a password should be required to join<br />\nthe Channel. Then, create a new Pinnion and<br />\nauthor the questions and answers. Proceed to the Include tab, where you can<br />\nselect one or more Channels for the Pinnion. Finally, you&#8217;ll use the distribution tab to select the day and time<br />\nfor your Pinnion to be distributed, along with an expiration. The Pinnion will<br />\nbe distributed to the appropriate channels at the time that you indicate.</p>\n<p>View the <a href=\"http://www.pinnion.com/help-and-resources/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pinnion resources</a> page for more<br />\ninformation.</p>\n<p><strong>When should I show the results to respondents?</strong><br />\nThe following options are available for displaying results to your<br />\nrespondents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not display results</li>\n<li>Display results only at the end (after the respondent has submitted his or her Pinnion)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may wish to suppress the results if your<br />\nPinnion deals with sensitive information or if you are simply trying to build<br />\nsuspense (say, at an event where you wish to announce all of the results at a<br />\nlater session). Showing results at the end of a Pinnion may be<br />\nuseful in &#8220;before-and-after&#8221; or pre-test/post-test scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I download results?</strong><br />\nResults download is not available for free accounts. Contact us to learn more about how we can enable this feature for you. We offer many easy to use exports including CSV for use in Excel, and custom reports designed to suit your exact needs.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Etc.</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;ve lost my password.</strong><br />\nVisit our <a href=\"https://secure.pinnion.com/pepl/resetPassword.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reset password</a><br />\npage and enter your email address. A reset link will be emailed to you. Note:<br />\nthe password reset process will take place in your web browser, but outside of<br />\nWordPress.</p>\n<p><strong>What is structured communication?</strong><br />\nIn a nutshell, it&#8217;s the process of creating a set of potential answers in<br />\norder to ensure that the answers you receive are relevant and usable. If you<br />\nblog about cats, structured communication will prevent your Pinnion results<br />\nfrom containing requests to blog about Dalmatians. If your blog has 17,000<br />\nreaders, structured communication will provide you with compiled answers that<br />\nare easy to process, so you can quickly understand what your large and diverse<br />\naudience is telling you.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
