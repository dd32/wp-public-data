        "faq": "\n<h4>Why Snazzy Slider?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While there are many slider plugins available, Snazzy Slider gives you the basic features of premium slider plugins at no cost while keeping true to the heart of open source plugin development. With an active community, it&#8217;s features will continue to grow and improve. Snazzy Slider can also be used by anyone on any device because it uses responsive web design techniques as well as accessibility standards like ARIA.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can I only add one slider per page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although most sites do not need more than one slider per page for design and performance reasons, we see that this may be a need for some in the future. I am always looking for ways to improve Snazzy Slider, and will work on new features whenever possible. See more info below about contributing to the GitHub project.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add more than six images to a slider?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each slider has a maximum of six images because research shows that more slides equals lower click through rate. Keeping the maximum at six keeps it short and sweet and shows people that your featured images and posts really are important.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I contribute?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can view the source code via the WordPress.org plugin directory or by visiting the <a href=\"https://github.com/joshcummingsdesign/snazzy-slider\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>. There, you can submit a pull request, fork the repository, and watch and star the project to get involved.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
