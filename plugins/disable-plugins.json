This plugin will allow you<br />\nto create simple rewrite rules to exclude a plugin or plugins from any URI<br />\npattern match. This is a great way to reduce the memory footprint, SQL queries<br />\nrun at page load, load times, and improve site response speed.</p>\n<p>This is NOT a normal WordPress plugin, but an <em>mu</em> (must use) plugin and requires<br />\nspecial installation instructions.

        "installation": "<p>Create a <code>/wp-content/mu-plugins/disable-plugins-rules</code> directory if the plugin<br />\nhas not created one for you already. Create a rules file for each site your<br />\nWordPress installation is running, naming the file after the host name for<br />\nthe site followed by a <code>.rules</code> extension. For example <code>mywordpresssite.com.rules</code><br />\nwould be a rules set for <code>mywordpresssite.com</code>.</p>\n<p>Populate your rules using regular expression pattern matches and plugin base<br />\nnames on each line of your rules file. For example, to exclude the <em>Hello Dolly</em><br />\nand <em>Akisment</em> plugins from being loaded on your home page, you would write<br />\na rules file that looks like:</p>\n<pre><code># Prevent the Hello Dolly plugin from loading on the home page\n^\\/$ hello\n# Prevent the Akisment plugin from loading on the home page\n^\\/$ akismet\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will need to write a rule for each plugin that will be excluded for each<br />\npattern that you wish to exclude that plugin from. C style comments are<br />\nallowed in your rules file to document your rules.</p>\n",

How do I format my exception rule?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is pretty easy to do, just two pieces to each line &#8211; the regular expression pattern and the plugin&#8217;s basename (usually the folder or file name of the plugin). See the installation section for an example of how this might look.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. Will this work on a multisite installation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is made to run with multisite in mind, but it has not been tested with a multisite installation yet.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q. How do you write regular expressions and do you have any good tools for writing them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re asking this question, you may want to consider a different plugin to help manage your site&#8217;s plugin use, but you can check out the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good information on regular expressions &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.regular-expressions.info/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Regular Expressions</a></li>\n<li>A nice cheat sheet for writing regular expressions &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet</a></li>\n<li>A great library of regular expression patterns &#8211; <a href=\"http://regexlib.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Regular Expression Library</a></li>\n<li>An excellent tool for testing patterns &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.regexpal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RegexPal Testing Tool</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, I really can&#8217;t do much support for this plugin, but time permitting I will continue to develop it. I am considering an admin interface for easier management, but thats down the road a bit.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
