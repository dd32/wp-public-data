        "faq": "<p>What kind of order can be carried out using this plugin?</p>\n<p>For now, our plugin supports only product transaction for purchase of physical goods.</p>\n<p>Who is the buyer, seller and broker?</p>\n<p>As a WooCommerce store owner, you are automatically the seller in the transaction wethwer your platform is a single-vendor platform or a multi-vendor/marketplace platform. In both scenarios, you will be required to complete each order from the provided Vesicash Order Page on your wordpress website or from the Vesicash Admin area in your WordPress Dashoard. In both scenarios, the customer who checkouts using this plugin is always the buyer.</p>\n<p>What happens after an order has been placed?</p>\n<p>Once an order has been placed using the Vesicash Escrow Payment option, the buyer will be instructed to complete the payment by logging into vesicash.com using the email and phone number used in placing the order. The seller is also notified about the new payment via email.</p>\n<p>When do I get the funds?</p>\n<p>For single-vendor/ecommerce platform type, funds for each order is released to the WooCommerce store owner within 24hours after which the store owner clicks &#8220;Order is Shipped&#8221; button on the Vesicash Order area on the wordpress dashboard.<br />\nFor Multivendor/Markteplaces platform type, funds for each order is automatically released to the WooCommerce store owner&#8217; vesicash wallet from which the store owner can then manually inititate disbursements to her vendors. A Disbursement tab has been provided on the Vesicash Order area for this purpose.</p>\n<p>What if there is an error during checkout using the Vesicash Escrow payment option.</p>\n<p>If an error occurs when a user places an order with the Vesicash Escrow payment option selected, open the WooCommerce admin and navigate to Status and then Logs. This plugin writes debug and error messages to these logs. They may be under fatal- or log-. If a 401 or 403 error is being returned from the Vesicash API, then there is a problem with the Vesicash Escrow credentials. If a 500 error is being returned, there is a problem on the Vesicash server. When that happens, please email techsupport@vesicash.com and it will be investigated.</p>\n",
