You can set this up by using the URL in red at the top of the Settings page. Just copy the URL and save it as your webhook URL on your Nomba dashboard under <strong>Settings &gt; Webhooks</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>If you do not find Nomba on the Payment method options, please go through the settings again and ensure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&#8217;ve checked the <strong>&#8220;Enable/Disable&#8221;</strong> checkbox</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve entered your <strong>API Keys</strong> in the appropriate field</li>\n<li>Your store currency is set to <strong>NGN</strong></li>\n<li>You&#8217;ve clicked on <strong>Save Changes</strong> during setup</li>\n</ul>\n",
