Or directly upload from your Plugin management page.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I replace more than one sidebar per page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently only one sidebar can be replaced per page.  If you wish to replace multiple sidebars per page, leave a commment and I may add this feature.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I replace sidebars on posts or custom post types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>YES! Version 2 and newer of the plugin allows sidebars on posts and I believe custom post types as well. This feature has not been heavily tested.  If you encouter any issues, please let me know.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can my authors &amp; contributors replace the sidebar on a page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A user can only replace a sidebar on a page if their role has the <em>edit_theme_options</em> capability. A user can edit a page that has been assigned custom sidebar and that custom sidebar will not be dropped. A user without the <em>edit_theme_options</em> capability simply cannot turn that functionality on or off.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My left sidebar was replaced on the parent but it not on the child, why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some themes allow you to chose different sidebar layouts on each page.  Sometimes these themes rely on a Primary/Secondary Sidebar configuration rather than a Right/Left sidebar convention. This may lead to confusion when the parent displays two sidebars and the child only displays one.  This plugin replaces the sidebar by name not by position.  In a 2 column layout, the only sidebar is by definition the &#8220;Primary&#8221; sidebar. Replacing a &#8220;Secondary&#8221; sidebar in the parent page will not alter the appearance of 2 column child page if the &#8220;Secondary&#8221; sidebar is never displayed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
