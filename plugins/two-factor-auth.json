Users will have to enter an One Time Password when they log in.</p>\n<h4>Why You Need This</h4>\n<p>Users can have common or weak passwords that lets hackers/bots brute-force your WordPress site and gain access to your files and place malware there.<br />\nJust like happend not that long ago: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/hackers-point-large-botnet-at-wordpress-sites-to-steal-admin-passwords-and-gain-server-access/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Article on TechCrunch</a></p>\n<p>If all sites would have used this plugin, this would never happend.<br />\nIt doesn&#8217;t matter how weak your users passwords are, no one can gain access to your WordPress site<br />\nwithout already having access to the users mobile phone or email inbox (depending on how the user gets his OTP).</p>\n<h4>How Does It Work?</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses the industry standard algorithm <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TOTP</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HOTP</a> for creating One Time Passwords.<br />\nA OTP is valid for a certain time and after that a new code has to be entered.</p>\n<p>You can now choose to use third party apps like <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Authenticator</a> which is available for most mobile platforms. You can really use any<br />\nthird party app that supports TOTP/HOTP that generates 6 digits OTP&#8217;s.<br />\nOr, as before, you can choose to get your One Time Passwords by email.</p>\n<p>Since you have to enter a secret code to third party apps, email is the default way of delivering One Time Passwords. Your<br />\nusers will have to activate delivery by third party apps themselves.</p>\n<h4>Easy To Use</h4>\n<p>Just install this plugin and you&#8217;re all set. There&#8217;s really nothing more to it.<br />\nIf you want to use a third party app, goto Two Factor Auth in the admin menu and activate it and set up your app.<br />\nGeneral settings can be found uner Settings -&gt; Two Factor Auth in admin menu. Settings for each individual user<br />\ncan be found at the root level of the admin menu, in Two Factor Auth.<br />\nA bit more work to get logged in, but a whole lot more secure!</p>\n<p>If you use WooCommerce or other plugins that make custom login forms, you will not be able to login through those anymore.<br />\nI will be adding a plugin that puts a One Time Password field to WooCommerce. If you use some other plugin that needs<br />\nsupport for this, let me know in the support forum.</p>\n<h4>TOTP or HOTP</h4>\n<p>Which algorithm you and your users choose doesn&#8217;t really matter. The time based TOTP is a bit more secure since a One Time<br />\nPassword is valid only for a certain amount of time. But this requires the server time to be in sync the clients time (if<br />\nthe OTP isn&#8217;t delivered by email). This is often hard to do with embedded clients and the event based HOTP is then a better choice.<br />\nIf you have a somewhat slow email server and have chosen email delivery, you might not get the TOTP in time.</p>\n<p>Conslusion: Choose which ever you want. TOTP is a little bit safer since OTP:s only are valid for a short period.</p>\n<p>Note that email delivery users always uses the site default algorithm, which you can set on the settings page. Third party<br />\napps users can choose which one they want.</p>\n<h4>Is this really Two Factor Auth?</h4>\n<p>Before version 3.0 this plugin had &#8216;kind of&#8217; two factor auth where the OTP was delivered to an email address.<br />\nSince version 3.0 you can have real two factor auth if you activate the Third Party Apps delivery type.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"http://oskarhane.com/two-factor-auth-explained/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">what two factor auth means &gt;&gt;</a>.</p>\n<p>See http://oskarhane.com/plugin-two-factor-auth-for-wordpress/ for more info.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Easy installation.</p>\n<p>This plugin requires PHP version 5.3 or higher and support for <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/mcrypt.installation.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP mcrypt</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <em>two-factor-auth.zip</em> through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>or</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for &#8216;Two Factor Auth&#8217; in the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Click the &#8216;Install&#8217; button.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I have real Two Factor Auth?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, since version 3.0 you can activate real Two Factor Auth by activating third party apps option under &#8220;Two Factor Auth&#8221; in admin menu. Don&#8217;t forget to set up your app with the secret key.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Oops, I lost my phone. What to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hopefully you saved the three Panic Codes when you activated third party apps. Use one of them.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I can&#8217;t reach my email account, can I bypass this plugin and log in anyway?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have Panic Codes, you can use them. Otherwise, no.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
