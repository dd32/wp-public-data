        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20saturn%20tables%20work%3F'>\nHow does Saturn Tables work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Saturn Tables works by using a hook and callback system built on top of the construct WordPress has for custom administration menus.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20level%20of%20wordpress%20knowledge%20is%20needed%3F'>\nWhat level of WordPress knowledge is needed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you can set up a custom WordPress administration menu or build a simple plugin it would be helpful. There is an assumption you would know some MySQL, also $wpdb, since Saturn Tables is for displaying data in the administration area. WordPress style PHP; filters, hooks and callbacks would be helpful.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20started%3F'>\nHow do I get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It would probably be easiest to install the sample code and data provided on the <a href=\"https://saturntables.com\" title=\"Saturn Tables\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">website</a> and then fork your project from there. Two sample code bases are provided for use and demonstration, you should be able to morph from there.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20documentation%3F'>\nIs there documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The <a href=\"https://saturntables.com\" title=\"Saturn Tables\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Saturn Tables</a> home page has complete documentation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20anything%20else%20i%20should%20know%3F'>\nIs there anything else I should know?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Saturn Tables has no settings or administration pages , it works by putting code, PHP files, in a subdirectory called /saturn-tables/ of your theme or child theme. You could also put the code in functions.php, but it is easier to organize in a separate file.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
