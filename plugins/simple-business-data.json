You will not need to keep track of every place you have your business information or social media links are displayed on your website. Just change it in the form and it is changed in your theme. Easily add your new social media link to the form and the icon will be added automatically in your front-end.

The first attribute is the identifier for the icon that will be displayed (telephone, address, etc). The second is an on/off switch to show the Font Awesome icon with your text. If you wish to only show the text then you need to add &#8220;show_icon=&#8221;no&#8221; to the shortcode when you use it. To make life easy, simply copy and paste the Shortcode below the item you wish to use.</p>\n<p>Note: the Font Awesome icon may only be turned &#8220;on/off&#8221; for the address, telephone, fax, and/or email. NOT for the social media icons, as they only display the Font Awesome icon.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming Releases</h3>\n<p>In future updates I hope to:<br />\n * Make the address section able to use embedded Google Maps<br />\n * Give you a choice of which Font Awesome icon gets used (some have multiple versions).<br />\n * Allow the user to add their own url, title and Font Awesome icon to any social media site not available with this plugin.<br />\n * Add the title text to a larger version of the social media icon for display on your website.</p>\n",
