How can I do this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Under <code>Advanced Options</code> you can add any custom JavaScript to the <code>Localization</code> text area. This will be added after your JS file.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to conditions work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When adding a condition, you need only to write the expression, and not the entire comment tag. For example, to load the item only for IE browsers at version 9, you would write <code>if IE 9</code>. Note: Adding a condition will force the item to be included at the end of the  element (after all other scripts and stylesheets). Therefore, specifying dependencies will have no effect.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
