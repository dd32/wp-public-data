        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After you install and activate it, go to Dashboard &gt; Tools &gt; Import &gt; Joomla 1.5. Enter your Joomla database connection<br />\ninformation on the first screen, then enter your export/import info on the second screen and click &#8220;Import&#8221;. It&#8217;s<br />\nreally pretty simple and self-explanatory.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What information do I need to export my Joomla articles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need the basic database connection information, which is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hostname of the MySQL server on which your Joomla database runs</li>\n<li>Port number of the MySQL server for your database (defaults to 3306)</li>\n<li>Username of a user with read privileges for your Joomla data</li>\n<li>Password for same user</li>\n<li>Database name of your Joomla database</li>\n<li>Prefix for your Joomla tables (defaults to jos_)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I export an entire Joomla section at one time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t &#8211; you can only export one category at a time. If you&#8217;d like to add that feature to this plugin, I&#8217;d love to integrate it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I use this plugin with a version of WordPress earlier than 3.0?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy. Just upgrade to the latest version of WordPress, then use this plugin. (You should upgrade anyway for a huge number of other reasons,<br />\nnot just this plugin.)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I import my Joomla 1.0 articles into WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy. Just <a href=\"http://docs.joomla.org/Migrating_from_1.0.x_to_1.5_Stable\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">migrate to Joomla 1.5</a> first, then use this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I import my Joomla 1.6 articles into WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn&#8217;t support Joomla 1.6 import at this time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t this plugin do _______?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because nobody coded it to do that. If you&#8217;ve got the time and know-how, I&#8217;d welcome any changes or updates to the plugin you can provide.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Your plugin saved me a ton of time and effort. How can I show you my appreciation for creating it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy. I wrote this plugin to migrate the website of <a href=\"http://www.girlchoir.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Girl Choir of South Florida</a>,<br />\nso the best way to say &#8220;thank you&#8221; is to make a donation to the choir.<br />\nFollow the link and click on the &#8220;Give the Gift of Music&#8221; button. Or click on the Donate button on one of<br />\nthe plugin screens. You and the choir will both be glad you did.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what to contribute, ask yourself what you would have paid someone to convert or retype all of your articles for you,<br />\nand donate that amount. Or $10 (US) &#8230; whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>All donations received from this plugin<br />\nwill go towards scholarships for needy families. You can see and hear the choir in action at<br />\ntheir <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/girlchoir\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">YouTube channel</a>. They&#8217;re amazing!</p>\n<p>The Girl Choir of South Florida is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, and your contribution may be tax-deductible.<br />\nDetails of the choir&#8217;s charitable status are available on its web site at http://www.girlchoir.org.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
