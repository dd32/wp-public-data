Now you can simply click the button &#8216;View Variants&#8217; to show a modal with all the listed variants of an image. Details include, full URL, file name, and file size.</p>\n<p>Improve your Media Library functionality by introducing a new column that showcases the sizes of files, including collective variants efficiently. This lightweight plugin empowers you to effortlessly sort files based on their respective file sizes.

However, managing these files can become a daunting task, especially when you have a large number of media files on your website. WordPress does offer a media library that allows users to upload and manage media files, but it falls short when it comes to providing information about file sizes. This is where the ‚ÄúMedia File Sizes‚Äù plugin comes in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default sizes may show without the need to run an index however, indexing the Media Library is highly recommended.</li>\n<li>If sizes do not show, you can click the Index Media button within the Media Library to index/re-index items.</li>\n<li>Shows file size of primary file, plus combined sized for variants (images).</li>\n<li>Ability to order the media items by file size.</li>\n</ul>\n",
