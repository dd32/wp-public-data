If you want it though let me know and I&#8217;ll add it to the<br />\nnext version.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want more hearts!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Originally I built this to use 5 hearts only but I was bored today so now you can have as many as you wish! Just enter the number in the widget or in<br />\nthe shortcode as &#8216;hearts&#8217; = &#8216;3&#8217; and the plugin will take care of the rest. *note: I haven&#8217;t tested the ins and outs of this so I&#8217;m not sure how well<br />\nit works but I don&#8217;t forsee any major issues.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
