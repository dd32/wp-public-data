It&#8217;s a full-featured order scheduling plugin for WooCommerce which allows you to fine-tune the customer&#8217;s checkout process.</p>\n<p>Customers can choose between creating a Delivery order where you deliver to them, or a Pickup order where they pickup. The plugin allows for powerful scheduling features that lets you set what days and times you offer delivery/pickup services.</p>\n<h3>NOTE</h3>\n<p>The plugin does not currently support the WooCommerce Blocks checkout. To use this plugin you need to have a normal checkout page that has the <code>[woocommerce_checkout]</code> shortcode. If you&#8217;re setting up a brand new website with a fresh version of WooCommerce installed on it, then by default, WooCommerce will create your checkout page as a Blocks checkout page.</p>\n<p>For this plugin to work, you need to <strong>delete all contents of that blocks page</strong> and add the shortcode: <code>[woocommerce_checkout]</code> inside it. Please read <a href=\"https://chwazidatetime.com/docs/switching-to-classic-checkout/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this doc to learn more</a>.</p>\n<p>Once thats done you&#8217;ll have the normal WooCommerce checkout page and the plugin options will show.

Download and give it a shot and let us know if there&#8217;s any features you&#8217;d like to see by posting it on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/delivery-and-pickup-scheduling-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a></p>\n<h3>Below are a few types of stores that would benefit tremendously from this plugin:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Online Food Delivery websites</li>\n<li>Online Supermarkets</li>\n<li>Online Furniture websites</li>\n<li>Restaurants offering delivery via their website</li>\n<li>Hardware Rental &amp; Delivery websites</li>\n<li>Car Rental websites</li>\n<li>Pickup service websites</li>\n<li>Taxi and pickup scheduling websites</li>\n<li>And more</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>Once enabled from the General settings, the plugin works by adding a Switcher on the checkout page that lets customers switch between &#8220;Delivery&#8221; and &#8220;Pickup&#8221;</p>\n<p>It also adds a datepicker and a timepicker field. The customer selects their desired date from the calendar that shows when the date picker field is clicked and can also select their desired time from the time picker field.</p>\n<p>Its possible to make both of these fields required as well disabling either one of them.</p>\n<p>When a customer switches an order to &#8220;Delivery&#8221;, all &#8220;local pickup&#8221; shipping methods are removed.
