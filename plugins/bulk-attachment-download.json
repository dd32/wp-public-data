The theoretical absolute maximum is 999. That&#8217;s the maximum you can set for &#8216;Number of items per page&#8217; in the Media Library (see above).<br />\nBut there may be other constraints depending on your host setup, such as max script execution time, file size limits and memory limits.<br />\nWhether you reach those constraints will depend on the number and size of files you are trying to download in one go.<br />\nIf you see error messages or your zip file is incomplete or corrupted, try several smaller downloads instead of one big one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20does%20it%20take%20for%20the%20zip%20file%20to%20be%20created%3F'>\nHow long does it take for the zip file to be created?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That depends on the number and size of files you are downloading, and also on your host setup.<br />\nTry downloading smaller numbers of files to get a feel for how long it takes before attempting a large download.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20can%20create%20downloads%3F'>\nWho can create downloads?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Permissions are set so that:<br />\n* Anyone who has the capability &#8216;upload_files&#8217; can create downloads.<br />\n* A user can download an attachment if that user has permission to edit the attachment.<br />\n* Only users who have the capability &#8216;manage_options&#8217; can download, edit, or delete a download that another user has created.</p>\n<p>That means that if the WordPress default roles and capabilities are being used:<br />\n* Administrators and editors can download any attachments.<br />\n* Authors and contributors can download only those attachments they uploaded.<br />\n* Only administrators can download, edit or delete a download created by another user.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20can%27t%20i%20open%20the%20password-protected%20zip%20files%3F'>\nWhy can&#8217;t I open the password-protected zip files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably because you are using the standard Windows zip facility, which will not work. Try 7-Zip instead.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20does%20chrome%20block%20my%20downloads%3F'>\nWhy does Chrome block my downloads?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may find that Google Chrome gives you a warning and asks you to confirm if you want to download the file.<br />\nThis is standard behaviour for Google Chrome because the file is a zip file (more info <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6261569?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20filters%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat filters are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>jabd_max_files_size</code>. Max download file size limit is set in the plugin settings in Settings &gt; Media,<br />\nbut if you wanted to set the file size per user you could use this filter.</li>\n<li><code>jabd_display_passwords</code>. Whether or not to store and display passwords is set in the the plugin settings in Settings &gt; Media,<br />\nbut you can also use this filter for more granular control, for example if you wanted only to display for certain users.</li>\n<li><code>jabd_zip_password</code>. Use this filter to amend a zip file password. One scenario might be to use different fixed passwords for different users or user groups,<br />\nas only a single default password can be set using the plugin settings.</li>\n<li><code>jabd_file_path_rel_to_uploads</code>. Used to amend the path of an attachment relative to the uploads folder.</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>jabd_include_original_file</code>. Used to include or exclude the original file. Example to exclude the original :<br />\n<code>add_filter( 'jabd_include_original_file', 'mytheme_remove_original_file', 10, 2 );<br />\nfunction mytheme_remove_original_file( $include, $image_post ) {<br />\nreturn false;<br />\n}</code><br />\nNB if you exclude the original and don&#8217;t select intermediate files sizes, you have nothing to download !</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>jabd_include_intermediate_image_size</code>. Used to include or exclude intermediate image size. Example to include only medium and large sizes :<br />\n<code>add_filter( 'jabd_include_intermediate_image_size', 'mytheme_amend_int_sizes', 10, 3 );<br />\nfunction mytheme_amend_int_sizes( $include, $int_size, $image_post ) {<br />\nreturn in_array( $int_size, ['medium', 'large'] );<br />\n}</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n"
