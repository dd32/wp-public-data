The latest release also has a &#8220;featured post&#8221; add-on so you can specify any post you want or just the most recent one to be put in the featured post box.

Easily place your Recent Visual Posts by simply inserting your desired Thesis hook on the settings page.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Create thumbnail cache directory <code>thumb-cache</code> under the wp-content/ directory.</li>\n<li>Place <code>&lt;?php insertVisualRecentPosts(); ?&gt;</code> in your template where you want things to show up. If you have a nice hook system in your theme (like Thesis theme from diythemes.com), then you don&#8217;t even have to modify any code. Just enter the hook name in the plugin&#8217;s option panel.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>I created the &#8216;thumb-cache&#8217; directory but my images aren&#8217;t showing up. What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t panic! OK, panic if you like, but this is probably a permissions problem. Make sure that directory is writable. If you have questions, please visit the plugin homepage or the <a href=\"http://oktober5.com/forums/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin forums</a></p>\n<p>Also, you should know that if you are using images in your posts that are hosted on another site this plugin won&#8217;t be able to generate the thumbnail. So, you have to upload the images in wordpress when you&#8217;re editing the post in order for things to go smoothly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My css popup boxes are not working. Are you a sorry excuse for a coder?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and no. I know enough to break things. But I&#8217;m really good at copy/paste ðŸ™‚ If your css popups aren&#8217;t showing, it&#8217;s probably because you&#8217;re using IE6&#8230;? The code I copy and pasted for this was supposed to work in IE6, but my experience has shown that it doesn&#8217;t work. If you like you can write Bill Gates about it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<p>v1.0 &#8211; changed thumbnail cache directory to be <code>wp-content/thumb-cache/</code>. Users of the WP super cache plugin might have noticed that deleting their cache also deleted all the thumbnails ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>v1.1 &#8211; The plugin was conflicting with other plugins about some session_start() garbage which I really don&#8217;t understand, but after a wild copy/paste job it appears things are better now.</p>\n<p>v1.1.1 &#8211; OK, for future reference, please use <code>&lt;?php</code> not just <code>&lt;?</code> &#8230; OK! Seriously&#8230;. Anyway, if you were getting a function not found or something like that, hopefully it&#8217;s fixed.</p>\n<p>v1.1.2 &#8211; No you can specify a category or multiple categories to display. And! if you don&#8217;t want to display posts without images, now you can&#8211;just change your setting on the VRP options page.</p>\n<p>v1.1.3 &#8211; Added parameter to insertVisualRecentPosts() function. You can now pass $number_of_posts to specify how many posts to display for that VRP box. Helpful if you&#8217;re displaying a small number of posts on the front page but want to display more posts on your category archive pages.</p>\n<p>v1.1.4 &#8211; Added more style options, like changing font sizes and background colors; also, I removed some hard-coded styles so that you may set them yourself in the css file. Hope that doesn&#8217;t break things&#8230;.</p>\n<p>v1.2 &#8211; Added CSS popup boxes; fixed number of posts with images issue thingy; took out hard coded margins, padding, colors, etc., so that you can make your own changes, although this makes things look ugly initially; upped the thumbnail image quality to 85%</p>\n<p>v1.2.1 &#8211; Yes, another release&#8230; Fixed a bug that I created in the last release. When you specify a number of posts and say images only, it should give you that many posts with images, assuming you have that many. If you don&#8217;t have that many, it will return what it can find.</p>\n<p>v1.2.2 &#8211; Afraid of CSS? This version adds padding options for image box, title, and excerpt. It also fixes the problem where each CSS popup excerpt is the same.</p>\n<p>v1.2.3 &#8211; Fixed bug where images were not displaying in Opera browser. Also removed some ugly and unnecessary styles in the css, which probably messed things up for you and I&#8217;m sorry. It was for the greater good. Also added option to put title after the image.</p>\n"
