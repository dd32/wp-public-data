The plugin is intended to be simple with easy-to-read code.</p>\n<p>An expiration can be set by specifying a number of days (e.g., <em>expire in 90 days</em>) or a specific date/time (e.g., <em>May 10, 2018 at 10:00 PM</em>). Two weeks prior to the expiration date, the author of the post/page is sent a warning email. The author receives another notification email upon expiration.</p>\n<p>When a post/page expires, it is <strong>not</strong> deleted. Instead, it is given a status of <em>Expired</em> and hidden from public view. Visitors to the site will receive the regular WordPress <em>404 Page Not Found</em> error.</p>\n<p>The expiration can be reset by any editor or administrator of the site. They must log in and edit the expiration settings of the post/page.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Expiration</strong> is developed on GitHub.
