        "faq": "\n<h4>What if I lock myself out?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you log into WordPress, you don&#8217;t need a PIN.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will Google, Bing and Yahoo index my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, search engines won&#8217;t index the site while it&#8217;s locked with a PIN.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the PIN have to be four digits?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it can be any number of digits. In fact it can use numbers, letters and punctuation like any password,<br />\nbut people are in the habit of thinking of a PIN as a few digits.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do if the wrong person has access to my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Immediately change the PIN, and disable that person&#8217;s user if they have one. And be more careful in the future!</p>\n<p>Note that even the lowest level of user (typically Subscriber) still has access to the site, so you have to disable<br />\nsomebody&#8217;s account entirely to stop them logging in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I give people a hint?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can set a custom message to display on the PIN entry screen. But giving a hint can be dangerous<br />\nbecause an attacker may be able to work it out. An example of a bad PIN would be something like &#8220;our address&#8221; or<br />\n&#8220;the year the company was started&#8221; since that&#8217;s information anybody could find out.<br />\nA better hint might be &#8220;the same as the PIN on the warehouse door&#8221; because only employees should know that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Who can change the PIN? Who can read the PIN?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only administrators can change the PIN. Any contributor can see the PIN.</p>\n<p>If you want to adjust WordPress&#8217; permissions with code of your own, the ability to edit the PIN uses the<br />\n    edit_theme_options<br />\npermission while the ability to read the PIN uses the<br />\n    edit_posts<br />\npermission.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
