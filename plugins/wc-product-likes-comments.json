This allows store owners to use their preferred terminology or call-to-action on the button.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the text on the Checkout Order button has been customized or changed. This gives the store owner the flexibility to use a specific text that aligns with their branding or conveys a desired message.</p>\n<p>The add to cart feature has been completely removed from the store. This means that customers can no longer add products to a cart for later purchase. The store may have implemented an alternative purchasing process or requires customers to make immediate purchases.</p>\n<p>The product price is hidden for users who are not logged in across the entire store.
