        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20create%20a%20custom%20button%20that%20opens%20the%20xcompliant%20widget%3F'>\nHow can I create a custom button that opens the XCompliant Widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We recommend using our regular trigger button because it is clear and visible, and is recognized by a lot of visitors worldwide. It is by far the most accessible experience to activate accessible adjustments. However, if you still want to create a custom button that opens the interface, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose your own element that you want to replace with the current accessibility button</li>\n<li>Add the following HTML attribute: data-acsb-custom-trigger=&#8221;true&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a handy example of a  element that, with the approach above, becomes the XCompliant button:<br />\nClick here for XCompliant</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20run%20a%20website%20audit%3F'>\nCan I run a website audit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great news, you can generate website audit whenever you want. This is fully self-serve on our end. You can run a compliance report anytime you&#8217;d like using our free testing tool to run an audit report anytime from here: <a href=\"https://xcompliant.com/analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://xcompliant.com/analysis/</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20accessibility%20statements%20and%20certification%3F'>\nDo you offer accessibility statements and certification?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You get what is called an &#8220;Accessibility Statement&#8221; within our interface. This statement doubles as a certification that proves your website has undergone the required accessibility procedures. It lists all the adjustments made by XCompliant, browser compatibility, operating system compatibility, assistive technology compatibility, and provides all required information regarding the level of accessibility. I should also mention that the accessibility statement we provide you with is a legal requirement.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20compliant%20are%20you%20with%20wcag%2C%20ada%2C%20eaa%20%26%20more%3F'>\nHow compliant are you with WCAG, ADA, EAA &amp; more?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>XCompliant is here to support you in reaching your website compliance with the WCAG 2.1 at the AA Level, in accordance with the US Section 508 and the ADA as well as other global legislations for web accessibility. Having said that, our assistance, guidance, tools and analysis should be in no way deemed to constitute a guarantee, legal advice or service.</p>\n<p><em>Offer Screen-reader &amp; keyboard navigation</em><br />\nSince the screen-readers (for example JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA) interact directly with the browser and aren&#8217;t hosted on the site itself, they rely on the site being WCAG and ADA compliant in order to work (which is where we come in!).</p>\n<p>XCompliant provides Automatic Screen-Reader adjustments powered by AI. Our tool uses contextual understanding and image recognition to scan and analyze the functionality of every element on your website and adjust it for screen reader accessibility. This includes Alt Attributes, ARIA Attributes, Icons &amp; Buttons, Forms &amp; Validations, State Controls and more.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20it%20possible%20to%20tab%20through%20different%20elements%20with%20xcompliant%3F'>\nIs it possible to Tab through different elements with XCompliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The answer here is most usually yes and YES! That being said, this can change a bit from site to site depending on the implementation and specific front-end of each site. We do have a 5-day free trial available on our application which is the absolute best way to see if our Tab function works well on your site(s).</p>\n<p><em>Monitoring Scans</em></p>\n<p>XCompliant scans and analyzes your website using AI technologies. Then, it applies adjustments to support your ADA and WCAG 2.1 compliance. This process takes up to 48 hours from installation. Our AI re-scans for new and revised content to process every 24 hours. The accessibility interface solves 30% of the ADA and WCAG 2.1 requirements immediately. This includes mostly UI and design features such as sizing, colors, and spacing.</p>\n<p>The remaining fixes we apply to support your compliance are solved within 48 hours, by our AI that runs in the background and adjusts your website, to make it operable using a screen reader (for blind people) and the Keyboard (for the motor impaired). The AI process includes several solutions: ALT (alternate text) attribute creation for images using image recognition and OCR technologies, form label creation and handling link/button icons using a contextual understanding technology, as well as fixing pop ups, menus, dropdown, forms, and more.</p>\n<p>XCompliant will not change a thing for the majority of users. It will only be activated when turned on via the interface (or a Screen-reader if the user is blind), as an overlay to your website, and only to the userâ€™s specific session. Therefore, XCompliant won&#8217;t affect your design, UI, or performance at all. The entire process is automated. From remediation to supporting your compliance, no manual work is being done.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
