Contact information on my wordpress.org Profile page</li>\n<li>Misc code standardization, formatting, and CSS updates</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where post Tags were set after the post was published which caused interference with other plugin processes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Future Publish settings wouldn&#8217;t properly unset after being set.</li>\n<li>Added autocomplete to Tags</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an edge case issue where Linkmarklet would show up as a 404 when invoked. Triggered by certain web hosts (in particular HostGator) that seem to interfere when a $_GET includes a protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed unwanted escaping of post content that was causing issue with Markdown and inline HTML</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where offiste image processing would not take place if using HTTPS</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for offsite images. If you include a Markdown-formatted image (e.g. <code>!&#091;Alt text&#093;&#040;http://example.com/image.jpg&#041;</code>) it will be downloaded and imported into your Media library so as to not hotlink someone else&#8217;s image. The image will be wrapped a link to the source article so as to mimic OEMBED policies. <strong>Note:</strong> image titles are not supported at this time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for Future Publishing. If you&#8217;re like me, you like to bulk-linkblog, but you don&#8217;t want to innundate readers with tons of posts all at once. There&#8217;s now a setting that will let you auto-schedule a post to go live within a timeframe after your future-most-scheduled post. You can also set a &#8216;bumper&#8217; of time between your most recently published posts.</li>\n<li>Added (optional) support for Tags</li>\n<li>Initial support for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save/\" rel=\"ugc\">Markdown on Save</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for Post Formats</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Better handling of text input fields on mobile devices</li>\n<li>Option to auto-generate the slug (or not)</li>\n<li>Added &#8216;Save&#8217; button to save as a Draft instead of Publish straight away</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
