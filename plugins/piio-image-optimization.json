Visitors don’t have the patience to wait more than three seconds for your site to load.</p>\n<p>Piio significantly improves the load time of your website by generating real-time responsive images and delivers them using lazy loading. Your visitors experience images optimized for their device that are instantly available as they scroll through your website.</p>\n<p>Piio delivers your images through an ultra-fast CDN, that is up to 10X faster than the Amazon S3 regular storage solution.
