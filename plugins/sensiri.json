Add multiple instances to get more nature sounds, each player is capable of playing seven at once.</p>\n<p>The Sensiri player is a sound controller, designed to load and play nature sounds from our online database. What&#8217;s the big deal you might be asking yourself? Well the big deal is that you can control and play up to seven separate sounds at once. If you download all three different player models you can play up to 21 separate sounds at once. That seems like a lot but consider this. The Sensiri player repeats each nature sound over and over again, creating loops. You can utilize the players random setting to add a silent pause at the end of each loop. You just type in the maximum length of the pause and the computer will repeat the sound with a different pause each time. This simple setting will bring the sounds of animals, birds and whatever else you want to life. I like to get seven birds going all at once, with a 600 second random delay. Each of the seven will sing after a random pause somewhere between zero and 600 seconds. There is no limit you could set an sparrow to sing sometime today, or once a day using the manual setting.Use shortcode or template tags to display this player in your posts or on your pages.
