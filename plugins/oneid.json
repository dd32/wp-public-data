        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20configure%20age%20restricted%20products%3F'>\nHow Do I Configure Age Restricted Products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin comes with three pre-set age restriction tags that can be assigned to products using the Products tab on the WordPress admin dashboard. These age restrictions are:<br />\n* Age Over 18</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20these%20the%20only%20age%20restrictions%20that%20i%20can%20apply%3F'>\nAre these the only Age Restrictions that I can apply?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At present, yes, however, we are working on future improvements to allow for a greater range of age restrictions to be configured.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20test%20this%20service%3F'>\nCan I Test this Service?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, using the OneID&reg; plugin tab on the WordPress admin dashboard, you can toggle the integration between our Production and Sandbox environments. The Sandbox integration is set up with a Model Bank and test users so that you can mock up the process before integrating with the live service. To integrate with either environment, your site must use TLS (i.e. be accessed via HTTPS).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20a%20customer%20fails%20to%20verify%20their%20age%3F'>\nWhat if a Customer Fails to Verify their Age?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the OneID&reg; plugin tab on the WordPress admin dashboard we give you the option to ‘Allow Customers to Skip Age Verification’. If this is switched on, customers are presented with a button to bypass OneID&reg; and are presented with an on-screen message instructing them that they are not bypassing Age Verification, only doing so via our product. You will still be required to verify their age through another means. If this setting is switched off, customers must complete the OneID&reg; to proceed to Checkout &#8211; customers then will pass or fail OneID&reg; age verification. We utilize the Order Notes and Order Tags to inform you at the order level what journey and outcome the customer took and whether a different method of Age Verification is required.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20configure%20the%20prompts%20on%20my%20site%E2%80%99s%20front-end%3F'>\nCan I Configure the Prompts on my Site’s Front-End?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Merchants can manually add a short code to show age restriction prompts on Product pages, in any of the sections that accept short codes. When the Age Verification service is enabled, prompts will always show on carts containing age-restricted products, and the OneID button will always appear on the checkout. The location and appearance of these prompts are fixed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20compatible%20with%20one-click%20checkout%20providers%3F'>\nIs this Compatible with One-Click Checkout Providers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, unfortunately for the Age Verification process to work most effectively, any One-Click checkout options must be disabled.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20configure%20the%20merchant%20skipped%20email%20content%3F'>\nCan I Configure the merchant skipped email content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, using the configuration settings under Woocommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Age Verification Pending</p>\n</p>\n\n",
