        "description": "<h3>Lightweight Loading Bar</h3>\n<p>Add a YouTube-style loading bar to your website easily! Extremely lightweight plugin that only adds 810 bytes to your page size. It also does not add anything to your database. Change color, height, and all options of the loading bar a configuration file easily. This style of preloader has a much more minimalist design and is not annoying at all compared to other full screen designs. Because most mobile browsers already have a built in loading bar, we allow you to disable it on devices smaller than 600px by default. This plugin has been tested with WP Rocket and should be fully compatible with other cache plugins as well. Please post bug reports, issues, and feature requests on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lightweight-loading-bar\" rel=\"ugc\">WordPress.org Support Forums</a> and I will respond ASAP!

The reason it will be a bit slower is because the current setup allows the plugin to get the options directly from the filesystem, whereas if we have a settings page we will store them in a database which takes time to query.
