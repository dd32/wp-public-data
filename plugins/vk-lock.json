Go to [VK Lock] section on page edit screen (meta-box at bottom of the page).<br />\nWithin [VK Lock] section specify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>URL to the VKontakte group (just copy&amp;paste http address from your browser of the VK group main page &#8211; its like https://vk.com/club123456789), if it is not specified &#8211; plugin won&#8217;t affect your page at all</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Timelimit (date in YYYY-MM-DD format after which the access to the page will be blocked even for proper VK group members), you may leave it empty</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How to configure plugin ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin has the following parameters (see at Plugings -&gt; VK Lock menu) :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;VK Application ID&#8217; &#8211; the ID of the application you have to create in VK</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;VK SecureKey&#8217; &#8211; security key of your VK application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;Show default Password box&#8217; &#8211; as the plugin works for password protected pages, you may either show (1) or not (0) the default password box the the page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;No access notice Header&#8217; &#8211; header text that be shown to the user (usually its ATTENSION or AUTHENTICATION)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;No access notice text&#8217; &#8211; text that show to the user as no-access description \\ explanation (there is %s param that will be replaced by VK group URL)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;SingIn Button Text&#8217; &#8211; text that will be put on &#8216;SingIn&#8217; button below the notice</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;No access after expiration time notice&#8217; &#8211; text that shown to the user in case timelimit was reached (there are two %s params &#8211; first one will be replaced by VK group URL, the second &#8211; by Timelimit-date)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&#8216;CSS class for SingIn</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>div&gt; area&#8217; &#8211; CSS classes to put set in</p>\n<p>&lt;</p>\n<p>div&gt; section of the no-access notice</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8216;CSS class for VK SingIn anchor&#8217; &#8211; CSS class to VK SingIn URL <a href=\"...\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">, usually its &#8216;button&#8217;</a></li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it slow down my site ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is NO. During page load VK-Lock Plugin checks if VK URL is set, if not &#8211; nothing will happen. So the overhead is very very small. Additionally, to minimize load on VK.COM and speed up page load VK-Lock also rely on vk_lock private cookies. VK Lock set secured cookie that confirms user was properly authorized in VK.COM (cookie valid for 2-hours max).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
