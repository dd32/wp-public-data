But, at the same time, I can&#8217;t help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let&#8217;s be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.</p>\n<p>I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too üíï</p>\n<h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>AI Engine is a plugin that helps you to connect your websites to AI services.
