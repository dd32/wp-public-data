I am sure you will have seen the option to select either thumbnail, medium, or full size when inserting an image into a post or page. This plugin simply adds to the list of automatically generated sizes available.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an unlimited number of image sizes</li>\n<li>Custom sizes automatically appear in the media manager for inserting into posts</li>\n<li>Images sizes are available for the featured image/post thumbnail</li>\n<li>Have WordPress crop or scale the image</li>\n<li>Set cropping positions (ie. top, bottom, right etc)</li>\n<li>Uses all native functionality for a smooth experience</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/easy-image-sizes</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the Easy Image Sizes menu screen to add/edit/remove image sizes</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow many different images sizes can I have?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hypothetically you could have as many as required. WordPress does have to generate each different image size when an image is uploaded and having LOTS of custom sizes might slightly impact performance.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat happens to my images if I disable the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The actual images will not be removed and they will still be available directly by using the img url, however they will not be available in the WordPress menus for inserting into posts. If you ware to reactive the plugin then the images will be fully available again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I export my custom image sizes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy Image Sizes can be exported/imported with the built in WordPress tools. It can be done as part of an entire site export, or just for the image sizes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
