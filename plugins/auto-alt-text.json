        "description": "<p>This plugin implements the automatic creation of alt text for images uploaded to the media library directly at the time of upload.</p>\n<p>To generate the alt text, you can choose to use the artificial intelligence of OpenAI or Azure, or decide if you simply want to copy the title of the article where the image is uploaded or the name of the image.</p>\n<p>Clearly, using artificial intelligence will allow for a more accurate and useful alt texts.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>This plugin allows you to generate alt texts in the following ways:<br />\n&#8211; using Openai APIs (updated to GPT-4o)<br />\n&#8211; using Azure APIs for computational vision;<br />\n&#8211; recovering the title of the image<br />\n&#8211; recovering the title of the article in which the image is uploaded</p>\n<h4>Getting Started</h4>\n<p>After installing the plugin, click on the &#8216;Auto Alt Text&#8217; menu item.</p>\n<h3>Choice of Generation Method</h3>\n<p>Select the Generation Method you prefer</p>\n<h3>OpenAI&#8217;s APIs</h3>\n<p>In your OpenAI account, retrieve the following data to enter on the options page:<br />\n&#8211; API Key</p>\n<p>Enter a prompt for generating the alt text according to your needs.</p>\n<p>When the gpt-4o model fails, the gpt-4-turbo fallback model is used to create the alt text based on the name of the image.</p>\n<h3>Azure&#8217;s APIs</h3>\n<p>On your Azure account, create a Computer Vision instance and retrieve the following data to enter on the options page:<br />\n&#8211; Computer Vision API Key<br />\n&#8211; Computer Vision Endpoint</p>\n<p>If you want to generate an alt text in English, save the options without filling in any other fields.</p>\n<p>If you want to generate an alt text in a different language, on your Azure account, create a Translator instance and retrieve the following data to enter on the options page:<br />\n&#8211; Translator Instance API Key<br />\n&#8211; Translator Instance Endpoint<br />\n&#8211; Translator Instance Region</p>\n<p>After entering this data, save the options.</p>\n<p>Select the desired language and save the options again.</p>\n<h3>Title of the article</h3>\n<p>For this generation method, there are no options to set as the alt text will be generated by copying the title of the article in which the image is uploaded.</p>\n<p>In case the article is not uploaded as an attachment of an article, the &#8220;Title of the attachment&#8221; method will be used as a fallback.</p>\n<h3>Title of the attachment</h3>\n<p>For this generation method, there are no options to set as the alt text will be generated by copying the title of the image.</p>\n<h3>Functioning</h3>\n<p>Once the plugin is configured, each time an image is uploaded to the media library, an alt text will be automatically set based on the selected generation method.</p>\n<p>For images already in the media library, you can create bulk alt texts. Open the Media Library in the &#8220;list&#8221; view, select the images for which to generate the alt text, and choose the &#8220;Generate alt text&#8221; bulk action. (Depending on the number of images chosen and their weight, this may take some time.)</p>\n<p>You can also generate the alt text of a single image directly from the media library. Open the Media Library in “grid” mode, choose the image for which to generate the alt text, and click the “Generate alt text” button. In no time the alt text field will be overwritten by the generated description.</p>\n<p><strong>Notice</strong>: If you choose one of the methods that involves the use of external APIs, the upload times for images in the media library might increase because it requires sending a request to the APIs, waiting for the external server to process, and waiting for a response.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>If the generation of the alt text via AI is set, in case of errors, to avoid blocking the editorial work, the image is loaded anyway but without the alt text being compiled.</p>\n<p>When a call to the Azure or OpenAI API fails, a record containing the error message is saved in a custom database table.<br />\nIn this case, the cause of the error can be seen on the Auto Alt Text -&gt; Error log page.</p>\n<h3>External Services</h3>\n<p>This plugin uses the following external services alternatively:</p>\n<h3>OpenAI</h3>\n<p>Selecting the generation method &#8220;OpenAI&#8217;s APIs&#8221; will use the API services of <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">OpenAI</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin does not collect any information from your OpenAI account.
