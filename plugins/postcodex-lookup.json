        "description": "<p>This plugin adds functionality to your Woocommerce checkout form to look up UK addresses from a postcode entered by your customer.</p>\n<p>This makes for a better user experience and reduces errors in user input, particularly on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>The plugin is free, but it requires an account with postcodex in order to function. You can create an account for free at https://console.postcodex.io/</p>\n<p>Documentation: https://postcodex.io/docs/wordpress/</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Install and activate the plugin through the WordPress plugins menu (or, if you prefer, upload the plugin zip manually to /wp-content/plugins/ and extract)<br />\nAccess the plugin settings either via the Installed Plugins screen, or from the link in the left hand menu in the admin dashboard.<br />\nOn this screen you&#8217;ll see three settings:</p>\n<p>API Key: On this screen, enter your API key and save your changes to confirm that your key is valid. If you don&#8217;t have an API key yet, you can get one free at https://console.postcodex.io/signup</p>\n<p>Please note that although it is free to create an account and you will receive some free credits to get you started and to allow you to test, you will need to purchase more in order to continue to use the plugin.</p>\n<p>Autosearch: You can also choose whether or not you want searches to happen automatically. If you choose to enable automatic search, the plugin may trigger a search more than once as your user types. This makes for a better user experience, but it may use more credits. If autosearch is disabled, the user will need to enter the whole postcode and then click the \\&#8221;search\\&#8221; button to perform the address lookup. This may reduce your credit spend, but it means a slightly less intuitive experience for your customer.<br />\nDebug Log: Finally, you can choose to enable logging. Although your activity can be managed through your control panel at https://console.postcodex.io/ you may also want to create a log file at the WordPress end of things e.g. for testing or debugging. This option is only available if Woocommerce is installed and active.</p>\n",
