        "faq": "\n<h4>Can it be used on a live site ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is only meant to be used for development purposes, but shouldn&#8217;t cause any issues if run on a production site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are shortcodes ?</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line. Shortcode = shortcut.<br />\n  <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more information about using shortcodes in WordPress:<br />\n&#8211;   <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Codex on shortcodes</a><br />\n&#8211;   <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Codex on the Shortcode API</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is my shortcode not listed ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two possibilities here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either your shortcode has <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_shortcode\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">not been properly registered</a> using the ShortCode API.</li>\n<li>Or your shortcode might only be registered conditionally and the current page does not meet those conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>The number of shortcodes differs depending on the requested page. How come ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See the previous answer.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using shortcode *abc* in page *xyz* and it doesn&#8217;t show as used!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To determine whether a shortcode is used in a page, only the <em><strong>post content</strong></em> is evaluated. If you add content to the page using shortcodes in other areas (for example: widgets) or via the theme, those uses will not be recognized.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use these shortcodes in the theme I&#8217;m building ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Generally speaking you can. However, don&#8217;t forget to always <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/shortcode_exists\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">check whether the shortcode is registered</a> before you use it! It may not be available on all pages and surely not on all WP installs.</p>\n<pre><code>if ( shortcode_exists( 'shortcode' ) ) {\n    /* Your code here */\n    // echo do_shortcode( 'some content containing a [shortcode /]' );\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m a developer and would like to enrich the information displayed by this plugin about my shortcode.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried to make this as easy and painless as possible.</p>\n<p>Just add a filter to enrich the information this plugin has about your shortcode. The easiest way is to use the <code>db_shortcodes_info_{shortcode}</code> filter which will only be applied to your shortcode.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'db_shortcodes_info_{your_shortcode}', 'filter_my_shortcode_info' );\nfunction filter_my_shortcode_info( $info ) {\n    // enrich the object\n    return $info;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>$info</code> object you receive and are expected to return will contain the currently known information about the shortcode.</p>\n<pre><code>$info is expected to contain (a selection of) the following parameters:\nstdClass(\n    $name         = (string) 'Friendly name for your shortcode',\n    $description  = (string) 'Description of your shortcode',\n    $self_closing = (bool) true/bool, // whether the shortcode is self-closing\n    $parameters   = array(\n        'required'      =&gt; array(\n            (string) 'attribute_name'       =&gt; (string) 'attribute description',\n        ),\n        'optional'      =&gt; array(\n            (string) 'attribute_name'       =&gt; (string) 'attribute description',\n        ),\n    ),\n    $info_url     = '',\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you happen to already provide similar information using the <code>sim_{shortcode}</code> filter for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/lrh-shortcode-list/\" rel=\"ugc\">LHR-Shortcode list</a> plugin, no need to do anything extra, that information will be picked up by this plugin.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you provide information for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/\" rel=\"ugc\">Shortcake/Shortcode UI</a> feature plugin, that information will be used automatically to enrich the available information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Hang on &#8211; the filter behaviour has changed ?!?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In version 1.0 of the plugin <code>$info</code> variable passed to the filter was an array. This has changed in version 2.0.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m aware that this is a backward compatibility break, but I&#8217;ve done some quite extensive searches and considering I did not find any plugin using the filter (yet), I decided this backward compatibility break would have little to no effect and therefore would be safe to implement.</p>\n<p>If you <em>did</em> already have a filter in place, sorry I didn&#8217;t find your plugin/theme! Not to worry though, I&#8217;ve tried to make it really easy to upgrade your code.<br />\nFirst off, you&#8217;ll need to change the <code>add_filter()</code> hook in code and your function signature to now received two variables. The first variable will be the new object, but the second variable will still be an array in the format which was passed in 1.0 so you can continue to use that in your function to enrich the information.<br />\nSecondly, as all this plugin uses are the properties of the object, you can just cast your array to an object in the return and it&#8217;ll work again.</p>\n<p>Old code for v1.0:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'db_shortcodes_info_{your_shortcode}', 'filter_my_shortcode_info' );\nfunction filter_my_shortcode_info( $info ) {\n    // enrich the array\n    return $info;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Updated code for v2.0:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'db_shortcodes_info_{your_shortcode}', 'filter_my_shortcode_info', 10, 2 );\nfunction filter_my_shortcode_info( $info_object, $info ) {\n    // enrich the array\n    return (object) $info;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>Why won&#8217;t the plugin activate ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have you read what it says in the beautifully red bar at the top of your plugins page ? As it says there, the Debug Bar plugin needs to be active for this plugin to work. If the Debug Bar plugin is not active, this plugin will automatically de-activate itself.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
