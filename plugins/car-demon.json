        "description": "<p>The Car Demon PlugIn is full of features. It has a general contact form, service appointment form, service quote form, trade-in form, a finance application and a vehicle information form all with AdfXml support.</p>\n<p>It also contains a powerful inventory management tool with optional VinQuery Decode Integration, compare vehicles tool, multiple location support and a whole lot more.</p>\n<h4>What can Car Demon do?</h4>\n<p>Car Demon is a powerful tool that manages the most important aspects of a vehicles sales website.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s used for more than just Car Dealers, it&#8217;s used for selling RVs, Boats, Campers, Motorcycles, Trailers, Semi-Trucks and even Planes.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re building a car dealer or vehicle sales website Car Demon gives you the wicked powers you need.</p>\n<h4>Full Featured Inventory Control</h4>\n<p>Use the inventory shortcode, [cd_inventory] and drop your vehicles onto any page.</p>\n<p>The inventory shortcode accepts the following parameters;</p>\n<p>title, year, make, model, condition, body_style, transmission, location, stock, criteria (keyword search), min_price, max_price, mileage (searches vehicles with less than the mileage entered) &amp; show_sold</p>\n<p>For example, you can create a page to show just ford trucks;<br />\n[cd_inventory title=&#8221;Ford Trucks&#8221; make=&#8221;ford&#8221; body_style=&#8221;truck&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Car Demon also supports custom theme pages by utilizing the custom post type cars_for_sale.</p>\n<p>To give you even more power you can assign search forms to the page your shortcode is on and search just those items.</p>\n<p>To make sure your search forms point to the correct result page you can set the result_page parameter for the search form widget or use it in the search form shortcode;</p>\n<p>[search_form size=1 result_page=&#8221;the url to your inventory shortcode page&#8221;]</p>\n<p>You have the option to enable a compare vehicle tool and the power to enable an auto load feature that continually loads inventory without the need to click on the next page.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Use Admin Area</h4>\n<p>The settings area has a Startup Guide to walk through your initial setup and get you up and running as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Turn features on and off easily letting you customize your site with ease.</p>\n<p>Inventory management is a snap, quickly add and remove vehicles, upload photos &amp; change prices.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.</p>\n<p>Go to your admin area and expand the menu for &#8220;Cars for Sale&#8221; and click on &#8220;Car Demon Settings&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Walk through the Startup Guide and adjust your settings as desired.</p>\n<p>Use shortcodes to create your inventory page(s), forms, staff highlights &amp; more.</p>\n<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve setup your Location Settings: Dashboard-&gt;Cars For Sale-&gt;Location Settings</p>\n<p>If you sell vehicles at more than one location then, click on locations from the Cars For Sale Menu and add an entry for each lot.</p>\n<p>After you have setup your locations click on &#8220;Location Settings&#8221;, fill out and save the form for each location, INCLUDING THE DEFAULT.</p>\n<p>It is important to check and make sure your Finance Disclaimer and Descriptions are legal for your location.</p>\n<p>We take no responsibility for the legality of the default entries.</p>\n<p>Adjust your theme settings and add widgets as desired.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re now ready to start adding vehicles to your site.</p>\n<p>Please make sure you add a price to your vehicles. If you don&#8217;t wish the price to be seen you can select &#8220;Do Not Show Prices&#8221; on the location settings page.</p>\n<p>Vehicles will not display in the search results until they have been marked published AND a price has been added to them, even if it&#8217;s just a 0 price.</p>\n<p>Finally, go to your admin area and click settings, then select permalinks. Add this as a custom permalink; /%postname%/%post_id%</p>\n<p>Congratulations!</p>\n",
        "faq": "<ul>\n<li>How do I view just a basic list of my vehicles?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First go to your admin area and click settings, then select permalinks. Add this as a custom permalink; /%postname%/%post_id%</p>\n<p>Then use the inventory shortcode, [cd_inventory] and drop your vehicles onto any page.</p>\n<p>The inventory shortcode accepts the following parameters;</p>\n<p>title, year, make, model, condition, body_style, transmission, location, stock, criteria (keyword search), min_price, max_price, mileage (searches vehicles with less than the mileage entered) &amp; show_sold</p>\n<p>For example, you can create a page to show just ford trucks;<br />\n[cd_inventory title=&#8221;Ford Trucks&#8221; make=&#8221;ford&#8221; body_style=&#8221;truck&#8221;]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why don&#8217;t my vehicles appear in the search even though I&#8217;ve published them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please make sure you add an &#8220;Asking Price&#8221; to your vehicles, even if it&#8217;s a 0 price.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t wish the price to be seen you can select &#8220;Do Not Show Prices&#8221; on the location settings page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why don&#8217;t my vehicles have titles even though I&#8217;ve entered a title for them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default Car Demon will display vehicles titles as Year Make Model Stock #, the title field is currently only used for descriptive purposes on the back end.</p>\n<p>You can tell Car Demon to use the vehicle title field in the admin settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I get the inventory to load new vehicles when I scroll to the bottom of the page?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you install the WP-Pagenavi PlugIn. It not only creates awesome pagination, but by default it will help the autoload feature function.</p>\n<p>The Car Demon PlugIn looks for the existing page navigation with specific id tags and uses those as an indicator for when the page has ended and which set of vehicles to load next.</p>\n<p>The auto inventory load has a few options in the backend that can be tweaked to work with different layouts and without WP-Pagenavi if needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does Car Demon have any hooks, filters or shortcodes for developers to use?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes it does. Please visit our website CarDemons.com and look in our blog for developer resources.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does Car Demon use taxonomies for categorizing vehicles and how can I leverage that?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, Car Demon uses several custom taxonomies; condition, body_style, vehicle_year, make, model and location.</p>\n<p>These can be used to create pages containing vehicle categories, for example;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you want to provide links to all the different body styles, to link to all of the coupes in inventory.</p>\n<p>You would create a link to http:/yoursite.com/body_style/coupe to link to all trucks it would be http:/yoursite.com/body_style/truck.</p>\n<p>You can use the same logic to leverage the other custom taxonomies as well.</p>\n<p>You will need to create custom template pages for your theme/child theme to take full advantage of this feature.</p>\n<p>Please check our website, http://CarDemons.com, for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m having trouble using custom taxonomies, I keep getting a 404 or page not found error.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you update your permalinks to /%postname%/%post_id% this should resolve most issues with using custom taxonomies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I override the vehicle inventory and display pages?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Car Demon has several hooks &amp; filters you can take advantage of and tweak or completely redesign the vehicle display, search forms and more.</p>\n<p>Please check our website, http://CarDemons.com, for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I use the shortcodes to include forms in my pages?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shortcodes can be used without arguments and will display a radio selection to determine the location to send the form.</p>\n<p>Shortcodes for [part_request], [service_request], [service_quote], [trade] &amp; [finance_form] now have the optional argument &#8220;location&#8221; added to them.</p>\n<p>The location argument accepts the name assigned to that form for the location you wish to send the form to and hides the radio selection.</p>\n<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you have a location called &#8220;Our Used Car Lot&#8221; and you have two different part departments, one that handle domestic vehicle parts and one that handles imported vehicle parts.</p>\n<p>You will need to create 2 locations &#8220;Our Used Car Lot Domestic&#8221; and &#8220;Our Used Car Lot Imports&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Under location settings you would enter a different name for Parts under both locations, ie &#8220;Domestic Parts&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Import Parts&#8221;.</p>\n<p>You can now use the part_request shortcode on two different pages and route each one to the correct department.<br />\nExp. [part_request location=&#8221;Domestic Parts&#8221;] and [part_request location=&#8221;Import Parts&#8221;]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I only have one location, how do I hide the location radio buttons on my forms?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will need to set the location argument for your form shortcodes to the form&#8217;s contact name entered under the default location.<br />\nExp. [part_request location=&#8221;Default Part Name&#8221;], this will hide the location radio buttons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I get rid of the drop down on the Contact Us Form? I want it to always go to the same person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The contact form shortcode, [contact_us], has an argument of &#8220;send_to&#8221; that accepts a single email address.</p>\n<p>If you set this argument in your shortcode it will hide the drop down and send the contact form to the address you supplied.<br />\nExp. [contact_us send_to=&#8221;me@my_site.com&#8221;]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I add a form as a Popup?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two new optional arguments have been added to several of the form shortcodes; popup_id and popup_button.</p>\n<p>These may be used with the following shortcodes; contact_us, part_request, service_form &amp; service_quote<br />\nAt this time they are NOT available for; trade or finance_form</p>\n<p>By setting the popup_id argument to a unique value you tell Car Demon to simply add a button to the page that opens your form in a popup lightbox.</p>\n<p>The popup_button argument allows you to customize what the button says.</p>\n<p>For Example [part_request popup_id=&#8221;1&#8243; popup_button=&#8221;Request Parts&#8221;] this would create a button that says &#8220;Request Parts&#8221; which opens the parts request form in a popup lightbox.</p>\n",
