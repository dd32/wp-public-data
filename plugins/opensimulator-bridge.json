This is how we make changes to the grid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://opensimulator.org/wiki/RemoteAdmin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">RemoteAdmin &#8211; OpenSimulator Wiki</a></p>\n<p>We strongly recommend setting a secret key, to avoid unwanted administration commands being sent to the grid. If you wish to restrict the enabled methods, the plugin description lists the required admin commands to be permitted.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20manually%20hook%20an%20account%20to%20a%20user%3F%20%28advanced%29'>\nHow do I manually hook an account to a user?
