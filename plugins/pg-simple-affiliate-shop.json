You may find this article <a href=\"http://www.peoplesgeek.com/2013/01/what-is-affiliate-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;What is Affiliate Marketing?&#8221;</a> useful.<br />\nThis plugin is for promoting and marketing other peoples products in return for a commission rather then selling your own product directly.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='all%20my%20products%20are%20showing%20as%20banners'>\nAll my products are showing as banners\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you create a product for your shop you must choose a category.

You can choose multiple categories for each of the product advertisements you create. By default &#8216;Shop Products&#8217; and all its children are shown in the shop page.

        "changelog": "<h4>Version 1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for shortcodes in the link field as suggested by @stiglv59dk. You can now add a shortcode in the link field</li>\n<li>Fix: The helper now works with 4.8 and the new TinyMCE thanks to Alex for his assistance.</li>\n<li>Bumped after testing against 5.2.1 (use classic block for PG Simple Affiliate shop if using Gutenberg blocks)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the ability to set a featured image for each shop product. This is to support this feature for some themes that use featured image. Note that it depends on your theme as to whether this option is used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: The helper for inserting short codes into pages and posts now supports the new and old tinyMCE editor</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Provided a sample theme file that allows you to customise the look of a single product page (without this the single product page will use your theme default page)</li>\n<li>Made the image in the shop optionally clickable as well as the buy now button and the banner &#8211; new option in settings</li>\n<li>Fixed the CSS in the admin pannel for the shortcode helper box to match the new 3.8 admin look and feel</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a helper button for inserting short codes into pages and posts so you don&#8217;t have to remember any codes. Look for the new button in the editor toolbar when creating or editing a page or post. Click on this button and a popup will appear to help you select if you want a shop, product or inline image. The correct shortcode will be automatically added to your page or post at the current cursor position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where the bottom pagination link for a page 1 went to the last product on the page rather than the first page of products (props Roger for bringing it to my attention). This only effects you if you are using pagination displayed at the bottom of a page of products.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added pagination so you can set how many products show per page. This can be overwritten at the shortcode level</li>\n<li>Changed the title of each product to a link to the product single page to allow customisation of pages for SEO if desired</li>\n<li>Added a filter so you can override the pagination if required for your theme</li>\n<li>Added more helpful comments on the &#8216;image not local&#8217; warning</li>\n<li>Added support for shortcodes in the description, cost, testimonial and customer fields</li>\n<li>Fix for help tab not showing in settings if you are using another plugin that customises menus</li>\n<li>Added support for localisation and translation &#8211; if you can assist with translating the plugin into your language then please get in touch</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed problem where you may have to refresh permalinks on installation to make individual product pages display</li>\n<li>Removed forcing the color of the shop h2 header so it will now use your theme color (retained the dotted separator)</li>\n<li>Added additional CSS elements to shop image to allow easier customisation (pg-sas-image)</li>\n<li>Added a new shortcode to allow an image inline to a post or page (see settings menu help tab)</li>\n<li>Changed CSS class &#8216;orange&#8217; to &#8216;a.pg-sas-orange&#8217; to avoid clashes</li>\n<li>Added full set of color buttons from  <a href=\"http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css3-gradient-buttons\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Web Designer Wall</a></li>\n<li>\n<p>Added an optional &#8216;hover image&#8217; for the banner that can be used with or in place of the banner buy now button</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have moved pg-sas.css to your theme then please merge the changes to your version and also remember to copy the clickhere.png image to your theme (or replace the image to one of your choice)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow HTML markup in the description and testimonial fields</li>\n<li>Make a new lines in the description or testimonial field show as an HTML break</li>\n<li>Check in the theme folder for the stylesheet first to allow for easier customisation by users</li>\n<li>Changed markup of testimonial quotations to allow easier overriding to match user&#8217;s theme</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 1.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
