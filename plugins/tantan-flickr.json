There is a pretty simple template provided which you can customize to 100% match the look and feel of your own site.</p>\n<p>The plugin is customizable in a number of different ways. There are options to allow you to hook it up with a number of different Lightbox-style popup overlay display libraries. Third party commenting services such as Disqus are also supported, allowing your visitors to comment on your photos without hopping over to Flickr.com. A simple Flickr widget is also included to let you easily include your photos into your blog&#8217;s sidebar.</p>\n<p>On the backend, this plugin will add a new Flickr icon to your WordPress edit screen which will allow you to easily insert your Flickr photos and albums into your blog posts with just a couple clicks. You can either have your inserted photos link back to your WordPress Flickr photo album or directly to your Flickr.com photo page.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>If you need more help installing and customizing templates, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/photo-album/wiki/Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">see here for more information</a>.
