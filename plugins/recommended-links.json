        "changelog": "<h4>0.4.2</h4>\n<p>Fixes a couple of bugs relating to displaying the plugin&#8217;s widgets on a page that includes a comments query (the author and the score of all links in the widget would be taken from the last comment displayed on the page.</p>\n<p>Also, includes an option to allow unregistered users to post for the the first time.</p>\n<h4>0.4.1</h4>\n<p>Fixes pagination bug when reclinks archive is set to front page and bug in install hook function.</p>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<p>This update fleshes out a number of functions that were introduced in earlier versions, and introduces a bookmarklet that can be used for easier submission of links.</p>\n<h4>0.3.5</h4>\n<p>I fixed term archives so that your recommended links archive page can be sorted by term; if you have categories enabled for links, try adding <code>?category=yourcategoryname</code> to the URL for your archive page. Also fixed issue with adding non-hierarchical taxonomies to reclinks, and fixed the loop on archive pages (reset the query after the recommended loops link) so that it doesn&#8217;t mess up any secondary loops on the page.</p>\n<h4>0.3.4</h4>\n<p>I broke posting of new links in the last update&#8230; this is just a quick fix to correct that. More changes to come soon.</p>\n<h4>0.3.3</h4>\n<p>Several bugfixes; added &#8220;vote on comments&#8221; option and styling for buttons.</p>\n<h4>0.3.2</h4>\n<p>Fixed a number of &#8220;missing index&#8221; bugs that caused error messages on first activation of the plugin.</p>\n<h4>0.3.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed bug relating to empty taxonomy array on first install.</p>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<p>Added multiple new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin settings page</li>\n<li>Link title now auto-populates from the link URL, so users don&#8217;t have to enter it by hand</li>\n<li>Shortcode for link add form</li>\n<li>Allows you to set an existing page as the archive, rather than use the WP archive page</li>\n<li>Option to allow unregistered users to vote (tracks votes by IP address)</li>\n<li>User karma functions &#8211; not in UI yet; but roughed out. Use function <code>author_karma( $user )</code> to get a user&#8217;s score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, fixed a couple bugs and roughed out the plugin to prepare for a number of other features in the works.</p>\n<h4>0.2.2</h4>\n<p>Added a widget to display the most recently posted links in the sidebar. Also, fixed some minor javascript and css errors.</p>\n<h4>0.2.1</h4>\n<p>Implemented four new sorting options to the recommended links archive page: &#8220;newest&#8221;, &#8220;hot&#8221;, &#8220;current&#8221;, and &#8220;score&#8221;. Also fixed minor bug in resolving symlinked plugin directory</p>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<p>This is the first initial public release. This uses a custom post type, rather than trying to do everything through custom tables and functions.</p>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<p>I built a version 0.1 back in 2010 for a personal project, which was only half complete (most of the functions necessary to run the plugin were mixed in with theme files, and functionality was very limited.)</p>\n"
