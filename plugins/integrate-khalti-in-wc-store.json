To do an automatic install of Integrate Khalti in WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;Integrate Khalti in WooCommerce&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our payment gateway plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading our Integrate Khalti in WC Store plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">instructions on how to do this here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n<p>Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.</p>\n",
