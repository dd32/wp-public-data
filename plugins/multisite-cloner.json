SELECT</code> to copy <em>every</em> table from the &#8220;master&#8221; blog into the new one. This is fast!</li>\n<li>Then it does a search and replace on the new blog&#8217;s tables, to replace the old URL with the new one.<br />\nThis is done in a way that respects serialized arrays, so your plugin&#8217;s settings will be preserved.<br />\n(We used a heavily trimmed down version of Interconnect/IT&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/interconnectit/Search-Replace-DB\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Search and Replace</a> tool for that, so go thank them for this!)</li>\n<li>It proceeds to copy all files from the <code>wp-content/uploads</code> dir of your master blog into the new one&#8217;s, so that all assets will work as expected.</li>\n<li>Finally it does some house clean-up, updating the new blog&#8217;s title, admin email, and user roles as needed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Go check the screenshots, it&#8217;s really simple and does what it says.<br />\nGive it a try!</p>\n<p><em>This plugin was handcrafted with love and â€˜yerba mateâ€™ by the team at <a href=\"http://www.tipit.net/\" title=\"Sustainable Web development since 1996 in Austin, Texas\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Tipit.net</a>.</em></p>\n",
