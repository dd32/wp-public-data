Here is a <a href=\"https://pixeline.be/blog/email-protector-demo-4258.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">demo</a>.</p>\n<p>Post/page authors may write email addresses in their article in the usual format (&#8220;john@doe.com&#8221;) without exposing them to spam email harvesters. The plugin takes care of the obfuscation, implementing a graceful degradation technique focusing on usability so as to protect your email addresses from harvesters while keeping them usable to your human visitors.</p>\n<p>The plugin replaces any email address found in posts, pages, comments and excerpts, and replace them by a bit of html markup that should deceive most email harvesters: <code>&lt;span class=\"email\"&gt;john(replace the parenthesis by @)doe.com&lt;/span&gt;</code>.<br />\nIf javascript is available, it will display a clickable link and display the original email to the human user.

When the plugin is activated, it will replace them by a human-readable html string that explains how to deduce the email address, and if javascript is available (99.9% of the time), the original email address will be displayed as a clickable mailto: link. For example:<br />\n    Hello john@doe.com. How are you today?<br />\nwill become<br />\n    John( replace these parenthesis by @ )doe.com.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can specify what the mailto: link should look like by sticking a parenthesis inside of which you put the visible link text, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Hello john@doe.com(John Doe). How are you today?  \n</code></pre>\n<p>will become<br />\n    John( replace these parenthesis by @ )doe.com.</p>\n<h4>inside a theme</h4>\n<p>If you need to protect emails inside your Theme&#8217;s files (like the footer.php for example), you can use the function safe_email() like this:</p>\n<pre><code> echo safe_email('you@domain.com'); &lt;h3&gt;Contribute&lt;/h3&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Github repo: https://github.com/pixeline/pixeline-email-protector</p>\n",
