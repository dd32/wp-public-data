Repeating this process again every time they wish to authenticate.</p>\n<p>If, like me, you use secure passwords generated by Safari or Chrome, you&#8217;ll never remember them. To shorten this workflow, an email is sent to your account (if an account is found by the specified email) with a link to log in, this link is only valid for one time use, and is only valid for 5 minutes. The code in the URL is generated by WP password generation.</p>\n<p>Please note, that for all intents and purposes this does not conform to the specification of multi-factor authentication, as we do not verify the password of the user (this would defeat the point of the plugin), instead for two factor authentication we suggest using WordFence (we&#8217;d advise putting this on your site anyway, to protect security and authentication).</p>\n",
