You can then serve that media through a CDN like Amazon Cloud front, Cloudflare, Fastly and others.</p>\n<p>Beyond cloud storage, Media Cloud also has deep integration with Imgix, the leading real-time image manipulation and optimization CDN.  Media Cloud is the first plugin for WordPress to bring the full benefit of what Imgix offers &#8211; simplifying your development efforts, reducing your site’s page load times and opening up creative options that simply haven’t existed until now.</p>\n<p>Media Cloud also provides advanced image editing tools that provide improved cropping options, effects, filters, watermarking and more.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This plugin requires PHP 7.1 or higher</p>\n<h4>Upload to S3, Cloudflare R2, Minio, Google Cloud Storage, Digital Ocean Spaces, DreamHost Object Storage and others</h4>\n<p>Automatically copy media uploads to the cloud and serve them directly from your cloud storage provider, CloudFront or any other CDN.</p>\n<h4>Video Encoding with Mux</h4>\n<p>Upload videos and encode them nearly instantly to adaptive bitrate HLS that plays back smoothly and beautifully on any device regardless of bandwidth.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20compare%20to%20wp%20offload%20media%3F'>\nHow does this compare to WP Offload Media?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP Offload Media provides a very small subset of everything Media Cloud provides.</p>\n<p>This plugin is an essential part of our own development stack when creating WordPress solutions for our clients and as client needs grow around media, and dealing with media in WordPress, Media Cloud gains new features and improvements.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20imgix%3F'>\nWhy should I use Imgix?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the headaches of managing a WordPress site is dealing with server disk space.  If you just use the S3 functionality of this plugin, you are already one step ahead.  Using S3, all of your media is centrally located in one place that you can then distribute through a high performing content delivery network to improve page load speeds for your site.  You also don&#8217;t have to worry about disk space on your servers anymore.</p>\n<p>Imgix is a content delivery network with a twist.  In addition to distributing your media, it also allows you to edit them, in real-time. and deliver the edited version through their CDN without altering the original.  Want to add a new image size to your theme?  You can do this with Imgix without having to use a plugin to recut all of your existing media to this new size.  Imgix optimizes format delivery and a bunch of other things.  It&#8217;s seriously the greatest thing to happen to WordPress and web development in the history of ever.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

This is probably a moving target  feature wise.</li>\n<li>Also note that this works differently then Bunny&#8217;s WordPress plugin.  Bunny&#8217;s plugin works via pull where Media Cloud is  push (it uploads your media to Bunny CDN).  Which way is better is up to you to decide, though you can&#8217;t use Bunny&#8217;s plugin in a dev environment or on a localhost during dev.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Added documentation for Bunny CDN</li>\n<li>Fixed Migrate to Mux task.</li>\n<li>Migrating media now migrates .webp and .avif files regardless of what plugin generated them.</li>\n<li>Fixes for some PHP 8.2 errors and notices.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.27 &#8211; 03/13/2024</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for assets tool where bucket name appears in URL.</li>\n<li>PUSH Asset mode deprecated.

Only use this<br />\nif you are using a strict IAM policy that prevents Media Cloud from verifying your settings.</li>\n<li>System compatibility test now takes upload prefix into account when testing cloud storage</li>\n<li>Deprecate Wasabi.  Wasabi is not a suitable cloud storage provider for Media Cloud&#8217;s purpose.  If you are using Wasabi currently,<br />\nnothing will change.  If you are not using Wasabi, you will not be able to add it as a cloud storage provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.23 &#8211; 09/07/2023</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive performance improvement for multisite.</li>\n<li>Some fixes for PHP 8.2.

Please update ASAP.</li>\n<li>Added missing us-west-1 region to Rekognition</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.20 &#8211; 12/12/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Media Cloud can now offload elementor form submission uploads to cloud storage.  You must enable this in the <strong>Integrations</strong><br />\nsettings. (Premium)</li>\n<li>Added a task <strong>Migrated Elementor Forms</strong> to migrate existing form submission uploads to cloud storage. (Premium)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.19 &#8211; 12/9/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>--skip-processed</code> flag to <code>mediacloud:storage makewebp</code> command to skip any attachments that already have webp<br />\nmetadata associated with them. (Premium)</li>\n<li>Added a setting to <em>Cloud Storage</em> settings called <em>Force WebP</em> that forces Media Cloud to return .webp urls for images<br />\nthat have webp metadata associated with them.  Note this does not do any sort of content negotiation or browser<br />\nsniffing, it simply returns the webp url for the image.  Consider that only IE 11 and much older versions of Safari<br />\ndo not support webp.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.17 &#8211; 12/8/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>wp mediacloud:storage syncAllLocal</code> command to download all cloud storage files to your local server.</li>\n<li>Added integration for WPForms to automatically upload files to the cloud.

EWWW Image Optimization<br />\nplugin must be installed and activated and working in local mode (NOT cloud mode).  (Premium)</li>\n<li>Added <code>wp mediacloud:storage makewebp</code> command to generate webp files using EWWW (see above).

This only works for S3 and S3<br />\ncompatible cloud storage.  If you are using Google, you will have to set that up manually.</li>\n<li>When upgrading from Leopard Offload, your links will be migrated as needed, but you can manually run a background<br />\ntask to do them all in one go.</li>\n<li>If using Leopard Offload with WooCommerce, after migrating to Media Cloud you must run the command line<br />\ntool <code>wp mediacloud:integrations fixLeopardWooLinks</code> to replace the weird link shortcode that Leopard Offload uses.<br />\nThis tool is only in the premium version.  (Premium)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.12 &#8211; 11/25/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Workaround for a bug in Fluent Forms when Fluent Support is integrated with Fluent Forms, for example when you are<br />\ncreating tickets in Fluent Support via a Fluent Form.

This<br />\nbug seems to be with the AWS SDK MultiRegionClient and not with Media Cloud.</li>\n<li>Fixed another AWS SDK MultiRegionClient bug where the path style endpoint setting was being ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.7 &#8211; 11/07/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed internal help links</li>\n<li>Updated support links (bye bye Freshdesk!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.6 &#8211; 11/04/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>(Premium) Integration for Fluent Forms plugin.

Offloads ticket attachments to cloud storage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.5 &#8211; 10/31/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Admin notices are now only shown to users with the <code>manage_options</code> capability.</li>\n<li>(Premium) Direct Uploads for Cloudflare R2 has been implemented.  <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: You must set up CORS on your bucket<br />\nand that process is mildly convoluted.  Please see this video tutorial for more information:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4Q0WQVNUI</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.4 &#8211; 10/29/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for assets tool in push mode</li>\n<li>Added option for assets tool in pull mode to process rendered page to force assets to be pulled from CDN for scripts<br />\nand styles that are included on the page in non-standard ways</li>\n<li>New assets tool tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYHHjO27tng</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.3 &#8211; 10/15/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for compatability issue with WP All Import Pro</li>\n<li>Added new Wasabi regions</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.2 &#8211; 10/15/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for compatability issue with Presto Player</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.1 &#8211; 10/11/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration for WP All Import Pro.  When enabled, during an import, Media Cloud will not process any images imported<br />\nduring the process.  This is to prevent the import from timing out.  After the import is complete, a Migrate to Cloud<br />\nStorage task is run to move the imported media to the cloud.</li>\n<li>Image Optimization will not work with the WP All Import Pro integration.  It&#8217;s recommended that you use the EWWW plugin<br />\nfor image optimization if that&#8217;s something you need.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5.0 &#8211; 10/7/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for Cloudflare Storage R2.</li>\n<li>Cloudflare R2 does not support direct uploads though we will be working on it in the future.</li>\n<li>R2 also does not support signed URLs, but that is a limitation of R2 and not Media Cloud&#8217;s integration with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.4 &#8211; 10/7/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The video player front-end javascript files are now only included on pages that use the player.  If you run into<br />\nissues with this, you can set a toggle in the settings to always include the scripts.  Note that for Elementor users,<br />\nthe player scripts are always included because there isn&#8217;t a reliable mechanism to tell if a player is being used on<br />\na page before it&#8217;s too late to enqueue the scripts.  You can blame Elementor for this.</li>\n<li>The elementor video player widget was removed from the previous version on accident, it has been included again.</li>\n<li>Fix for asset tool</li>\n<li>Fix for <code>block_categories</code> deprecation warning (thanks @joshuafredrickson)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.3 &#8211; 10/5/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to specify colors for video.js player in the Video Player settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.2 &#8211; 10/2/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes for PHP 8.x compatibility</li>\n<li>Implement changing poster image for video files</li>\n<li>Fixed how additional buttons are displayed on attachment detail pages</li>\n<li>Fixed downloading video with video player</li>\n<li>Fix for getting rendition URL for mux encoded videos</li>\n<li>Updated video.js library to 7.20.3</li>\n<li>Updated related video.js plugins to latest versions</li>\n<li>Fix mux transfer task to work with large files and give better feedback.  Note: Mux transfers wait until the mp4<br />\nrenditions are encoded by mux before transferring.  This can take a while for large files.</li>\n<li>Remove preflight admin notice</li>\n<li>Added support for Supabase Storage.  This support is only provided for specific development scenarios, you should not<br />\nuse Supabase Storage for general purpose storage because you think it&#8217;s inexpensive.  Supabase Storage support is for<br />\nwhen you need to <em>integrate</em> with an application already using Supabase.</li>\n<li>Added a new <code>Transfer Mux Video</code> task that allows you to transfer encoded videos from Mux to cloud or local storage to serve the videos from other services and CDNs instead of Mux.  Use Mux to encode, serve the result elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Added a <code>Regenerate Filmstrip</code> task to generate new filmstrips for Mux encoded videos that might not have had them generated.</li>\n<li>The Gutenberg block now supports outputting the video&#8217;s dimension to insure that there isn&#8217;t any reflow on document load.</li>\n<li>Fixed INFO log messages with regards to PHP 8.1.</li>\n<li>Transferred Mux videos display HLS logo instead of the Mux logo in the media library.</li>\n<li>In the list view in the Media Library, the Mux or HLS logo is now displayed.</li>\n<li>The <code>Relink Mux Video</code> task will relink any videos that were transferred with the <code>Transfer Mux Video</code> task unless they&#8217;ve been deleted on Mux.</li>\n<li>You can setup Media Cloud to automatically transfer Mux encoded videos to local or cloud storage after they&#8217;ve finished being encoded by Mux.</li>\n<li>Added <code>wp mediacloud:video transfer</code> command to transfer videos from Mux to cloud or local storage.</li>\n<li>Added <code>wp mediacloud:video relink</code> command to relink videos that were transferred from Mux to local or cloud storage.</li>\n<li>Added toggle to <code>Video Player</code> settings to replace the WordPress admin default video player with the native video player using HLS.js.  This allows you to preview Mux encoded videos in the admin without having to create a post.</li>\n<li>Added toggle to override the default WordPress video shortcode and replace it with the Media Cloud Video Player.  You should, however, consider switching to the Media Cloud Video Player shortcode instead because it performs better.</li>\n<li>The Elementor Media Cloud Video Player widget now supports playing non-Mux videos.</li>\n<li>Added <code>hls</code> object to WP REST Attachment object that includes the playlist url, poster image url, filmstrip url, width, height, duration, mp4 fallback rendition url and subtitles.</li>\n<li>Added the ability to add captions (via a VTT text file) to any video, regardless if it&#8217;s Mux encoded or not.  This feature is available on the edit detail screen for a video attachment.  You must be using the Media Cloud Video Player feature.</li>\n<li>Removed <code>yuloh/bccomp-polyfill</code> dependency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.4.0 &#8211; 4/7/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This release has a breaking change if you are using the <strong>Mux/Video Encoding</strong> feature.  If you are using the video.js or hls.js video player, you will need to enable the separate <em>Video Player</em> feature to continue using those players.  There will be a notification in WordPress admin warning you about this, but only if it applies to you.</li>\n<li>Upgraded video.js player to latest 7.19.0</li>\n<li>Upgraded hls.js player to latest 1.1.5</li>\n<li>Separated the video player into it&#8217;s own feature from the video encoding feature.</li>\n<li>Video player now supports playing any uploaded videos, not just Mux encoded videos.</li>\n<li>You can now allow video downloads for logged in users only in <em>Video Player Settings</em></li>\n<li>The Video Player gutenberg block allows you to override the download setting for an individual video.</li>\n<li>Filmstrip generation can now be enabled regardless of video player in use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.11 &#8211; 3/8/2022</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new option to imgix to disable <code>urlencode()</code> the filename which may cause issues for certain unicode characters in filenames.

Now, you can now upload PDFs of any size without issues (subject to WordPress and web server limitations).</li>\n<li>PDF upload speed should be greatly improved.
