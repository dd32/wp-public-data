        "faq": "\n<h4>I&#8217;m not a developer, can I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably not. You&#8217;re going to need some technical experience to migrate your site properly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I import the file I downloaded into my WP Multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need access to a database client that can perform writes to your WP database. You can use PHPMyAdmin, or run the raw SQL on the commandline using the <em>mysql</em> client and running the <em>source</em> command.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I download the images and files in my media library so I can upload them to my multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need access to your server to get these files easily. Use FTP or SSH into your server to zip wp-content/uploads so you can download to your Multisite server. You could also make use of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/\" rel=\"ugc\">All-in-One WP Migration plugin</a> to export just the files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make sure the correct themes and plugins are setup on my multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s likely easiest to just freshly install the themes and plugins on your Multisite. If you have a custom theme or plugin on your standalone site, you will need to copy it over the same way you copied your media files.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will a future version of this plugin make it easier for me to export my media files, themes and plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>Maybe</em>. This plugin was created in haste to tackle a problem that wasn&#8217;t already solved by some other plugin like the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Migrate DB</a> plugin or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/\" rel=\"ugc\">All-in-One WP Migration plugin</a> plugin. These plugins both suggest they have a PRO version coming that offers multisite migration. This plugin will always remain Free however.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
