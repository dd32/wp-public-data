This personalization enhances the user experience and increases the likelihood that the visitor will convert into a buyer.</p>\n<h3>5Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Rules for Non Intrusive Popup Display</h3>\n<p>Great deals and valuable content are key, but bombarding visitors with them can backfire. To avoid this, Claspo offers high-end approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Silence Interval</strong></p>\n<p>Be sure that your visitors can focus on your content without feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The default time gap between widget displays in Claspo is 3 minutes.</li>\n<li>Easily adjust it based on typical user behavior on your site ensuring a smooth browsing experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Overlapping Protection</strong></p>\n<p>Managing multiple widgets can be complicated. Claspo&#8217;s automatic overlapping protection eliminates the worry of them clashing on your visitors&#8217; screens, even if you duplicate display rules for several widgets by mistake.</p>\n<h3>6Ô∏è‚É£ Reliable WordPress Plugin with Wide Integration Options</h3>\n<p>The Claspo plugin will not conflict with your other plugins. Also we guarantee there will be no bugs after updating your WordPress version.</p>\n<p>Seamlessly integrate our pop-up builder with a wide range of popular CRM, ESP, and CDP systems, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/mailchimp/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mailchimp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/mailerlite/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MailerLite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/hubspot/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">HubSpot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/salesforce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Salesforce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/klaviyo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Klaviyo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/getresponse/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GetResponse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://claspo.io/sendgrid/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SendGrid</a></li>\n<li>and many <a href=\"https://claspo.io/integrations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">more</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Create a Popup in Less than 5 Minutes</h3>\n<p>And your next popups will take even less time‚Ä¶</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yo71dtDSshQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Select the Perfect Template</strong></p>\n<p>Choose a ready-made template or create one from scratch. Using a template will save you time and give you confidence in the quality of your design. Using filters such as use-case, layout, industry, and theme, you can choose the template that best suits your purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Customize the Template for Your Brand</strong></p>\n<p>Choose a color scheme that matches your brand book or website style. Write text and change images by adding your own or selecting from our library.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Set the Rules for Displaying the Widget</strong></p>\n<p>The optimal rules for displaying pop-ups are set in the system by default. However, you can customize them to meet your specific needs and objectives. For example, choose to show the widget only to newcomers or residents of a selected city, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Integrate Claspo with Marketing Automation Software</strong></p>\n<p>For example, you can add integration with your ESP with a couple of clicks. Copy a single line of code from our system and add it to the admin panel of your email marketing automation platform. You won&#8217;t need this step for all your future widgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Publish it!</strong></p>\n<p>You can test drive the completed widget without publishing it on your website. If everything is fine, publish it and track conversions and revenue!</p>\n<h3>Drive Business Growth with Claspo üöÄ</h3>\n<p>Ready to enhance your audience engagement and streamline your marketing efforts?

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%27s%20included%20in%20the%20free%20claspo%20plan%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s Included in the Free Claspo Plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Claspo&#8217;s fair free plan provides everything you need to get started with pop-ups on your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Three active widgets. You can create and use up to three pop-up widgets on your website at any given time. This allows you to test different pop-up designs and target them to specific audiences.</li>\n<li>30,000 pageviews per month. This is suitable for new websites and those with moderate traffic. If you exceed this limit, you can purchase additional pageviews without upgrading your plan.</li>\n<li>Access to Claspo‚Äôs full range of features and templates.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20are%20pageviews%20calculated%3F'>\nHow are Pageviews Calculated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Pageviews refer to the number of times a user visits the pages where the Claspo script is installed.</p>\n<p>The Claspo tracking module counts a pageview whenever a page is loaded or the URL path (the segments before the question mark) changes. For instance, if a user navigates to a different page and then returns to the original page, each visit is counted as a separate pageview. Additionally, if a user reloads a page, it counts as an additional pageview.</p>\n<p>However, a pageview is not counted when only the query component of a page URL changes (the part after the question mark). For example, if a user applies or changes filters on your page and the URL path remains the same, this does not count as a new pageview.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20an%20expiration%20date%20on%20the%20free%20plan%3F'>\nIs There an Expiration Date on the Free Plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No! Claspo&#8217;s free plan is truly free for life. There are no hidden fees or time constraints. You can use it for as long as it meets your needs.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a solo entrepreneur just starting out or a small business looking to test the waters of pop-up marketing, the free plan is a great place to begin. It allows you to experiment with Claspo&#8217;s features and see the positive impact pop-ups can have on your website&#8217;s performance at your own pace.</p>\n<p>If your website grows or you need more advanced features, you can always upgrade to a paid plan later.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20save%20money%20on%20claspo%E2%80%99s%20paid%20plans%3F'>\nHow Can I Save Money on Claspo‚Äôs Paid Plans?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Claspo rewards your commitment!

Using a template will save you time and give you confidence in the quality of your design. Using filters such as use-case, layout, industry, and theme, you can choose the template that best suits your purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Customize the Template for Your Brand</strong></p>\n<p>Choose a color scheme that matches your brand book or website style. Write text and change images by adding your own or selecting from our library.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Set the Rules for Displaying the Widget</strong></p>\n<p>The optimal rules for displaying pop-ups are set in the system by default. However, you can customize them to meet your specific needs and objectives. For example, choose to show the widget only to newcomers or residents of a selected city, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Integrate Claspo with Marketing Automation Software</strong></p>\n<p>For example, you can add integration with your ESP with a couple of clicks. Copy a single line of code from our system and add it to the admin panel of your email marketing automation platform. You won&#8217;t need this step for all your future widgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Publish it!</strong></p>\n<p>You can test drive the completed widget without publishing it on your website. If everything is fine, publish it and track conversions and revenue!</p>\n<h3>Drive Business Growth with Claspo üöÄ</h3>\n<p>Ready to enhance your audience engagement and streamline your marketing efforts?
