        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<h3>Automatically</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Search for Payments for Elementor in the Add New Plugin section of the WordPress admin</li>\n<li>Install &amp; Activate</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Manually</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the zip file and upload <code>payments-for-elementor</code> to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nHow do I use this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, install and activate the plugin.</p>\n<p>Next, configure your global payment settings. These are found in your wp-admin, under Payments &#8211;&gt; Settings. This is where you connect your Stripe account, and set things like your currency and statement descriptor.</p>\n<p>Finally, open the Elementor panel for any page on your website. Add a Payment Form widget, and configure the settings for your payment form. Here, you&#8217;ll add a price, description for the payment, redirect URL, and more.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDo you offer support for this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have any questions or need any help, please get in touch with us on <a href=\"https://elegantmodules.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow does Payments for Elementor compare to WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WooCommerce and EDD are great, but they are not &#8220;small&#8221; plugins. WooCommerce, for example, adds a lot of options to your database, and loads large stylesheets and scripts on the frontend of your website. If you don&#8217;t need features like shipping, inventory management, etc., WooCommerce may be overkill for your website.</p>\n<p>Payments for Elementor is very lightweight. Its purpose is to provide simple, minimal, and flexible e-commerce features that won&#8217;t impact the performance of your website. You also won&#8217;t need to add a bunch of add-ons to your website, keeping the number of plugins running to a minimum.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat happens if I refund my customers? Do you refund your fee?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you refund your customer, we refund our fee proportionally (if you refund 50% of the cost, we refund 50% of our fee).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow is my data used?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stripe.com/privacy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Stripe</a> &#8211; Payments for Elementor sends customer data to Stripe to create customer records for users who submit payments through Payments for Elementor. Your customers will have customer records in Stripe, which are attached to your Stripe account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://elegantmodules.com/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Elegant Modules</a> &#8211; Payments for Elementor submits payment and customer data to an external API owned and maintained by us, Elegant Modules, for the purpose of generating the required payment data with Stripe. This data is <strong>not</strong> saved on the our servers. <strong>We do not store any customer or payment data.</strong> The data we send to Stripe is used by Stripe to process the customer&#8217;s payment. Customer and payment data is stored only on Stripe and your website.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
