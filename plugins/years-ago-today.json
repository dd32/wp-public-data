By default this value is false, meaning no email is sent in such circumstances.</li>\n<li><code>c2c_years_ago_today-email-body-no-posts</code> : Customize the content of the body of the daily Years Ago Today email when it is sent on days that had no posts in prior years. </li>\n<li><code>c2c_years_ago_today-first_published_year</code> : Explicitly define the earliest year to be considered when finding earlier published posts.</li>\n</ul>\n",
