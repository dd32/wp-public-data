You can then use the image in various ways:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a shortcode. Put [cptImage] wherever you want the image to appear. Not that in this usage (without a parameter) it will only appear when you are on a single item of that custom post type OR in the archive page itself. To call any attached image, use [cptImage cpt=&#8221;Custom Post Type Name&#8221;].</p>\n<p>In PHP in your template. To retrieve the image url to a variable, use get_cptimage_image($optionalname, $echo) (you can use get_cptimage_image(&#8220;Custom Post Type Name&#8221;) to retrieve a specific post type image, or get_cptimage_image(&#8220;Custom Post Type Name&#8221;, true) to echo the url rather than retrieving it. To merely display the image, call cptimage_image(&#8220;Custom Post type Name&#8221;) or simply cptimage_image(). Not that if you do not pass a post type name it will only appear when you are on a single item of that custom post type OR in the archive page itself.</p>\n<p>Please note, as with every plugin or theme modification, you should do a backup of your files beforehand.  Although we&#8217;ve tested this across many installs, we are not responsible for anything it does to your system and do not guarantee support.</p>\n",
