        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20is%20the%20plugin%20necessary%3F'>\nWhy is the plugin necessary?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Core can&#8217;t guarantee that CSS is properly sanitized when saving it in the database, and the associated capabilities for managing CSS are equivalent to those for posting unfiltered html. Site admins do not have this capability, so they can&#8217;t manage CSS as a result. However, in most cases this is an acceptable tradeoff for providing custom CSS to site admins, particularly on trusted networks (open networks are encouraged to take greater precautions and consider other solutions besides this plugin). Note that super admins can access custom CSS for any site on the network without this plugin.</p>\n<p>Because this plugin only provides access to a core feature for more users, all feature requests and non-capability-related support questions apply to WordPress core and not this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
