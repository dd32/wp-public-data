Using the plugin requires that you create a ZIP file of the <em>contents</em> of your <code>publish_to_web folder</code>; don&#8217;t zip the folder itself. You&#8217;ll then upload that zip, and be given both full embed code, and a short form you can use for inserting the slideshow. I&#8217;d recommend using the full embed code; the editor that comes with WordPress strips out the short tag if you switch between source and visual views.</p>\n<p>The code for the plugin isn&#8217;t as pretty as it could be; if it turns out to be popular, I&#8217;ll clean it up. The plugin outputs HTML, not XHTML. I&#8217;m a firm believer in not using XHTML for general purpose Web sites.</p>\n<p>Let me know of any problems: jj56@indiana.edu</p>\n",
