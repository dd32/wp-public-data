This integration significantly reduces complexity, saves time, and improves the effectiveness of SEO initiatives.</p>\n<p>You can start implementing Holistic SEO, driven with the power of two different AIs we have in the free version of Squirrly SEO.</p>\n<p>This is the AI SEO Plugin you were looking for.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Google is analyzing more ranking factors than ever. We know that because our custom-built AI, called Ranking Vision AI, keeps learning and adapting the scores we reference inside our SaaS+plugin setup.</p>\n<p>If you only work on one aspect, for example: technical SEO, your SEO just won&#8217;t work. &#8211; this was possible years ago, but no longer possible with today&#8217;s Google algorithm updates.</p>\n<p>You need a Holistic approach to win, and you need to take good care of all your marketing aspects.

that simplifies complexity, making it the go-to solution for business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>SEO is complex because Google wants it to be (and let&#8217;s be honest for a moment: it needs it to be).</p>\n<p>Remember a few months ago when everyone tried to game the FAQ schemas? &#8211; they figured it out and removed them.</p>\n<p>In 2024, SEO is not a one trick pony anymore. SEO can be completely NOT overwhelming at all if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You don&#8217;t (yes, do not) do SEO the right way and focus only on meta tags or getting rich snippets for the site. Or any of these: &#8220;I need to do only one thing approaches.&#8221; &#8211; it won&#8217;t be overwhelming, but it won&#8217;t help you either. Good luck ranking like that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You use the Next SEO Goals feature from your Squirrly SEO, and only work on what&#8217;s needed, when it&#8217;s needed, using exactly the tools it tells you to use. &#8211; which is the smart way of working on your SEO, backed by real data, not guesswork and weird luck.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goals are tailored to each site and set of focus pages you choose (for real; many claim this, but they don&#8217;t have any system in place).</p>\n<p>And then you get to be walked through all the complexities analyzed by Focus Pages (which take you from basic SEO to actual Holistic SEO, so you can use the full force to your advantage). However, with Next SEO Goals you&#8217;ll be able to fully focus on the next step that drives bigger rankings.</p>\n<p>The people who were successful with Squirrly SEO have used the Next SEO Goals to work on what matters (because our systems analyze data from WP and also from many of our cloud services). Some of them have even gone through the 14 Days Journey to learn more about SEO.</p>\n<p>They have chosen option number 2.</p>\n<p>When you look at this table, where you see that your version of Squirrly SEO does a lot more than Ahrefs (for the usecases we target), SEMrush, Yoast, Rank Math, it may feel overwhelming.</p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be if you start working with the AI Consultant we&#8217;ve built.</p>\n<p>You can use Squirrly SEO on easy mode or on hard mode. It&#8217;s up to you and your skill level.</p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t worry: using it on easy mode will get you plenty results. Once you learn more about SEO, you&#8217;ll be able to use more of the tools inside and make more customizations.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s SaaS+plugin. Our plugin loads fast, and the real heavy lifting is done by our company&#8217;s servers, not yours. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t use one of the tools right now. It doesn&#8217;t cost you &#8220;compute&#8221; &#8211; I hate that term, but it&#8217;s so fresh.</p>\n<p>In the beginning: stick with the Next SEO Goals and if you&#8217;re a bit more advanced work on your Holistic SEO with Focus Pages and focus on turning red elements to green.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how you win. &#8211; Focus Pages is the way, once you get to know Squirrly SEO better. Ranking Vision AI powers its Chances of Ranking score, and I think it&#8217;s the only AI of its kind.</p>\n<h3>In fact, Squirrly covers everything you need to optimize and be successful with WordPress SEO.</h3>\n<p><strong>Over 650 features pre-configured for you during install</strong>, so that you don&#8217;t have to work on configurations!</p>\n<p>Check out every single feature you can get inside: <a title=\"All Features\" href=\"https://seotools.completeseofunnel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Every single feature</a></p>\n<p>Squirrly SEO has all important settings done for you right as you start and complete the setup wizard.</p>\n<p>No need to go back and forth between tabs to do keyword research, create SEO content, completely optimize your website and pages, and track their SEO performance.</p>\n<p>SEO optimization has never been easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Safely migrate your data</strong> to Squirrly SEO from any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rank Math, Yoast, All in One SEO, SEO Framework, SEO Press, SEO Pressor, Add Meta Tags Plugin, Gregs High Performance SEO, Headspace 2, Platinum SEO Pack, SEO Title Tags, SEO Ultimate Plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re new to SEO like me, some dark corners of content optimization can be hard to figure out.

Furthermore, our keyword research data is fresh, since we don’t use caching (cached databases).</p>\n<p>Maximum caching time is about 48 hours, not a whole year or two years like you find in other tools.</p>\n<p>As we use Google API for search volume, Social Media for discussions, the data should be fresh every time and this is why it is different from others – and also why the data we show is different from what you may find in other keyword research tools who use caching for their data.

that simplifies complexity, making it the go-to solution for business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>SEO is complex because Google wants it to be (and let&#8217;s be honest for a moment: it needs it to be).</p>\n<p>Remember a few months ago when everyone tried to game the FAQ schemas? &#8211; they figured it out and removed them.</p>\n<p>In 2024, SEO is not a one trick pony anymore. SEO can be completely NOT overwhelming at all if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You don&#8217;t (yes, do not) do SEO the right way and focus only on meta tags or getting rich snippets for the site. Or any of these: &#8220;I need to do only one thing approaches.&#8221; &#8211; it won&#8217;t be overwhelming, but it won&#8217;t help you either. Good luck ranking like that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You use the Next SEO Goals feature from your Squirrly SEO, and only work on what&#8217;s needed, when it&#8217;s needed, using exactly the tools it tells you to use. &#8211; which is the smart way of working on your SEO, backed by real data, not guesswork and weird luck.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goals are tailored to each site and set of focus pages you choose (for real; many claim this, but they don&#8217;t have any system in place).</p>\n<p>And then you get to be walked through all the complexities analyzed by Focus Pages (which take you from basic SEO to actual Holistic SEO, so you can use the full force to your advantage). However, with Next SEO Goals you&#8217;ll be able to fully focus on the next step that drives bigger rankings.</p>\n<p>The people who were successful with Squirrly SEO have used the Next SEO Goals to work on what matters (because our systems analyze data from WP and also from many of our cloud services). Some of them have even gone through the 14 Days Journey to learn more about SEO.</p>\n<p>They have chosen option number 2.</p>\n<p>When you look at this table, where you see that your version of Squirrly SEO does a lot more than Ahrefs (for the usecases we target), SEMrush, Yoast, Rank Math, it may feel overwhelming.</p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be if you start working with the AI Consultant we&#8217;ve built.</p>\n<p>You can use Squirrly SEO on easy mode or on hard mode. It&#8217;s up to you and your skill level.</p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t worry: using it on easy mode will get you plenty results. Once you learn more about SEO, you&#8217;ll be able to use more of the tools inside and make more customizations.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s SaaS+plugin. Our plugin loads fast, and the real heavy lifting is done by our company&#8217;s servers, not yours. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t use one of the tools right now. It doesn&#8217;t cost you &#8220;compute&#8221; &#8211; I hate that term, but it&#8217;s so fresh.</p>\n<p>In the beginning: stick with the Next SEO Goals and if you&#8217;re a bit more advanced work on your Holistic SEO with Focus Pages and focus on turning red elements to green.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how you win. &#8211; Focus Pages is the way, once you get to know Squirrly SEO better. Ranking Vision AI powers its Chances of Ranking score, and I think it&#8217;s the only AI of its kind.</p>\n<h3>In fact, Squirrly covers everything you need to optimize and be successful with WordPress SEO.</h3>\n<p><strong>Over 650 features pre-configured for you during install</strong>, so that you don&#8217;t have to work on configurations!</p>\n<p>Check out every single feature you can get inside: <a title=\"All Features\" href=\"https://seotools.completeseofunnel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Every single feature</a></p>\n<p>Squirrly SEO has all important settings done for you right as you start and complete the setup wizard.</p>\n<p>No need to go back and forth between tabs to do keyword research, create SEO content, completely optimize your website and pages, and track their SEO performance.</p>\n<p>SEO optimization has never been easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Safely migrate your data</strong> to Squirrly SEO from any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rank Math, Yoast, All in One SEO, SEO Framework, SEO Press, SEO Pressor, Add Meta Tags Plugin, Gregs High Performance SEO, Headspace 2, Platinum SEO Pack, SEO Title Tags, SEO Ultimate Plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>★★★★★</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re new to SEO like me, some dark corners of content optimization can be hard to figure out.
