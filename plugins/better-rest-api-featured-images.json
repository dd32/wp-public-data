The REST API already supports adding the query param <code>?_embed</code> to your URL and the response will then include all &#8220;embedded media&#8221;, including the featured image, and the data you get there is exactly what this plugin gives you. The only reasons to use this plugin at this point are if you prefer to have the featured image data in a top level field in the response rather than among other embedded media in the <code>_embedded</code> field, and if you <em>always</em> want the featured image data in the response rather than having to ask for it with <code>?_embed</code>. I still use this plugin because I do usually want both these things, but definitely give <code>?_embed</code> a try before using this plugin. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Version 2 of the WordPress REST API returns a <code>featured_media</code> field (formerly featured_image) on the post object by default, but this field is simply the image ID.</p>\n<p>This plugin adds a <code>better_featured_image</code> field to the post object that contains the available image sizes and urls, allowing you to get this information without making a second request.</p>\n<p>It takes this:</p>\n<pre><code>\"featured_media\": 13,\n</code></pre>\n<p>And turns it into this:</p>\n<pre><code>\"featured_media\": 13,\n\"better_featured_image\": {\n    \"id\": 13,\n    \"alt_text\": \"Hot Air Balloons\",\n    \"caption\": \"The event featured hot air balloon rides\",\n    \"description\": \"The hot air balloons from the big event\",\n    \"media_type\": \"image\",\n    \"media_details\": {\n      \"width\": 5760,\n      \"height\": 3840,\n      \"file\": \"2015/09/balloons.jpg\",\n      \"sizes\": {\n        \"thumbnail\": {\n          \"file\": \"balloons-150x150.jpg\",\n          \"width\": 150,\n          \"height\": 150,\n          \"mime-type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n          \"source_url\": \"http://api.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balloons-150x150.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"medium\": {\n          \"file\": \"balloons-300x200.jpg\",\n          \"width\": 300,\n          \"height\": 200,\n          \"mime-type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n          \"source_url\": \"http://api.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balloons-300x200.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"large\": {\n          \"file\": \"balloons-1024x683.jpg\",\n          \"width\": 1024,\n          \"height\": 683,\n          \"mime-type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n          \"source_url\": \"http://api.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balloons-1024x683.jpg\"\n        },\n        \"post-thumbnail\": {\n          \"file\": \"balloons-825x510.jpg\",\n          \"width\": 825,\n          \"height\": 510,\n          \"mime-type\": \"image/jpeg\",\n          \"source_url\": \"http://api.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balloons-825x510.jpg\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"image_meta\": {\n        \"aperture\": 6.3,\n        \"credit\": \"\",\n        \"camera\": \"Canon EOS 5D Mark III\",\n        \"caption\": \"\",\n        \"created_timestamp\": 1433110262,\n        \"copyright\": \"\",\n        \"focal_length\": \"50\",\n        \"iso\": \"100\",\n        \"shutter_speed\": \"0.004\",\n        \"title\": \"\",\n        \"orientation\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    \"post\": null,\n    \"source_url\": \"http://api.example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balloons.jpg\"\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>The format of the response is nearly identical to what you would get sending a request to <code>/wp-json/wp/v2/media/13</code> or using <code>?_embed</code>.

For me this is much faster than making a second request to <code>/media/</code>, especially for multiple posts.</p>\n<p>As of version 1.1.0, there is a filter <code>better_rest_api_featured_image</code> that allows you to add custom data to the better_featured_image field. The filter is directly on the return value of the function that returns the better_featured_image field. This can be used to do things like add custom image meta or an SVG version of the image to the response.

To avoid any issues, this plugin includes the extra data under the <code>better_featured_image</code> field name.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is the core field called `featured_media` but the plugin field is `better_featured_image`?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Prior to V2 Beta 11 of the REST API the core field was called <code>featured_image</code>. As of Beta 11 this field was changed to <code>featured_media</code>, with the idea that at some point in the future there may be additional media items included on this field beyond the featured image. Version 1.1.1 of this plugin is compatible with both Beta 11 and all previous versions of V2.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
