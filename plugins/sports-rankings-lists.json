        "description": "<p>The plugin allows authors to rank and list ANYTHING and display the table of rankings in posts or pages. Authors can create comments when they create rankings which are displayed below the rankings / list in the wordpress post or page. Created with sports teams and athlete list / rankings in mind, but can be used for anything you want to easily list or rank. We came up with this idea to help multiple authors list / rank players on our fantasy football website. We&#8217;ve seen people use this to rank the top sports teams and players for fantasy baseball and fantasy basketball too.</p>\n<h4>Key features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload or manually create default list to be used on any rankings / list you desire. </li>\n<li>Multiple Authors</li>\n<li>Composite of all authors list / rankings</li>\n<li>Show <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/?\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravatar</a> for Authors above their name and rankings / list table.</li>\n<li>Users can sort rankings in the post for each author, default order is based on composite.</li>\n<li>Set default rank order for authors when created list.</li>\n<li>Drag and drop items being ranked (wordpress admin area)</li>\n<li>Upload csv list of items (players) or manually enter them.</li>\n<li>Three custom fields for adding information about items being ranked. example: Player Name, Team, Position</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Admins can create player lists and rankers. Authors can only rank players.</p>\n<p>Useful for rankings and list of anything you desire but optimized for ranking athletes. For example: You can upload (or manually create) a list of NFL players then authors can sort those rankings in post or pages. You can create top 10 list, top 100 list, top 10 rankings etc for NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL players with ease! Fantasy Football websites will find this extremely useful when creating <a href=\"http://fantasyknuckleheads.com/fantasy-football-rankings/\" title=\"fantasy football rankings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fantasy football rankings</a> for the draft and weekly matchups.</p>\n<p>We use custom post types to create list and rankings.</p>\n<h4>Unlock all feature and Remove Credits</h4>\n<p>If you enable all of the powerful features then a credit will be placed below your list pointing to WordPress.org and FantasyKnuckleheads.com</p>\n<p>If you wish to unlock all the features and remove the credits contact kurt@fantasyknuckleheads.com for premium version. Low price, no worries.</p>\n<h4>Examples of how to use:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Top 10 list (up to 1000)</li>\n<li>Ranking Sports Teams</li>\n<li>Fantasy Football Rankings (baseball, basketball, hockey, etc)</li>\n<li>Power Rankings</li>\n<li>Plugin Rankings / Top WordPress Plugins</li>\n<li>You can rank and list anything you want!

Choose a list of players created in the previous step. This give you shortcode to be used in post or page.</li>\n<li>Now go to &#8220;Rankings&#8221; menu, just below the Add Post option and edit your rankings! Authors (or higher level) can now go to Rankings Menu and drag and drop rankings where they desire as well as add comments for their choices.</li>\n<li>Copy the ranker&#8217;s shortcode (from step 3) and paste it in post or page where you would like to see your list / rankings. If Rankings are updated the post must be updated by clicking the &#8220;update&#8221; button. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>READ THIS: view the screenshots <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sports-rankings-lists/screenshots/\" rel=\"ugc\">here</a> so you know how to use this plugin!</p>\n",
