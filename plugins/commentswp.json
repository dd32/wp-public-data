And you can see the number of comments for each user who can be grouped by either email or IP addresses. You literally can find users who leave comments on your site under the same email address &#8211; but different names, or use the same email &#8211; but different IP addresses.</p>\n<p>And there is also this awesome &#8220;Anomalies&#8221; table card that allows identifying offenders and legit comment &#8220;spammers&#8221; (who leave a ton of comments manually, perhaps being too invasive and trying to hide their location by using different IP addresses or identity by using different email addresses). You better check the card on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Last but not least: the &#8220;Total by Time Period&#8221; table card will allow you to see the number of comments left throughout the whole history of your site, grouped by years, months, and weeks.
