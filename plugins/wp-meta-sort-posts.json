Both public and private <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Query_Vars\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress query variables</a> can be passed as long as it is formatted appropriately, e.g.<br />\n<br />\n    [msp query_string=&#8221;meta_key=shortcode_test&amp;meta_value=Arizona&amp;orderby=meta_value&amp;order=asc&#8221;]<br />\n<br />\n<em>Notes:</em> Do not URL Encode special characters like spaces to %20. Do not use query variables “paged” and “offset” in your shortcode because they are automatically calculated and added to the query string.<br />\n<br />\nIf you prefer, you can also pass each argument separately, e.g.<br />\n<br />\n    [msp Argument1=”Value1” Argument2=”Value2” Argument3=”Value3”]<br />\n<br />\nThe same query will be performed as in the first example if the arguments are passed like this.<br />\n<br />\n    [msp meta_key=&#8221;shortcode_test&#8221; meta_value=&#8221;Arizona&#8221; orderby=&#8221;meta_value&#8221; order=&#8221;asc&#8221;]</p>\n"
