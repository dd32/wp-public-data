I use the regular WordPress plugin on my WPMU site as well to allow individual site owners the option to add the protection at the blog level.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work on regular WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. This is only targeting the WPMU new blog signup and new user signup functions. If you need WP registration, login and comment protection I recommend you get the Block Spam By Math plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the math questions?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, just edit the two rand functions in the plugin file to generate whatever type of numbers you want.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work on regular Buddypress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Requires Buddypress 1.2.7 or higher</p>\n</p>\n\n",
