        "installation": "<h4>Automatic installation</h4>\n<p>Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don&#8217;t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.</p>\n<p>In the search field type &#8220;WP Restaurant Listings&#8221; and click Search Plugins. Once you&#8217;ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by clicking <em>Install Now</em>.</p>\n<h4>Manual installation</h4>\n<p>The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it</li>\n<li>Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation&#8217;s <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Getting started</h4>\n<p>Once installed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a page called &#8220;restaurants&#8221; and inside place the <code>[restaurants]</code> shortcode. This will list your restaurants.</li>\n<li>Create a page called &#8220;submit restaurant&#8221; and inside place the <code>[submit_restaurant_form]</code> shortcode if you want front-end submissions.</li>\n<li>Create a page called &#8220;restaurant dashboard&#8221; and inside place the <code>[restaurant_dashboard]</code> shortcode for logged in users to manage their listings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note when using shortcodes</strong>, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the &#8216;text&#8217; tab. Then remove any &#8216;pre&#8217; or &#8216;code&#8217; tags wrapping your shortcode.</p>\n<p>For more information, <a href=\"https://wpdrift.com/docs/article-categories/restaurants/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">read the documentation</a>.</p>\n",

If you don&#8217;t setup the [submit_restaurant_form] shortcode, you can just post from the admin backend.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I customize the restaurant submission form?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are three ways to customize the fields in WP Restaurant Listings;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For simple text changes, using a localisation file or a plugin such as https://wordpress.org/plugins/say-what/</li>\n<li>For field changes, or adding new fields, using functions/filters inside your theme&#8217;s functions.php file: <a href=\"https://wpdrift.com/docs/knowledge-base/editing-restaurant-submission-fields/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://wpdrift.com/docs/knowledge-base/editing-restaurant-submission-fields/</a></li>\n<li>Use a 3rd party plugin which has a UI for field editing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn about WordPress filters, here is a great place to start: <a href=\"https://pippinsplugins.com/a-quick-introduction-to-using-filters/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://pippinsplugins.com/a-quick-introduction-to-using-filters/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
