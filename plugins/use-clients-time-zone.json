This cookie is then read by PHP and the date_default_timezone_set() function (requires PHP 5 &gt;= 5.1.0) is used to set the default time zone for PHP scripts. Since it runs just after all of the plugins are loaded, it changes the time zone for all of the PHP that follows. It is useful in cases where one wants users to see certain posts on certain days. E.g., if the post slug contains the day number, like &#8220;xyz-daynr,&#8221; then the post can be specified by &#8220;$slug = &#8216;xyz&#8217;.date(j);&#8221; in a theme template. The cookie does not expire for ten years, but is reset if the user changes time zones. So, unless the user deletes cookies or moves the page reload only occurs once every ten years.</p>\n<p>NOTE:</p>\n<p>A remark was posted in our forum stating that sites may experience problems if changing timezones using date_default_timezone_set. WP expects it to always be UTC and display of things in different timezones are achieved in other ways:<br />\n    <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-development-tips-tricks/use-current_time-not-date_default_timezone_set/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-development-tips-tricks/use-current_time-not-date_default_timezone_set/</a><br />\n    <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2013/04/02/do-not-change-the-default-timezone-from-utc-in-wordpress/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://weston.ruter.net/2013/04/02/do-not-change-the-default-timezone-from-utc-in-wordpress/</a></p>\n<p>The author has not observed any problems on the sites on which this plugin has been tested.
