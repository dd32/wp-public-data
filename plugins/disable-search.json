They do not make use of your site&#8217;s native search capabilities. You can only prevent search engines from searching your site by blocking their web crawlers and purging their cache of your site (which is well beyond the scope of this plugin).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20still%20see%20a%20search%20form%20on%20my%20site%20despite%20having%20activated%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy do I still see a search form on my site despite having activated this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The most likely cause for this is a theme that has the markup for the search form hardcoded into one or more of the theme&#8217;s template files (excluding <code>searchform.php</code>). This is generally frowned upon nowadays (the theme should be calling <code>get_search_form()</code> or using <code>searchform.php</code> to get the search form). There is no way for this plugin to prevent this hardcoded form from being displayed.</p>\n<p>However, even if this is the case, the form won&#8217;t work (thanks to this plugin), but it will still be displayed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20front-end%20search%20only%20be%20selectively%20disabled%2C%20allowing%20it%20to%20appear%20and%20work%20under%20certain%20conditions%20%28such%20as%20only%20for%20logged-in%20users%2C%20etc%29%3F'>\nCan the front-end search only be selectively disabled, allowing it to appear and work under certain conditions (such as only for logged-in users, etc)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at this time, though it is feature being considered. (In truth, custom coding could certainly be used to achieve this, but that obviously requires coding knowledge.)</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20gdpr-compliant%3F'>\nIs this plugin GDPR-compliant?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.

The tests are not packaged in the release .zip file or included in plugins.svn.wordpress.org, but can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/coffee2code/disable-search/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin&#8217;s GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
