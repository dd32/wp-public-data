You now have a question in your content that dynamically personalizes content on the page when someone answers it.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Who is WordPress Content Personalization built for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We built this plugin for content marketing professionals, bloggers, and internet marketers looking to increase their content engagement and conversion rates by displaying more relevant content to their audiences through personalization.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the page need to be refreshed for the content to dynamically update?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, all of the personalized content changes in real time when a visitor answers a question. There&#8217;s no need for the page to refresh.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a flicker effect or reduction in page loading time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No &#8211; we use shortcodes to prevent any flicker effect (a major problem with many content personalization platforms that use visual editors) and to keep the plugin as lightweight as possible. While the additional resources may result in a tiny increase in loading time, this is very likely to be justified by the increased engagement &amp; conversions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a demo where I can see it in action?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes &#8211; we use the plugin on this article on <a href=\"https://www.ventureharbour.com/email-marketing-software-tools-one-best/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">email marketing software</a>. By adding three personalisation questions &amp; content blocks we increased average time on page by 22%, reduced the bounce rate by 9.9%,  and increased the number of people clicking through to an email marketing provider by 88%. Shortly after these improvements, organic search traffic to this article increased by 53% &#8211; while it&#8217;s difficult to directly attribute personalization to this increase, it&#8217;s likely that the improved engagement was a contributor to this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I personalize web content based on geolocation, IP,  or device?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet. We believe that content personalization is more engaging (and less creepy) when it&#8217;s based on asking visitors a set of questions. Our own experiments have found that this approach increases engagement</p>\n</p>\n\n",
