His Version was not working, since he had a typo in a variable. I fixed this error and<br />\nextendet this Plugin with some new Features like Changelogs, Roadmaps etc.</p>\n<p>This plugin for WordPress 2.8 and above allows you to insert information from a Mantis Bug Tracker<br />\ninto a wordpress page or post.  The plugin is perfect for projects which use WordPress for blogging,<br />\nbut also utilize Mantis for their bug tracking/issue tracking. You can include bug lists,<br />\nchangelogs and roadmaps.</p>\n<p>After you installed the Plugin you have to do the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a user in Mantis wich represents your blog. You could name him &#8216;wordpress&#8217;. This user needs at least Reporter<br />\nRights due a limitation in Mantis, but you can see the botton of the page to find out, how to change this.</li>\n<li>Configure the Plugin.</li>\n<li>Add <code>[Mantis]</code> to the post or page where you want to appear the infomation from Mantis. See below for further instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>About the Shortcode</h4>\n<p>You must provide options in the Shortcode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To include a bug list use <code>[Mantis bugs proj_id=x]</code>. Replace x with the ID of the project wich you want to display.<br />\nYou can find the ID in the URL of the Mantis Management Page for this project.</li>\n<li>To include a roadmap use <code>[Mantis roadmap ver_id=x]</code>. Replace x with the ID of the Version for that you want to display<br />\nthe roadmap. You can find this ID in the URL, when you view a single Roadmap in Mantis.</li>\n<li>To include a changelog use <code>[Mantis changelog ver_id=x]</code>. See the instruction above this to find the ID.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When including a roadmap or a changelog you can speficify a project and version <em>name</em> instead of the ID:<br />\n    [Mantis roadmap proj_name=my_project ver_name=1.2.3] or you can use a project ID and a version name: <code>[Mantis roadmap proj_id=x ver_name=y]</code><br />\n<strong>The <code>ver_name</code> Paramter is optional, if missing the full changelog/roadmap for the project will be displayed</strong></p>\n<p>If you use the &#8216;bugs&#8217; option, you can add the &#8216;exclude_stat&#8217; or &#8216;include_stat&#8217; parameter. After the eqal sign you can add (comma seperated)<br />\nthe IDs of the statuses to exclude or include. (You can not use include and exclude at the same time, of course!)<br />\nSo if you dont want to include closed and fixed bugs you would write <code>[Mantis bugs proj_id=1 exclude_stat=90,80]</code><br />\nHere is a list of the IDs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10 New</li>\n<li>20 Feedback</li>\n<li>30 Acknowledged</li>\n<li>40 Confirmed</li>\n<li>50 Assigned</li>\n<li>80 Resolved</li>\n<li>90 Closed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the <code>limit</code> paramter you can limit the displayed bugs. To display the latest 5 fixed bugs you would write<br />\n    [Mantis bugs proj_id=1 include_stat=80 limit=5]</p>\n<p>You can change the table background color for each status and use the localized status names from your mantis installation.</p>\n<h4>Why the Mantis User needs Reporter rights</h4>\n<p>This plugin uses the Mantis SOAP API to get the bug information. And to access this API the user needs at least Reporter<br />\nright. To change this you can create a &#8216;mc_config_inc.php&#8217; file in your &#8216;/api/soap&#8217; directory with the following<br />\ncontent:</p>\n<p>Now Viewer rights are suffiant for the user.</p>\n<h4>Further plans: (eventually)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Only include the CSS/JavaScript if the <code>[Mantis]</code> shortcode is in the content</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>The original plugin is in english, but you can translate in your langguage, since the pot file is included. If I should include<br />\nyour translation, email me: info at niklas-rother dot de. So far the following translations are included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>German/Deutsch</li>\n<li>Frensch/Francais</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Know Bugs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The changelog and roadmap is in the default language, not in the language of the user. At this point I dont see a change to fix this.</li>\n</ul>\n",
