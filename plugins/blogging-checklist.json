Go there and enter what you want.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make checkboxes appear?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just use a pair of brackets, and they will become checkboxes</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I enter HTML?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, go nuts. Okay, actually be careful. If you leave tags unclosed, you might make the administration pages behave weirdly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Security Risks?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin does allow you to inject HTML into the Admin pages. However, only an WordPress Administrator can change the checklist, so it&#8217;s not really a big deal.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t the checklist save its state?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not the point of the plugin. The checklist is just a reference card. The checkboxes are form elements, but these just allow the post author or editor to note which tasks he or she has already completed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
