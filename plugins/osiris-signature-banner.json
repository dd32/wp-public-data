Set &#8220;Right Position&#8221; to something that is not -1 (50 for example) to position the text inside the image. This is fixed in the next version that is coming soon.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get new fonts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I downloaded the ones included in the plugin from http://www.dafont.com/. There are loads of sites that provide free fonts.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
