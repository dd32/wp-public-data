This plugin just allows visitors to order and pay for the prints via PayPal.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a PayPal account to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin utilizes <em>your</em> PayPal account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have different purchase variations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can create an unlimited number of purchase variations such as size and finish. Variations take the Form of <code>label:price</code> (i.e. 11 x 14 Glossy:$100 ) and are entered via the Purchase Variations Media admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I choose which variations are available on an image by image basis?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Variations can be selected via the image&#8217;s attachment page. If no local variation choices are made for an image, all variations will be presented. This backfill behavior can be turned off by setting the &#8220;explicit mode&#8221; option on the settings admin page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have different prices per each product variation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can. Use the following syntax within the widget or shortcode:  <code>option1:$20|option2:$40|option3:$60</code>. <em>Note:</em> you must enter a currency symbol along with the price.</p>\n<p>Also, This feature is implemented by this plugin and is not part of the WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart plugin. Please do not bother that developer for questions/support for this feature.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
