PageSpeed is a Google Ranking Factor so it is important to have a fast website.<br />\nThere a several ways to enable Browser Caching. This Plugin uses Expires. The following code will be added to your .htaccess file:</p>\n<p>ExpiresActive On</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType text/css &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType text/javascript &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType text/html &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType application/javascript &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType application/x-javascript &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType application/xhtml-xml &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType image/gif &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType image/jpeg &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType image/png &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>ExpiresByType image/x-icon &#8220;access plus 1 month&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second line means that css files will be requested after 1 month. The third line means that javascript files will be requested after 1 month and so on.<br />\nOf course you can change the periods. You will find instructions for that in the FAQ section.</p>\n<p>In case you do not have reading rights to the .htaccess file you will get a 403 Permission Denied Error Page.

Open the file &#8216;caching.php&#8217; and go to line 21. The defined periods of the Expires are from line 21 to line 30. You can change them there.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the periods of the caching without editing the code?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since version 1.1 there is a modification menu on the plugin dashboard. Go to the admin dashboard and click the &#8216;modify Expires&#8217; button to open the menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the periods of the caching after I already activated the caching?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you already activated the caching you can not change the periods via the plugin dashboard. First you have to delete the inserted block in you .htaccess file, after that you can change the periods.<br />\nWhen you want to delet the inserte block for changing the periods, you can also change them directly when opening the file on your server.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use Browser Caching without .htaccess file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To enable Browser Caching this Plugin adds code to your .htaccess file. Therefore this file is necessary for this Plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do I do when my .htaccess is not writable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When it is not writable the Plugin can not add code. You have to change the file permissons to e.g. 644.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when I activate Browser Caching even if I already use it in the .htaccess?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since Version 1.2 this is no longer possible. If youre Apache Server is already configured to use Browser Caching with Expires it is no longer possible to activate Browser Caching again via this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
