        "faq": "<p><em>Whats is GDPR?</em><br />\nGDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect on 25th May 2018. GDPR is the strictest data protection regime globally, applies to private &amp; government entities, and applies to both EU &amp; Non- EU organizations. We covered GDPR in detail here.<br />\n<em>How do i make the wordpress website GDPD Compliant?</em><br />\nStart with understanding what data you collect and the collection points. Common data collected would be via Cookies, Scripts, Trackers, and Marketing Forms. Give users notice on your collection points with a link to a detailed Privacy Policy. Ask for consent wherever applicable and monitor your website for ongoing compliance. For a more detailed answer, please go through our post here.<br />\n<em>Do I need a cookie banner for the WordPress website?</em><br />\nModern privacy laws like GDPR, PDP, or CCPA include cookies and IP in their definition of Personal Data. This means you will need to give users notice of the use of cookies and the purposes for which you are using them (Analytics, Marketing etc.). Please read our article on cookie guidance for more details.<br />\n<em>Can I Build my own Cookie Banner?</em><br />\nSure, you can build a cookie banner. However, GDPR requires you to consent from users before you set these cookies and allow consent withdrawal. This requires a lot of work. Instead, use our wordpress cookie solution plugin to get compliant with one line of code. (edited)</p>\n",
