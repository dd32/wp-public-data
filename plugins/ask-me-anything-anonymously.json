        "installation": "<p>To Install This Plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin through the WordPress admin interface, or upload the plugin folder to /wp-content/plugins/ using ftp.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress. On a Multisite you can either network activate it or let users activate it individually. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>To Create A Page / Post With The Ask Me Anything Form:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to WordPress Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Ask Me Anything to generate and customize the shortcode. Copy this shortcode. </li>\n<li>Add a new Page / Post and make sure comments are enabled. Refer FAQ if you do not know how to enable comments.</li>\n<li>Paste the shortcode that you generated in step 1 and publish the page. You will have your brand new Ask Me Anything page. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>To Add The Form Into A Widget:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Questions are saved as WordPress comments and all comments need to be associated with a page or a post. So you need to create a page or a post with the Ask Me Anything form as described in the previous steps. </li>\n<li>Once the Page is created, go to WordPress Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Ask Me Anything.</li>\n<li>Select Location in &#8216;Choose Location&#8217; as &#8216;Sidebar Widget&#8217;. </li>\n<li>Enter the page ID of the Page or Post created for the Ask Me Anything form in &#8216;Page / Post ID&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Play with the rest of the options to customize the shortcode. Copy the generated shortcode.</li>\n<li>Go to Appearance &gt; Widgets and add a new Text widget to your sidebar. Paste the shortcode here and Save it. Your Ask Me Anything widget is ready.</li>\n</ol>\n",
