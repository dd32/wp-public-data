I am terribly sorry for this mishap.</p>\n<p>Major new features in YASG 1.1 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding captions to main image: the image caption is displayed under the main image, and the image description is set as the alternative text and title &#8211; pops up on mouse over.</li>\n<li>Improving the image transition</li>\n<li>All css rules are set under the main gallery container, to avoid conflicts with other elements on the page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to use</h3>\n<p>After plugin installation &#8211; all is left to do is creating a new gallery:<br />\nGo to the admin area =&gt; Posts.<br />\nCreate a new post.<br />\nFill in a title for your page and set it in the right category.
