Head to <code>Tools-&gt;Build Post Term Data</code>.  From there, you can build the term data based on the taxonomies you select.  You can also start over and clear the existing term data.</p>\n<p>Please note that this plugin <strong>does not</strong> change the order of items in the front-end.  This functionality is <strong>not</strong> core WordPress functionality, so it&#8217;ll require some work on your end to get the posts to display in your theme correctly.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to make use of <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP_Query</a>, <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get_posts</a>, or <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/pre_get_posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre_get_posts</a> to modify query behavior on the front-end of your site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ronalfy/reorder-by-term#usage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See usage for some examples.</a></p>\n",
