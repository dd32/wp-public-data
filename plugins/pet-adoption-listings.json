When used it will show the shelter&#8217;s available pets from their Adopt-a-Pet.com profile. The only required attribute is <code>shelter_id</code> (obtained from Adopt-a-Pet.com) but you can also specify the iframe width and height.</p>\n<p>The second way is with a widget that can display available pets in your sidebar or wherever else widgets are in your theme. You can specify the Shelter&#8217;s ID (required, obtained from Adopt-a-Pet.com), the types of pets to show (defaults to All), and the height of the listing.</p>\n<p>All pet detail links will open in a new browser window or tab on the Adopt-a-Pet.com website.</p>\n<p>Note that the plugin loads content from a third-party site via iframe, and so may introduce cookies, tracking codes, etc. in addition to those present on your WordPress site.
