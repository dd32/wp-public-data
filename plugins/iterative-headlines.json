        "description": "<p>The free version of Viral Headlines is limited in how many users you can test. Please consider our premium product at <a href=\"http://www.viralheadlines.com/?source=wprm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ViralHeadlines.com</a> if you have a busy website. Additionally, the premium version produces significantly better results by engaging a per-user optimization as can be seen by the red line in the <a href=\"http://www.viralheadlines.com/assets/images/experiments-lift-chart.png\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">results graph</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>Have you ever wondered how sites like Buzzfeed, Upworthy and the Huffington Post get their content to go viral? Why do people share their content so widely? The answer is testing.</p>\n<p>Over 80% of people exposed to your site will read your headlines. But for most sites, less than 20% of people will read the content. We&#8217;ve built a brand new algorithm for continuously improving your post titles to fix this problem.</p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to know any math or statistics, there&#8217;s no &#8220;sample sizes&#8221;, &#8220;p values&#8221; or anything like that. Just put in your post titles and our plugin gets to work for you. Our artificial intelligence takes care of all the hard stuff, tuning your results instantly and entirely behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard of A/B testing for this sort of thing. A/B testing is better than nothing, but it is very hard to get right — most algorithms available today, do the math wrong, are hard to use and in general provide inferior results. Even if it were implemented perfectly, A/B testing is slow: it requires thousands of users to get meaningful results, and the results aren&#8217;t available until after the test. In the meantime, you waste a lot of resources on ordinary untested headlines to your users for a very long time — and then they&#8217;re gone, off your site, never to return.</p>\n<p>The algorithm we use in this plugin is our own secret blend of research from Stanford, Princeton and other leading colleges. The result is the ability to perform testing at a rate that works for even the smallest of sites: often, we can learn the best headlines in less than 50 views! This means that your users are quickly seeing the best headline, the one that attracts the most attention, gets the most clicks and keeps your readers around the longest.</p>\n<p>Recent research from the University of Tokyo shows that on small websites (roughly, less than 1,000 views per article) this plugin achieves up to 57% better results than other methods of testing. On busier sites, the results are even more surprising. With testing, you <em>will</em> regularly see results up to 2,000% better (and often in surprising ways!) — if you were to get a result that is 2,000% better (turning what would have been 1 visit in to 20 visits) with another solution, with Viral Headlines™ you would see a 3,508% improvement (turning 1 visit in to 35!).</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>iterative-headlines/</code> to the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; Viral Headlines and select your goal.</li>\n<li>Begin writing posts. When you write a post, you&#8217;ll be presented the option of picking multiple headlines. Specify up to 10 headlines per post and the algorithm will get to work deciding which one is the best!</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Why does it appear to not be rotating my headlines?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each user is displayed a single headline — that includes you. This way, we can objectively evaluate whether a headline attracted a user or not. This means you will only see one headline for each post from your web browser. If you want to see different headlines, try acting like a new user — use a different web browser, different computer or clear your cookies.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when I disable the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will return to the classic behavior — your &#8220;primary&#8221; (i.e., the first) headline will show for each post again.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What goals are currently available?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We can optimize your headlines to increase the number of viewers of your posts or to increase the number of comments on your post at the moment. In the future, we will support optimizing for time on site (that is, getting users to spend more time on your site!) and optimizing for return viewers (do users remember your site when they leave?) and more.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change goals at any time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The algorithm is constantly learning for every available goal.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to optimize my headlines to increase my advertising revenue, can you do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends. It will require some custom integration. Contact me and we&#8217;ll see what we can do.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If your server is offline/overloaded/attacked by aliens, will my site break?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Your headlines will continue to be tested and the data will be updated when we get back online.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I contact you?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can email me at joe@iterative.ca — I&#8217;m happy to chat about optimizing your website!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
