On the other hand most themes &#8216;index.php&#8217; file always has sidebar. If you cannot see forum sidebar then change this value to index.php in plugin settings (settings -&gt; bbPress WP Tweaks ) page. If your theme has other non standard template files like &#8220;page-fullwidth.php&#8221; for example then you can use it by selecting &#8220;custom&#8221; option and writing page-fullwidth.php in text input field.

Login and register links can be customized with custom HTML code to match your website design.</p>\n<p><strong>Show forum description</strong> &#8211; By default forum description is shown only on where forums are listed, not in forum page.
