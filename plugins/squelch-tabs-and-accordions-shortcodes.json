        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20shortcodes%20are%20available%3F'>\nWhat shortcodes are available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes makes available 8 shortcodes: [accordions], [accordion], [haccordions], [haccordion], [tabs], [tab], [toggles] and [toggle]. The plural tags (accordions, haccordions, tabs, toggles) are wrappers that define the group of tabs or accordions. The singular shortcodes (accordion, haccordion, tab, toggle) represent the individual content items within each group.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Full instructions can be found on the <a href=\"http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes</a> project home page on the Squelch Web Design website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20look%20of%20the%20widgets%3F'>\nCan I change the look of the widgets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The plugin creates jQuery UI accordions and tabs, jQuery UI-compatible toggles, and the horizontal accordions have been set up to use jQuery UI themes by default. So changing the jQuery UI theme in use on the page will change the appearance of the widgets. To change the jQuery UI theme simply go to Appearance &gt; Tabs and Accordions and choose a theme from the drop-down menu.</p>\n<p>You can also style the widgets with your own custom CSS if you wish by using the .squelch-taas-override class, but that is beyond the scope of this FAQ. Instructions are available on the <a href=\"http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes</a> project home page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20see%20a%20demo%20of%20the%20widgets%3F'>\nCan I see a demo of the widgets?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure, on the <a href=\"http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes</a> project home page.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://tastewp.com/new?pre-installed-plugin-slug=squelch-tabs-and-accordions-shortcodes&amp;redirect=themes.php%3Fpage%3Dsquelch-tabs-and-accordions-shortcodes%2Fsquelch-tabs-and-accordions.php&amp;ni=true\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">spin up your own WordPress playground and try the plugin out for yourself</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20these%20widgets%20responsive%3F'>\nAre these widgets responsive?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All widgets is in this plugin are responsive <strong>excluding</strong> the horizontal accordion widget: It uses a different library to the other widgets, and that library is unfortunately not responsive. A new responsive horizontal slider is planned for the future.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20link%20to%20a%20tab%3F'>\nCan I link to a tab?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! As of version 0.3.7 it is possible to link to a tab. The easiest way to achieve this is to open the tab you want to link to and, if you take a look at the page address, it should change as you click the tab. If you copy and paste this address it should link directly to the tab you have chosen.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Thanks to @emajluap for reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New feature: It is now possible to disable the Magic URL feature introduced in v0.3.7 so that changing tabs/accordions does not change your site&#8217;s URL.</li>\n<li>New feature: The Magic URL can also be partially branded with your own vanity URL.</li>\n<li>New feature: Smooth-scroll when linking to a tab. Rather than jumping the length of the page in one go, the page will now slide smoothly before the tab/accordion switch happens.</li>\n<li>Version bump for WP4.8.1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: Links with hash fragments that do NOT point to a tab/accordion were broken in 0.3.7 and 0.3.8. Thanks to @jschinnerer for reporting the bug.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: When linking to, say, a tab on another page, if there are tabs on the current page, the link would always open the tab on the current page. Now fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: Perhaps not quite a bug as such, but annoying nevertheless &#8230; all themes in the admin screen are now in alphabetical order to make it easier to find themes by name.</li>\n<li>New feature: It is now possible to link to a specific tab within the same page using a # fragment in the URL</li>\n<li>New feature: While clicking through tabs, accordions and toggles, a # fragment is added to the URL to make it easy to link to tabs etc</li>\n<li>New feature: On page load any # fragment in the URL will trigger the opening of the relevant tab, accordion or toggle</li>\n<li>New feature: Roll your own jQuery UI 1.11.4 theme from the theme roller and store it in your uploads directory so that plugin upgrades do not affect your theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug fix: It&#8217;s now possible to use paragraphs or newlines to lay out your shortcodes once again.</li>\n<li>Bug fix: Test for custom jQuery UI theme from jQuery UI Widgets (my thanks to RobWunderlich for reporting this bug)</li>\n<li>New feature: [tab] shortcode now accepts a parameter of &#8216;class&#8217; to add additional classes to your tabs.</li>\n<li>New feature: Roll your own theme from the theme roller and store it in your uploads directory so that plugin upgrades do not affect your theme.</li>\n<li>Version bump for WP4.5</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor bug-fix: After changing themes the admin interface would still show the OLD theme, this has now been resolved.</li>\n<li>Version bump for WP4.4</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Emergency bug-fix: Paragraphs and breaks being interfered with</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Version bump (which should work)</li>\n<li>Putting icons live as they&#8217;ve been in the dev branch for too long</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Version bump (which went wrong)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor fix for a warning in debug mode.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The plugin was banned from the WordPress.org directory for providing jQuery from the Google CDN and allowing the user to choose the version of jQuery they wanted to run on their site. Apparently this contravenes the WordPress.org directory guidelines, despite the fact that the guidelines seem to make no mention of jQuery anywhere and despite the fact there are a number of plugins in the directory that do exactly the same thing. In order to get the plugin relisted it was necessary to use the WordPress-hosted version of jQuery and package the jQuery UI theme files. As a result the plugin no longer works on WP&lt;3.5 and there&#8217;s not much I can do about that.</li>\n<li>When you upgrade WordPress you may find that none of your widgets work any more due to a change in version of jQuery. This is a WordPress.org enforced change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>0.2.3</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code to add .squelch-taas-override was missing, added in.</li>\n<li>Enabled nested accordions.</li>\n<li>Selecting &#8220;no jQuery UI theme&#8221; was causing the front-end to attempt to pull in a theme named &#8216;none&#8217; from the CDN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>0.2.2</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>autoHeight was always on regardless of settings on the accordions shortcode. If you prefer the old behaviour then ensure you have autoHeight=&#8221;true&#8221; on the accordions shortcode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>0.2.1</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing necessary default data being set in the options table on upgrade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>0.2</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added in lighter text for haccordion&#8217;s dark theme, was somehow missed out of 0.1.1</li>\n<li>Added subtabs, subsubtabs, subtab and subsubtab shortcodes to allow tabs in tabs up to 3 levels deep</li>\n<li>Added subhaccordions, subhaccordion, subsubhaccordions and subsubhaccordion shortcodes to allow nested horizontal accordions</li>\n<li>Added toggles and toggle shortcodes and created jQuery plugin to provide toggle functionality</li>\n<li>Added subtoggles, subtoggle, subsubtoggles and subsubtoggle shortocdes to allow nested toggles</li>\n<li>Created admin interface configuration page with theme switcher for jQuery UI themes</li>\n<li>All generated screen widgets get a class of squelch-taas-override to make overriding styles in themes easier</li>\n<li>Added option to allow jQuery and jQuery UI to not be loaded if desired</li>\n</ul>\n<p><h4>0.1.1</h4>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin now works on older versions of WordPress down to 3.3</li>\n<li>pauseonhover attribute was being erroneously ignored</li>\n<li>Fixes for styles in certain themes that might interfere with the horizontal accordions</li>\n<li>Dark theme now has grey text in the content area by default to make it easy to use out of the box</li>\n<li>Scripts and styles loaded from Google CDN for performance</li>\n<li>Fix for WordPress 3.4.2 (and possibly lower)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version</li>\n</ul>\n"
