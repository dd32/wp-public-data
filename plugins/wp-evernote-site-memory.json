With the Evernote Site Memory button adding this functionality to your site could not be simpler.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Evernote, <a href=\"http://www.evernote.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visit their website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I click the button, nothing happens.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order for the necessary files to be included for the button to work, you need to call wp_footer. Just insert <code>&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;</code> just before the closing &lt;body&gt; tag</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The entire page is being clipped. What gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By default, WP Evernote Site Memory uses the post-## ID to specify the content to be clipped. However, if your theme does not utilize this scheme, you will have to specify the ID you wish to use instead in the admin panel. Remember, ID&#8217;s are case sensitive.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I style the button?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The button itself is an image. Therefore certain aspects of it can not be changed. However the Site Memory button is composed of three HTML elements that will allow you to further customize the button with css styles.<br />\nThe 3 components are a &lt;div&gt;, an &lt;a&gt;, and an &lt;img&gt;.<br />\nThey are assigned the CSS classes evernoteSiteMemory,  evernoteSiteMemoryLink, and  evernoteSiteMemoryButton respectively.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where are the suggested tags coming from?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The tags that are suggested to the user clipping your post are the tags assigned to it in WordPress. So to suggest tags to the user, just add tags to that post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There is no admin menu to edit the settings</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you do not see a &#8220;Site Memory&#8221; admin menu in the settings section of the WordPress backend, you are most likely using an outdated version of WordPress. The administration features are only available on versions &lt; 2.7.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
