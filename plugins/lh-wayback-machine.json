        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20this%20handle%20old%20content%3F'>\nWill this handle old content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it will, in fact this is the main advantage of this plugin. This plugin will detect old content that has not been archived and create a queue to send it to the wayback machine</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20did%20you%20write%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy did you write this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because I liked Mickey Kay&#8217;s Archiver plugin but I wanted something that did not need configuration and runs in the background.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20work%3F'>\nHow does this plugin work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When the plugin is activated a queue of old content is created and this is sent off the wayback machine periodically via cron. Any change to your content is also detected, so new or modified content is also queued to be sent to the archive.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20see%20if%20this%20plugin%20is%20working%3F'>\nHow can I see if this plugin is working?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin creates a column in the posts, pages, and taxonomies screens with the date the last time the wayback machine was pinged. By clicking on this date you can view the most recently archived content.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Wayback Machine, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-wayback-machine/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-wayback-machine/</a> . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
