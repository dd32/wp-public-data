The easiest way to geocode is to input an address into the Search field and select one of the results. Note that not all of the geo-fields are required for syncing to CartoDB. At a minimum, only the latitude and longitude fields are required in order for the sync to work. A CartoDB ID will appear to the bottom-right of preview map when a post has been successfully synced to CartoDB.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I manually input geo data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Checking the &#8220;Allow Geo Data Editing&#8221; box will unlock the geo fields for editing. This is useful for changing the Display Name or manually filling in fields that the Search does not. You can also manually edit the latitude and longitude fields.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the mapping engine used by the Geocoder?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Geocoder search feature uses <a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nominatim</a>, OpenStreetMap&#8217;s open source georeferencer. Note that these results are not required to geocode your posts, but simply provides an easy way to obtain the required latitude and longitude information. You can also manually input this data.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do drafts and private posts sync to CartoDB?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, only posts with the status of &#8216;Publish&#8217; will be synced. If you later change a published post to private, trash, draft or any other type, it will automatically be deleted from your CartoDB dataset.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I choose to not sync a single post on a case-by-case basis?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can click the &#8216;Do Not Sync&#8217; toggle to optionally choose to not sync a published post. You can find this by clicking on the Geocoder settings tool just to the right of the CartoDB ID in the Geocoder. Note that it is only necessary to use this button if you would like to keep geodata stored for the post, but not sync with CartoDB. Any post that does not contain latitude and longitude data will not sync anyway.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I remove geodata from CartoDB, but keep my post published?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Geocoder settings toggle (located to the right of the CartoDB ID) contains a &#8216;Delete Geo Data&#8217; button. Click this button remove all geodata from both CartoDB and geodata stored directly in the WordPress database. If you would like to prevent the post from re-syncing to CartoDB, either leave the latitude and longitude fields blank or use the &#8216;Do Not Sync&#8217; button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I write a custom summary description for my infowindows?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, use the Summary Description textarea to write your own custom summary description. Alternatively, if you are using Post Excerpt, you can leave the Summary Description blank and the Post Exceprt will be used instead. If both the Post Excerpt and Summary Description are blank, a summary will be generated using the first 55 words of the Post Content.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are there no custom fields appearing in the Select menu even though I have the Custom Fields box checked in the sync settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must have at least one custom field in use. Any custom field meta keys that are currently set will appear in the select menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will CartoPress automatically geocode my existing Published posts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately no, CartoPress will only sync data that is added or edited after the plugin has been installed. You will have to manually enter at least latitude and longitude data for each of the existing posts in order to sync. If you have a lot of posta and geodata saved in a custom field or from another plugin, there may be some creative work-arounds for bulk syncing, but this would need to be taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use an existing CartoDB dataset?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, though it is recommended to start fresh. You can input an existing tablename in the CartoPress Settings, and you will get a prompt asking you to confirm the use of an existing dataset. Note that CartoPress uses a standard set of column names in order to sync to CartoDB and by confirming the use of an existing table, CartoPress will add these standardized columns to your table if they do not already exist. If you plan to use an existing table, you should make sure that your column names match exactly the column names used by CartoPress. Please see the documentation for a listing of these names. Also note that the WordPress Post ID is the joining attribute that allows syncing to occur. If your existing dataset does not have a column of Post IDs, then it is more than likely better to use a new dataset from scratch instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I actually make a map?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CartoPress is a tool for linking your WordPress data to CartoDB. Therefore, CartoPress does not contain any publishing settings, and all map-making must be done with CartoDB. But no worries, its super easy. Just login to your CartoDB account, select your dataset. You should see all of your data in a table view. Click on the Map view and you will instantly see a simple visualization of your data. You can customize this by using the Wizards, CartoCSS, SQL, Infowindow settings in the panel to the right. You can also use this same panel to add additional layers. When you are ready, you can click the &#8220;Visualize&#8221; button to create the map, where you can continue to use the editor to added labels, change the basemap, and Publish your map.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I embed a map on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way to do this is to use the &#8217;embed&#8217; option in the CartoDB publishing options. This will automatically generate the code to insert the map into a post or a blank page on your site. You can share the map directly by using the &#8216;share&#8217; publishing option. You can also get a little a crazy and use the CartoDB.js API to create awesome custom visualizations and applications with your data.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
