We are using a pre-trained model provided by tensorflow itself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I improve or personalize the prediction by manually training the toxicity classifier on my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. The classifier is pre-trained. But you could build your own classifier based on the [code to create and train] (https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai-models/tree/master/experiments) this one</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What external JavaScript scripts does the plugin import?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin relies on tensorflow.js to analyze the comment on the browser. Therefore, the plugin enqueues tensorflow, the sentence encoder and the toxicity model.<br />\nNevertheless, the JS code to execute the actual comment classification is only added to single post pages with comments (and the toxicity settings) enabled.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
