Click that and it should say &#8220;Active&#8221;. Alternatively, you can upload the directory directly to your plugins directory (typically /wp-content/plugins/)</li>\n<li>Navigate to Forms &gt; Settings in the WordPress admin</li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Engage API&#8221; in the lefthand column of that page</li>\n<li>Enter your organization&#8217;s Engage API token, which you can get by visiting Organization Settings -&gt; API tab of your Salsa Engage account</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve entered your Engage account details, create a form or edit an existing form&#8217;s settings. You&#8217;ll see an &#8220;Engage API&#8221; tab in settings where you can create a &#8220;Engage API Feed&#8221;. This allows you to pick and choose which form fields you&#8217;ll send over to Engage from the form. You also have the option of automatically putting form signers into segments, or setting some conditional logic to pick and choose which information gets sent.</li>\n</ol>\n",
