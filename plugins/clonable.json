Your multilingual website updates automatically.</p>\n<h4>The challenge</h4>\n<p>Translating a WordPress / Woocommerce site can prove to be both costly and time-consuming. Beyond the initial translation effort, ongoing maintenance is essential to ensure the translated version remains current with new content. Consequently, translations are often overlooked or neglected following their initial creation, despite the substantial potential in foreign markets.</p>\n<h4>Our solution</h4>\n<p>Introducing Clonable, a groundbreaking solution for WordPress website owners. Clonable enables the effortless creation of &#8220;clones&#8221; of your WordPress websites, ensuring they are consistently synchronised with the original version. Any modifications made to the original site are instantly reflected in the clone, significantly reducing maintenance overhead. With Clonable, you can generate a website clone in just 5 minutes, drastically reducing time-to-market.</p>\n<h4>Key features</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>SEO Enhancement: Our plugin seamlessly adds language tags to the head section of all your pages. This ensures that your clones and the original site are appropriately linked for improved SEO performance. This functionality extends to both translated and non-translated clones and supports clones of subfolders as well.</li>\n<li>Effortless Subfolder Integration: Clonable empowers you to effortlessly incorporate a clone into a subfolder of your website, eliminating the need for complex technical configurations within WordPress.</li>\n<li>User-Friendly Language Switcher: Clonable also offers an intuitive language switcher, allowing users to effortlessly navigate between the different languages available on your website.</li>\n<li>Support for Woocommerce for easier conversion tracking in different languages.</li>\n</ol>\n",
