What to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can try to enable alternative scrolling. Go to plugin Options -&gt; Panel (tab) and turn on the Alternative Scrolling. Best looks with centered panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to display team members in a certain order?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment, there are two ways to do this:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Use &#8220;Order&#8221; column on All Members/Team Members screen, or use &#8220;Order&#8221; field on team member editing screen.</p>\n<p> Default order value of a team member is 0, this means there is no special order and it will be sorted/ordered by publication date.</p>\n<p> If we change order value to 1 (for example), the member will be shown before all other members with default order of 0. If we change its order to 3, the member will be shown before all members with order value of 2, 1, 0, -1, etc. Negative numbers are valid (-1). If both members have the same order value (e.g. 4 and 4), then their publication date will also determine their order.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Use <a href=\"http://amothemo.com/docs/amo-team-showcase-documentation/en/#sc-member\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Team Member</a> shortcode. The order in which you specified members’ IDs in “id” attribute of the shortcode, for example <code>id=\"31,10,241\"</code>, will be used to display the members.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>When I click on member thumbnail nothing happens, the info panel doesn&#8217;t appear.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably it&#8217;s a conflict with some of your other plugins or even with the theme. Try to disable the plugins one by one to find the one that causes the problem.<br />If your theme or some other plugin on your site uses MagnificPopup JS (which AMO Team uses for info panel), there may be a probability (a small one) of MagnificPopup JS conflict.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin doesn&#8217;t work or doesn&#8217;t work properly with my theme, set of plugins, or site, what to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all please make sure that you use current / the last version of the plugin.</p>\n<p>Next, although the plugin has been tested on about 30 themes, I can&#8217;t say that it will work with any possible theme, plugin, or site configuration, every little thing can not be envisaged.<br />So if it doesn&#8217;t work for you, first please ask your question on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/amo-team-showcase\" rel=\"ugc\"><strong>support forum</strong></a> (but please check first if such topic already exists there).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
