Check out the &#8220;Excludes&#8221; area in the Vivio Swift plugin to see what types of excludes you can set up for your site, or contact us if you would like to take advantage of Vivio&#8217;s Extended Support service and we can set these rules up for you.</p>\n<p>If you are a developer (particularly a theme developer) you can drastically decrease your users load time by separating out your front-end code from your back-end code. Specifically, use JavaScript to pull data from a WordPress web service instead of embedding PHP functions on the front-end of your theme or plugin. This will theme&#8217;s or plugin&#8217;s performance not only be much better with Vivio Swift, but with all caching layers (like CDN&#8217;s).</p>\n<p>Caching support is a marketable feature!
