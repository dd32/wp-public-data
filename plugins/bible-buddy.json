        "description": "<p>This plugin helps theologians, churches, and any online authors who want to share God&#8217;s word in their posts do so in a more concise, user-friedly way.<br />\nWhenever you add a verse reference to your post (ex. Genesis 1:1), this plugin will automatically add a clickable link to it.  When clicked, that link<br />\nwill open a popup that displays the actual contents of that verse.  This plugin helps increase the visual appeal of your posts while also making them<br />\nquicker to write!  This plugin has four color themes (traditional, cool, light, and dark), four languages, six versions (including the Latin Vulgate!), a custom verse<br />\nformat specifier (so you can determine how your verse references should look, ex. Genesis 1:1 vs Genesis ch. 1 v. 1), and much more.</p>\n",

This will open the plugin settings.  Then, simply select a theme<br />\nfrom the &#8220;Theme&#8221; dropdown, and click the save changes button.  Now, your popup should change color according to the theme you selected.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20make%20verses%20in%20my%20post%20display%20the%20popup%20when%20clicked%3F'>\nHow do I make verses in my post display the popup when clicked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After activating the plugin, open the plugin details (menu page with a book on it).  This will open the plugin settings.  Then, click into the &#8220;Verse Format&#8221;<br />\ntext box.  Notice the tooltip that shares what the three special tokens mean.  Based on the format you write verses in, enter the appropriate phrase in the box.<br />\nFor instance, if you want the popup to appear for verses following the format &#8220;Genesis 1:1&#8221;, enter &#8220;\\B \\C:\\V&#8221;.  Click the save changes button.<br />\nNow, your verse references should trigger the popup upon being clicked.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20are%20my%20verse%20references%20not%20able%20to%20make%20the%20popup%20appear%3F'>\nWhy are my verse references not able to make the popup appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Ensure you have entered your regular expression incorrectly.  Watch out for whitespace characters!
