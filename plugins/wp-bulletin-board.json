        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>wp-bulletin-board</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress.</li>\n<li>Your newly created forum is viewable by visiting the page it uses. The page will be called &#8220;Forum&#8221; by default and depending on your permalinks settings will have a url like mywpsite.com?page_id=95 or mywpsite.com/forum etc.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Where is my Forum?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your newly created forum is viewable by visiting the page it uses. The page will be called &#8220;Forum&#8221; by default and depending on your permalinks settings will have a url like mywpsite.com?page_id=95 or mywpsite.com/forum etc.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you provide free support or installation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I always have and will provide free support for any of my plugins. If you do encounter any problems when installing this plugin I&#8217;ll be glad to assist you as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I deactivate or remove the plugin, are there any actions that I need to take?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>None whatsoever. When you deactivate the plugin, WPBB will stop working and will notify you that the plugin is deactivated. This can be disabled by deleting or editing the page that WPBB creates for you. When you reactivate the plugin, WPBB resumes as normal. If you do decide to delete the plugin, everything is removed for you, so do take care that you don&#8217;t remove the plugin by accident.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Something doesn&#8217;t work, what should I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Firstly always download the plugin again as the plugin is constantly updated. It is likely the problem you&#8217;re having has been fixed already. If that doesn&#8217;t work, create a topic here: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-bulletin-board</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to Setup Facebook Integration</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>https://developers.facebook.com/apps (register or login)</li>\n<li>&#8220;Create New App&#8221;</li>\n<li>Enter App Name, can be anything you want, don&#8217;t worry about app namespace or web hosting. Click continue.</li>\n<li>Facebook should&#8217;ve created the app for you and you&#8217;ll see at the top the name of your app and the default avatar, next to that there is your App ID and App Secret Key. Enter those into your WPBB facebook settings.</li>\n<li>You may want to enter a contact email and change any other settings to your liking but leave sandbox mode disabled and don&#8217;t use the &#8220;Hosting URL&#8221;</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Website with Facebook Login&#8221; under &#8220;Select how your app integrates with Facebook&#8221; then enter the URL to your wpbb forum e.g. http://mysite.com/wordpress/forum</li>\n<li>Save changes</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>When I edit and save my forum or subforum, there is an error</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is likely that you are updating a forum with roles that no longer exist. Go to your admin dashboard -&gt; WPBB -&gt; Tools -&gt; Refresh Roles. Use this tool whenever you add, change or remove roles. Roles are like the ranks or capabilities that users have, e.g. subscriber, author, administrator, etc.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
