You never know, they may offer it free of charge.</p>\n<h4>Do you or your organization own Dudumobile/DuduSMS</h4>\n<p>No, we don&#8217;t. We just happen to use the SMS Gateway very often for clients so I thought to plug it into WordPress for &#8216;plug and play&#8217; installation.</p>\n<h4>What if I have issues sending SMS?</h4>\n<p>DuduSMS is not owned by me or the company I work with. For support, go to http://dudumobile.com for support</p>\n<h4>My SMS credit is exhausted, how do I buy more</h4>\n<p>Head over to the DuduMobile website üòê</p>\n",
