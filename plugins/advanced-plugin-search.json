Premium features are available for a limited time and use in the free plugin. We&#8217;ve introduced some limitations regarding use and search to avoid abuse. If you hit any limits you will be notified by the plugin, just get in touch via our support@klick-on-it.com and we will be happy to review your case. We&#8217;re not here to prevent you from finding what you need&#8230; Quite the opposite!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Can I turn it off</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, Either disable from &#8216;Advanced plugin search&#8217; menu&#8217;s tab or  just de-activate &#8216;Advanced Plugin Search&#8217; from the plugin menu</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: Why did you build APS? Does WordPress not already has a search feature for plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes it does have a search feature, but we think there is room for improvement. We hope APS will make it easier for WordPress admins to find plugins they need. We especially wanted to have more flexibility to filter on more criteria. You can filter on the following criteria: Installs, Rating, Last update and more.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I see some differences between APS search and standard search. Howâ€™s that possible?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: You will see in the plugin operation that we take data from WordPress.org and store it on your sites server. The age of this data is displayed whenever you use APS. If the data at WordPress.org is updated then you will need to download the data again. We dont control how often you download the data bu the age of the data on your server might explain any differences.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: : What data do you use for the searches?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: We use the information present on WordPress.org. You can update you information as often as you wish.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I found a bug. What can I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Get in touch, we&#8217;re always happy to hear suggestion. You can simply send an email to: support@klick-on-it.com</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I have a suggestion.
