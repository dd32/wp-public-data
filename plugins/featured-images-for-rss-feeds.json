And two, you may need some custom CSS to style/size it.</p>\n<p>The Premium way: When you check the Media Tag option, it creates and includes the Media:Content block, and then in Mailchimp you can use the RSSITEM:IMAGE merge tag, and place the image wherever you like, create custom designs, etc. Those same two caveats apply, non-https websites may not show the images in Preview Mode but should work when sent, and custom CSS is even more desirable, which we can help with, and which is why it&#8217;s a Premium option.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='blurry%20images%20in%20mailchimp%20or%20other%20services'>\nBlurry images in Mailchimp or other Services\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Blurry images usually means the size selected in the plugin&#8217;s option page is too small. Try increasing it, or using &#8220;Full&#8221; size. If still blurry using Full, then the original image size uploaded is too small, upload a larger image.</p>\n<p>The other option is to use some custom CSS to display the image(s) smaller in the email, max width should always be 600px for Mailchimp, so make sure your images are at least that large, and ideally exactly that width, with a reasonable height (300-500px typically).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='free%20features'>\nFree Features\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Featured image size: Select from thumbnail, medium, large, any theme-specific sizes, and full size.</li>\n<li>Image Position: Select Image left above text, Image left text wrap, Image right text wrap, and Image centered above text.</li>\n<li>Padding: Instantly set the spacing between the image and the body text.</li>\n<li>Feedly: Now support Feedly&#8217;s webfeedsFeaturedVisual class name on image HTML.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='premium%20version%20features'>\nPremium Version Features\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Upgrade to the Premium version for a full suite of image customization features for professional marketing.</p>\n<p>Enjoy a 14-day free trial no credit card required.

The problem is, then, when feeding my RSS feed to MailChimp, that featured image at the head of the post is lost. Sometimes the image is highly crucial to the post (not to mention more enjoyable), so this plugin is a life saver. A must have!&#8221; &#8211; @ericdye <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/must-have-for-featured-image-based-themes-mailchimp-users/\" rel=\"ugc\">Read the review</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It just works – lovely! Great with MailChimp. I installed this plugin, changed the (very simple) settings and the featured images started appearing in my MailChimp campaigns straight away – perfect!&#8221; &#8211; @barn2media <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/it-just-works-lovely-great-with-mailchimp/\" rel=\"ugc\">Read the review</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We promise you&#8217;ll love the features this plugin provides for your content marketing automation!</p>\n<p><strong>Need help</strong> or wish it did something else as well?
