Is there anything else I need to do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Is this a new site with no existing images? If the answer is yes, then there is nothing else you need to do, any uploads that happen after you activated this plugin will be automatically cleaned up. If the answer is no, keep reading.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to clean up existing images?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Images can be cleaned up at any time by visiting &#8216;Tools -&gt; Remove image sizes&#8217; in your WordPress Dashboard. Simply click on the &#8220;Start new cleanup&#8221; button and wait for the process to finish (there is a visual feedback for the duration of the cleanup).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Some image sizes are not cleaned up, which ones and why?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugin never cleans default image sizes (thumbnail, medium, large), so if your theme/plugins don&#8217;t define custom image sizes, you don&#8217;t need this plugin. Why does it not clean up those image sizes? Well the reason for that is that all of those image sizes are used in the Media UI of the WordPress Dashboard. What that means is: if plugin were to clean up all sizes, they would be generated for all of your images as soon as you would visit the Media screen. Since I don&#8217;t know of anyone that never visits the Media screen, it made sense to exclude those image sizes from the cleaning process and avoid the redundant server load.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I know which files the plugin cleaned up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A list of removed files is available only for the manual cleanup request, by checking the checkbox at the top of the plugin page. Once the request finishes, a message will appear stating how many images it removed. Click on the number to show the list of files that were removed in the process.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are there any drawbacks to using this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not that I know of. Your WordPress website will continue working as it did before, only your uploads folder will be a bit lighter (depending on the number of images and image sizes you have). It&#8217;s certainly useful during migrations!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
