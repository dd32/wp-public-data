Set the Product and Checkout pages to not display in your menu &#8211; those have nothing on them but shortcodes.  The Category page shows all of your root categories. You can either use this page or set it to not display if you are using the Categories Menu widget in a sidebar.</li>\n<li>Rename these pages and their permalinks to something that is SEO friendly for your particular site: go to the OrderStorm.com sys admin to Settings, Storefront Settings and enter the slugs in the corresponding fields.</li>\n<li>The Key you see is an example key. To add your categories and products to the shopping cart, sign up for a subscription on the http://www.OrderStorm.com/wordpress-e-commerce-sign-up/ecommerce-wordpress-plugin-pricing/ page.  After you sign up and login through the OrderStorm.com home page, you will find the key under <strong>Settings -&gt; WordPress/API keys</strong>.   Replace the example key with your key. Note that even the free version requires a subscription and key.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Customize Appearance</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Two widgets are added to the Widgets page during the initial installation. One for the Categories Menu and another for the Shopping Cart status box. You can put them anywhere you want plus put them in multiple places on your site.</li>\n<li>To display the Categories Menu, go to Appearance, Widgets. The OrderStorm E-commerce widgets were added to the list of Widgets during installation.</li>\n<li>Drag the Categories Menu widget to a sidebar wherever you want it.</li>\n<li>To change the Categories Menu settings, click the arrow on the widget to open up the settings box.</li>\n<li>Maximum menu level depth can be set as 0, which displays all menus or any other number to limit the number of menu levels that fly out before a customer has to click on something.</li>\n<li>The Parent Category Key can be set if you want to display a subset of the menu on a particular page.</li>\n<li>The OrderStorm View Cart Status widget draws a box that shows how many items are currently in the customer&#8217;s shopping cart and the total dollar amount. Customers can click on this box to check out.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The View Cart Status box can be included in any part of a theme. This example shows the way to include it in PHP.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php orderstorm_ecommerce_shopping_cart_status('topright'); ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <strong>&#8216;topright&#8217;</strong> value you see is an argument for the function&#8217;s <strong>$idSuffix</strong> parameter, used to provide a unique ID for the DIV containing the status box. Each instance should be named differently, using this suffix, in order to allow for styling or <strong>ostrm_shopping_cart_status_$idSuffix</strong>,<br />\nwhich for the PHP code example above would translate into:</p>\n<p><strong>ostrm_shopping_cart_status_topright</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To change the look of the categories and products, go to the Plugin page. Then go to OrderStorm E-commerce, click on &#8216;Edit&#8217;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The .css files controlling the appearance of the categories, subcategories and products are here.  You can completely customize colors, fonts, product display, product box sizes etc.</li>\n<li>After you have your .css files changed the way you want them, create a backup copy of your .css files in a separate folder or use the OrderStorm eCommerce Custom Files Manager plugin. OrderStorm will overwrite the main plugin .css files when we issue updates.</li>\n</ol>\n",
