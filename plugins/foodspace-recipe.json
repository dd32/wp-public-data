First it provides an easy method for users to save your recipes right from the recipe post by using a &#8220;Save This Recipe&#8221; button that appears in line with the recipe box. Second it provides a &#8220;Find Ingredients&#8221; button that takes the reader and all the recipe ingredients directly into Instacart where everything they need can be ordered for delivery (more grocery delivery options coming soon!). The Foodspace Recipe Widget plugin is compatible with most recipe plugins to automatically find and display right along with the recipe box for your recipe posts, but you can also utilize the shortcode [foodspace-widget] to insert it anywhere you like. Further customization options will be rolling out soon!</p>\n<h3>Arbitrary section</h3>\n",
