        "description": "<p>LearnDash is a powerful learning management system (LMS) for managing your online courses, but there are some areas where the design falls short. In order to provide your students with an exceptional learning experience, you need a professional design.</p>\n<h3>Enter Design Upgrade for LearnDash</h3>\n<p>Design Upgrade for LearnDash completely redesigns every aspect of LearnDash so that it closely resembles your existing WordPress theme. No settings or custom code. Just activate &amp; enjoy!</p>\n<h3>Compatible with LD3 &amp; &#8220;Legacy&#8221; Templates</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll automatically detect whether you&#8217;re using the &#8220;LearnDash 3.0&#8221; or &#8220;Legacy&#8221; template, and assign styles appropriately. If you&#8217;re still running LearnDash 2.x, all of the same design upgrades that you&#8217;ve always enjoyed will still be there.</p>\n<p>See below for a list of what&#8217;s new.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Tested with LearnDash 4.3.0.2</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NEW:</strong> Improved styles for the new LearnDash registration process/page</li>\n<li><strong>Global:</strong> Larger clickable areas for all course content, navigation &amp; Focus Mode areas</li>\n<li><strong>Buttons:</strong> All buttons have matching rounded corners &amp; increased font size</li>\n<li><strong>Font Sizes:</strong> These will now be inherited from your theme, which should increase your font sizes across the board</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Improved sidebar tray design, Course Sections, shadow added to mobile menu, collapse arrow flips to show current menu state, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Top navigation bar received several small improvements</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Improved styles for Focus Mode comments, which were added in LearnDash 3.1</li>\n<li><strong>Animations:</strong> Subtle animations for LearnDash tooltips &amp; the Focus Mode top menu</li>\n<li><strong>Profile:</strong> Several styles were improved &amp; standardized</li>\n<li><strong>Login/Registration:</strong> Unified styles for all form fields</li>\n<li><strong>Course Grid:</strong> Equal height columns &amp; other small tweaks</li>\n<li><strong>WisdmLabs Ratings, Reviews &amp; Feedback</strong> design upgrades</li>\n<li>Design improvements for WisdmLabs&#8217; LearnDash Group Registration plugin</li>\n<li>Improved print styles</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Also:</strong> Small tweaks were made to assignments, pagination, the &#8220;User Status&#8221; widget and more.</p>\n<p><strong>LearnDash 2.x &#8220;Legacy&#8221; Features</strong></p>\n<p>Tested with LearnDash 2.6.6. <strong>We no longer support these features and highly recommend using the LearnDash 3.0 active template.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much improved course grid styles, equal height cards &amp; no more weird spacing issues üëç</li>\n<li>All fonts have been reset to use your theme&#8217;s default font family, size &amp; color</li>\n<li>All PNG icons have been replaced with comparable SVGs</li>\n<li>All complete/incomplete icons for lesson/topic/quiz lists have been moved to the right for better consistency</li>\n<li>Spacing around &amp; between elements has been adjusted to provide greater consistency throughout</li>\n<li>All LearnDash widgets now have more consistent spacing &amp; sizing, including improvements to Course Info &amp; Course Navigation</li>\n<li>Styling for the <code>[ld_profile]</code> shortcode has been completely revamped</li>\n<li>Completely revamped &amp; restyled quiz elements üíØ</li>\n<li>Improved design of the statistics modal window (for quizzes), including row highlights on hover</li>\n<li>Larger pager navigation buttons to improve usability</li>\n<li>Full support for RTL languages</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who is this for?</h3>\n<p><strong>Brand new LearnDash users:</strong> There is absolutely no reason not to try it out. At the very least, it will give your site a more consistent design. If you plan to customize LearnDash further, you can still do so using a child theme or Additional CSS in the Customizer.</p>\n<p><strong>Seasoned LearnDash veterans:</strong> If you have not made any customizations to your LearnDash design, but would like to improve it, give us a shot. You might want to try it out on a test site first, but you can deactivate it with one click and return to your previous design.</p>\n<p>You might also want to give your students a heads up that you&#8217;re updating the design. But we feel confident that they&#8217;ll like it üôÇ</p>\n<p><strong>LearnDash developers:</strong> If you&#8217;re a developer who builds LearnDash sites for your clients, this could save you hours (maybe even days) of development time. LearnDash&#8217;s markup &amp; CSS is a beast to customize. This will give you a much easier baseline to work with.</p>\n<p>We designed the plugin to be just specific enough to override LearnDash&#8217;s default styles, but not so specific that you&#8217;ll need to use a ton of selectors to override our specifity. All CSS in child themes and Additional CSS will take precedence over our styles.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p><strong>Need custom styles?</strong> Our <a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro version</a> uses the Customizer to bring you <strong>over 110 customizable design options.</strong> Completely customize your LearnDash site with just a few clicks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOUToX87U9E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>Pro Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Achievements Add-On:</strong> 10 new customization options</li>\n<li>Show/Hide various course &amp; profile features</li>\n<li>Disable expand/collapse links &amp; show all by default</li>\n<li><strong>Course Content Lists:</strong> Update background &amp; text colors, hover effects, customize line separators, remove the list count numbers and more</li>\n<li><strong>Progress Bar:</strong> Customize the color, border radius &amp; height, add stripes, and animate the bar on page load</li>\n<li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Add your own background &amp; text colors</li>\n<li><strong><code>[ld_profile]</code>:</strong> Avatar shape, custom &#8220;edit profile&#8221; link, hide profile info, hide quiz information, and more</li>\n<li><strong>Login/Registration Popup:</strong> 10+ design options</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> 20+ design options, including 7 for Focus Mode comments</li>\n<li><strong>Course Navigation Widget:</strong> 15+ design options</li>\n<li><strong>Course Grid Add-On:</strong> 20+ design options</li>\n<li><strong>Alerts:</strong> 9 custom colors, plus a few other options</li>\n<li><strong>Tooltips:</strong> customize the background &amp; text color</li>\n<li><strong>Uncanny Groups:</strong> buttons, border radius &amp; improved styles are applied to many Uncanny Groups frontend elements</li>\n<li><strong>Tin Canny Reporting:</strong> 12 design options for Tin Canny reports on the front-end</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to Pro Today ¬ª</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Theme Compatibility</h3>\n<p>Design Upgrade for LearnDash <strong>should work on most themes</strong>, assuming they have not customized the LearnDash markup in any way. While we can&#8217;t guarantee full compatibility, we have tested with the following themes.</p>\n<h4>Tested With</h4>\n<p>We have tested with the following themes, and they all appear <strong>to be compatible:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astra</li>\n<li>Divi</li>\n<li>GeneratePress</li>\n<li>eLumine (when using the &#8220;LearnDash 3.0&#8221; active template or eLumine&#8217;s &#8220;Elementary Layouts&#8221;)</li>\n<li>LearnMate</li>\n<li>Edufire</li>\n<li>Neve</li>\n<li>OceanWP</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Incompatible Themes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyBoss Platform (released June 2019)</li>\n<li>Boss. / Social Learner (If you deactivate the &#8220;Boss for LearnDash&#8221; plugin, it will still work in &#8220;Legacy&#8221; mode)</li>\n<li>eLumine (when using the &#8220;Legacy&#8221; active template or any version of LearnDash before 3.0)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Incompatible Plugins</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LearnDash Visual Customizer by SnapOrbital:</strong> The Visual Customizer takes a similar approach to designing LearnDash components, and thus the code conflicts with ours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Uncanny Owl Toolkit Compatibility</h3>\n<p>We recognize the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/uncanny-learndash-toolkit/\" rel=\"ugc\">Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit</a> by Uncanny Owl is a popular LearnDash plugin that adds some nice features. We&#8217;re in the process of making our plugin fully compatible with theirs. Here&#8217;s where we are so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reset Progress button: Button styles upgraded</li>\n<li>Simple Course Timer modal: Button styles upgraded</li>\n<li><code>[uo_dashboard]</code>: Styles upgraded</li>\n<li><code>[uo_courses]</code>: Styles upgraded</li>\n<li><code>[uo_breadcrumbs]</code>: Compatible; Considering upgrades</li>\n<li><code>[uo_lessons_topics_grid]</code>: Compatible; Considering upgrades</li>\n<li><code>[uo_login_ui]</code>: Compatible; Considering upgrades</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit styles are only upgraded if you&#8217;re using the &#8220;LearnDash 3.0&#8221; active template. Styles do not apply to the &#8220;Legacy&#8221; template.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Compatibility</h3>\n<h4>Ratings, Reviews &amp; Feedback plugin by WisdmLabs</h4>\n<p>As of version 2.5, we now enhance the styles of the Ratings, Reviews &amp; Feedback plugin by WisdmLabs. For a detailed overview, please see our <a href=\"https://ldx.design/design-upgrade-wisdmlabs-ratings-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article on ldx.design</a>.</p>\n<h4>Group Registration plugin by WisdmLabs</h4>\n<p>As of version 2.6, we now enhance the styles of the Group Registration plugin by WisdmLabs. General design improvements will be made to all frontend elements output by the <code>[wdm_group_users]</code> shortcode.</p>\n<h3>Browser Support</h3>\n<p>A few techniques we use to improve the LearnDash design are only supported in the latest versions of major browsers. For the most part, as long as you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> using Internet Explorer, most (if not all) of our plugin&#8217;s design upgrades will work.</p>\n<p>We support the latest versions of the following browsers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Chrome for Android</li>\n<li>Firefox for Android</li>\n<li>iOS Safari (not tested, but should work)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We <strong>do not</strong> support any version of Internet Explorer, however, we do offer a few code snippets &amp; suggestions to fix a few issues in IE11. See the IE11 section below in FAQ.</p>\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\n<p>As LearnDash adds new features, it is our goal to keep this plugin updated.</p>\n<p>Features planned for future release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New features for the Quiz Reporting Extension by WisdmLabs</li>\n<li>Compatibility with more Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit modules</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>We&#8217;d love to hear from you!</h4>\n<p>Does something look weird with your theme? Is there something we missed? Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if&#8230;</p>\n<p>We tested it on a handful of popular themes, but we couldn&#8217;t possibly cover them all.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20settings%3F'>\nWhere are the settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The free version doesn&#8217;t have any. It simply applies a fresh coat of paint behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme&amp;utm_content=faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro version</a> that includes 100+ settings you can customize.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20affect%20the%20rest%20of%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this affect the rest of my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We&#8217;ve carefully crafted it to only apply to LearnDash elements. The rest of your site (header, footer, pages, blog posts, etc.) will continue to use the styles determined by whichever WordPress theme you are using.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20with%20the%20learndash%20visual%20customizer%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin with the LearnDash Visual Customizer?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically, yes, but you will encounter some weird design issues. We recommend you check out our similar <a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme&amp;utm_content=faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro plugin</a> to customize LearnDash styles.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20compatible%20with%20the%20elementor%20for%20learndash%20integration%3F'>\nIs this compatible with the Elementor for LearnDash Integration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The general design &amp; UX improvements that Design Upgrade makes will still take effect. However, any customizations you make to LearnDash elements in Elementor will override our plugin&#8217;s styles.</p>\n<p>But yes, you can use the two together without any issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20with%20the%20divi%20learndash%20kit%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin with the Divi LearnDash Kit?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have done some testing with the Divi LearnDash Kit, but I haven&#8217;t tested every element. It should work in most cases, but you&#8217;ll want to test all your pages. If you find something that isn&#8217;t compatible, please let us know in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/design-upgrade-learndash\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> so we can fix it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20make%20design%20changes%20in%20addition%20to%20what%20the%20plugin%20makes%3F'>\nCan I make design changes in addition to what the plugin makes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely. Feel free to add your own CSS if you want to further customize the look &amp; feel of your LearnDash site. Just place your CSS in a child theme or the Additional CSS area of the WordPress Customizer. Or check out our <a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme&amp;utm_content=faq\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro plugin</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20slow%20down%20my%20site%3F'>\nWill this slow down my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We do add one CSS file to the header, but as long as you&#8217;re using a reliable WordPress host with decent performance, you shouldn&#8217;t notice a difference.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='ie11%20support%20%26%20bug%20fixes'>\nIE11 Support &amp; Bug Fixes\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The two main CSS features we use that cause issues in IE11 are CSS custom properties (variables) and flexbox. You can use the following CSS to fix some of these issues if you&#8217;re using IE11.</p>\n<p>To fix some layout issues with the course grid:</p>\n<pre><code>.ld-course-list-items div.ld_course_grid .thumbnail.course {\n    display: block !important;\n}\n\n.ld-course-list-items div.ld_course_grid .thumbnail.course .caption {\n    display: block;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To fix colors not appearing, you&#8217;ll need to use the dev tools to look for all CSS properties that start with <code>var(--</code>. These represent CSS custom properties, and they don&#8217;t work in IE11.</p>\n<p>For example, replace <code>var(--ldx-color-link)</code> with <code>#000000</code>, or whatever hexadecimal color value you&#8217;d like to use for your link color.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20course%2Flesson%2Ftopic%2Fquiz%20still%20looks%20weird.%20can%20you%20help%3F'>\nMy course/lesson/topic/quiz still looks weird. Can you help?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely, yes. We&#8217;ll certainly try.</p>\n<p>We designed this plugin to be flexible so that it takes on many of the characteristics of your WordPress theme. But every theme is built differently, so styles will differ from site to site. Shoot us a message in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/design-upgrade-learndash\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> with a link to your site and we&#8217;ll try to help out.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

    "description": "<p>LearnDash is a powerful learning management system (LMS) for managing your online courses, but there are some areas where the design falls short. In order to provide your students with an exceptional learning experience, you need a professional design.</p>\n<h3>Enter Design Upgrade for LearnDash</h3>\n<p>Design Upgrade for LearnDash completely redesigns every aspect of LearnDash so that it closely resembles your existing WordPress theme. No settings or custom code. Just activate &amp; enjoy!</p>\n<h3>Compatible with LD3 &amp; &#8220;Legacy&#8221; Templates</h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll automatically detect whether you&#8217;re using the &#8220;LearnDash 3.0&#8221; or &#8220;Legacy&#8221; template, and assign styles appropriately. If you&#8217;re still running LearnDash 2.x, all of the same design upgrades that you&#8217;ve always enjoyed will still be there.</p>\n<p>See below for a list of what&#8217;s new.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>Tested with LearnDash 4.3.0.2</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>NEW:</strong> Improved styles for the new LearnDash registration process/page</li>\n<li><strong>Global:</strong> Larger clickable areas for all course content, navigation &amp; Focus Mode areas</li>\n<li><strong>Buttons:</strong> All buttons have matching rounded corners &amp; increased font size</li>\n<li><strong>Font Sizes:</strong> These will now be inherited from your theme, which should increase your font sizes across the board</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Improved sidebar tray design, Course Sections, shadow added to mobile menu, collapse arrow flips to show current menu state, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Top navigation bar received several small improvements</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Improved styles for Focus Mode comments, which were added in LearnDash 3.1</li>\n<li><strong>Animations:</strong> Subtle animations for LearnDash tooltips &amp; the Focus Mode top menu</li>\n<li><strong>Profile:</strong> Several styles were improved &amp; standardized</li>\n<li><strong>Login/Registration:</strong> Unified styles for all form fields</li>\n<li><strong>Course Grid:</strong> Equal height columns &amp; other small tweaks</li>\n<li><strong>WisdmLabs Ratings, Reviews &amp; Feedback</strong> design upgrades</li>\n<li>Design improvements for WisdmLabs&#8217; LearnDash Group Registration plugin</li>\n<li>Improved print styles</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Also:</strong> Small tweaks were made to assignments, pagination, the &#8220;User Status&#8221; widget and more.</p>\n<p><strong>LearnDash 2.x &#8220;Legacy&#8221; Features</strong></p>\n<p>Tested with LearnDash 2.6.6. <strong>We no longer support these features and highly recommend using the LearnDash 3.0 active template.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Much improved course grid styles, equal height cards &amp; no more weird spacing issues üëç</li>\n<li>All fonts have been reset to use your theme&#8217;s default font family, size &amp; color</li>\n<li>All PNG icons have been replaced with comparable SVGs</li>\n<li>All complete/incomplete icons for lesson/topic/quiz lists have been moved to the right for better consistency</li>\n<li>Spacing around &amp; between elements has been adjusted to provide greater consistency throughout</li>\n<li>All LearnDash widgets now have more consistent spacing &amp; sizing, including improvements to Course Info &amp; Course Navigation</li>\n<li>Styling for the <code>[ld_profile]</code> shortcode has been completely revamped</li>\n<li>Completely revamped &amp; restyled quiz elements üíØ</li>\n<li>Improved design of the statistics modal window (for quizzes), including row highlights on hover</li>\n<li>Larger pager navigation buttons to improve usability</li>\n<li>Full support for RTL languages</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who is this for?</h3>\n<p><strong>Brand new LearnDash users:</strong> There is absolutely no reason not to try it out. At the very least, it will give your site a more consistent design. If you plan to customize LearnDash further, you can still do so using a child theme or Additional CSS in the Customizer.</p>\n<p><strong>Seasoned LearnDash veterans:</strong> If you have not made any customizations to your LearnDash design, but would like to improve it, give us a shot. You might want to try it out on a test site first, but you can deactivate it with one click and return to your previous design.</p>\n<p>You might also want to give your students a heads up that you&#8217;re updating the design. But we feel confident that they&#8217;ll like it üôÇ</p>\n<p><strong>LearnDash developers:</strong> If you&#8217;re a developer who builds LearnDash sites for your clients, this could save you hours (maybe even days) of development time. LearnDash&#8217;s markup &amp; CSS is a beast to customize. This will give you a much easier baseline to work with.</p>\n<p>We designed the plugin to be just specific enough to override LearnDash&#8217;s default styles, but not so specific that you&#8217;ll need to use a ton of selectors to override our specifity. All CSS in child themes and Additional CSS will take precedence over our styles.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p><strong>Need custom styles?</strong> Our <a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pro version</a> uses the Customizer to bring you <strong>over 110 customizable design options.</strong> Completely customize your LearnDash site with just a few clicks.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOUToX87U9E?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h4>Pro Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Achievements Add-On:</strong> 10 new customization options</li>\n<li>Show/Hide various course &amp; profile features</li>\n<li>Disable expand/collapse links &amp; show all by default</li>\n<li><strong>Course Content Lists:</strong> Update background &amp; text colors, hover effects, customize line separators, remove the list count numbers and more</li>\n<li><strong>Progress Bar:</strong> Customize the color, border radius &amp; height, add stripes, and animate the bar on page load</li>\n<li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Add your own background &amp; text colors</li>\n<li><strong><code>[ld_profile]</code>:</strong> Avatar shape, custom &#8220;edit profile&#8221; link, hide profile info, hide quiz information, and more</li>\n<li><strong>Login/Registration Popup:</strong> 10+ design options</li>\n<li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> 20+ design options, including 7 for Focus Mode comments</li>\n<li><strong>Course Navigation Widget:</strong> 15+ design options</li>\n<li><strong>Course Grid Add-On:</strong> 20+ design options</li>\n<li><strong>Alerts:</strong> 9 custom colors, plus a few other options</li>\n<li><strong>Tooltips:</strong> customize the background &amp; text color</li>\n<li><strong>Uncanny Groups:</strong> buttons, border radius &amp; improved styles are applied to many Uncanny Groups frontend elements</li>\n<li><strong>Tin Canny Reporting:</strong> 12 design options for Tin Canny reports on the front-end</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://escapecreative.com/products/design-upgrade-learndash/?utm_source=wordpress.org&amp;utm_medium=free%20plugin&amp;utm_campaign=readme\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to Pro Today ¬ª</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Theme Compatibility</h3>\n<p>Design Upgrade for LearnDash <strong>should work on most themes</strong>, assuming they have not customized the LearnDash markup in any way. While we can&#8217;t guarantee full compatibility, we have tested with the following themes.</p>\n<h4>Tested With</h4>\n<p>We have tested with the following themes, and they all appear <strong>to be compatible:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Astra</li>\n<li>Divi</li>\n<li>GeneratePress</li>\n<li>eLumine (when using the &#8220;LearnDash 3.0&#8221; active template or eLumine&#8217;s &#8220;Elementary Layouts&#8221;)</li>\n<li>LearnMate</li>\n<li>Edufire</li>\n<li>Neve</li>\n<li>OceanWP</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Incompatible Themes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>BuddyBoss Platform (released June 2019)</li>\n<li>Boss. / Social Learner (If you deactivate the &#8220;Boss for LearnDash&#8221; plugin, it will still work in &#8220;Legacy&#8221; mode)</li>\n<li>eLumine (when using the &#8220;Legacy&#8221; active template or any version of LearnDash before 3.0)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Incompatible Plugins</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LearnDash Visual Customizer by SnapOrbital:</strong> The Visual Customizer takes a similar approach to designing LearnDash components, and thus the code conflicts with ours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Uncanny Owl Toolkit Compatibility</h3>\n<p>We recognize the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/uncanny-learndash-toolkit/\" rel=\"ugc\">Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit</a> by Uncanny Owl is a popular LearnDash plugin that adds some nice features. We&#8217;re in the process of making our plugin fully compatible with theirs. Here&#8217;s where we are so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reset Progress button: Button styles upgraded</li>\n<li>Simple Course Timer modal: Button styles upgraded</li>\n<li><code>[uo_dashboard]</code>: Styles upgraded</li>\n<li><code>[uo_courses]</code>: Styles upgraded</li>\n<li><code>[uo_breadcrumbs]</code>: Compatible; Considering upgrades</li>\n<li><code>[uo_lessons_topics_grid]</code>: Compatible; Considering upgrades</li>\n<li><code>[uo_login_ui]</code>: Compatible; Considering upgrades</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit styles are only upgraded if you&#8217;re using the &#8220;LearnDash 3.0&#8221; active template. Styles do not apply to the &#8220;Legacy&#8221; template.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Compatibility</h3>\n<h4>Ratings, Reviews &amp; Feedback plugin by WisdmLabs</h4>\n<p>As of version 2.5, we now enhance the styles of the Ratings, Reviews &amp; Feedback plugin by WisdmLabs. For a detailed overview, please see our <a href=\"https://ldx.design/design-upgrade-wisdmlabs-ratings-reviews\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">article on ldx.design</a>.</p>\n<h4>Group Registration plugin by WisdmLabs</h4>\n<p>As of version 2.6, we now enhance the styles of the Group Registration plugin by WisdmLabs. General design improvements will be made to all frontend elements output by the <code>[wdm_group_users]</code> shortcode.</p>\n<h3>Browser Support</h3>\n<p>A few techniques we use to improve the LearnDash design are only supported in the latest versions of major browsers. For the most part, as long as you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> using Internet Explorer, most (if not all) of our plugin&#8217;s design upgrades will work.</p>\n<p>We support the latest versions of the following browsers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Chrome for Android</li>\n<li>Firefox for Android</li>\n<li>iOS Safari (not tested, but should work)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We <strong>do not</strong> support any version of Internet Explorer, however, we do offer a few code snippets &amp; suggestions to fix a few issues in IE11. See the IE11 section below in FAQ.</p>\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\n<p>As LearnDash adds new features, it is our goal to keep this plugin updated.</p>\n<p>Features planned for future release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New features for the Quiz Reporting Extension by WisdmLabs</li>\n<li>Compatibility with more Uncanny LearnDash Toolkit modules</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>We&#8217;d love to hear from you!</h4>\n<p>Does something look weird with your theme? Is there something we missed? Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if&#8230;</p>\n<p>We tested it on a handful of popular themes, but we couldn&#8217;t possibly cover them all. If you have any feedback, please let us know in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/design-upgrade-learndash\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>.</p>\n<h4>Credits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Paint brush icon made by <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Freepik</a>, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">flaticon.com</a>.
