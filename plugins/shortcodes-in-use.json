        "faq": "<p>If you have a question or problem that is not covered here, please use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/shortcodes-in-use\" rel=\"ugc\">integrated Support forum</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Does it list all available shortcodes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, all shortcodes known to WordPress (Admin) are listed, grouped by provider, and possibly sub-grouped by plugin or theme name. You<br />\ncan select to filter by any number of them, or by either the provider or the specific plugin/theme. Note that you do <em>not</em> get any<br />\ninformation about their use or function.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can it find shortcodes that are not known to WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, assuming it is in the standard format. By default, anything that looks like a shortcode is reported, the only exception being<br />\nshortcodes that are &#8220;escaped&#8221; (by doubling up on the containing square brackets). You can filter the<br />\nresults to just Unknown shortcodes, or you can search for a specific shortcode regardless or whether WordPress knows about it or not.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it show nested shortcodes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the shortcodes are processed recursively, and nesting is indicated by a level of indentation in the results table.<br />\nHowever, please be aware that indentation only indicates that the shortcode in question is nested <em>somewhere</em> within the shortcode at<br />\nthe lesser level of indentation; it does not necessarily provide any indication of howy deeply it&#8217;s nested, because the search/filter<br />\nparameters may exclude any of the containing shortcodes from being reported. For this same reason, a lack of indentation does not<br />\nnecessarily mean that the shortcode is not nested within another shortcode. In other words, any indentation is only relative to the<br />\nreported shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the Provider/Tag filter work, and why the highlighting?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hierarchical, with (up to) 3 levels : general provider, named provider, and tags. Select nothing amd they&#8217;re all included.<br />\nSelect a named provider and all its tags get included. Select a general provider and all its named providers (ie. all their tags)<br />\nget included. As soon as you select anything, whatever remains unchecked and outside the immediate scope of the checked item<br />\n(ie. not hierarchically below) gets excluded. As an example, if you check &#8220;WordPress&#8221; without checking &#8220;Plugin&#8221; then you won&#8217;t get any<br />\nresults for shortcodes provided by plugins.</p>\n<p>You can select multiple tags, multiple providers (general or named). What you can&#8217;t do is select, for example, a named provider<br />\n<strong>and</strong> one of its tags. Selecting a named provider gets all its tags. If you only want one or two of its tags then select them<br />\nindividually and don&#8217;t try selecting the provider. Same applies when selecting a general provider.</p>\n<p>Checked items are highlighted. Also, because the tree is collapsible (and starts out collapsed), unchecked ancestors of checked items<br />\nare also highlighted in order to provide visual feedback that something (possibly hidden from sight) has been selected.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What gets cached, and for how long?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Based on the Location filters, the plugin caches the ids of database records that contain likely-looking shortcodes. It does <em>not</em> cache<br />\nthe results of any inspection of those records&#8217; content. If you change the Location filters (excluding Widget, which does not require<br />\ndatabase access) such that any cached ids do not accurately reflect the new filters, then the cache is discarded and refreshed with<br />\na new set of ids. The cache is only kept for 15 minutes, and can be manually discarded at any time.<br />\nEnquiries run via the shortcode do not use or set the cache.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I need to use the shortcode instead of the admin Tool?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You may well not. But&#8230;</p>\n<p>Some plugins &#8211; for example, the WP Photo Album Plus plugin &#8211; don&#8217;t add their shortcode if you are in<br />\nthe admin backend (and I hasten to add that there is nothing wrong with that approach). What this means<br />\nthough, is that this plugin can&#8217;t then determine the provider of that shortcode when it finds it in, say,<br />\na page&#8217;s content, because WordPress hasn&#8217;t been told about it. The Tool can only report it as Unknown<br />\nProvider.</p>\n<p>So, if you get too many unknowns turning up you may want to run a quick check to make see if they can<br />\ncan be resolved when running the shortcode on a front end page : stick<br />\na <code>[shortcodes_in_use provider=unknown/]</code> shortcode onto a page and view it while logged in as Admin?</p>\n</p>\n\n",
