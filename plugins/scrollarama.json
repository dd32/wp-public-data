Make sure the category you want to use exists before you start! You can select any number of categories &#8211; use ctrl and/or shift to select more than one</li>\n<li><strong>Number of posts:</strong> Number of posts used &#8211; if there are fewer posts, that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;ll just use the ones in your chosen category</li>\n<li><strong>Slider effect:</strong> jQuery Cycle effect to be used.

For example 3000 = 3 seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Transition speed:</strong> how long it takes for each transition, again in milliseconds. For example, if you set this to 1000 it will take one second for a post to fade out and the next to fade in</li>\n<li><strong>Width:</strong> Add a width here <em>if needed</em>. By default, the widget should fit the sidebar you drop it in to. If not, you can override this by setting a width in pixels (don&#8217;t include the units, just the number)</li>\n<li><strong>Height:</strong> Set the height of the widget in pixels.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What categories are used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can specify any number of categories to use. Select multiple categories in the widget control panel using shift and/or ctrl.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What images are used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The widget looks for a custom field called &#8220;slider&#8221; &#8211; which you should assign an image URL (you can grab this from the image details in the media library, or use an external image if you have permission).</p>\n<p>If this custom field isn&#8217;t set, the first image attachment assigned to a post is used.</p>\n<p>If neither is in place, the background of the slider will be blank.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How big should the image be?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The height should match the height you specify in the widget, and width needs to match the width you set or the width of your sidebar. If it&#8217;s bigger than this, the background image will be centered. If smaller, you&#8217;ll have some blank space around it, so try to make it big enough.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I restyle the widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can edit scrollarama/styles/scrollarama_style.css &#8211; just make sure you read the notes or you might break it! A white .png (to replace the default black background behind the post header) is provided, so you can easily swap that out.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The widget doesn&#8217;t do x, y or z&#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are several bits of functionality I&#8217;d like to add when I get time &#8211; mainly to make it a bit more flexible and easy to style and adapt. If you want it to do anything in particular, though, get in touch via <a href=\"http://www.maltpress.co.uk\" title=\"Maltpress.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my site</a></p>\n<p>Version 1.2 should include better styling options. I&#8217;m trying to keep the widget controls tidy and simple, though.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t show in IE8!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s possibly a conflict with other plugins using jQuery Cycle, possibly only if their Cycle plugin version isn&#8217;t the same (2.99 at plugin version 1.1). I&#8217;ve seen it once but can&#8217;t replicate the issue at the moment. If this happens to you, please contact me via <a href=\"http://www.maltpress.co.uk\" title=\"Maltpress.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">my site</a> or in the forum for this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s with the name?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think of one, so I asked on Twitter and @michlan came up with it. I&#8217;m going to make this a thing. If you want to name a future plugin, follow @maltpress</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Marry me?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Maybe.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
