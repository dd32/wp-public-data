Discover ways to calm someone down, connect them to resources and supports, and offer them hope that things will get better.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ19WgGNq0A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Note: <em>This plugins does not contain any confidential information</em>. They are basically general knowledge. It n is meant to be used to practice or revise your knowledge in Psychological first aid.<br />\nThe American Red Cross provides free psychological first aid training online. This valuable service is accessible to everyone, no matter where they live in the world.</p>\n<p><em>Safety</em><br />\nSafety refers to the capacity of an individual or organization to prevent, detect and respond to accidental harm. It encompasses both physical and psychological elements as well as various environmental components.</p>\n<p>Safety has the potential to protect both individual and community health and well-being, while increasing productivity at work. A safe workplace can reduce accidents, injuries, as well as costs related to worker&#8217;s compensation, retraining programs, and equipment repair projects.</p>\n<p>A secure work environment will also boost employee morale, as they know their employer cares about their wellbeing. This is essential in an age when employee turnover and poor performance can result in massive financial losses for companies.</p>\n<p>Organizations can benefit from the expertise of safety analysts, occupational health nurses and injury prevention specialists by creating a safer and more productive workplace.</p>\n<p>These professionals apply their understanding of various risks and hazards to craft an effective safety plan for the company, often drawing upon specific industry expertise.</p>\n<p>One of the most crucial tasks these professionals perform is ensuring all employees receive adequate safety training. Doing this helps reduce the risk of accidents and illnesses for everyone involved &#8211; from managers to workers &#8211; on site.</p>\n<p>Many employers have stringent policies regarding worker safety. Although these measures can be costly, the investment in safeguarding employees and the company&#8217;s assets is well worth it.</p>\n<p>Alcoa, for instance, has demonstrated how its commitment to occupational safety can increase profits. CEO Paul O&#8217;Neill made it a point to invite employees to share their safety improvement ideas with him; this incentivized workers to take initiative and made Alcoa an increasingly safer workplace for employees.</p>\n<p><em>Calm &amp; Comfort</em><br />\nCalm and comfort are essential to those experiencing distress. Psychological first aid training teaches you how to help others feel at ease and connected with appropriate resources and support systems.</p>\n<p>Physical injuries can be treated quickly, while emotional distress takes more time to resolve. Therefore, helping someone cope with a disaster may have long-lasting benefits on their mental wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Psychological first aid techniques can also be beneficial during long-term crises like pandemics. According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network, strategies that aid individuals during disasters also enable them to cope with chronic stress and make healthy coping decisions for the future.</p>\n<p>When responding to someone in distress, it&#8217;s essential to remain composed and maintain a positive outlook. You can do this by observing your own reactions to symptoms and speaking in a soothing voice. You could also utilize simple tools like taking a deep breath and counting down from four before exhaling slowly.</p>\n<p>Staying calm can help you maintain control over your emotions and inspire your patient to do the same. By remaining composed, it sends a signal that they&#8217;re safe in a secure environment which then encourages them to begin relaxing themselves.</p>\n<p>Psychological first aid is a skill set anyone can acquire; it does not require special mental health training or professional expertise. According to the World Health Organization, providing psychological first aid is an approach people can take when faced with stressful or traumatic circumstances. It serves as a way for people to provide help and comfort during these trying times.</p>\n<p><em>Connectedness</em><br />\nPsychological first aid is the practice of meeting the mental health needs of those affected by trauma. While it cannot replace long-term, professional interventions, it can help people cope with immediate situations and promote improved long-term health outcomes.</p>\n<p>Psychological first aid techniques aim to promote safety, comfort and relaxation; self-empowerment, connectedness, hope and the capacity for problem-solving. This type of support is typically offered during early recovery phases for survivors but may also be utilized during ongoing crises.</p>\n<p>PFA training can be provided by anyone with a passion for helping others, such as mental health professionals, disaster response workers, volunteers or those interested in trauma and resilience. It has the potential to take place in many settings like field hospitals and medical triage areas; emergency departments; evacuation centers; feeding locations; crisis hotlines/phone banks; shelters; homes; businesses; and communities.</p>\n<p>Psychological first aid emphasizes listening and responding to individuals&#8217; reactions. This necessitates a compassionate, nonjudgmental approach that does not pressure individuals into disclosing their emotions or behaviors.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it involves offering practical assistance and connecting them to resources and social support systems. While these objectives can be accomplished using a variety of methods, all adhere to certain key principles.</p>\n<p>Survivors need a sense of safety and control over their lives, particularly during times of intense stress and uncertainty. Psychological first aid can assist them with this by connecting them to essential resources, reuniting them with loved ones and friends, as well as offering hope that they will be able to move forward in their recovery process.</p>\n<p><em>Self-Empowerment</em><br />\nPsychological first aid techniques cannot replace long-term professional mental health interventions, but they can help people remain calm, reduce acute stress and promote healthy recovery. This may reduce burnout among healthcare providers who deal with stressful medical situations and may improve long-term mental health outcomes for trauma survivors.</p>\n<p>Psychological First Aid strives to foster an atmosphere of safety, calm and comfort; connectedness; self-efficacy; empowerment; and hope. It teaches skills that increase personal resilience and effectiveness when aiding others during crisis situations &#8211; whether at work or in the community.</p>\n<p>After disasters, individuals often experience a range of emotions such as fear, confusion, shock, grief, anger, withdrawal, guilt and feelings of hopelessness. These negative emotions can interfere with one&#8217;s capacity for dealing with current needs and cause lack of self-assurance.</p>\n<p>PFA techniques are intended to make people who have experienced traumatic events feel calmer and more assured in their capacity for managing their situation. It also aids trauma survivors recover from their injuries with hope.</p>\n<p>When confronted with a traumatic event, people can feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they are presented with. PFA training seeks to give these individuals space and comfort in focusing solely on their feelings and thoughts without fear of judgement from others.</p>\n<p>Individuals&#8217; responses to traumatic events will differ, and depending on their age or developmental stage may require different forms of assistance. According to the National Child Traumatic Stress Networkopen_in_new, trainers should adapt their language according to each individual&#8217;s needs and provide appropriate responses.</p>\n<p>Following a traumatic event, individuals often become in a state of shock and require basic needs that must be met in order to survive the next few hours or days. It is essential for those providing assistance to meet these requirements while also helping the individuals understand what they require and remaining calm while doing so.</p>\n<p><em>Hope</em><br />\nHope is the belief that things can get better, even if it seems impossible. This belief can be an essential tool in providing psychological first aid during times of crisis and should always be kept in mind when providing such care.</p>\n<p>Building hope requires accurate information about people&#8217;s situations and what they can do to make things better. Furthermore, survivors need to feel supported and equipped with social supports and resources that will assist them.</p>\n<p>Though some people may not require a great deal of emotional support, most do. It is essential to remember that those experiencing emotional distress may be at greater risk for long-term mental health problems; early intervention is key in order to avoid these issues from developing.</p>\n<p>Psychological First Aid training teaches skills to create and sustain an atmosphere of safety, comfort, connectedness, self-empowerment and hope during emergencies. This evidence-based approach can be employed in various settings such as hospitals, shelters, field hospitals or medical triage areas, evacuation centers or emergency operations centers; feeding locations; crisis hotlines/phone banks; disaster assistance service centers; homes or businesses; as well as other community settings.</p>\n<p>PFA is founded on a model known as RAPID (Reflective Listening, Assessment of Needs, Prioritization, Intervention and Disposition). This has been officially adopted by the World Health Organization as an internationally recommended training for supporting people during emergencies.</p>\n",
