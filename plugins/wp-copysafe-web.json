        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20be%20used%20without%20copysafe%3F'>\nCan this plugin be used without CopySafe?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By leaving mode set to demo, an icon will be displayed instead of the object code, but no-right-click saving and drag-n-drop will still be prevented, and you will still be able to control which web browsers can access the page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20web%20browsers%20are%20supported%20by%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nWhich web browsers are supported by this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All browsers are supported on all Windows platforms since XP that still support NPAPI plugins. However web browser versions since late 2015 dropped support for NPAPI. The ArtisBrowswer is most recommended, which actually improves copy protection for everyone, because now a browser properly designed with copy protection in mind can be used without confusion.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20can%20be%20done%20for%20mac%20or%20linux%20computers%3F'>\nWhat can be done for Mac or Linux computers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Nothing that is safe from PrintScreen or screen capture unless they run Windows from within a partition solution like Parallels.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
