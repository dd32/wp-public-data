        "description": "<p>Wibstats is a WordPress plugin that gives a WordPress site, or each blog in a WordPress MU or BuddyPress installation, their own visitor statistics. The data stored includes the page viewed, date and time of visit, visitors browser, operating system and screen resolution, and the geographic location of the visitor (country and city) where it is possible to determine that information.</p>\n<p>The plugin uses freely available APIs from several providers to determine the geographic location of the visitor. One of the APIs is chosen randomly for each visit to spread the load across each of the API providers.</p>\n<p>A range of graphs and tables are available to users to see the visitors to their blog. WordPress MU site administrators also have the option to easily view the statistics for any particular blog, as well as for the main site.</p>\n<p>The plugin relies on the <code>wp_footer</code> action, normally used in the footer.php file of the theme. Without this action no visitor statistics will be stored. Please check each template available to your end users to ensure they all use the <code>wp_footer action</code>.</p>\n<h3>Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>WibStats allows you to include statistics from your site in your blog posts and pages. This is done with shortcodes, simple bits of text that set some parameters for the information to display. For example:</p>\n<pre><code>[wibstats report=\"popularsearches\"] \n</code></pre>\n<p>Will give you (for example);</p>\n<pre><code>Search          Visitors\nsearch 1        40%\nsearch 2        30%\nsearch 3        20%\nsearch 4        10% \n</code></pre>\n<p>Please note these examples here are not formatted correctly (due to WordPress readme file restrictions). The proper code looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"wibstats_report [name of the report]\"&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n    &lt;thead&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Column 1&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Column 2&lt;/th&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;Row 1, column 1&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;Row 1, column 2&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;Row 2, column 1&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;Row 2, column 2&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Want another example? OK:</p>\n<pre><code>[wibstats report=\"recentcountries\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Gives:</p>\n<pre><code>Country             Time\nUnited Kingdom      9:22 pm\nUnited States       9:21 pm\nPortugal            9:18 pm\n</code></pre>\n<p>When showing country names WibStats will also show a small icon of the flag of that country.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few different reports you can show (these go in the <code>report=\"report-name-here\"</code> bit).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>popularcountries</code><br />\nThe most popular countries to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularcities</code><br />\nThe most popular cities to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>recentcountries</code><br />\nThe most recent countries to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>recentcities</code><br />\nThe most recent cities to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularbrowsers</code><br />\nThe most popular browsers to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularplatforms</code><br />\nThe most popular platforms (operating systems) to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularscreensizes</code><br />\nThe most popular screen sizes to visit your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularsearches</code><br />\nThe most popular search words which found your blog</li>\n<li><code>recentsearches</code><br />\nThe most recent search words which found your blog</li>\n<li><code>populardays</code><br />\nThe most popular days of the week that people visited your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularhours</code><br />\nThe most popular hours of the day that people visited your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularmonths</code><br />\nThe most popular months of the year that people visited your blog</li>\n<li><code>popularreferrers</code><br />\nThe most popular referring websites that sent visitors to your blog</li>\n<li><code>recentreferrers</code><br />\nThe most recent referring websites that sent visitors to your blog</li>\n<li><code>session</code><br />\nA breakdown of the data associated with the current visitor to your blog (their country, city, browser etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A couple of other options allow you to configure these reports as they display on your posts/pages.</p>\n<pre><code>size\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sets the number of items you want to show (minimum 1, maximum 100)</p>\n<pre><code>cache\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sets how long you want the report to be cached for.

        "installation": "<p>For standard WordPress:</p>\n<p>The plugin should be placed in your /wp-content/plugins/ directory, so it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>/wp-content/plugins/\n/wp-content/plugins/wibstats/\n/wp-content/plugins/wibstats/wibstats.php\n/wp-content/plugins/wibstats/wibstats-includes/\n</code></pre>\n<p>For WordPress MU or BuddyPress:</p>\n<p>The plugin should be placed in your /wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory (<em>not</em> /wp-content/plugins/) so it looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>/wp-content/mu-plugins/\n/wp-content/mu-plugins/wibstats.php\n/wp-content/mu-plugins/wibstats-includes/\n</code></pre>\n<p>Wibstats for WordPress MU requires no activation.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Why did you write this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I looked around for a suitable statistics plugin for one of my websites (wibsite.com) but was disappointed in the options available. In fact I tried one of the most popular ones but it was very badly written and I had to remove it as it was killing my server. So, I decided to write one myself.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The stats aren&#8217;t working? What&#8217;s gone wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two reasons visitor stats might not be working:</p>\n<p>1) The wp_footer() action is not being fired in your template. Please ensure that the wp_footer() action is in your footer.php file.</p>\n<p>2) The statistics tables could not be created. If your WordPress database user does not have CREATE TABLE provileges you will need to run these two SQL scripts (replacing [prefix] with your WordPress database prefix, for example &#8220;wp_&#8221;). For WordPress MU the [prefix] needs to be replaced with the base database prefix AND the blog id (for example &#8220;wp_123&#8221;):</p>\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE [prefix]wibstats_sessions ( \nid mediumint( 9 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\ntimestamp bigint( 11 ),\nipaddress VARCHAR( 24 ),\nsessionid VARCHAR( 50 ),\ncolordepth VARCHAR( 3 ),\nscreensize VARCHAR( 12 ),\nbrowser VARCHAR( 50 ),\nversion VARCHAR( 12 ),\nplatform VARCHAR( 50 ),\npage VARCHAR( 255 ),\ntitle varchar( 255 ),\nreferrer VARCHAR( 255 ),\nreferrer_domain VARCHAR( 255 ),\nterms VARCHAR( 255 ),\ncity VARCHAR( 50 ),\ncountry VARCHAR( 50 ),\ncountrycode VARCHAR( 3 ),\nlatitude FLOAT( 10,6 ),\nlongitude FLOAT( 10,6 ),\nPRIMARY KEY  ( id ),\nKEY timestamp ( timestamp ),\nKEY ipaddress ( ipaddress ),\nKEY sessionid ( sessionid ),\nKEY colordepth ( colordepth ),\nKEY screensize ( screensize ),\nKEY browser ( browser ),\nKEY version ( version ),\nKEY platform ( platform ),\nKEY page ( page ),\nKEY title ( title ),\nKEY referrer ( referrer ),\nKEY referrer_domain ( referrer_domain ),\nKEY terms ( terms ),\nKEY city ( city ),\nKEY country ( country ),\nKEY countrycode ( countrycode ),\nKEY latitude ( latitude ),\nKEY longitude ( longitude )\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE [prefix]wibstats_pages ( \nid mediumint( 9 ) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\ntimestamp bigint( 11 ),\npage VARCHAR( 255 ),\ntitle varchar( 255 ),\nsessionid VARCHAR( 50 ),\nreferrer VARCHAR( 255 ),\nreferrer_domain VARCHAR( 255 ),\nterms VARCHAR( 255 ),\nPRIMARY KEY  ( id ),\nKEY timestamp ( timestamp ),\nKEY page ( page ),\nKEY title ( title ),\nKEY sessionid ( sessionid ),\nKEY referrer ( referrer ),\nKEY referrer_domain ( referrer_domain ),\nKEY terms ( terms )\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information and support leave a comment here: http://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/projects/mu-wibstats/</p>\n</p>\n\n",
