This helps prevent overloading your server with too many simultaneous tasks.</p>\n<p>If you see a &#8216;Pending&#8217; status in the &#8216;SEO coverage&#8217; column, it means one of two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The plugin is waiting for the next scheduled task to run (typically within 1-5 minutes).</li>\n<li>The plugin is currently generating data for other entries.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can check the &#8216;AI for SEO&#8217; dashboard to see if any generation is in progress for other items. If many items are pending, it may take longer to process them all.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, the plugin will automatically generate data for all pending items over time. If you need immediate results, you can use the manual generation option for specific items.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20navigate%20to%20the%20page%20i%20want%20to%20edit%20for%20seo%3F'>\nHow do I navigate to the page I want to edit for SEO?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can navigate to the page or post you want to edit through the normal editor, using a page builder like Elementor, or by opening the page directly in the frontend.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20is%20the%20%27ai%20for%20seo%27%20metadata%20editor%20located%3F'>\nWhere is the &#8216;AI for SEO&#8217; metadata editor located?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the &#8216;AI for SEO&#8217; button in the top admin-bar.

Each generation costs 5 credits, regardless of the content&#8217;s word count or image size.<br />\nPlease note that credits are not consumed when you manually edit the metadata or media attributes. Also, credits-wise, it does not make a difference if you only generate metadata for a single field (e.g., the title) or for all fields at once.<br />\nOn the other hand, if you do not make any changes to the content, you can generate the metadata again without consuming additional credits. However, if you make changes to the content, you will need to generate the metadata again, which will consume additional credits.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20try%20the%20%27ai%20for%20seo%27%20plugin%20without%20purchasing%20a%20plan%3F'>\nCan I try the &#8216;AI for SEO&#8217; plugin without purchasing a plan?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the free plan provides you with 100 credits, allowing you to experiment with AI-generated SEO content without any cost.
