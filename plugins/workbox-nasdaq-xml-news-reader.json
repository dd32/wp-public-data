I did enter the USER ID.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Please check if your IP is whitelisted with NASDAQ.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Q: I have a news item that is for the same day as a NASDAQ IR press release, but I want it to appear above the press release in the list. Can I do that?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A: Yes, but it is kind of a kludge. Just edit the time of the news item so it occurs on the same day &#8211; but more recently in the day &#8211; than the NASDAQ IR press release.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
