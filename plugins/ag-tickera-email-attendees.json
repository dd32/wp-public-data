By default Tickera sends email only to buyer of the tickets. This add-on plugin adds functionality to send tickets to attendees (ticket owner) as well. Attendee will receive a link to his/her own ticket only via an email. The email template is hard coded right now. If you guys need to customize the template, reach out. I will add admin menu page from where you can customize the email template to be sent.
