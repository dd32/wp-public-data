        "description": "<p>External or affiliate products are ones that have been linked to other sites or platforms other than WooCommerce. With the <strong>WPC External Variations for WooCommerce</strong> plugin, you are empowered with the ability to set up variable external products. Instead of choosing the external/affiliate product type, users are entitled to insert an external URL to any variation of a variable product and make them external variations.</p>\n<h4>Live demo</h4>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://demo.wpclever.net/wpcstore/product/mens-three-piece-suit/?attribute_pa_color=blue&amp;attribute_pa_size=large\" title=\"live demo\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">live demo</a> here to see how this plugin works.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to customize the text displayed in the button for all external variations generally or specific variations. When customers click on the button under, the link will redirect them to the target site or open a new tab for customers to continue browsing; so the affiliation mission is completed properly.</p>\n<p>External variations can have a normal display like a standard variable product. Buyers will see them as normal variations until the button (in the position of the normal Add to Cart button) is clicked and they are redirected. Moreover, external variations work perfectly with some variation selectors such as <strong>WPC Variations Radio Buttons</strong> &amp; <strong>WPC Variations Table</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another great feature that you can take advantage of with this plugin is that both external variations and standard variations can function properly under the same parent variable product. Buttons will change accordingly when buyers choose between the external and standard variations. There&#8217;s no need to worry about duplicated products or creating new products for external/affiliate purposes.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s beneficial if you run stores on different platforms at the same time, so when a variation is out of stock or not available on WooCommerce, you can redirect customers to purchase that item on a different platform by converting them into external variations in bulk. Don&#8217;t waste any chance to sell your products to customers at all.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited external variations per product</li>\n<li>Custom button text replacement for all at once or each variation</li>\n<li>Open the link in the same tab or a new tab</li>\n<li>Both external and standard variations can work in the same product</li>\n<li>Automatically convert out-of-stock variations into external variations</li>\n<li>Display an error message when customers press the add to cart button</li>\n<li>Compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variation-swatches/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Variation Swatches</a></li>\n<li>Compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variation-duplicator/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Variation Duplicator</a></li>\n<li>Compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variation-bulk-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Variation Bulk Editor</a></li>\n<li>Compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variations-table/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Variations Table</a></li>\n<li>Compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-variations-radio-buttons/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Variations Radio Buttons</a></li>\n<li>Compatible with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpc-sticky-add-to-cart/\" rel=\"ugc\">WPC Sticky Add to Cart</a></li>\n<li>Compatible with common WordPress themes, Woo plugins/add-ons</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>External Service</h4>\n<p>This plugin used WordPress.org API (https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/) to get WPClever&#8217;s plugin listing once a day.
