It allows multiple waves to be displayed on the same page- useful if you‚Äôre going to have multiple waves in a single post, or individual waves across multiple posts being displayed on the front page of your blog.</p>\n<p>Waves are embedded by using shortcodes (e.g. [wave id=&#8221;wave-id&#8221;]). Google is the default provider, to change this you‚Äôll simply need to change the type attribute of the shortcode, e.g. [wave id=&#8221;wave-id&#8221; type=&#8221;google-wave-sandbox&#8221;] for the Google Wave Sandbox. Alternative content (for when javascript is disabled or the wave embed API fails to load) can be added by placing content between the shortcode tags e.g. [wave id=&#8221;wave-id&#8221;]zomgwtf rss bbq[/wave] &#8211; the alt content is removed after the Wave has been loaded.</p>\n<p>Additionally, ‚ÄúEmbed Wave‚Äù is extensible, in that new providers can be added by other plugins via the WordPress filter system. In fact, the plugin does this itself in order to add Google Wave.</p>\n",
