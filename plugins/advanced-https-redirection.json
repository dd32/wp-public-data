        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>1) Upload advanced-https-redirection folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.<br />\n2) Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.<br />\n3) Configure the plugin by going to Settings =&gt; Advanced https redirection, you can override these global settings in posts, terms, and all other front-end pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do i redirect the whole domain to https or http?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the plugin&#8217;s settings page and then select the option Redirect to https in all the different options including static resources. If you wish to redirect the whole domain to http then select Redirect to http in all the different options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work with all different Servers?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, except for the redirection of the static resources &#8211; like images. You need to be on Apache and using an htaccess file for this option to work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to redirect static resources but i\\&#8217;m not on Apache or i don\\&#8217;t use an htaccess file?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment redirecting static resources works only by adding rewrite rules to an existing htaccess file, so if you are not on Apache or ypu are not using htaccess this option will not work &#8211; you will be informed in the settings page of this plugin whether this option will work for you or not.</p>\n<p>In the future i may make this plugin compatible with more servers.</p>\n<p>However, If you are using Apache this makes it quite easy for you to manage the redirection yourself, go to the plugin and choose what redirection status you want to use, and whether you want to redirect static resources to http or https. After choosing these options you will have a code that is meant to be inserted in your htaccess file, copy that code and insert it in your main Apache configuration file.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
