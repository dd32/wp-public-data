        "faq": "<h4>I have images of multiple dimensions. How can I classify them?</h4>\n<p>You can put them in multiple sub-directories. Yes. Just update your file name after your base url. eg. <code>[stockimage name='sub-directory/image-name.jpg']</code></p>\n<p>You can use this trick to classify banners, logos, icons or full sized images.</p>\n<h4>How can I protect my images?</h4>\n<p>This plugin is to consume your hosted images. Providing safety to your hosted images is beyond the scope of the plugin. However, you can use .htaccess and index.php files to prevent directly listing and hot-linking to your images.</p>\n<h4>How can I setup my hosted server?</h4>\n<p>Actual hosting of your photography is not the scope of this plugin. But you should upload your photos anywhere accessible via web. You can use Dropbox or FTP like tools to upload your file on your server.</p>\n<p>Consult with your hosting provider regarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to upload your files</li>\n<li>Bandwidth you are using</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Can I upload raw images from my camera?</h4>\n<p>Not recommended due to file size and bandwidth. Rather make suitable thumbnails or at least optimize your images. Your website should always have least possible content output.</p>\n",
