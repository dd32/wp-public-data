Thus probably most calendars will only give the plain text in the Description in the iCal output.<br />\nSecondly: For security reasons  this plugin filters the HTML to convert characters that have special significance in HTML to the corresponding HTML-entities.</p>\n<p>But if you trust the output of the calendar application you can set a checkbox to allow safe html in the output. So if you manage to get the HTML in the Description and you set the checkbox to allow safe html you can get that html in the output, with exception of the tags that are not considered safe like SCRIPT and unknown tags.<br />\nAnd with the current version  of Google Calendar you can put some HTML in the Description output. (April 2022) I saw the  &lt;a&gt; (link),  &lt;b&gt; (bold text),  &lt;i&gt; (italic text),  &lt;u&gt; (underlined text) and  &lt;br&gt; (linebreak) tags in a iCal description. They will all come through with &#8220;Allow safe html&#8221; checkbox on. Probably even more is possible, but Google can also decide to comply more to the standard.<br />\nWith Microsoft Outlook the HTML tags were filtered away and did not reach the iCal description</p>\n<p>In case you have all kinds of HTML in your appointments a plugin that uses the API of te calendar-application might be a better choice for you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20microsoft%20office%20outlook%20calendar%3F'>\nHow to use Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you have to share your calendar to make it public available, or to create and share a public calendar. Private calendars cannot be accessed by this plugin.<br />\nThen publish it as  an ICS link and use this link address. (something like https://outlook.live.com/owa/calendar/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/&#8230;/cid-&#8230;/calendar.ics) (works from version 1.3.1 of this widget)<br />\n<a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-your-calendar-in-outlook-on-the-web-7ecef8ae-139c-40d9-bae2-a23977ee58d5\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More details on Microsoft Office support</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20only%20see%20the%20widget%20not%20the%20block'>\nI only see the widget not the block\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Are you using at least WP 5.9? Below 5.9 the block doesn&#8217;t work.<br />\nAre you using a page builder like Elementor? The block might not show in the page builder editor, try if it is available in the WordPress editor.<br />\nTo support users wo cannot use the Gutenberg block I have in v2.1.1 (with pain in my hart because Gutenberg blocks are in my opinion the future of WP) synchronized the output of the widget again with that of the block.<br />\n Otherwise they needed to use a work-around with an extra plugin like described in <a href=\"https://gutenberghub.com/how-to-display-gutenberg-blocks-in-other-page-builders/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Display Gutenberg Blocks in Other Page Builders (Elementor, Divi, etc)</a> or use an other plugin that adds a shortcode to a Gutenberg block or maybe some pro functionality of Elementor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20use%20apple%20calendar%20%28icloud%20mac%2Fios%29%3F'>\nHow to use Apple Calendar (iCloud Mac/ios)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Choose the calendar you want to share. On the line of that calendar click on the radio symbol (a dot with three quart circles) right in that line. In the pop up Calendar Sharing check the box Public Calendar. You see the url below something like webcal://p59-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/MTQxNzk0NDA2NjE0MTc5AAAAAXt2Dy6XXXXXPXXxuZnTLDV9xr6A6_m3r_GU33Qj. Click on Copy Link and OK. Paste that in the &#8220;Calendar ID, or iCal URL&#8221; field of the widget (before version 1.3.1 you have to change webcal in https)<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/icloud-configure-public-calendar\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More details on the MacObserver</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='error%3A%20curl%20error%2028%3A%20operation%20timed%20out%20after%205000%20milliseconds%20with%200%20bytes%20received'>\nError: cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 5000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably the calendar is not public (yet), you can copy the link before the agenda is actually published.

Test e.g. with an appointment for the next day and refresh the cache or wait till the cache is refreshed.<br />\nCheck if you can download the ics file you have designated in the widget with a browser. At least if it is a text file with the first line &#8220;BEGIN:VCALENDAR&#8221; and further lines &#8220;BEGIN:VEVENT&#8221; and lines &#8220;END:VEVENT&#8221;.

With this setting active, at first the widget will be presented as a placeholder with only the title and the text processing. In the HTML of this placeholder are also some ID\\&#8217;s as parameters for the javascript REST call to fetch the content after the page is loaded. This fetch is not executed (correct).<br />\nTo work correct Javascript must be enabled in a browser with version newer than 2016 but not in Internet Explorer.<br />\nThis is probably caused because the javascript view file with the fetch command is not loaded e.g. in the editor of Elementor or an other pagebuilder that tries to show a preview of the widget but does not load the necessary Javascript. This is a known issue, you could work around it by first set &#8220;Use WordPress timezone settings, no REST&#8221; until you are satisfied with all the other settings and then set &#8220;Use Client timezone &#8230;&#8221;.<br />\nIf you change the Sibid without clicking the Update button, the new Sibid may already be saved in the plugin options for the REST call, but not in the block attributes. If you still click Update, the problem will be resolved.<br />\nThe REST call might also have failed by other reasons, then another try would probably solve the issue, but I have never seen that in testing.<br />\nIf you cannot resolve it, you can of course report an error / question in our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-google-icalendar-widget\" rel=\"ugc\">community support forum</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20an%20event%20calendar%20that%20only%20uses%20days%2C%20not%20times%2C%20like%20a%20holiday%20calendar%3F'>\nCan I use an event calendar that only uses days, not times, like a holiday calendar?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you can, since v1.2.0, I have tested with <a href=\"https://p24-calendars.icloud.com/holiday/NL_nl.ics\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://p24-calendars.icloud.com/holiday/NL_nl.ics</a> .</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='this%20block%20has%20encountered%20an%20error%20and%20cannot%20be%20previewed'>\nThis block has encountered an error and cannot be previewed\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably you have (re)opened a page where the block is edited but your password cookie is expired.<br />\nLog in in WordPress again and open the page again.
