This occurs before the WordPress login screen is displayed, ensuring that unauthorized users are blocked by the server itself, reducing the load on WordPress and the database. In contrast, WordPress login credentials are checked by WordPress after the login page is loaded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20a%20new%20user%3F'>\nHow do I add a new user?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the &#8216;Protect WP Login&#8217; page under the admin menu, enter a username and password, and click &#8216;Save&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20delete%20a%20user%3F'>\nHow do I delete a user?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the same page, enter the username of the user you want to delete in the &#8216;Eliminar Usuario&#8217; section and click &#8216;Eliminar Usuario&#8217;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
