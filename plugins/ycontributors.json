We like two great WP plugins that work with yContributors, User Photo (https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-photo/) and Rich Text Biography (https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rich-text-biography/) that should help you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change how things look?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Certainly. CSS is your best friend. everything is id&#8217;d and class&#8217;d.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>There&#8217;s a weird discrepancy between the search results and the rows of users that show</h4>\n<p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t excluded users with 0 posts.  Go to the back end and make sure to check the boxes next to the names of anyone with 0 posts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Spacing issues</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See above question on 0 posts, but also you&#8217;ll probably need to style it.  I purposefully left it sparsely styled so you can use your stylesheet.  Try the table format to see if it works better for you, or please be in touch with us for customization.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;see all posts by x&#8221; page is all screwed up</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Remember that to style an individual author&#8217;s post list, you must code your own wp template called authors.php.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
