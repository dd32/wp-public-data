        "description": "<p><strong>WooCommerce requires at least: 2.2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>WooCommerce tested up to: 2.4.12</strong></p>\n<p>While working on a project there was a situation where I needed to change the author assigned to a WooCommerce product. The product author was receiving unwanted notifications when reviews for the product were being left. We did not want to turn the notifications off; we just wanted them to go to a different author or user. Changing the author is easily possible with posts and pages, but the option isn&#8217;t available by default for WooCommerce products.</p>\n<p>Adding the functionality is very simple &#8211; it involves adding author support to the product post type which can be accomplished by adding the following to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file:</p>\n<pre><code>if ( post_type_exists( 'product' ) ) {\n    add_post_type_support( 'product', 'author' );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, for users who don&#8217;t want to touch the functions.php file, or would prefer a solution that is not restricted to a theme, I created this simple plugin. Just activate the plugin with WooCommerce also installed and you will be able to change the author of a product as if it were a standard post or page.<br />\nAfter activating the plugin you will be able to change the author assigned to a WooCommerce product by editing the product in the WP dashboard. See screenshot for details.</p>\n<p>If you do not see a place to change the author, check the screen options and make sure that &#8216;Author&#8217; is checked. See screenshot for details.</p>\n<h4>Please note that WooCommerce must be installed and activated for the plugin to work.</h4>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>Installing this plugin automatically is the easiest option. You can install the plugin automatically by going to the plugins section in WordPress and clicking Add New. Type &#8220;WooCommerce Change Product Author&#8221; in the search bar and install the plugin by clicking the Install Now button.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>To manually install the plugin you&#8217;ll need to download the plugin to your computer and upload it to your server via FTP or another method. The plugin needs to be extracted in the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder. Once done you should be able to activate it as usual.</p>\n<p>If you are having trouble, take a look at the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Managing Plugins</a> section in the WordPress Codex, it has more information on this topic.</p>\n",
