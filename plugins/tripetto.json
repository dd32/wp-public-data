You can use all your forms in three form layouts, also named &#8216;form faces&#8217; in Tripetto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autoscroll form face</strong>: the autoscroll form face presents one question at a time and is akin to Typeform’s conversational forms;</li>\n<li><strong>Chat form face</strong>: the chat form face presents all questions and answers as speech bubbles and is partly inspired by Landbot;</li>\n<li><strong>Classic form face</strong>: the classic form face presents question fields in a traditional form as often seen in SurveyMonkey and the likes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just use the form face that suits your form and purpose best. <a href=\"https://tripetto.com/form-layouts/\" title=\"More info about form faces\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See all form layouts.</a></p>\n<p>💡 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create smart forms that react to the given answers of your respondents.

You can use all your forms in three form layouts, also named &#8216;form faces&#8217; in Tripetto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autoscroll form face</strong>: the autoscroll form face presents one question at a time and is akin to Typeform’s conversational forms;</li>\n<li><strong>Chat form face</strong>: the chat form face presents all questions and answers as speech bubbles and is partly inspired by Landbot;</li>\n<li><strong>Classic form face</strong>: the classic form face presents question fields in a traditional form as often seen in SurveyMonkey and the likes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just use the form face that suits your form and purpose best. <a href=\"https://tripetto.com/form-layouts/\" title=\"More info about form faces\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See all form layouts.</a></p>\n<p>💡 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create smart forms that react to the given answers of your respondents.
