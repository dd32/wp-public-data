You can use all your forms in three form layouts, also named &#8216;form faces&#8217; in Tripetto:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autoscroll form face</strong>: the autoscroll form face presents one question at a time and is akin to Typeform‚Äôs conversational forms;</li>\n<li><strong>Chat form face</strong>: the chat form face presents all questions and answers as speech bubbles and is partly inspired by Landbot;</li>\n<li><strong>Classic form face</strong>: the classic form face presents question fields in a traditional form as often seen in SurveyMonkey and the likes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just use the form face that suits your form and purpose best. <a href=\"https://tripetto.com/form-layouts/\" title=\"More info about form faces\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See all form layouts.</a></p>\n<p>üí° With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create smart forms that react to the given answers of your respondents.
