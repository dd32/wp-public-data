Consent logs are stored (optional).</li>\n<li>Scripts will be output and executed only after the user has accepted the respective categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cookie Notice &amp; Consent aims to help you comply with local privacy laws like GDPR/DSGVO. It does not offer a one-click solution though. Please set up your website properly and carefully to comply with applicable laws.</p>\n<h4>Developer focus</h4>\n<p>Please note that <strong>Cookie Notice &amp; Consent</strong> is generally geared towards developers and technically savvy site administrators. Although it does provide pre-made themes, the plugin does not provide separate options for individual design aspects, and does not plan to provide those in the future. It is up to the developer/administrator to add further styling to match the theme using CSS.</p>\n<p>This plugin does not add any branding (neither visually nor textually), top-level admin menu items or user-facing indicators. It aims to be usable in client projects by blending in with WordPress core appearance, naming and settings. Settings screens are visible to administrator level users only.</p>\n<h4>What this plugin does not provide</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Beyond the pre-made, as-is themes, this plugin does not offer styling options via the settings screen (please contact your webdev for further design customization)</li>\n<li>This plugin does not provide scanning for, detecting or automatic blocking content like embeds, scripts or cookies</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Shortcodes and functions</h4>\n<p>This plugin currently provides the following shortcodes and public functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortcode [revoke_cookie_consent]: Outputs a revoke consent button that clears the consent cookie</li>\n<li>Shortcode [cookie_consent_status]: Outputs a formatted string indicating the users consent choice</li>\n<li>Function <code>is_cookie_consent_set()</code>: Returns whether the consent has been set by the user</li>\n<li>Function <code>is_cookie_category_accepted( $category )</code>: Returns whether the given cookie category has been accepted by the user (valid values: essential, functional, marketing)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disclaimer</h4>\n<p><strong>This plugin does not represent legal advice and assumes no liability whatsoever. Please obtain proper advice from real lawyers if in doubt.</strong></p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/cookie-notice-consent</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Configure your settings using the Settings-&gt;Cookies screen</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20modify%20the%20notice%20banner%20styling%3F'>\nHow can I modify the notice banner styling?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can choose between pre-defined themes. Apart from those, and the accent color option, further customization requires CSS skills. Applicable CSS classes are best found in the source code. Included styling is done via class names, which makes it easy to overwrite using the parent element&#8217;s ID.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20planning%20to%20add%20more%20features%3F'>\nAre you planning to add more features?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Right now, I&#8217;m interested in looking into auto-blocking of embeds. Plans might change though.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%27s%20feature%20x%20that%20i%20need%20for%20full%20compliance%20in%20my%20country%3F'>\nWhere&#8217;s feature X that I need for full compliance in my country?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If this plugin does not meet your legal requirements, I encourage you not to use it. Please note that this plugin will probably never turn into a one-click solution for regular users. This plugin is geared towards developers or at least technically savvy users.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
