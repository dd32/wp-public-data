Just:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download using the button above, unzip and place the folder in your wp-content/plugins/ folder. Alternately,<br />\ninstall using WordPress&#8217; built-in plugin installer.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions in the Description tab to add, insert, and configure feature lists.</li>\n</ol>\n",

I&#8217;ve included<br />\nclasses for the elements that you can create selectors for as well. If you need any custom styling and you don&#8217;t want<br />\nto worry about this, contact me at admin@qedev.com and we can discuss any jobs you need done.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I remove a feature group?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>On the Edit Feature List page, simply remove all the features from the feature group you wish to delete.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

The text is set on the Post page just like checkboxes.</li>\n<li>Feature lists previously defined will no longer work. I apologise for the inconvenience but these and future improvements<br />\nrequired moving to a more flexible, incompatible underlying architecture. I thought it was best to do this now rather than<br />\ndown the line.</li>\n<li>78% more love was added to the plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release</li>\n</ul>\n"
