You have been warned.</p>\n<p>That said, it&#8217;s perfectly &#8220;safe&#8221;, given a certain definition of the word &#8220;safe&#8221;. The &#8220;create a new theme&#8221; screen itself is secure, and inaccessible to anybody who lacks the capability to &#8220;edit_plugins&#8221; to begin with. Themeinception also uses the proper WP_Filesystem methods to create the theme files, so there&#8217;s no worries about incorrect file ownership on shared hosting. You may have to give it FTP credentials on some hosts for it to be able to create the theme, that&#8217;s the WP_Filesystem at work, making sure the files are correctly &#8220;owned&#8221;.</p>\n<p>All this plugin really does is make it quick and easy to create a new one-off theme and take you directly to editing it. Cowboy-coding at its finest.</p>\n<h4>For the love of god, man, why?</h4>\n<p>The pluginception plugin by Otto42 inspired me</p>\n<h4>I want this plugin to do something other than what it does.</h4>\n<p>Then modify the plugin however you like to do whatever you want. Don&#8217;t bother me with it. This plugin does what I want it to do.</p>\n",
