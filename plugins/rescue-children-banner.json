If it is, start a post in the support forums (see below for details).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will the link open in a new window?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is an option to control whether it does or not, but be aware that forcing links to open in a new window <a href=\"http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/01/should-links-open-in-new-windows/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">is considered a bad practice</a>. Please consider leaving it off.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I prevent the banner from overlapping my header on smartphones or other small screens?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can go to the General Settings page and check the &#8216;Move to Bottom on Small Screens&#8217; box. That will move the banner to the bottom of the page for smartphones and other devices with small screens.</p>\n<p>Note that this won&#8217;t work in Internet Explorer 8 or below, because it doesn&#8217;t support modern web standards.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
