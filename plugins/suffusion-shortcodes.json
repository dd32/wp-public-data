If you have used those shortcodes on your website, then you<br />\ndefinitely need this plugin. As of version 4.4.8 of Suffusion, the shortcodes have been removed from the theme. This plugin now<br />\nstands alone and is fully featured, so you can use it by itself, regardless of which version of Suffusion you use, or whether<br />\nyou use Suffusion at all.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make this work with other themes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just activate the plugin, and you are done.
