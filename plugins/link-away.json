When the user clicks any link that would normally take them to the single post page for that post, they will bypass the post on your site and go directly to the article location.</p>\n<p>The value of this plugin compared to others that might be similar, is that it is clean and lightweight. It&#8217;s so simple, in fact, that the actual functionalitly is only about a half dozen lines of code.</p>\n<p>Because it filters the WP function that retrieves the permalink and replaces it with the given URL as it is returned, with a very high priority, it should have no problem working across all themes and regardless of other plugins.</p>\n",

Works on regular and public custom post types.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a pretty simple plugin. If you don&#8217;t want to change a post, just ignore the Link Away settings, but when you do want a post to link away, add the complete URL where you want users to go.</p>\n<p>Optionally, you can select to have the new location open in a new window.</p>\n<p>Click the test button and the URL will open in a small popup in case you want to verify the URL before you update the post.</p>\n",
