We collect your payment details when you select your first paid plan.<br />\nAfter each successful charge, we will send you a billing receipt. Check your user account profile to see your latest and upcoming invoices.</p>\n<p><em>Do my subscribers need a mobile app to use PushPro?</em></p>\n<p>No, they don’t! The great thing about PushPro is that we send web-based push notifications. Once a visitor to your website has opted in to push notifications,<br />\nthey get sent to them straight from your website, no mobile app needed.</p>\n<p><em>How do I send a push notification?</em></p>\n<p>You can send a push notification in a few easy steps. Select the domain you want to send push notifications from. Next up, go to “notifications” in the sidebar menu and follow the steps to create a push notification. Give your notification a name, provide it with a message title, body text, destination URL and a button text.<br />\nIn step two you can provide the notification with a Time to Live and a vibration pattern<br />\nYou can preview the notification by pressing “Test Now”. Finally, save the notification as a draft, schedule the notification or send it directly.</p>\n<p><em>What happens if I exceed my plan’s subscriber limit?</em></p>\n<p>We will notify you when you reach 50%, 80% and 100% of your plan’s subscriber limit, so you will have plenty of time to consider an upgrade. We will send you an alert in your user profile to make sure you are always up to speed.<br />\nIf you do hit the 100% limit, we will still register new subscribers for a limited period. However, you won’t be able to send them push notifications.<br />\nWhen you upgrade your plan, these ‘sleeping’ subscribers will be reactivated.</p>\n",
