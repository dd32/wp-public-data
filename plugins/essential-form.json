It will not be possible for robots to send you spam. Only humans will be able to do it manually.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, in your <strong>contact form</strong> you just need the fields name, email, message, and an agreement checkbox. If you need more, this plugin is not for you. In that case install a <strong>Contact Form</strong> plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" rel=\"ugc\">Contact Form 7</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/essential-form/\" rel=\"ugc\">Essential Form</a> adds no HTTP requests. It consumes zero. When we say it&#8217;s the <strong>lightest contact form</strong> we are not joking at all.</p>\n<p>The entire zip of the plugin is 14 kB. On the page where you add the shortcode it inlines a very tiny script of pure Vanilla JavaScript that is around 1 kilobyte. On the pages where you have no forms, of course, it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<p>No jQuery, no libraries, nothing of this kind of bloated stuff.</p>\n<p>The anti-spam system runs behind the scenes in a very clever way without the need for any annoying captcha or other similar systems which some times even fail.</p>\n<p>Just to give you an idea of the security level of this plugin, the name of the Ajax action that manages the sending of the email is something like essential_form_fbe52b696, where the last part is different on every website.</p>\n<p>A robot will never be able to guess the names of the functions that are involved during the process.</p>\n<p>Morover, the submission is based on a random token that is always different at each form submission, and 20 random keys which are unique for every website.</p>\n<p>All the anti-spam system works behind the scenes without disturbing the users, and most of all, it works.</p>\n<h3>How to add a contact form on the page</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the shortcode [essential_form]</li>\n<li>Done!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features of the contanct form</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Extremely lightweight. It inlines 1 kb (when the document is compressed it will be even smaller) of pure Vanilla JavaScript only on the page where you add the shortcode, and never above the fold. On the other pages, it doesn&#8217;t exist. We can say it exists on the page where you add the shortcode only because you see the <strong>contact form</strong>, in another case, it would be impossible to see that this plugin exists on that page. No tools will be able to measure consumption due to this plugin.</li>\n<li>The <strong>contact form</strong> will have only the fields name, email, message, and an agreement checkbox. Nothing else. If you need more, better you use a different plugin. If those fields are all that you need, you will love this plugin.</li>\n<li>It inherits the style of your theme. If you want a different style, you need to write your custom CSS or use a different plugin.</li>\n<li>It has a very powerful anti-spam system. It will be impossible for robots to send spam through the <strong>contact form</strong>. Only humans can send spam manually.</li>\n<li>No need for annoying captcha or similar systems that make visitors lose their nerves. The anti-spam system is behind the scenes, and it&#8217;s very powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shortcode parameters</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>label_email</li>\n<li>label_message</li>\n<li>button_text</li>\n<li>agreement_text</li>\n<li>success_message</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If assigned, the shortcode will look like [essential_form label_emal=&#8221;Your email&#8221; lable_message=&#8221;Your message&#8221; button_text=&#8221;Send&#8221; agreement_text=&#8221;You agree with our privacy policy&#8221; success_message=&#8221;Thank you for your message!&#8221;]</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t assign the parameters of the shortcode, the plugin will take the default settings.</p>\n<h3>How to customize the contact forms</h3>\n<p>You can also customize the contact forms throught the filter hook &#8216;essential_form_settings&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Here an example.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'essential_form_settings',function( $options ){\n    return array(\n        'email_from' =&gt; 'youremail@mail.com',\n        'email_to' =&gt; 'youremail@mail.com',\n        'email_subject' =&gt; sprintf( esc_html__( 'Message from %s','your-domain' ),get_bloginfo( 'name' ) ),\n        'label_name' =&gt; __( 'Name','your-domain' ),\n        'label_email' =&gt; __( 'Email','your-domain' ),\n        'label_message' =&gt; __( 'Message','your-domain' ),\n        'button_text' =&gt; __( 'Send','your-domain' ),\n        'agreement_text' =&gt; __( 'By submitting this form I agree with the privacy policy','your-domain' ),\n        'success_message' =&gt; __( 'Form submitted successfully!
