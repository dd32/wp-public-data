        "faq": "\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin basically allows you to have different versions of your site, each<br />\none with specific content according to the visitor location.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How this plugin changes my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your site is <em>mysite.com</em>, and you have created the locations <em>Japan</em> and<br />\n<em>Italy</em>, when the visitor goes to <em>mysite.com/japan</em> will only see posts<br />\nwhich belong to the Japan location, and when they go to <em>mysite.com/italy</em><br />\nthey will see posts which belong to the Italy location.</p>\n<p>If they go to <em>mysite.com</em> they will only see posts which are not assigned<br />\nto a particular location, unless you define a default location. In that case,<br />\n   they will see posts which belong to such location. Note that assigning a<br />\n   post to the default location will make it appear in all locations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I assign posts to each location?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Basically you create location terms, which are like any other WordPress<br />\ntaxonomy (categories or tags), and then, when creating a post you assign that<br />\nlocation to that post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I create new locations?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The location manager submenu is located inside the <em>Posts Menu</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the *Location Slug* setting for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each market has its own <em>home</em> page, which is something like<br />\n<em>mysite.com/such-location</em>. But, in case you have defined a default location,<br />\n    in that page you will see posts from the specified location mixed with<br />\n    posts from the default location. In case you want to see only a list of<br />\n    posts from the specified location, there is another page which you may see<br />\n    by going to <em>mysite.com/location-slug/such-location</em>. That string,<br />\n    <em>location-slug</em> can be changed by modifying the setting <em>Location Slug</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does the visitor redirection works?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you enable the visitor redirection (in the <em>Settings -&gt; Geolocated Content</em><br />\n        section), the system will attempt to determine which location the<br />\nvisitor is nearer, and it will redirect them there. In order this feature to<br />\nwork you must specify each location latitude and longitude coordinates (that<br />\n        is done when creating a new or editing a new location).</p>\n<p>This redirection only works if the visitor is not navigating any location<br />\n(the visitor is browsing <em>mysite.com</em>, not <em>mysite.com/location</em>).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How the system determines the visitor location?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It uses the WordPress public geo API. You can check it out here:<br />\n<a href=\"https://public-api.wordpress.com/geo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://public-api.wordpress.com/geo/</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the tolerance radius?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The system will always try to redirect the visitor to its nearest location<br />\n(only if the visitor redirection is enabled). If you specify a tolerance<br />\nradius, it will only redirect the visitor to its nearest location if they are<br />\nin a distance no longer that such radius of kilometers from the location.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What does the geolocated settings do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you enable this option, it allows to specify a different setting value for<br />\na specific location. For example, if some plugin allows you to determine the<br />\ncolor of your site background, you can change this color for different<br />\nlocations. Note that this feature may not work in all plugins, it will work in<br />\nplugins which use the <strong>WordPress Settings API</strong> for registering their<br />\nsettings.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin makes my site slower?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It should not, or at least not significantly. If well the geolocation process<br />\nrequires communicating with an external API, it only calls it once a day per<br />\nvisitor (the location of the visitor is stored in a cookie). Also, this plugin<br />\nis compatible with most full page cache plugins, like <strong>Batcache</strong> or <strong>W3<br />\nTotal Cache</strong>, and does not any extra query in front-end requests.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why I cannot assign locations to pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because pages are not supposed to be listed in a archive page. The idea of<br />\nthis plugin is to filter lists or archives according to the visitor location,<br />\n     not to restrict content.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
