Pricing can be controlled by the broker by adjusting the cost per hour and other values of each aircraft. You can also add as many aircraft to the system as you like.</p>\n<p>Instajet is free, but the journeys are calculated using an API. The free version of Instajet allows 5 API calls per month, whilst the premium version allows 250. A premium API key can be purchased from instajet.co.uk.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the Settings-&gt;Instajet screen to configure the plugin</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>How do I add Aircraft?</h4>\n<p>You can add any aircraft you wish to the system by selecting &#8220;Aircraft&#8221; from the WordPress dashboard menu. When adding aircraft, you&#8217;ll need to ensure you fill in all the meta fields required. This includes cruise speed, max capacity, max range, cost per hour and the base cost.</p>\n<h4>How do I adjust the price estimates?</h4>\n<p>To adjust the pricing, edit the cost per hour and base cost values for each aircraft until the price created is as desired.</p>\n<h4>How do I theme Instajet?</h4>\n<p>By default, the plugin will load an Instajet CSS theme to apply styling to the system on the front-end of your website. You can apply your own styling to Instajet by changing the theme to either Bootstrap or Skeleton. This is done via the Instajet Settings page in the WordPress dashboard.</p>\n<h4>How do I manage flight requests?</h4>\n<p>When your customers request a flight, this shows up on the Flight Requests page via the WordPress dashboard menu. You will see the details of their request, including the flight and the aircraft they are requesting quotes for. You can update your customers on the status of their booking by changing the &#8220;Booking Status&#8221; dropdown on the edit page for each request. You&#8217;ll also see all the relevant contact details so you can process the lead.</p>\n"
