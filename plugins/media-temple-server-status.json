The mediatemple API gives access to plenty more<br />\ndata but the Google Charts API makes it difficult to display all this data with the correct units. Once I figure<br />\nout what the best way to handle them are, I will add in the extra data points. I am also planning to add in multiple date ranges as well.</p>\n",

Now uses <code>file_get_contents()</code> which will work on more/all servers and much faster with less memory usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a check to see if cURL is installed on the server since it is used for the (mt) API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>First Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
