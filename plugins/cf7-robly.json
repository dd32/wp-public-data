You’ll also need to <a href=\"mailto:support@robly.com?subject=API access\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact Robly support</a> to get an API ID and key for your account.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>API-what?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>API stands for “Application Programming Interface,” which basically means computer code that is able to talk to other computer systems and get or send information. Most API providers require an API key of some sort (similar to a username and password) to ensure that only authorized people are able to use their services.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What info is sent or received?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you install the plugin and enter your API ID and key, your WordPress site will contact the Robly API, asking for all the lists you have set up in your account. You are then able to choose certain lists to which contact form submissions are added, and those choices are saved in your WordPress options.</li>\n<li>When somebody submits a contact form, WordPress will contact the Robly API and search for that email address in your Robly account. If found, it will update their information according to the settings you specified; otherwise, it will create a new contact with the contact information and add them to the list(s) you selected.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a hard-coded HTML field and it doesn’t show up in the list of fields; what do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the “Add a custom field” button at the bottom of the Robly settings section.</li>\n<li>In the “Custom Field Name” field, enter the <code>name</code> attribute of your custom field.</li>\n<li>Choose the Robly field(s) for the custom field and save the contact form.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
