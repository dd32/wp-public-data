        "faq": "\n<h4>Where do I get my website ID and accesskey to start using the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You will need to visit <a href=\"http://www.icanlocalize.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ICanLocalize</a> and sign up for an account (it&#8217;s free). Then, create a new &#8220;CMS translation&#8221; project.<br />\nThis plugin must already be installed on your blog in order for our system to connect to it and validate the installation.</p>\n<p>Then, your website&#8217;s ID and accesskey are generated. Enter to the plugin admin screen and you&#8217;re ready to start.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this free translation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We pay professional human translators for their work, so we must charge for it too.<br />\nThe payment for the translation will be negotiated directly between you and the translator (using our system).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How good are these translation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All the translators in our system are professional translators, writing in their native language.<br />\nYou can also select to use your own translator, if you&#8217;re already working with one.<br />\nWe guarantee that all translations done by our own translators are excellent.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I localize my theme?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin will not handle your theme localization &#8211; but we can certainly help with this too. You&#8217;ll need to follow these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrap all texts in the theme in gettext calls (this is what WP is doing for itself too).</li>\n<li>Create a PO or POT file that includes all texts to be translated. You&#8217;re welcome to our free online <a href=\"http://www.icanlocalize.com/tools/php_scanner\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">.PO extractor from PHP</a> which will read the ZIP file containing your theme and produce a single .PO file.</li>\n<li>Send the PO file to translation. Again, <a href=\"http://www.icanlocalize.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our translators</a> can do this job for you.</li>\n<li>Save the MO files you get from the translator in the theme folder.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin change my database or break things up?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not. It doesn&#8217;t change the default WordPress tables. Instead, this plugin will create new contents in different blogs, where the translations will be kept.<br />\nAll linking information between the contents in different languages is simply stored as custom fields.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add language selectors between the translated and original language blog?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Follow these instructions for <a href=\"http://sitepress.org/wordpress-translation/automatic-links-between-original-and-translations/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">adding language selectors</a>.<br />\nYou can add a drop down language selector in header.php or a list of available languages at the beginning or end of each post/page.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
