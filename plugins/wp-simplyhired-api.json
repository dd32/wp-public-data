Make note of your publisher ID and job board Url, they are needed to use the SimplyHired API.</li>\n<li>Download and unzip this package to your plugin folder.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress and configure the settings to your liking.

Visit <a href=\"http://buildz.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Construction Jobs at Buildz.net</a> for an in-production example of the plugin in action.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I keep getting a &#8220;no results&#8221; error on my job listing page, what gives?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is usually caused by some incorrect values in your required settings. It could be an invalid publisher ID number, invalid job board Url, or either, an invalid O<em>NET code or severely limiting O</em>NET code. See the <a href=\"http://webstractions.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-simplyhired-api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ page</a> for more information.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where do I find my Blog-a-matic Publisher ID number?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a little obscure to find. Go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in your Job-a-matic.com Partner Dashboard settings <a href=\"https://www.jobamatic.com/a/jbb/partner-dashboard-advanced-xml-api\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">direct link</a>. You will find it half way down the page under <strong>Job Search GET Parameters</strong>. Look for the <em>pshid=xxxxx</em> value. The x&#8217;s will be your Publisher ID number.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does the SimplyHired API have a request limit?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Currently, they do not have a limit on requests. The plugin does transient caching of some high-use data for speed however, which will reduce the number of requests.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
