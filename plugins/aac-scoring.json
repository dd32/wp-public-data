        "description": "<p>Improves Pagespeed/GTMetrix/SEMrush/Yslow scores for Twenty Fourteen and other themes by reducing round trips, moving core CSS above the fold. For best results, you should also employ the following to get the best score:</p>\n<pre><code>Fast Velocity Minify\nSmush IT\nDeclutter WordPress\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<pre><code>    - removes excessive fonts:\n            Lato (from google)\n            Open Sans (from google - part of WP Embed load)\n        For Emphasize theme\n            Genericons (replace with Font Awesome if in use)\n- removes excessive json+ld entries\n    - Embedding Styles Above-the-fold:\n    Child Theme Configurator (child theme styles)\n            Twentyfourteen Styles (and main theme styles for other themes)\n    Icon-Fonts when Font Awesome in use\n    Font Awesome Four Menus (overrides Icon-Fonts font-awesome)\n    Fourteen Colors\n            WP Bootstrap Tabs\n    Tabby Responsive Tab\n            Simple Custom CSS\n    WP-Columna\n    Responsive Lightbox Fancybox\n    Fancier Author Box\n- removes H1 collisions\n- removed W3 Total Cache comments at end of post\n    W3 Total Cache adds a comment with whitespace that takes \n    lots of processing\n- removed Child Theme Configurator's parent theme\n    older setup, new setup not yet.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>Works best with BWP-Minify and Defer CSS AddOn for BWP Minify already installed, however, this is a plugin with no settings. It just works.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>There&#8217;s 3 ways to install this plugin:</p>\n<h4>1. The easy way</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin (.zip file)</li>\n<li>In your Admin, go to menu Plugins &gt; Add</li>\n<li>Select the tab &#8220;Upload&#8221;</li>\n<li>Upload the .zip file you just downloaded</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>2. The old way (FTP)</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload <code>aac-scoring</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<ol>\n<li>Does it place CSS above the fold automatically?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No. The plugin loads specific CSS above the fold from the Twenty Fourteen and other themes as well as the WP Bootstrap Tabs, Simple Custom CSS, WP-Columna plugins. To add more please contact the author. Eventually, there will be a way to input other ones. However, too much CSS above the fold is also a problem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does the plugin automatically defer CSS or JS?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>No. For CSS you need BWP Minify with the Defer CSS AddOn and for JS W3 Total Cache works great.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I am using Youtube/Vimeo but GTMetrix/Pagespeed/Yslow shows Youtube/Vimeo links?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use the a3 Lazy Load or Speed Booster Pack plugins to lazy load Youtube and Vimeo players.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google Links still show up in GTMetrix/Pagespeed/Yslow?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, if you are using Google Analytics as well as other Google integrations, the scripts are loaded with low cache values which cause issues to show up. I limit google integrations to just Analytics these days to limit the number of JS files loaded from elsewhere.</p>\n",
        "changelog": "<p>2.3.6.1 Updated README.txt</p>\n<p>2.3.6 Fixed protection around Tabby Responsive Tabs so error does not appear when it is not enabled as a plugin.
