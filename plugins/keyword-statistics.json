        "faq": "\n<h4>My language is not supported by the plugin! How can I replace a language I don&#8217;t need with another one?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First you should add the language specific stopwords. You can integrate them in the file stopwords.js. The simpliest way: If you are writing in french you can edit the block defined with <code>'de'</code> which you replace with <code>'fr'</code> &#8211; if you don&#8217;t need the german language. After that you can replace the wordlist with the french ones. At least you have to search the file keyword-statistics.php for all occurencies of the string <code>&lt;option value=\"de\"</code> and replace the <code>de</code> with <code>fr</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t know the language code for the language I want to add! Where can I find it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply have a look at http://xml.coverpages.org/iso639a.html. There you can find a list of all language codes that can be used as your content lanugage.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to add my language to the existing ones! How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply add the string <code>'*LANGUAGE*': [ *...* ],</code> at the second line of the file stopwords.js. Replace <code>*LANGUAGE*</code> with the one you want to integrate (<code>fr</code> if you want to integrate french for example).The <code>*...*</code> is a placeholder for the stopwords you wish to define. You must embed each word in single quotes (e.g. <code>'the'</code>). Single quotes unsed in the stopword have to be escaped with <code>\\'</code>. If you wan to add <code>it's</code> you have to make it this way: <code>'it\\'s'</code>. Between the stopwords you need a <code>,</code> to separate them.</p>\n<p>At least you have to search after all occurencies of <code>&lt;option value=\"de\"</code>. Just copy these lines and insert them the line before. Then change all <code>\"de\"</code>s in the new line to <code>\"fr\"</code>. From now on you can set french as your default language and also choose it in edit post/page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which words should appear in the stopword list?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The stopword list should only contain single words with no double meanings. For example in the dutch language the word &#8216;weer&#8217; means &#8216;weather&#8217; but also &#8216;again&#8217;. Words like that should not appear in the list. There are two reasons why: Firstly these words are helping search engines to classify the page content and these words are surely not classified as stopwords by Google, Yahoo! and Bing. The second reason is that there are some people writing about weather and they need this word to be listed as a keyword and not as a stopword. So please avoid those words if you want to filter stopwords.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Every time the plugin has been updated I need to reintegrate my stopwords. What can I do to prevent this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just send me the stopword list. Before you do this be sure that the stopwords face the conditions described above. I&#8217;ll check the wordlist &#8211; if there is a way of automatic translation &#8211; and add it to the plugin. In future updates the stopwords stay inside the plugin so you don&#8217;t have to do it anymore.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am missing some stopwords in the plugin&#8217;s list. Can you add them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If there are some words that &#8211; for your meaning &#8211; belong to the stopword list just send them to me via. e-mail. I&#8217;ll check and maybe add them to the existing.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get the plugin with my native backend language?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to create your own pot file of the plugin which is containing the localized captions. Translate the captions in the pot file and build your own mo file. The name of this file has to keep the structure condition <code>keyword-statistics-*LANGUAGE*.mo</code>. <em>LANGUAGE</em> is a placeolder for your personal language &#8211; to be exact the shortcode of it. If you are translating the captions to spanish you&#8217;ll use <code>es</code> instead of it.</p>\n<p>More about localization you&#8217;ll find at <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">I18n</a> and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Translating WordPress</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I translate the plugin&#8217;s backend to my language?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you want to translate the captions displayed at the admin interface or the author&#8217;s view for editing posts, you&#8217;ll have to edit the included file named <code>keyword-statistics.pot</code> that comes with the current version of the plugin. There you see the english captions used in the backend.</p>\n<p>It is separated in blocks beginning with comments &#8211; recognizable at a <code>#</code> &#8211; which is followed by two lines. The first line is containing the double quoted english caption initiated by a <code>msgid</code> at the beginning of the line. At the second line &#8211; initiated by <code>msgstr</code> &#8211; you can add your translation between the double quotes.</p>\n<p>After translating all messages you can send me the file and I&#8217;ll integrate the translation. At the end your authors got rid of the language mix at their backend.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

Counted always one before even if the field was empty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Image captions were not filtered before text analysis so if a picture with a caption including the most important keyword were at the beginning of a post/page the source code of the captions block could be written in the generated description.</li>\n<li>Corrected regular expression for filtering special characters out of the content.</li>\n<li>Changed expression for automatic generation of meta description.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated german translation of the plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now you can configure a sitewide used maximum number of keywords / keyphrases and the length this meta tag should have at the most.

While editing a post or page the custom title field now has a status field automatically updated when the field has been changed. Authors can see if they are using too many characters in this field.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolved conflicts with other plugins using the same name for the plugins base directory variable. This could cause an overwriting of the plugins path variable while initialization of the different parts in the wrong order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Update of german captions and the needed pot for additional translations</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If the plugin is not serving the page title, we should not drop an existing page title generated by WordPress or another plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added page title also to be served optional like meta informations. This way the page title already generated by WordPress or a plugin which ran before stay in the document.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Translated backend text for serving canonical urls</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made generation of canonical urls by the plugin optional too. WordPress only generates these on single pages or posts but not for archives, author aggregations, categories and tag lists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Translations for captions of the new options for not serving various meta tags.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Now admin can configure which meta-informations sould be served or not &#8211; meta keywords and description in addition to robots meta and the content language. This will help when the plugin is installed with others who send meta informations and prevents from sending multiple tags of the same type. You can use it with other SEO plugins without confusing search engine crawlers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent plugin from resetting already defined metadata when post or page has been changed in quick edit mode.</li>\n<li>Changed confusing description in options backend</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Captions for option testmode had to be translated</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t delete the page title generated by WordPress or a plugin which generated one before if we are in testmode. This one should still be there for comparing with the one generated by keyword statistics plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a testmode in which the plugin sends his meta description, keywords and other meta tags inside a HTML comment. This way you can check if the served metadata meets your expectations. Moreover you can compare the plugins meta output with the situation before. By commenting out the generated metadata search engines are ignoring these informations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Translated german captions of new option and updated pot file</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option which makes serving of all meta informations optional. This can be used if you want to manage these things with another SEO plugin and you don&#8217;t want to serve the plugin generated meta informations. In this case the plugin can still be used to have a look at keyword densities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed german translation and pot needed to be updated</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made robots-meta optional. If controlling robots will be handled by robots.txt file it may confuse search engine crawlers when they get different informations via robots.txt and the robots meta-tag on a particular page. Now serving of the meta tag can be disabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated pot file and translation for new option min_words</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>We should not generate meta informations (keywords and description) if there isn&#8217;t enough content. New parameter for controlling the minimal number of words per post or page before automatic generation of metadata is setting these informations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Autoupdate status not set correctly in edit-page/post. Now it should work in all cases.</li>\n<li>Fixed problem with concatenation of meta robots.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Under certain curcumstances an error with the concatenation operator could occur while assembling of metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolved problem on blogs running on servers with PHP 4. There the object operator did not work on function results.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added information about the plugins version to the configuration. This can be used for future automatic update of the plugins configuration while keeping the state of the art &#8211; the plugins behave will not change while new options which are allowing a more sophisticated configuration are added.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Status of autoupdate has been lost if authors and distributors were not able to change automatic generated content in fields keywords and description.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated german translation of configuration and pot file for translating the plugins backend</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added possibility to hide fields authors and contributors can not change &#8211; e.g. if admin disallows editing robots meta or manual input of a meta description. These fields may confuse the author when they will be displayed but the user can&#8217;t edit them. Moreover it&#8217;s a waste of space on screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>With some custom settings of permalink structure a false canonical were generated or an unaccurate slash at the end were appended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Completed missing translations and faqs about backend translation and adding stopword lists</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added configuration to prevent sending of language meta informations or attributes in keywords and description.
