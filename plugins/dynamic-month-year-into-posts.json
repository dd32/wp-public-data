        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20need%20this%3F'>\nWhy would I need this?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are an affiliate marketer or blogger who uses months, years and dates in your posts. If you use this plugin to render dynamic month, year, date, next year, and previous year shortcodes, you won’t have to update those posts again and again as time passes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20access%20settings%3F'>\nHow can I access settings?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You cannot. There is no options panel because there is no need to have one. Why bloat the WordPress dashboard with more options?</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20it%20in%20block%20editor%20or%20classic%20editor%3F'>\nCan I use it in Block Editor or Classic Editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like running text, you can use the shortcodes in both Block Editor and Classic Editor. You can also use the shortcodes in widget areas, including the footer (use-case: Autoupdating Copyright Year) and headers (use-case: Today’s Date).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20in%20my%20language%3F'>\nWill this plugin work in my language?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The shortcode outputs are WPML ready and render as per the language set in your WordPress dashboard. Since there is no settings page, you don’t have to translate this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20use%20these%20shortcodes%20in%20my%20theme%2Fphp%20code%3F'>\nHow can I use these shortcodes in my theme/PHP code?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[year]');?&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;?php echo do_shortcode('[month]');?&gt;</code> etc. in themes or in functionality plugins to use these shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20render%20shortcodes%20in%20acf%20fields%3F'>\nHow can I render shortcodes in ACF fields?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin doesn’t render shortcodes in ACF fields by default (due to various reasons, security being the first). But if you really need to render [year] etc., shortcodes, you can enable selective rendering.<br />\nJust add this code in your theme’s functions.php file or in the Code Snippets plugin:</p>\n<p>ACF field type =&gt; text<br />\n        <code>add_filter('acf/format_value/type=text', 'do_shortcode');</code></p>\n<p>ACF field name =&gt; headline<br />\n        <code>add_filter('acf/format_value/name=headline', 'do_shortcode');</code></p>\n</p>\n\n",
