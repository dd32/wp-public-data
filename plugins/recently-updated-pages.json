You can choose whether to display the update date and in what format.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve an option to display the Posts in the list as well. If checked (through admin panel) the list will include the Posts along with the list of Pages.</p>\n<p>You can use WP&#8217;s shortcode to display the last update date of the page or blog posts. Date/time format for the shortcode can be controlled through the widget settings.</p>\n<p>V 1.0.4 only fixes the bug related to the widget area where any widget (in admin panel) below RUP&#8217;s widget will lockup and cannot be moved.</p>\n<p>V 2.0.0 widget code updated to make it combatible with WordPress v. 6.6.2</p>\n",

If you want to display a different title, type it in and save.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20many%20pages%20will%20it%20show%20in%20the%20list%3F'>\nHow many pages will it show in the list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can define it through the widget editor in the WordPress admin panel. Specify the number and save.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20be%20able%20to%20show%20my%20blog%20post%20titles%20in%20the%20list%3F'>\nWill I be able to show my blog POST titles in the list?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, now you can. Check the option to include the blog Posts in the list and it will show them along with the Page list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20way%20to%20hide%20the%20last%20update%20date%3F'>\nIs there a way to hide the last update date?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can do that. Toggle the checkbox to hide or display the date.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20change%20the%20date%20format%3F'>\nCan I change the date format?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is now a text box to specify the date format. There&#8217;s also a small help below the admin form in the Widget section.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20shortcode%3F'>\nHow do I use the shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two ways you can use it. Either by modifying the template files (e.g. single.php or page.php or footer.php) of the currently running theme or you can add the shortcode within the blog post or page through the WP admin post/page editors.</p>\n<p>To use the shortcode within the template file add the following PHP code:</p>\n<p>&lt;&#063;php echo do_shortcode(&#8216;[rup_display_update_date]&#8217;); &#063;&gt;</p>\n<p>To use the shortcode through the post/page editor:</p>\n<p>[rup_display_update_date]</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20control%20the%20date%2Ftime%20format%20for%20the%20shortcode%3F'>\nCan I control the date/time format for the shortcode?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can. Through the widget settings (WP Admin &gt; Appearance &gt; Widgets &gt; Recently Updated Pages) you can now control the date/time format for shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20trying%20to%20display%20the%20update%20date%2Ftime%20like%2020th%20aug%202010%20at%205%3A30pm%2C%20but%20the%20word%20%22at%22%20shows%20up%20like%20%22pm31%22.%20why%3F'>\nI&#8217;m trying to display the update date/time like 20th Aug 2010 at 5:30pm, but the word &#8220;at&#8221; shows up like &#8220;pm31&#8221;. Why?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because PHP&#8217;s date function will recognize the characters &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;t&#8221; as format parameters and parse them. In order to show the word &#8220;at&#8221; you will need to escape both characters like &#8220;\\a\\t&#8221;.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
