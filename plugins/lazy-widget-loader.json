Or you could use the <em>Add new</em> option found in the <em>Plugins</em> menu in WordPress.  </li>\n<li>Enable the plugin from the <em>Plugins</em> menu in WordPress.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You&#8217;re ready to go. To enable lazy loading for any widget, go to your <em>Widgets</em> section under the <em>Appearance</em> menu and check <em>Lazy Loading</em> on every widget that should be loaded after the main page&#8217;s content is ready.</p>\n<p>Please also visit the <a href=\"http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/lazy-widget-loader\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Lazy Widget Loader plugin page</a> for the latest info.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What is &#8216;lazy loading&#8217;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The term <em>lazy loading</em> (also <em>lazy acquisition</em>) refers to a technique that postpones loading (acquisition) of an object (content, resources, &#8230;) until it is really needed.<br />\nIn our case, this means that we still have to get the content that is to be displayed in the widget, but we postpone its acquisition until the latest possible moment,<br />\nso that its possibly negative impact on loading the rest of the page is minimized.</p>\n<p>How does Lazy Widget Loader accomplish its goal? The contents of chosen widgets are loaded in the page&#8217;s footer and once the page has loaded completely, these contents<br />\nare moved to where they should appear. As we postpone loading of these contents until the very last moment, our page will render its contents and will not be affected<br />\nby those contents in slow widgets that take more time to load.</p>\n<p>Note that <em>lazy loading</em> is often understood as to retrieve resources when they come into view, for example if you have an image at the bottom of your page and you want to make sure that this<br />\nimage is not loaded, unless the viewer scrolls down to where that image should appear. But that is not this plugin&#8217;s strategy; if you want to be able to load content on sight, take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/itthinx-lazyloader\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Itthinx LazyLoader</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I choose which widget is loaded lazily?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Go to the <em>Widgets</em> section under the <em>Appearance</em> menu and check <em>Lazy Loading</em> on those widgets that tend to slow down your page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I get a throbber while the widget loads?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes you do if you want to.</p>\n<p>Go to the <em>Widgets</em> section under the <em>Appearance</em> menu and check <em>Throbber</em> on those widgets that should show one.<br />\nOf course, for this to happen, you must also check the <em>Lazy Loading</em> option.<br />\nAlso note that in this case the minimum height of a widget will be set to the height of the throbber or the height given in the appropriate field, whichever is greater.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this improve the page loading time of my site?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It improves the way widgets are loaded, especially those that take a while to load. It does not make your pages load faster.<br />\nSo if you have one widget that appears in, say, the middle of a page and this widget really takes a looong time to load, then your entire page will take &#8230; looong to load because whatever is displayed in that particular widget takes quite a while to show up.<br />\nNow here is why you would want to use this plugin. In the case of said widget, you would activate the <em>Lazy Loading</em> option for it. After that, what you should see is that first your page renders, after that, the content of your slow widget will appear as well.<br />\nThe result of that is: your page renders within a reasonable time and the content of the slow widget(s) is displayed when available, without slowing down the visualization of your entire page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this work with more than one widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can activate lazy loading for any active widget.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Should I enable the &#8216;Lazy Loading&#8217; option for all my widgets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>No!</em></p>\n<p>Widgets handled by Lazy Widget Loader will be shown after everything on the page has been loaded, including images etc.<br />\nSo widgets that load normally should NOT be loaded using Lazy Widget Loader.<br />\nOnly those that really can slow down page rendering should be loaded using Lazy Widget Loader.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Help!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>&#8230; <a href=\"http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/lazy-widget-loader\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this</a> is the right place to ask for help.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I really appreciate this, how can I contribute?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your contribution to the <a href=\"http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/itthinx-lazyloader\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Itthinx LazyLoader</a> will provide you with advanced loading options and support.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
