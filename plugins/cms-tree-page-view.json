Thanks to Julio POTIER (<a href=\"http://secu.boiteaweb.fr/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://secu.boiteaweb.fr/</a>) for finding and reporting.</li>\n<li>Added nonce checks for options page and for adding new pages</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Small design changes for the icons in the post overview screen</li>\n<li>Added actions to check permissions when adding pages with AJAX</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed an ugly pixel in the tree icon</li>\n<li>Minor CSS changes to tree icon</li>\n<li>Updated French translation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide &#8220;inside&#8221; link if post type is draft, since you can&#8217;t create new post inside a page with status draft (limitation/bug with WordPress)</li>\n<li>Added actions so other developers or plugins can control what pages/posts that are editiable and so on. Added filters are: cms_tree_page_view_post_can_edit, cms_tree_page_view_post_user_can_add_inside, cms_tree_page_view_post_user_can_add_after</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed wrong count if WPML where activated and future or private posts existed for a language</li>\n<li>Show info message if no posts found after fetching posts with AJAX</li>\n<li>Updated Swedish translation</li>\n<li>Updated Russian translation &#8211; hopefully it works this time!</li>\n<li>Updated POT file</li>\n<li>Minor language fixes, like actually loading plugin textdomain before using any texts&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added option to show the tree in the regular post overview screen. Makes the tree view fit into the regular workflow and GUI much better. To enable: go to settings &gt; CMS Tree Page View &gt; Tick the option &#8220;On post overview screen&#8221;. Then go to for example the pages overview screen and in the upper right corner there will be an icon to switch between the regular list view and the tree view of this plugin.</li>\n<li>Fixed so search button now looks more like the rest of the WordPress GUI</li>\n<li>Fixed a undefined index warning</li>\n<li>Fixed wrong language count for WPML-enabled post types</li>\n<li>Perhaps fixed a problem with some other plugins, for example Formidable Pro</li>\n<li>Added icon to settings page</li>\n<li>Added updated Russian translation</li>\n<li>Updated POT-file for translators</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added &#8220;Add new&#8221;-link next to headline, to better match the regular post overview page + it makes it possible to add new pages/posts when there are no pages/posts added (previously there needed to be at least one post added to be able to add new posts)</li>\n<li>Added post count in parenthesis after each post status. Also makes the page match the regular post overview page a it more. Works for both built in post types and custom post types + if WPML is installed it will show post count for each language too.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug with sortables (well, I kinda forgot to load that script at all!) that made the plugin only work on the dashboard.</li>\n<li>Fixed some IE-bugs</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New: create multiple pages at once! Add multiple pages faster than ever before! You can even select if the new pages should be drafts or published. And ever drag and drop the pages to get the correct order even before adding them. I know &#8211; it&#8217;s awesome!</li>\n<li>Fixed: adds new pages with the correct and selected WPML-language</li>\n<li>Added: you can now change the type of a post by draging the post between different trees on the dashboard. So if you have one custom post type called &#8220;Cars&#8221; and another called &#8220;Bicycles&#8221; you can now drag a page from the cars tree to the bicicyles tree and the post will converted to that post type. Pretty powerful feature that you used to need a separately plugin to be able to do.</li>\n<li>Misc fixes</li>\n<li>Added new POT-file for translators</li>\n<li>I decided to call this version 1. I&#8217;ve been using this plugin for so long time now and I use it in almost every WordPress project I participate in (all projects with lots of pages), so with this new add-mulitple-page-feature it feels like it&#8217;s time to go to version 1. Hope you&#8217;ll agree! 🙂</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.10.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed popup closing to fast on Firefox.</li>\n<li>Enable menu item setting by default for hierarchical post types during first install. It was confusing when it was enabled for pages but not for other post types. Consistency!</li>\n<li>Added link to settings page to plugin listing.</li>\n<li>Fixed: WPML-stuff now also works on custom post types</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed position of action div. Now it&#8217;s always to the right of the page name.</li>\n<li>Fixed so action div never is below the fold of the browser. Instead it&#8217;s moved up until it&#8217;s visible.</li>\n<li>Fixed problem related to hoverIntent and mouseover and drag and drop. There was just to many wierd things going on so I switched to my own solution instead. Let me know if it works ok for you too now again!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Only output scripts and styles on pages that the plugin uses. This should speed up other parts of the WordPress admin a little tiny itsy bitsy bit.</li>\n<li>Added a hopefully not to spammy box about donation and stuff. Hopefully it it encourages some of you to give it a good review or maybe even donate some money. I&#8217;ve spent a lot, lot, LOT of time developing this plugin you know 😉</li>\n<li>Changed title on dashboard widgets and changed name of the menu item under each supported post type. Makes the titles/names look/feel a bit less dorky.</li>\n<li>Show icons next to the headline of top of pages with the tree</li>\n<li>Minor CSS changes like a little bit bigger text on the pages and a bit more spacing between each page. Makes a bit easier to drag and drop/move them around.</li>\n<li>Changed javascript to to use on() istead on live()</li>\n<li>Removed hoverIntent since that is included in WordPress by default</li>\n<li>Started using hoverIndent to make the popup with page actions show after a short while for each page. This also means that you can move outside the actions-pop-up for a short while without the pop up being closed &#8211; a thing that annoyed me very much. This makes the whole popup actions div thingie feels less in-your-face all the time. Hope you like it as much as I do!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8.14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Estonian translation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8.13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Lithuanian language</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8.12</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for forever loading tree</li>\n<li>No plus-sign on nodes that has no children</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8.11</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the way to find the plugin url.

Thank you!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Celebrating more than 100.000 downloads and as a gift to you, the user of this plugin, I have removed the &#8220;Support the author&#8221;-text from the right column. No more nagging! Donations are still welcome though&#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Polish translation added.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: You can now show the tree for regular posts. Appearently there are som plugins that use the hierarchy on posts.</li>\n<li>Fixed: The capability required to show the tree for a post type should now be correct. Previously it was hard-coded to &#8220;edit_pages&#8221;.
