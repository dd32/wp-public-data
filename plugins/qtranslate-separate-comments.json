To do this, go to the Comments section in WordPress Dashboard and set the appropriate language for all of your comments(you can use the &#8220;Bulk Set Language&#8221; button after selecting some comments and the right language for them).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin doesn&#8217;t redirect to the proper language and the language is set incorrectly</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order to properly identify where the comment is coming from, this plugin adds a hidden input to the Comments form. This is done by hooking a function to the <code>comment_form</code> action hook, which is called from the <code>comment_form()</code> WordPress function. If you are using a custom comments form instead of calling this function, make sure to add <code>&lt;?php do_action( 'comment_form', $post-&gt;ID ); ?&gt;</code> . If this still doesn&#8217;t work, replace that code with the following: <code>&lt;?php global $post; do_action( 'comment_form', $post-&gt;ID ); ?&gt;</code>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.2.3</h4>\n<p>Tested with WordPress 4.8 &#8211; still works! Also added support for qTranslate-X, as it seems to be an active fork of qTranslate.</p>\n<h4>1.2.2</h4>\n<p>Tested with WordPress 3.9 and everything works fine. Note that the current version of qTranslate(2.5.39) however breaks my test site with a fatal error.</p>\n<h4>1.2.1</h4>\n<p>Changed the tested up to version to 3.5.1. Changed stable tag from trunk to tag number.</p>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<p>Changed the passing of the comment language to a much, much more simple way, that should be more proof to errors.</p>\n<h4>1.1.1</h4>\n<p>Fixed a bug related to proper setting of the language/redirecting back. The code was tested both from a root-level install and a sub-directory install.</p>\n<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed the <code>fix_comments_count()</code> function(a typo was returning the wrong comments count) &#8211; thanks @hyOzd</li>\n<li>Added support for qTranslate&#8217;s &#8220;Query Mode&#8221;</li>\n<li>Fixed a couple of little bugs</li>\n<li>Updated the FAQ section</li>\n<li>Added a .pot file</li>\n<li>Added Bulgarian translation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n<li>Automatic language setting for new comments.</li>\n<li>Manual setting of a comment&#8217;s language through the admin.</li>\n<li>Bulk setting of comment&#8217;s language from the Edit Comments dashboard section(using AJAX).</li>\n<li>Fixed qTranslate issue of not returning the commenter to the correct language.</li>\n</ul>\n"
