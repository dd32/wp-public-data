This setting is important as the redirect script will evaluate the cookie name in order to bypass the redirect.  If the actual cookie name and the cookie name under the settings menu does not match, the bypass will fail.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The script will only bypass the redirect for a short period of time?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The bypass of the redirect is conditional on the cookie that is set on your mobile site.  If you have used the default code to set the cookie, the cookie will expire in 3600 seconds or one hour.  If you would like to change this time simply modify the cookie settings on your mobile site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
