After that only the buddypress recognises the user as a member.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Its taking a lot of time to import users?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the number of users are less then it will not take much time. But if the number of users in the CSV are more like more than 500+ or 1000+ then it will take time to process the CSV. So its better to break the CSV file into small CSV files to import more number of users at a time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I report a bug?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Report bugs, suggest ideas, and participate in development at <a href=\"https://vibethemes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">VibeThemes</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
