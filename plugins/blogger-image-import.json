Resolved by replacing spaces in the URL with %20.</li>\n<li>Added support for multiple image formats (png, gif, tif) though the link extension must match the  tag extension.</li>\n<li>Added support for multiple domains (blogger.com and blogspot.com by default) since Blogger has used at least two in the past.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for images with spaces in their names</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial version</li>\n</ul>\n"
