And, by 2030, gift cards sold online will reach the $1.1 trillion threshold.</p>\n<p>Gift cards are a powerful marketing tool to increase sales (especially during the holidays) and build customer loyalty over time.</p>\n<p>Think about it: it could be a Christmas gift for a friend, a birthday gift for a family member, or Christmas bonuses for your employees… a gift card is always the best choice!</p>\n<p>By offering your customers the opportunity to purchase a gift card that can be redeemed in your store, you can gain new customers (those who receive the gift card will know about your products and place an order, which means you will be able to push them to buy again and build their loyalty over time) and significantly increase your revenue.</p>\n<p>YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards is an easy and free solution to start selling gift cards in your e-commerce store.</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>You only have to install the plugin, create your first gift card and publish it: a few-minutes process that will let you start offering gift cards immediately to your customers.</p>\n<p>The user&#8217;s interface is very easy and inspired by Amazon&#8217;s one: your customers can choose one of the amounts you set, select an image to customize the gift card (our plugin is the only one that lets you upload an unlimited image gallery!), insert the receiver&#8217;s details, add a message and, finally, purchase the gift card like any other product on your ecommerce store.</p>\n<h4>Main features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Create unlimited virtual gift cards.
