It was born from a small script <a href=\"https://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/04/05/breadcrumb-trail-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">first released in 2009</a> and has grown into a system that can handle nearly any site&#8217;s setup to show the most accurate breadcrumbs for each page.</p>\n<h3>Blocks and Classic Support</h3>\n<p>The plugin works with both block and classic themes, so you can use it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>For <strong>block themes</strong>, you can insert it into any template or template part via the WordPress Site Editor. Ideally, this would be something like the Header part, which is generally shown on every page of the site.</p>\n<p>For <strong>classic themes</strong>, you must manually add the PHP code to your theme to call the breadcrumb trail like so:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if ( class_exists( '\\X3P0\\Breadcrumbs\\Trail' ) ) {\n    \\X3P0\\Breadcrumbs\\Trail::display();\n} ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<p>This plugin automatically detects your permalink setup and displays breadcrumbs based on that structure. Nearly all sites have some sort of hierarchy. The plugin recognizes that and builds a set of unique breadcrumbs for each page on your site.</p>\n<p>This means that it can also detect custom post types and taxonomies right out of the box. Whatever you throw at it, it&#8217;s got a solution.</p>\n",

We&#8217;ll chat about it. The PHP for the block is much more robust than what&#8217;s currently controllable via the block editor, so it&#8217;s likely the feature already exists&#8212;it just needs the editor UI component built out.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
