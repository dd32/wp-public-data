        "description": "<p>Snap Finance is a lease-to-own financing provider that empowers credit-challenged shoppers with the buying power to get what they need now, and then allows them to make affordable payments to pay over time. Snap was founded on the principle that financing should be accessible to everyone. It&#8217;s easy to apply, and Snap&#8217;s sophisticated algorithms don’t rely on FICO scores when considering an approval. Shoppers know in seconds if they&#8217;ve been approved.  </p>\n<p>Snap also believes in complete transparency, so a shopper knows the cost of their lease up front, with no surprises or hidden costs. With Snap, shoppers have flexible payment options, from the standard full-term lease of 12 months to the 100-Day Payment option, which provides a considerable reduction in overall cost.  </p>\n<p>Snap Finance wants their Merchant Partners to thrive while supporting their customers.  In 2019, Snap drove $890M in merchant sales, with over 870K lease applications completed. Some merchants have seen up to an 80% approval rate.</p>\n<p>Attract more customers and drive more sales for your business by offering a financing option to credit-challenged shoppers that would otherwise walk away empty-handed.   </p>\n<p>The Snap Finance Checkout extension will be seamlessly embedded into your checkout flow as a payment option, where Snap handles the application approval, payment processing, and servicing of the lease.  </p>\n<h4>Account &amp; Pricing</h4>\n<p>To offer Snap Finance Checkout on your website, you will have to first fill out our <a href=\"https://learn.snapfinance.com/snap-finance-ecommerce-inquiry?utm_source=woocommerce&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;utm_campaign=ecomm-platform\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">inquiry form</a>. You will go through a vetting process to get approved as a Snap Finance partner and have a merchant account created. The Snap Finance Checkout is free to download and install, but transaction fees on customer orders may apply and will vary from merchant to merchant based on merchant type and level of partnership.   </p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Snap Finance continues to drive merchant business.
