A widget is also provided to display user information or links such as &#8216;Login&#8217; or &#8216;Register&#8217;.  It also provides an option for hiding the wp-login.php page to help avoid brute force attacks of that page.</p>\n<p>Note that this control is primarily designed for site admins who will be running a site to disperse information, and not one where a community of users interact with the site.</p>\n<p>MGMC also provides a means to share or validate users between sites with a validation key.  The user must exist in both sites and be identifyable by email address.  When a visitor logs into SiteA, that site can provide a link to SiteB with a special key so that when the user clicks it they will jump to SiteB and be logged in automatically.
