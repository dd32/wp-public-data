If your theme somehow bypasses our filters and displays them, please reach out to us so we can try to offer compatibility with your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20post%20sensitive%20information%20in%20internal%20comments%3F'>\nCan I post sensitive information in internal comments?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Internal comments are meant strictly for internal use but you should still <em>avoid</em> storing sensitive information. The data is not encrypted in the database and we can&#8217;t promise that it won&#8217;t leak. Think of these comments more as a digital version of post-its.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20compatible%20with%20woocommerce%3F'>\nIs this compatible with WooCommerce?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! You can use internal comments on WooCommerce orders, products, and even coupons.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20compatible%20with%20%5Binsert%20plugin%20name%5D%3F'>\nIs this compatible with [insert plugin name]?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Likely yes. Internal Comments works with all registered post types that use the WordPress UI. If you don&#8217;t find your post type in the plugin&#8217;s settings, please raise a support question.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20help%20if%20i%27m%20stuck%3F'>\nHow can I get help if I&#8217;m stuck?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using the free version, you can find more examples in <a href=\"https://docs.deep-web-solutions.com/article-categories/internal-comments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our knowledge base</a> and you can open a community support ticket here at <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/internal-comments/\" rel=\"ugc\">wordpress.org</a>. Our staff regularly goes through the community forum to try and help.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve purchased the premium version of the plugin <a href=\"https://www.deep-web-solutions.com/plugins/internal-comments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on our website</a>, you are entitled to a year of premium updates and access to <a href=\"https://www.deep-web-solutions.com/support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our prioritized support forum</a>.
