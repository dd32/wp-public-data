Instead, the seller purchases inventory as needed from a third party—usually a wholesaler or manufacturer—to fulfill orders. In short, the order will be shipped directly to the end customer after you make the sale. All the products we provide at Hertwill are available via dropshipping.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
