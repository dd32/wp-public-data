        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20my%20server%20be%20strong%20enough%20to%20process%20large%20pdfs%3F'>\nWill my server be strong enough to process large PDFs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The advantage of the MnumiDesigner solution is that it isn’t a burden on the WordPress server. Our plug-in magically combines the WooCommerce website with the Online Editor, which is fully installed in our Data Center. PDFs are also created on specially configured servers, so you can take hundreds of orders a day without the fear that your server won’t handle it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20when%20my%20server%20space%20is%20finished%3F'>\nWhat happens when my server space is finished?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Remember that you can buy additional disk space at any time.<br />\nTo make sure that you continue getting orders, we will start to free up the disk space you have bought, starting with your customers’ oldest orders. So if your free space is up, your client won’t be able to reorder their previous item. Don’t forget to buy additional disk space.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20restrictions%20on%20the%20number%20of%20templates%3F'>\nAre there any restrictions on the number of templates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can create any number of Templates for your clients and connect them to any number of Product in WooCommerce. The capacity of the disk space occupied by the Templates and Projects of your customers is the only limitation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20additional%20tools%20to%20get%20started%3F'>\nDo I need additional tools to get started?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need a website prepared in WordPress and the WooCommerce system. You don’t need any additional tools to use online projects and generate ready-to-print PDFs. What may be useful is a system for imposing prints on a printing press, but machine manufacturers usually take care of it.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
