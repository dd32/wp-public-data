        "description": "<p>Sendmachine&#8217;s official plugin will enable you to:</p>\n<p><strong>Set up signup forms</strong><br />\nYou can set up a signup form in a few easy steps: connect using the provided API <a href=\"https://www.sendmachine.com/admin/#/myaccount/smtp_settings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">credentials</a>, select a contact list where your visitors will subscribe and you&#8217;re basically good to go. The signup form is available as a widget (in your widget area) or as a shortlink by pasting <code>[sm_subscribe_form]</code> in a post or page.</p>\n<p><strong>Add subscribe checkboxes</strong><br />\nAllow users to subscribe to your contact list only by checking a checkbox in certain website areas like comment form or register form.</p>\n<p><strong>Sync your wordpress users with a specific contact list</strong><br />\nYou want to send emails to all your users but don&#8217;t know how? Well, don&#8217;t worry, we can help you with that. After you&#8217;ve successfully selected a contact list, you can use the &#8220;<em>Sync users</em>&#8221; button, to subscribe all your users to that contact list.</p>\n<p><strong>Send emails through our services</strong><br />\nNo need for nasty, geeky configurations. Just set a from email, an optional from name and you are good to go. Also, make sure that &#8220;<em>enable email sending</em>&#8221; is set to <code>on</code>.<br />\nIf you set a <em>from email</em> that doesn&#8217;t already exist in your sendmachine account as a <em>sender address</em>, a confirmation email will be generated and sent to that address.<br />\nNot quite sure if you&#8217;ve done everything right? You can test if everything is ok by sending a test email. If you got the mail, you can sit back and relax: you&#8217;ve done it, otherwise something went wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Send transactional emails</strong><br />\nNo more &#8220;<em>dog ate my email</em>&#8221; excuses. Using our services you can now monitor an email&#8217;s activity (opens, clicks, geolocations, user agents). In order to enable this option, after you install our plugin, go to &#8220;<em>email settings</em>&#8221; tab and check that &#8220;<em>Register</em>&#8221; and/or &#8220;<em>Comment</em>&#8221; checkboxes. Basically, if you tick that checkboxes on each email sent, that coresponds with that action, we add a custom tracking header: <code>X-Sendmachine-Campaign: campaign_name</code>, where <em>campaign_name</em> is the name of the transactional campaign that will be created, or updated if already exists. Campaign&#8217;s name can be found/modified next to every action&#8217;s checkbox.</p>\n<p><strong>Send news feed</strong><br />\nYou can send a newsletter directly from the admin panel with the latest posts. You can choose to build your newsletter with the latest 5, 10, 15 or 20 posts, set newsletter&#8217;s width, color and content.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>In your WordPress admin panel, go to <em>Plugins &gt; New Plugin</em>, search for <strong>Sendmachine</strong> and click <em>Install now</em></li>\n<li>Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of <code>sendmachine-for-wordpress.zip</code> to your plugins directory, which usually is <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code></li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Set <a href=\"https://www.sendmachine.com/admin/#/myaccount/smtp_settings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">your Sendmachine API username and password</a> in the plugin&#8217;s general settings tab.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NOTE!

        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20sendmachine%3F'>\nWhat is Sendmachine?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sendmachine is an email marketing service provider that offers all the tools you need to send your beautiful newsletters to destination.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20sendmachine%20account%3F'>\nDo I need a Sendmachine Account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you do, but you can easily <a href=\"https://www.sendmachine.com/admin/#/register\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">create</a> one for free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20get%20started%20with%20this%20plugin%3F'>\nHow to get started with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Grab your API credentials from our <a href=\"https://www.sendmachine.com/admin/#/myaccount/smtp_settings\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">site</a> and head out to the plugin&#8217;s  &#8220;<em>general</em>&#8221;  tab to fill in the appropriate fields.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20track%20emails%20mean%3F'>\nWhat does track emails mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Track emails means that a transactional campaign will be created when a checked action occurs and an email is sent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%27t%20see%20the%20subscription%20widget'>\nCan&#8217;t see the subscription widget\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sendmachine subscription widget will be visible only after you&#8217;ve successfully connected to the API (using the API credentials) and have selected a contact list.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='signup%20form%20not%20hiding%20after%20successful%20signup'>\nSignup form not hiding after successful signup\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>Hide form after a successful sign-up</em> option works only if the visitor that subscribed has an account and is logged in to your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20%22refresh%20cached%20contact%20lists%22%20mean%3F'>\nWhat does &#8220;Refresh cached contact lists&#8221; mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>Refresh cached contact lists</em> refers to the fact that, for optimisation purposes, the plugin does not perform a request to sendmachine each time you visit that page, it caches your list data. For this reason, if you create a new contact list, you need to acknowledge the plugin that you made some changes to your lists.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='a%20form%20field%20is%20checked%20and%20i%20can%27t%20uncheck%20it'>\nA form field is checked and I can&#8217;t uncheck it\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If a contact list&#8217;s form field is checked and the checkbox is grayed out (you can&#8217;t uncheck it), it means that is required.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20subscribe%20checkboxes%3F'>\nWhat are subscribe checkboxes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Subscribe checkboxes are used to subscribe people to your contact list when they perform certain actions like register or comment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20can%27t%20sync%20users%20or%20add%20signup%20checkbox%20to%20register%20and%20comment%20form'>\nI can&#8217;t sync users or add signup checkbox to register and comment form\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you encounter this problem, most likely you selected a contact list that has more required fields than these options can operate with. Basically when performing this operations, just the email address is sent for subscription and if a list has more required fields, like <em>name</em> or <em>age</em>, subscription will not be successful because we did not sent a value for the extra required fields.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20confirmed%20my%20from%20address%2C%20but%20the%20interface%20still%20notices%20me%20that%20i%20have%20to%20confirm%20my%20address'>\nI confirmed my from address, but the interface still notices me that I have to confirm my address\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you added a from address that does not exist in your <em>sender list</em>, a confirmation email will be sent to you. After you confirm your email address, you need to go back to the plugin&#8217;s &#8220;<em>Email settings</em>&#8221; tab and hit that <em>I already confirmed my address</em> button to acknowledge the plugin that you confirmed your address, this is not done automatically.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20those%20keywords%3F'>\nWhat are those keywords?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>With that keywords you can build your newsletter without the need of an actual content. This way you can customize your newsletter how you want.<br />\nThose keywords will be replaced with the actual content when you preview the newsletter, or send it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='in%20which%20languages%20is%20this%20plugin%20available%3F'>\nIn which languages is this plugin available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is currently available in English and Romanian.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
