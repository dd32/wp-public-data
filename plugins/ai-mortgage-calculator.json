In addition, we calculate the difference between the payoff period from the current mortgage to the new mortgage.</p>\n<p>The extra monthly payment shows you how to beat the bank. That is by making an additional small principal payment each month.</p>\n<p>For example, if you started with a $300,000 mortgage at 4.5% on a 30-year term in August of 2020 and did a cash-out refinance for an additional $50,000 and increased the loan amount to $350,000 at 4.5% over 30 years in May of 2022 and made an additional $300 monthly payment you would have a lifetime savings of $18,617 of interest even though you took a larger loan amount.</p>\n<p>New features will be added soon including a home purchase calculator and reverse mortgage calculator <a href=\"https://aimortgagecalculator.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://aimortgagecalculator.com</a></p>\n",
