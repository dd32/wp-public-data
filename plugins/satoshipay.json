        "description": "<p>SatoshiPay is a cross-website, 1-click micropayment service based on blockchain technology. To use SatoshiPay your readers don’t need to sign up anywhere or download any additional software. If they come to your site with a pre-filled wallet, they will be able to pay for your content with just a single click. Your payout arrives in your own wallet within seconds. Generate extra income from your posts, pictures, audio, video or downloads! Micropayments have never been this easy.</p>\n<p>As a publisher you only need to install the plugin, register at <a href=\"https://dashboard.satoshipay.io/sign-up\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SatoshiPay Dashboard</a>, create a blockchain wallet for your earnings, and you are ready to go.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ul>\n<li>Upload plugin files to your plugins folder, or install using WordPress&#8217; built-in &#8220;Add New Plugin&#8221; installer</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin</li>\n<li>Select SatoshiPay from the left-hand admin menu and enter your SatoshiPay API credentials (find them in the API section of the <a href=\"https://dashboard.satoshipay.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SatoshiPay Dashboard</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For a full installation guide please go to our <a href=\"https://satoshipay.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006852211-How-to-install-and-use-the-WordPress-Plugin-\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center</a>.</strong></p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I add paid content?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are two options for paid content:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Paid posts: Simply edit the post or page you want to charge for, activate the &#8220;Paid Post&#8221; checkbox in the SatoshiPay metabox on the right, set a price (for example 2 lumens), and press Publish/Update. Your post will now show the SatoshiPay payment interface to your reader and will only be accessible after the reader pays for it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paid media inside a post: Edit a post and select &#8220;Add Paid Audio&#8221; from the SatoshiPay menu in the top toolbar of the visual editor. The media library will open and let you pick an existing audio file or upload one. Select an audio file and press &#8220;Insert&#8221;. The next dialog will let you set a price (for example 4 lumens). Press &#8220;OK&#8221; to insert the paid audio. The editor will display a placeholder where the audio will appear on your post. Click the placeholder to edit options or remove the paid audio from the post. The procedure is very similar for paid downloads, images and videos. Try it out!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I show a free teaser of my paid post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the Start Tag. When editing a post in the visual editor, place your cursor at the position your free teaser text ends and the paid text should begin. Now open the SatoshiPay menu in the top toolbar and select &#8220;Insert Start Tag&#8221;. A horizontal dotted line with the text &#8220;SatoshiPay Start&#8221; will be inserted. Move this line around to change the starting point of the paid text.</p>\n<p>Note: If no Start Tag is inserted, the whole post will become paid content. Also, make sure to have the &#8220;Paid Post&#8221; checkbox enabled to activate SatoshiPay for a post.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Start Tag you can use an excerpt. When editing a post you can enter your teaser in the Excerpt box underneath the post edit box. The excerpt text will always be shown for free when viewing the post. Your theme needs to support excerpts.<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t see the Excerpt box when editing, activate Screen Options &gt; Boxes &gt; Excerpt.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will SatoshiPay work well with my other plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. We ensured that our plugin is compatible with the most popular WordPress plugins. However, there are a few known issues:</p>\n<p><strong>Duplicate Post plugin</strong></p>\n<p>Issue: When using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/\" rel=\"ugc\">Duplicate Post plugin</a>, the duplicate of a SatoshiPay enabled post will not show up when displayed on the same page as the original.</p>\n<p>Solution: Unfortunately there is currently no workaround for this, so you can&#8217;t duplicate SatoshiPay enabled posts.</p>\n<p><strong>W3 Total Cache plugin</strong></p>\n<p>Issue: When using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/\" rel=\"ugc\">W3 Total Cache plugin</a>, SatoshiPay&#8217;s ad blocker detection feature will not work.</p>\n<p>Solution: Disable Page Cache (W3 Total Cache settings &gt; General Settings &gt; Disable Page cache). You can enable all other caching features.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I find more documentation on SatoshiPay?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For more information, visit the SatoshiPay help center: <a href=\"https://satoshipay.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sp.gg/help</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
