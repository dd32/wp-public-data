It uses ajax to fetch latest contents from your blog, and then visualize all paragraphs, images and videos from your posts just like they were on television, or draws them on the page according to a floating spiral layout, continuously animated and updated. Main goal of Rognone is to let you sit on your coach and watch your blog contents on your tv (if your tv is internet connected, of course). See changelog for newest features. It&#8217;s an ongoing project, we need feedback from desktop and smartphone users: please write us in Support section.
