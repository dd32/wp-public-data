Any members that makes the new link, will automatically be joined to the appropriate BuddyPress group.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why would I install this?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using BuddyPress, groups may be the soul of what you are doing.  This plugin will be sure members get into groups that they should be joining.  A good example is a site based on a college.  If you wanted all the English majors to be members of the <code>English</code> group, you would create a profile field where the member selects his major.  Any member who selects <code>English</code> for the profile field, will be automatically made a member of the <code>English</code> group.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
