        "faq": "\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20create%20a%20sheerid%20account%3F'>\nHow can I create a SheerID account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Navigate to the <a href=\"https://my.sheerid.com/auth/registration\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">SheerID registration</a> page and fill out the required information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20verifications%20globally%3F'>\nDo you offer verifications globally?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Our platform verifies customers in 193 countries and 37 languages around the world. Please note, for each program, you can include up to 3 countries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20set%20up%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I set up the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, navigate to the WooCommerce menu tab and click the SheerID link. On the API Settings page<br />\nclick the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button. You will be prompted to enter your SheerID username and password. Submit your info and you will<br />\nbe connected to your account.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='after%20i%20connect%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nAfter I connect what should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you connect the plugin to your SheerID account you can start to create some programs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20program%3F'>\nWhat is a program?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A program is what your customers verify their identity against. For example, you can create a program for customers that are in the military. Once they verify their identity, you can expose<br />\nthings like special coupons or products that are only meant for that group.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20fast%20does%20verification%20occur%3F'>\nHow fast does verification occur?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Almost instantly. For customers who successfully verify, it takes a few seconds for it to occur. For situations where data isn’t correct, document review occurs with our support team in order to verify information.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20does%20it%20cost%20to%20use%20sheerid%3F'>\nHow much does it cost to use SheerID?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>SheerID offers a variety of packages for our leading verification. For WooCommerce stores, we offer a pay as you go option for $250 for your first 200 verifications, and $1.25 after for each one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20a%20free%20trial%3F'>\nDo you offer a free trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! We offer a special extended trial for all WooCommerce stores of 28 days.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20included%20in%20the%20free%20trial%3F'>\nWhat is included in the free trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We allow stores to use live verifications in our trial and don’t limit any features. Please note though that we do extend the right to throttle verification usage above 75 verifications if you pass that amount during your trial.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
