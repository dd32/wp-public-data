        "description": "<p>Introducing WP Fast Total Search (WPFTS), the ultimate WordPress full-text search plugin that will revolutionize how you search for content on your website! WPFTS extends the standard search capabilities of WordPress by creating a transparent word-based index. This allows you to search not only by the title and content of posts, but also by meta-fields, custom types of posts, shortcode content, and even by the contents of attached files.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, WPFTS doesn&#8217;t require the installation of external indexing software, making it ideal for shared hostings. Plus, all other plugins will automatically use the word-based index after installing WPFTS. You can easily specify the relevance function by assigning weights for the title, content, and each of the meta-fields in your posts.</p>\n<p>Unlike other search plug-ins, WPFTS doesn&#8217;t replace the standard WP search, instead, it expands its functionality. All built-in functions of WP_Query are saved, and other plug-ins automatically use advanced search with WPFTS. With its built-in Live Search functionality, you can quickly find what you&#8217;re looking for without ever leaving the search bar. Simply switch it on with WPFTSâ€™s native flexible Search Widget, which you can install anywhere on your page/post with a special shortcode ([wpfts_widget]).</p>\n<p>The extended (Pro) version of the plugin allows you to automatically index the text content of attached files such as PDFs, giving you quick access to information contained within them.</p>\n<p>With WPFTS, you can enjoy true indexed text search within title, content, shortcodes, meta field values, or programmatically-created text data. It dramatically extends the native WordPress search, supporting phrase search and offering powerful index clustering system. Plus, you can order results by relevance, date, post ID, title, slug, type, random, comment_count, and more.</p>\n<p>WPFTS is not just free, it doesn&#8217;t require 3rd-party libraries or services. Everything happens right inside your website! It also supports language translations (English, German, Dutch, Russian and Ukrainian are ready now), removes HTML tags and comments from post content before indexing it (useful for Gutenberg-driven sites and themes), and does the text search inside shortcode content.</p>\n<p>With its TRUE relevance algorithm using improved TF-IDF, WPFTS offers a relevance formula that can be justified via settings. You can make default search WP ordering configurable, and it has API and full documentation to customize pluginâ€™s behavior.</p>\n<p>WPFTS works well with PHP 5.6+ up to PHP 8.2+ and supports add-ons, including a big library of them. You can even write your own extensions!</p>\n<p>In short, WPFTS is the ultimate WordPress search plugin that you simply must have. Try it today and discover how easy it is to find the information you need on your site!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fulltextsearch.org/evaluation/\" title=\"WP Fast Total Search Pro Evaluation License\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TEST DRIVE</a> | <a href=\"https://fulltextsearch.org/buy/\" title=\"Download WP Fast Total Search Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>GET PRO</strong></a> ðŸ’Ž</p>\n<p>Please note, that the <a href=\"https://fulltextsearch.org/buy/\" title=\"WP Fast Total Search Pro plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PRO</a> version of this plugin also supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File attachments search by their content (PDF, DOC, DOCX and other files currently supported)</li>\n<li>Filter file search by mime-type</li>\n<li>Display PDF content in search results using Smart Excerpts</li>\n<li>External service to extract text information from files can be used (license included)</li>\n<li>Technical support (with installing, configuring, fixing conflicts)</li>\n<li>Regular automatic updates (it works the same way as WP repository updates)</li>\n<li>A bunch of add-ons which makes it possible to index and search the content and files generated by other plugins and themes (for example: file search add-on for WordPress Download Manager plugin, add-on for Filebase Pro, add-on for Delicious Downloads, and many more).

    "description": "<p>Introducing WP Fast Total Search (WPFTS), the ultimate WordPress full-text search plugin that will revolutionize how you search for content on your website! WPFTS extends the standard search capabilities of WordPress by creating a transparent word-based index. This allows you to search not only by the title and content of posts, but also by meta-fields, custom types of posts, shortcode content, and even by the contents of attached files.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, WPFTS doesn&#8217;t require the installation of external indexing software, making it ideal for shared hostings. Plus, all other plugins will automatically use the word-based index after installing WPFTS. You can easily specify the relevance function by assigning weights for the title, content, and each of the meta-fields in your posts.</p>\n<p>Unlike other search plug-ins, WPFTS doesn&#8217;t replace the standard WP search, instead, it expands its functionality. All built-in functions of WP_Query are saved, and other plug-ins automatically use advanced search with WPFTS. With its built-in Live Search functionality, you can quickly find what you&#8217;re looking for without ever leaving the search bar. Simply switch it on with WPFTSâ€™s native flexible Search Widget, which you can install anywhere on your page/post with a special shortcode ([wpfts_widget]).</p>\n<p>The extended (Pro) version of the plugin allows you to automatically index the text content of attached files such as PDFs, giving you quick access to information contained within them.</p>\n<p>With WPFTS, you can enjoy true indexed text search within title, content, shortcodes, meta field values, or programmatically-created text data. It dramatically extends the native WordPress search, supporting phrase search and offering powerful index clustering system. Plus, you can order results by relevance, date, post ID, title, slug, type, random, comment_count, and more.</p>\n<p>WPFTS is not just free, it doesn&#8217;t require 3rd-party libraries or services. Everything happens right inside your website! It also supports language translations (English, German, Dutch, Russian and Ukrainian are ready now), removes HTML tags and comments from post content before indexing it (useful for Gutenberg-driven sites and themes), and does the text search inside shortcode content.</p>\n<p>With its TRUE relevance algorithm using improved TF-IDF, WPFTS offers a relevance formula that can be justified via settings. You can make default search WP ordering configurable, and it has API and full documentation to customize pluginâ€™s behavior.</p>\n<p>WPFTS works well with PHP 5.6+ up to PHP 8.2+ and supports add-ons, including a big library of them. You can even write your own extensions!</p>\n<p>In short, WPFTS is the ultimate WordPress search plugin that you simply must have. Try it today and discover how easy it is to find the information you need on your site!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fulltextsearch.org/evaluation/\" title=\"WP Fast Total Search Pro Evaluation License\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TEST DRIVE</a> | <a href=\"https://fulltextsearch.org/buy/\" title=\"Download WP Fast Total Search Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>GET PRO</strong></a> ðŸ’Ž</p>\n<p>Please note, that the <a href=\"https://fulltextsearch.org/buy/\" title=\"WP Fast Total Search Pro plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PRO</a> version of this plugin also supports:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File attachments search by their content (PDF, DOC, DOCX and other files currently supported)</li>\n<li>Filter file search by mime-type</li>\n<li>Display PDF content in search results using Smart Excerpts</li>\n<li>External service to extract text information from files can be used (license included)</li>\n<li>Technical support (with installing, configuring, fixing conflicts)</li>\n<li>Regular automatic updates (it works the same way as WP repository updates)</li>\n<li>A bunch of add-ons which makes it possible to index and search the content and files generated by other plugins and themes (for example: file search add-on for WordPress Download Manager plugin, add-on for Filebase Pro, add-on for Delicious Downloads, and many more).
