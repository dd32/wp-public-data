        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20a%20shipment%20tracker%3F'>\nWhat is a Shipment Tracker?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A shipment tracks one tracking number from the time it&#8217;s shipped until it has been delivered, no matter how many status events were created during its life cycle.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20trackship%20affect%20my%20site%E2%80%99s%20performance%3F'>\nWill TrackShip affect my site’s performance?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at all. When you fulfill an order, the shipping information is sent to TrackShip and it does all the heavy-lifting for you, we check the status of the shipment with the shipping provider every few hours and we update your store whenever there is an update in the status, and it does not impact your load time in any way.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20a%20developer%20to%20connect%20trackship%20to%20my%20store%3F'>\nDo I need a developer to connect TrackShip to my store?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely not! You can easily connect your store with TrackShip in a few simple steps and start enjoying a branded tracking experience in less than 10 minutes..</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20connected%20my%20store%20but%20the%20shipment%20status%20is%20not%20showing%20for%20my%20orders'>\nI connected my store but the shipment status is not showing for my orders\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The trigger to auto-track shipments by TrackShip is to add tracking to the order and change the order status from Processing to Shipped (Completed). TrackShip will not automatically track orders that were Shipped before you connected your store.<br />\nYou can trigger these orders to TrackShip by using the <a href=\"https://docs.trackship.com/docs/trackship-for-woocommerce/manage-orders/#get-shipment-status\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Shipment Status</a> option on the WooCommerce orders admin in the bulk actions menu.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20store%20is%20connected%20but%20many%20of%20my%20orders%20still%20show%20a%20%E2%80%9Cconnection%20error%E2%80%9D%20shipment%20status'>\nMy store is connected but many of my orders still show a “Connection error” shipment status\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>These messages are from before you connected your store, TrackShip auto-track shipments when you change the order status from Processing to Shipped (Completed).<br />\nTrackShip will not automatically track orders that were shipped when you had a connection issue.<br />\nYou can trigger these orders to TrackShip by using the <a href=\"https://docs.trackship.com/docs/trackship-for-woocommerce/manage-orders/#get-shipment-status\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Shipment Status</a> option on the WooCommerce orders admin in the bulk actions menu.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20do%20you%20check%20for%20tracking%20status%20updates%3F'>\nHow often do you check for tracking status updates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>TrackShip checks the shipment status with the shipping providers APIs every 2-4 hours. We check for updates more often once the package is in the &#8220;unknown&#8221; status, until the first tracking event is received from the providers API and when the shipment is out for delivery.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20shipping%20providers%20%28carriers%29%20do%20you%20support%3F'>\nWhich shipping providers (carriers) do you support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>TrackShip supports 810+ <a href=\"https://trackship.com/shipping-providers/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">shipping providers</a> around the globe ,if you can find your carrier on our supported shipping providers list, you can suggest a shipping provider <a href=\"https://feedback.zorem.com/trackship\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20show%20the%20shipment%20status%20for%20orders%20on%20woocommerce%20admin%3F'>\nDo you show the shipment status for orders on WooCommerce admin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, TrackShip adds a Shipment Status column on your orders admin and displays the shipment tracking status, last update date, and the Est Delivery Date for every order that you shipped after connecting your store.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20a%20shipment%20tracker%20returns%20no%20result%2C%20does%20it%20count%3F'>\nIf a shipment Tracker returns no result, does it count?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It doesn’t. When a shipment tracker is not supported by TrackShip or returned Unknown the Shipment tracker isn’t counted in your trackers balance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20free%20trials%3F'>\nDo you offer Free Trials?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, When you sign up for your TrackShip account,  you’ll get a free 50 shipments monthly plan, once you finish your trial balance, you can sign up for a paid subscription in order to continue to track additional shipments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20be%20charged%20when%20my%20free%20shipment%20trackers%20are%20finished%3F'>\nWill I be charged when my free shipment trackers are finished?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can fully test out TrackShip and all the features with the free trial Trackers without adding a credit card.
