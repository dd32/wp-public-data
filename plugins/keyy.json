If you don&#8217;t like it, add <code>define('KEYY_USE_WAVE', false);</code> to your wp-config.php (or, if you have Keyy Premium, switch it off in the settings).</li>\n<li>FIX (relevant to Keyy Premium only): Incorrect error message when saving &#8220;valid for&#8221; field</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.7.1 &#8211; 2017/Jul/17</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX (relevant to Keyy Premium only): if the user saved a site policy, then entirely removed it, then it would re-appear after the settings were saved</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.7.0 &#8211; 2017/Jul/13</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Added support for the Keyy Wave on login forms. The code is in this release; you will also need to 1) Have a recent-enough app version (1.0.9 for Android, or 1.2.4 for iOS) and 2) Add a line to your wp-config.php (careful not to add a syntax error &#8211; your site will then go off-line until you remove it). The feature will be enabled by default in our next major release (we are allowing a little bit of time for testing of the major refactoring, and for peoples&#8217; apps to update). Here is the line: <code>define('KEYY_USE_WAVE', true);</code></li>\n<li>TWEAK: Work around security rules which require the name/value pair form the login form submit button to be present, by adding that to the form before submission</li>\n<li>TWEAK: More detection of ways in which the REST interface may have been disabled</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Added plugin links to Dashboard plugins page</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Delete expired login tokens slightly later</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Add some extra checking on the /login call, when using new-style shorter tokens</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.12 &#8211;

2017/Jun/27</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: Fix JavaScript syntax in shared.js that caused a build failure</li>\n<li>FIX: As a result of the build failure, files were missing from the plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.10 &#8211; 2017/Jun/27</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Implement a back-off/die sooner polling strategy that is less troublesome in hosting setups that limit the number of active PHP processes</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Slightly strengthen checks around KEYY_DISABLE in case any cacheing is reducing its effectiveness</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Close the PHP session when doing login polling to avoid blocking any other session-using code</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Alert the user in the Keyy dashboard if mod_security is installed</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Make the test app send a user-agent header, to handle default mod_security rules</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.9 &#8211; 2017/Jun/26</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: WP sites with non-default permalink structures are now supported</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Detect further ways that users may have disabled WP&#8217;s REST interface</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Attempt to deal with WooCommerce not re-setting phpmailer fully after Keyy sends a mail (only makes any difference if the same page-load first sends a Keyy mail and then a WooCommerce one)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.8 &#8211; 2017/Jun/15</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: For rendering QR codes in the browser, swap to the kjua library, dropping the dependency on jQuery, and thus preserve success on sites with ancient plugins loading antique jQuery versions</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.7 &#8211; 2017/Jun/14</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: User logins (on the plugin side) beginning with numbers were failing to connect</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Command-line test script had issues when run on Windows due to line-ending differences.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: If the user has disabled WP&#8217;s REST interface (e.g. via a security plugin), then tell them why Keyy isn&#8217;t working</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.6 &#8211; 2017/Jun/10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FIX: If the user had chosen to allow either Keyy OR a traditional password login (option in the Premium version), then the plugin was actually requiring both (i.e. AND).</li>\n<li>TWEAK: A few bits added internally as part of the work towards Single Sign-On</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.5 &#8211; 2017/Jun/09</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: Secret URL for de-activating Keyy: note and securely store this URL when you set up, and if you lose your phone later, you can use it to login using the ordinary WordPress username/password mechanism.</li>\n<li>FEATURE: The WP users page now allows you to filter users depending on whether they are connected via Keyy or not.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: (Premium) The administrative area now displays a count of how many connected and unconnected users there are, linking to the lists in the user area.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Never hide normal login form elements when KEYY_DISABLE is set</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.4 &#8211; 2017/Jun/07</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: Be more tolerant/careful in handling of home_url values</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.3 &#8211; 2017/Jun/05</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>FEATURE: In the free version, if all users are connected to Keyy, then hide the normal username/password fields</li>\n<li>FIX: The facility in Keyy Premium for sending all un-enrolled users an email was previously not working if the Keyy Server plugin was not installed.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: The facility in Keyy Premium for sending all un-enrolled users an email now has an improved indication of progress.</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Close the PHP session when doing scan polling to avoid blocking any other session-using code</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.2 &#8211; 2017/Jun/03</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>TWEAK: When policy for a particular user is &#8220;Require both Keyy and password&#8221; (Premium option), allow the user to supply credentials in either order in all situations (previously only covered some)</li>\n<li>TWEAK: Tweak the capitalisation when choosing a user policy (Premium option) to make the difference more quickly visible</li>\n<li>FIX: When policy for a particular user was &#8220;Keyy only; no passwords&#8221;, passwords were still working if the user used their email address instead of their user login.</li>\n<li>FIX: When policy for a particular user was &#8220;Require both Keyy and password&#8221; (Premium option), passwords alone were still working if the user used their email address instead of their user login.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>0.6.1 &#8211; 2017/Jun/01</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RELEASE: Initial release (please see our list of upcoming features on the plugin page)</li>\n</ul>\n"
