Shopp creates a meta description for categories based off the category description and disregards WordPress SEO by Yoast. This plugin fixes that so only one meta description is created on a category and that is the one setup by WordPress SEO by Yoast.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this plugin adds in the ability for you to setup SEO titles and descriptions for Shopp areas you couldn&#8217;t otherwise SEO, like the Shopp landing page, account page, collections and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugin Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shopp v1.3.4+</li>\n<li>WordPress SEO by Yoast v1.6.1+</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It may work on earlier versions of those plugins but it has not been tested.</p>\n",
