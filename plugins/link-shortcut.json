Your permalink structure cannot be yourblog.com?p=84, it must be date-based, name-based, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Link Shortcut creates a table inside your database.  Upon deactivation, the plugin creates a backup table and copies records to it before removing the main table.

        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the Link Shortcut plugin to your blog (YOURBLOG/wp-content/plugins) and activate it using the WordPress plugin admin screen.</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Link Shortcuts&#8221; in the left-hand menu and manage your links.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Deactivating 1.2 and lower before upgrading to 1.3 will result in loss of any links you&#8217;ve created with this plugin.  If you&#8217;d like to keep that data, simply replace the plugin files with the new version &#8212; but be aware of the following:  There has been a database change to enable you to set a longer character length.  If you want that new functionality, you&#8217;ll need to make manual edits to your DB structure to enable this (change wp_linkshortcut.ident&#8217;s field type to VARCHAR(255)).  If you don&#8217;t want to make manual edits but would like the new features, you&#8217;ll have to bite the bullet and deactivate / unzip / re-activate.  Sorry.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How does Link Shortcut work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Link Shortcut plugin attaches itself to various core WordPress methods and waits for a request to be made for a shortcut URL saved to the database.  When one is, it simply does a redirect to the saved URL.  The redirect type can be changed (301 or 302) inside the options panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I installed the plugin but it doesn&#8217;t work.</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must have non-ugly permalink settings.  If there are variables in your URLs, you&#8217;ll have to use WordPress admin to change that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does Link Shortcut use the WordPress database?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Upon activation, Link Shortcut creates a table and stores all links in that table, so your existing structure does not change.  If you decide to deactivate the plugin, it removes this table but creates a backup table for your convenience.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
