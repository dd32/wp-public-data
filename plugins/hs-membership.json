        "faq": "\n<h4>Does HS Membership install any new database tables?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, HS Membership has been fully integrated with the Options Settings that are already built into WordPress.<br />\nIt is designed to be completely seamless, without code bloat. It has been structured to maximize the ability to<br />\nintegrate with other plugins installed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to install s2Member to use HS Membership?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. HS Membership has been designed to specifically integrate and build on the functionality of s2Member. It is designed to<br />\nseamlessly add to the functionality of s2Member. HS Members have been tested with s2Member 3.1.2.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to install BuddyPress to use HS Membership?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  Although HS Membership has been designed to integrate with BuddyPress, it is not required to have BuddyPress<br />\ninstalled to use it.

In the current version HS Membership can only be &#8216;Network Activated&#8217;. The options menu and other<br />\nfunctionality will also not be displayed or be available in membership blog dashboards. However this issue is being addressed<br />\nand in future the Super-Admin will have the option to make the HS-Membership functionality available to member blogs or even to<br />\nmember blogs with a certain membership level on the Site Blog?</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If a member cancel his subscription, will his blog be deleted automatically?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not in the current version.  In the current version of HS Membership the Super-Admin will have to manualy delete the Blog from<br />\nthe Dashboard.  However this is issue is being addressed and in future the Super-Admin will have the option to set HS-Membership<br />\nup to delete a blog if the subscription is canceled?</p>\n</p>\n\n",
