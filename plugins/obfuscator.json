        "description": "<p>This plugin will allow you to display Tor bridge information on your blog.</p>\n<p>The intent is to let your readers find bridge IP information  without the<br />\naddresses being grabbed by censoring governments and filtered. The hope is<br />\nthat many people will run this plugin and make it impossible (or just very<br />\nhard) for Tor bridge information to be filtered, but still allow that<br />\ninformation to be available to large groups of people.</p>\n<p>You can aggregate the bridge information from the main Tor site, or from<br />\nan RSS feed. This is configurable per widget.</p>\n<p>You can display the bridge information with shortcodes, or widgets. You<br />\ncan change the display size and location of the shortcode and of the<br />\nindividual widgets.</p>\n<h3>Extraneous</h3>\n<p>RSS Support<br />\nI plan to read Tor bridge information via RSS in the following format:</p>\n<p>    RSS Feed Site<br />\n    http://feedsite.com/rss/</p>\n<p>        TOR bridge RSS feed</p>\n<p>        Extra information<br />\n        Extra link information</p>\n<p>           1.2.3.4:80</p>\n<p>        Extra information<br />\n        Extra link information</p>\n<p>           4.3.2.1:8080</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure where this will go, but I like the idea of having a lot of<br />\nmeta for each bridge address. For now it won&#8217;t be display, but in the future<br />\nit could possibly be used for something. Maybe the person providing the feed<br />\ncould specify the level of obfuscation each bridge should have? Or a personal<br />\ndonation link or something to keep the bridge in oepration.</p>\n<p>Shortcode Support<br />\nYou can use the shortcode tag [obfuscaTOR] to embed the image in your posts.<br />\nYou can set the width, height, and alignment as well. Example:</p>\n<p>Here is the bridge information [obfuscaTOR width=150 height=50 align=right]</p>\n<p>This WordPress plugin is based on the ObfuscaTOR library that I put together<br />\nusing several publicly available CAPTCHA image programs. You can either copy<br />\nthat library out, or grab the latest from Github, and use it to develop plugins<br />\nfor your favorite CMS. This is encouraged! The more plugins out there, the more<br />\npeople can distribute bridge information without the censors being able to<br />\nautomatically filter it.</p>\n<p>If you write a plugin, please let me know and I can link to you. Also if you<br />\nhave more CAPTCHA creation libraries or better CAPTCHA libraries please let me<br />\nknow or fork the ObfuscaTOR lib on Github so we can keep improving this.</p>\n<p>Please see the ObfuscaTOR library readme for further info.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Unzip this plugin into your wp-content/plugins/ directory</li>\n<li>Activate it in the wordpress admin section.</li>\n<li>Put the obfuscaTOR widget wherever you like in your sidebar</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This has been tested on 2.8.4 and 2.8.5 on a Linux and Windows system. You<br />\nshould immediatley be up and running.</p>\n<p>There are more configuration options however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image Placement:<br />\nThis is where you would like your image displayed. I have included a few<br />\npopular areas that are used in most WordPress themes. If you need a new<br />\narea please let me know.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As of 1.1 there is now widget support, and that is the default operation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Checking for new bridges:<br />\nThis plugins uses a simple cacheing system to store bridge information. The<br />\ninformation you receive from the bridges.torproject site is only renewed every<br />\nfew hours(12 or more I think). This means there is no need to generate extra<br />\ntraffic for your own network, and for Tor&#8217;s network, with unecessary requests.<br />\nThis option lets you choose how often to check for new bridge information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recreate Image:<br />\nGenerating the image takes a second or two, so it can end up slowing down your<br />\nblog load time. Since there isn&#8217;t new bridge information very often, there is<br />\nreally no need generate a new image on every page request. Every now and then<br />\nyou get a bad image though, so there is a box you can check which will generate<br />\na new image immediatley.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Image Size:<br />\nThe height and width of the generated image</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
