Your author data will no longer be tied solely to the WordPress user system, and can now be managed on a per-post basis. Author name and description are saved with each post, allowing you to preserve this information as it was when the post was published.</p>\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Per-post author display name and biographical info</li>\n<li>TinyMCE (WYSIWYG) editor for user profile and per-post biographical info</li>\n<li>rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; link inside biographical info entries</li>\n</ul>\n",

The plugin saves author info to each post you edit whether or not you&#8217;ve enabled displaying author data from the post metadata. If you decide later that you want per-post author information to be displayed, any post you&#8217;ve created or edited since installing the plugin will already be set up to do this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20assign%20multiple%20authors%20to%20a%20post%3F'>\nCan I assign multiple authors to a post?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at the moment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%27m%20not%20seeing%20any%20author%20information%20on%20my%20posts%21%20what%27s%20gone%20wrong%3F'>\nI&#8217;m not seeing any author information on my posts! What&#8217;s gone wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In order for author information to appear on your posts and pages, the theme you&#8217;re using must have support for this. If it does, you should see your author info changes without issue. If you know it shows author information but you&#8217;re not seeing the changes you made using this plugin, pop over to the Support area. If your theme does not have support for author info, contact the theme developer.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
