Allowing CORS for all sites is a security problem but given you are the super admin for sites on your own network they should be trustworthy, therefore CORS can be safely activated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20cors%20and%20jsonp%3F'>\nWhat is the difference between CORS and JSONP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CORS is more modern and more secure since it works <em>with</em> the browser&#8217;s same-origin policy and XmlHttpRequest objects rather than bypassing them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='ok%20i%27m%20sold%2C%20where%20can%20i%20read%20more%20about%20cors%3F'>\nOk I&#8217;m sold, where can I read more about CORS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the CORS spec here: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ You can learn more about how to use CORS here: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Multisite CORS, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-multisite-cors/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-multisite-cors/</a>. I look there regularly and resolve most queries.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20need%20a%20feature%20that%20is%20not%20in%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please contact me for custom work and enhancements here: <a href=\"https://shawfactor.com/contact/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://shawfactor.com/contact/</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
