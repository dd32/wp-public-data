What are &#8220;New Sale Price&#8221; and &#8220;New Sale Discount&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The &#8220;New Sale Price&#8221; action changes the sale price to an amount or a percentage of the current sale price. This action is typically used for adjusting sale prices. The &#8220;New Sale Discount&#8221; action changes the sale price to an amount or a percentage off the regular price. This is handy for creating sales like &#8220;20% off&#8221;. The &#8220;Sale From&#8221; and &#8220;Sale To&#8221; dates are optional for both actions and have no effect when left empty.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>2.
