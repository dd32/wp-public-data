        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20should%20i%20use%20your%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy should I use your plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin was designed with marketing and project management teams in mind. It&#8217;s easy to implement, easy to update, and easy to customize, and all designed to help you increase conversions. I spent three years working closely with marketing and sales specialists, as well as directly with website owners, and time and time again I got a request to implement this exact functionality. So, I did what any sane developer would do: I turned it into a plugin and shared it with the community. While I am no longer with the marketing agency where this plugin was inspired and developed, the love and support this plugin has found inspires me to continue improving it with new and better features.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20you%20ready%20for%20gutenberg%3F'>\nAre you ready for Gutenberg?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been tested with Gutenberg, the new WordPress editor, and works seamlessly in WordPress environments that include it. The editor in the plugin&#8217;s admin page, where you write the body of your message, for now still uses the classic WYSIWYG.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20should%20i%20contact%20you%20if%20i%20find%20a%20bug%20or%20have%20a%20feature%20request%3F'>\nHow should I contact you if I find a bug or have a feature request?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/caspers-fly-in-cta\" rel=\"ugc\">support forums</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20change%20the%20tab%20that%20says%20%27close%27%3F'>\nHow can I change the tab that says &#8216;Close&#8217;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately this plugin is not yet translatable, and in a major oversight, I hardcoded &#8216;Close&#8217; in the JavaScript files. In a future version, I will rectify this, but in the meantime, here are the steps you can take to fix it yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Through the WordPress admin, go to Plugins -&gt; Plugin Editor.</li>\n<li>In the top right corner, select Casper&#8217;s Flyin&#8217; Call-to-Action from the dropdown.</li>\n<li>In the list of plugin files to the right, go to js -&gt; side-flyin.js.</li>\n<li>Around line 18, you should see a line like this: <code>if(!isMobile) $topbar.innerText = 'Close';</code>.</li>\n<li>Update &#8216;Close&#8217; to whatever you want.</li>\n<li>Save!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One thing to note: Any time you update this plugin, this change will be overridden. Hopefully the next update will fix this oversight though!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
