The token or voucher can easily be paid from any e-banking portal along with mobile wallet accounts.<br />\nOnce the payment has been made against the token the merchant can easily monitor success transactions in the reporting portal.</p>\n<h4>Method 2: Pull IBFT</h4>\n<p>This method saves a lot of time since it deducts money directly from the bank account of the user once the correct details have been entered. Only the user having an active e-banking or online banking can pay via pull IBFT method.<br />\nAll the transactions which are done via simpaisa plugins can be easily traced on simpaisa portal, In order to use the plug-in one must have merchant ID assigned by Simpaisa Team.<br />\nNote: To collect your merchant ID and discuss the process, please contact simpaisa team today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Support policy</strong><br />\n  * If you need assistance, please open a support request in the <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simpaisa-wallet-payment-services/\" rel=\"ugc\">Support section, above</a></strong>, and we will look into it as soon as possible (usually within a couple of days).<br />\n  * If you need support urgently, or you require a customisation, you can avail of our paid support and consultancy services.
