Put it at the top of your sidebar, and it adds some useful admin links on every page, allowing you to add new posts/pages, edit existing posts/pages, go to the admin, or log out. In short, it&#8217;s everything the meta widget should have been, without the annoying extra links.</p>\n<p>Quick Admin Links is intelligent. It doesn&#8217;t display at all unless the user is logged in (or unless you choose to display a log-in link). And if you are logged in, it will only show links that are relevant to your capabilities and the page you are on. You also have complete control over what is displayed, so you can turn off any links you don&#8217;t use.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s probably best at the top where you can see it. Drag it there.</li>\n<li>Edit the widgets options to confirm which links you want to display. Remember to save your settings!</li>\n<li>If you don&#8217;t want the log-in link displayed at the top of your sidebar, there&#8217;s another simple widget (called &#8220;Log on&#8221;) which you can also add lower down your sidebar.</li>\n</ol>\n",
