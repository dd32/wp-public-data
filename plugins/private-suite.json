As long as you have one public page, all the private pages will appear as options in the dropdown menu.</p>\n<h3>Page Lists and Widgets</h3>\n<p>Adding private pages to <code>wp_list_pages()</code>, <code>wp_page_menu()</code>, and the Pages widget does not always work as it should. The private pages will be out of order, and they might appear as children of the wrong parent page. If this occurs, try using the <code>wp_list_private_pages()</code> template tag instead. It&#8217;s a clone of <code>wp_list_pages()</code> and should accept all the same arguments. This plugin includes an extra Pages widget that includes private pages.</p>\n<h3>Private Categories</h3>\n<p>When you mark a category as private, all the posts in that category will have their visibility set to private when they are published, even if you don&#8217;t change the visibility setting on the edit screen. Only published posts are affected; your draft, pending, and scheduled posts will work as usual, except that scheduled posts will be set to private when they become active.</p>\n<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>\n<p>Huge thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mtekk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mtekk</a> for providing the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8592\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">patch</a> that makes the page list features possible.
