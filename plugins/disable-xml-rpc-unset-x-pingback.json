First, try using an XML-RPC client, like the official WordPress mobile apps. Or you can try the XML-RPC Validator, written by Danilo Ercoli of the Automattic Mobile Team &#8211; the tool is available at <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it/</a> with a blog post about it at <a href=\"http://daniloercoli.com/2012/05/15/wordpress-xml-rpc-endpoint-validator/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://daniloercoli.com/2012/05/15/wordpress-xml-rpc-endpoint-validator/</a>. If you host provides a caching service, make sure to clear your cache before you check with any of the validators.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
