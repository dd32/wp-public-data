No need to edit your theme files!</p>\n<p>The simple interface of the Pinterest conversion Tags plugin gives you one place where you can insert your TAG ID.</p>\n<p>Also, you can easily add your Pinterest meta tag verification code to claim your site with Pinterest.</p>\n<p><strong>PREMIUM FEATURES</strong></p>\n<p>The Pinterest conversion tags plugin allows you to create EVENTS on specific pages thanks to our <strong>Event META BOX</strong> feature available on each page.</p>\n<p>You can now define a conversion event by a specific action someone takes on your website, like signing up for your newsletter or buying a product.</p>\n<p>This plugin allows you to get conversion reporting for <strong>8 types of activity</strong> on your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PageVisit:</strong> Record views of primary pages, such as product pages and article pages</li>\n<li><strong>iewCategory:</strong> Record views of category pages</li>\n<li><strong>Search:</strong> Record searches on your website</li>\n<li><strong>AddToCart:</strong> Record when items are added to shopping carts</li>\n<li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Record completed transactions</li>\n<li><strong>WatchVideo:</strong> Record video views</li>\n<li><strong>Signup:</strong> Record sign ups for your products or services</li>\n<li><strong>Lead:</strong> Record interest in product or service</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Add-to-cart, Search &amp; Checkout Events</strong> are directly managed on settings page while all others are managed via our <strong>Event META BOX</strong>.</p>\n<p>Once the codes are added, give it 5 minutes and then confirm in Pinterest Conversion Manager that the tags are properly implemented.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/ad-tools/conversion-tag/?\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">full implementation guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW TO CHECK CONVERSION?</strong></p>\n<p>Click into your Pinterest Tag at https://ads.pinterest.com/conversion_tags/. On the left you‚Äôll see a section for ‚ÄòTag Event History‚Äô. Here you‚Äôll see all event codes you‚Äôve successfully added. Next to the event code you‚Äôll see how many times we‚Äôve seen the tag fire in the last 24 hours as well as the timestamp of the most recent event fire in UTC time. The data in the tag event history is updated every 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should know¬†:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Give your campaigns a little room. As with any conversion based campaign, they need time to learn. This means you might initially see CPCs and CTRs that are a little out of line with what you normally see.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you‚Äôre able to, for the initial learning phase, increase your bids slightly over where you would normally set them to help give Pinterest the space it needs to learn and optimize. You can always scale back later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always test more than one pin, but preferably 3-5 pins per ad set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If/when you make changes, make small adjustments incrementally. Meaning, you can‚Äôt go crazy to try to scale efforts that are going well because you‚Äôll throw off the algorithms and your results might not scale the way you want them too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pinterest‚Äôs new <a href=\"https://blog.pinterest.com/en/our-crazy-fun-new-visual-search-tool\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">visual search</a>¬†tool is a great way to help Pinners find your brand and products.
