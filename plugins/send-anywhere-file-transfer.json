        "faq": "\n<h4>How does Send Anywhere work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Send Anywhere pairs two devices with a temporarily generated key confirmation and transfers files instantly via the optimal network path between the devices.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I send/receive files?</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select files to send and hit the [Send] button on your Send Anywhere widget.</li>\n<li>Share the temporarily generated 6-digit key with the receiving device.</li>\n<li>The transfer process begins when the receiving device inputs the key.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Is Send Anywhere secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We use SSL encryption on our website https://send-anywhere.com and mobile apps; however, keeping the temporarily generated 6-digit key away from others is important. You can get enhanced security keys – numerical and alphabetical mixtures – through the application’s settings. Sending files through Send Anywhere is completely secure because the files are never stored on any servers. Instead, they are transferred directly via a peer-to-peer network connection between devices. If the devices are in remote locations or in different networks, the p2p path may sometimes fail. In these instances, Send Anywhere finds the most effective node-server to pass through without storing any files. The process for uploading files for later download follows the same convention as a normal upload/download process. The maximum allotted file storage time is 24 hours so there is no need to worry about security.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
