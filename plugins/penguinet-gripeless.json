The Gripeless modal allows your users to write down the problem and to attach (or directly create) a screenshot of the page.<br />\nWith their report you&#8217;ll find also useful information about their environment (browser, OS, page link, viewport, etc &#8230;), and when you resolve the problem the user will receive an automatic notification. If you are concerned about the privacy matter, look to Gripeless <a href=\"https://usegripeless.com/legal\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Terms an Conditions</a>.</p>\n<p>As already said, the button to open the modal is added to the administration bar, so only the users that see it can report a problem: for example, this plugin can be useful to web developers, designers and web agencies to receive feedback from their customers directly from the website they have produced. I&#8217;m open to requests to add functionalities to the plugin.</p>\n<h4>Benefits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The user has an easy way to provide written and visual feedback, leaving to the software the hassle to add technical information such as browser version or viewport dimensions</li>\n<li>Save time managing all the feedback of your projects from one dashboard: you can add comments and resolve the reports</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Future scenarios:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Develop a WordPress Widget</li>\n<li>Possibility to let not logged in users to use it</li>\n<li>Manage the users roles that can use it</li>\n<li>Add multisite support</li>\n<li>Add custom context to send to Gripeless</li>\n<li>Add Gripeless modal customization</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Service discontinued</h3>\n<p>Sadly, the Gripeless developer discontinued this service.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20this%20an%20official%20plugin%3F'>\nIs this an official plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, i&#8217;m not a Gripeless developer and i&#8217;m not affiliated with them. I have found the service they provide useful and easy to use, so i decided to create a plugin to integrate it into WordPress. If you have problems strictly with the plugin don&#8217;t submit your issues to Gripeless, but do it in the WordPress plugins&#8217; repository.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20service%20free%3F'>\nIs this service free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! Gripeless has a free tier that lets you use a lot of functionalities (like unlimited screenshots!), and this plugin is free (but i can always accept a beer from you ðŸ˜‰ ).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20gripeless%20work%20in%20a%20local%20environment%3F'>\nDoes Gripeless work in a local environment?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, i have found no issues in a local development environment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20read%20the%20documentation%20of%20gripeless%20and%20found%20that%20i%20can%20add%20a%20custom%20context.%20where%20i%20can%20put%20it%20in%20the%20plugin%20configuration%3F'>\nI have read the documentation of Gripeless and found that i can add a custom context. Where i can put it in the plugin configuration?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In this plugin is not yet possible to add a custom context.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
