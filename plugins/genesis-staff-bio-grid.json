It gives you built-in templates for both (these templates are part of the plugin), and a future version of the plugin will allow you to create your own replacement templates if you&#8217;d like them to do something other than the defaults.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin have a settings page or anything that needs to be set up before using it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at the moment, though there are some shortcode attributes that can help you customize things.</p>\n<p>Features planned:<br />\n* An options page to allow for customization of the archive and single templates â€“ allowing the featured image to be removed from the single template, allowing for customization</p>\n</p>\n\n",
