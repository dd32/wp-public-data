Save changes.</li>\n<li>That’s it! Now go ahead and explore customization options in your <a href=\"https://client.chatwee.com/v2/customize\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Chatwee Dashboard</a> and the plugin settings page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, you can upload the unzipped \\&#8217;chatwee\\&#8217; folder to the \\&#8217;/wp-content/plugins/\\&#8217; directory after you <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/chatwee.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">download it</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20chatwee%20free%20to%20use%3F'>\nIs Chatwee free to use?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we do offer a Free-forever plan to anyone who finds it suitable for his needs. If, however, you’d like to gain access to more features and be able to accommodate more users at the same time, we kindly encourage to you to upgrade. If you’re hesitant to spend money and would like a trial first, no problem. Please <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a>, and we’ll arrange a free trial of the paid plan of your choice.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20chatwee%20show%20ads%20in%20my%20chat%20widget%3F'>\nWill Chatwee show ads in my chat widget?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you’re using the Free plan, or have purchased a subscription, Chatwee doesn’t display any ads in your chat widget. We appreciate that our solution is an integral part of your site, so we keep it ad-free.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20customization%20can%20i%20do%3F'>\nHow much customization can I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using Chatwee you can click and drag the chat window to adjust its size to the one that fits you best. It also offers the option to set up multiple chat rooms with paid plans.<br />\nThere’s plenty more, though, and the best way to learn about Chatwee is to install it and explore it on your own. Essentially, these are two different products, and comparing them isn’t really fair, as they both offer unique features to their users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20are%20simultaneous%20chatters%3F'>\nWho are simultaneous chatters?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simultaneous chatters are people logged in to the chat at the same time and they don’t have to reflect the number of people currently visiting your site. Their number depends on the <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plan</a> that you have in place. Once the limit has been reached, the next person trying to access the chat will see a message informing them about it and will not be able to join. If your site accommodates a significant number of users, going into high hundreds, or even thousands, we can discuss an <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Enterprise solution</a> to meet your individual needs.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20chatwee%20available%20in%20my%20language%3F'>\nIs Chatwee available in my language?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Chatwee is currently available in: Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian.<br />\nWould you like to help us translate Chatwee? If so, <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">let us know</a> and we\\&#8217;ll send you the array of phrases to translate from English. In exchange, we\\&#8217;ll offer you a free, one-time upgrade to your current plan.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20you%20mean%20by%20enterprise%20solution%3F'>\nWhat do you mean by Enterprise solution?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An Enterprise solution would be a tailor-made chat plan that includes a number of simultaneous users going beyond what’s available with the ready-made plans, as well as the possibility of having new chat features developed on demand. If you happen to be interested in a group live chat solution adjusted to the specific needs of your online community, please <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a>, and we’ll discuss the details individually.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20white%20label%3F'>\nWhat is White Label?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>White Label means no Chatwee branding or the words \\&#8217;powered by Chatwee\\&#8217; anywhere on your widget. Please take a look <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> for which of our plans offer White Label.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20types%20of%20media%20can%20chatwee%20users%20share%3F'>\nWhat types of media can Chatwee users share?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using Chatwee you can upload files as well easily share images and animated gifs simply by selecting the file from your phone or hard drive. You can also send voice messages of up to 10 seconds long.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20payment%20methods%20do%20you%20accept%3F'>\nWhat payment methods do you accept?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We accept secure PayPal and credit card payments. In certain cases, such as a one-time annual payment, for example, a bank transfer can be arranged as well.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20cancel%20my%20subscription%20or%20change%20plans%20anytime%3F'>\nCan I cancel my subscription or change plans anytime?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely, there are no cancellation fees either. You can also upgrade or downgrade your current plan anytime directly in <a href=\"https://client.chatwee.com/v2/order\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dashboard</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20need%20help%2C%20the%20chat%20isn%E2%80%99t%20working%20for%20me.'>\nI need help, the chat isn’t working for me.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First, please make sure you’ve followed all the installation instructions closely and don’t have any <a href=\"https://client.chatwee.com/v2/customize\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">settings</a> in place, that would prevent the chat from displaying. If you still can’t get the widget to go, please <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a> and we’ll figure this out together.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='any%20other%20questions%3F'>\nAny other questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"https://chatwee.com/contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a> and we’ll do our best to get back to you shortly.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
