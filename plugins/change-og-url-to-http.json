        "description": "<p>When you shift your blog from HTTP to HTTPS, all your posts/pages lose facebook likes/share count. The only way to regain these likes/share counts is to add a &#8216;OG URL&#8217; tag that points back to the older &#8216;HTTP&#8217; urls as <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/faqs#moving-urls\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">described here by Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin helps you do just that.</p>\n<p>For example, if you use a SEO plugin like Yoast, the OG URL tag automatically reflects the HTTPS version for HTTPS URLs. This plugin adds a filter to the &#8216;OG URL&#8217; output and changes it back to &#8216;HTTP&#8217; for all existing posts/pages. New posts that you add after this plugin is activated will not be affected.</p>\n<p>Similary, the canonical URL tag remains unchanged as &#8216;HTTPS&#8217;. Canonical tag is used by search engines like Google. So you are good when it comes to SEO.</p>\n<p>This plugin changes the OG URL output for the following popular plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoast SEO Plugin</li>\n<li>ALL In One SEO Pack</li>\n<li>WP facebook open graph protocol by Chuck Reynolds</li>\n<li>Facebook Open Graph, Google+ and Twitter Card Tags plugin by Webdados</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Note</h4>\n<p>This plugin only changes the &#8216;OG URL&#8217; tags for posts that existed when this plugin is first installed. This way all new posts will have the regular OG URL tags with &#8216;HTTPS&#8217;.</p>\n<h3>Steps to make this work</h3>\n<p>You need to follow these steps in order for the plugin to work:</p>\n<p><em>Step 1:</em> Install and activate the plugin.</p>\n<p><em>Step 2:</em> If you are using a Cache plugin (eg: WP Super Cache), delete the cache.</p>\n<p><em>Step 3:</em> Exclude facebook bot from the HTTP to HTTPS redirection in your HTaccess file. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n<p>RewriteEngine On<br />\nRewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80<br />\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !facebookexternalhit/[0-9]<br />\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://sitename.com/$1 [R=301,L]</p>\n<p>The above rewrite rule excludes facebook bots from the redirect.</p>\n<p><em>Step 4:</em> Wait for 30 days for facebook to rescrape your pages. Your &#8216;share count&#8217; will return when facebook rescrapes your page.</p>\n<h3>Test to see if this works</h3>\n<p>You can instantly check to see if you did everything right by forcing facebook to rescrape one or many of your pages. Here&#8217;s how you can do that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login to your facebook account and go to <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook debugger tool</a></li>\n<li>Enter the &#8216;HTTPS&#8217; url of one of your pages/posts and click the &#8216;Debug&#8217; button. </li>\n<li>If you get the &#8220;This URL hasn&#8217;t been shared on Facebook before.&#8221; message,click on the &#8216;Fetch New Information&#8217; button. </li>\n<li>Now click &#8216;Scrap Again&#8217;. You should now be able to see all your &#8216;likes&#8217; to the page. You would also see two URLs under the &#8216;Redirect path&#8217;<br />\nheading which reflects your og:url meta tag and your original HTTPS URL.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you do not manually rescrape your URLs, facebook will automatically rescape your URLs within 30 days. So all your &#8216;share counts&#8217; will return within 30 days.</p>\n<p>For detailed information on these steps, <a href=\"https://orbitingweb.com/blog/http-to-https-retain-facebook-likes/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">check out this article</a></p>\n<h3>Want any new features?</h3>\n<p>Want any new features added to this plugin?
