Cached files are stored on disk, and automatically invalidated when your site is updated.</p>\n<p>In various load tests, Surge has shown to easily handle 1000-2500 requests per second at 100 concurrent, on a small single-core server with only 1 GB of RAM.

In your WordPress admin navigate to Plugins &#8211; Add New &#8211; Upload. Select the .zip file and hit Upload. Activate the plugin after upload is successful.</p>\n<p>Manually via FTP: download the Surge plugin .zip file from WordPress.org, extract the archive, make sure the directory is called &#8220;surge&#8221;. Use your FTP/SFTP client to upload the &#8220;surge&#8221; directory to wp-content/plugins. Then activate the plugin in your WordPress admin from the Plugins section.</p>\n<p>Using WP-CLI: wp plugin install surge &#8211;activate</p>\n",

Common caching errors, like installation problems, etc. will appear there. Otherwise, open your site in an Incognito window to see the cached version. You could also look for the &#8220;X-Cache&#8221; header in the server response.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20am%20i%20getting%20cache%20misses%3F'>\nWhy am I getting cache misses?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Below are a few common reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are logged into your WordPress site</li>\n<li>You have a unique cookie set in your browser</li>\n<li>A unique query parameter will also cause a cache miss, except common marketing parameters, such as utm_campaign, etc.</li>\n<li>Request methods outside of GET and HEAD are not cached</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20exclude%20page%20x%20from%20being%20cached%3F'>\nCan I exclude page X from being cached?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Of course. If you pass a &#8220;Cache-Control: no-cache&#8221; header (or max-age=0) the request will automatically be excluded from cache. Note that most WordPress plugins will already do this where necessary.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='fpassthru%28%29%20has%20been%20disabled%20for%20security%20reasons'>\nfpassthru() has been disabled for security reasons\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It seems like your hosting provider disabled the fpassthru() function, likely by mistake. This is a requirement for Surge. Please get in touch with them and kindly ask them to enable it.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20support%20surge%3F'>\nHow can I support Surge?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you like Surge, consider giving us a <a href=\"https://github.com/kovshenin/surge\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">star on GitHub</a> and a review on WordPress.org.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
