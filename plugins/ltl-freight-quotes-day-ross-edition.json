To ensure the most accurate quote possible, make sure that every product has a weight, dimensions and a freight classification recorded.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20i%20forget%20to%20identify%20a%20freight%20classification%20for%20a%20product%3F'>\nWhat happens if I forget to identify a freight classification for a product?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In the absence of a freight class, the plugin will determine the freight classification using the density calculation method. To do so the products weight and dimensions must be recorded. This is accurate in most cases, however identifying the proper freight class will be the most reliable method for ensuring accurate rate estimates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20was%20the%20invoice%20i%20received%20from%20day%20%26%20ross%20freight%20more%20than%20what%20was%20quoted%20by%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhy was the invoice I received from Day &amp; Ross Freight more than what was quoted by the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>One of the shipment parameters (weight, dimensions, freight class) is different, or additional services (such as residential<br />\ndelivery, lift gate, delivery by appointment and others) were required. Compare the details of the invoice to the shipping<br />\nsettings on the products included in the shipment. Consider making changes as needed. Remember that the weight of the packaging<br />\nmaterials, such as a pallet, is included by the carrier in the billable weight for the shipment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20find%20out%20what%20freight%20classification%20to%20use%20for%20my%20products%3F'>\nHow do I find out what freight classification to use for my products?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact your local Day &amp; Ross Freight office for assistance. You might also consider getting a subscription to ClassIT offered<br />\nby the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA). Visit them online at classit.nmfta.org.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20get%20a%20day%20%26%20ross%20freight%20account%3F'>\nHow do I get a Day &amp; Ross Freight account?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check your phone book for local listings or call 804-353-1900.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20my%20day%20%26%20ross%20username%20and%20password%3F'>\nWhere do I find my Day &amp; Ross username and password?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Email and passwords to Day &amp; Ross online shipping system are issued by Day &amp; Ross.

At the conclusion of the registration process an email will be sent to you that will include the<br />\nAPI key. You can also login to eniture.com using the username and password you created during the registration process<br />\nand retrieve the API key from the My API keys tab.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20change%20my%20plugin%20api%20key%20from%20the%20trail%20version%20to%20one%20of%20the%20paid%20subscriptions%3F'>\nHow do I change my plugin API key from the trail version to one of the paid subscriptions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Login to eniture.com and navigate to the My API keys tab.

To use it on another website you will need to purchase an additional API key.<br />\nIf you want to change the website with which the plugin is registered, login to eniture.com and navigate to the My API keys tab.<br />\nThere you will be able to change the domain name that is associated with the API key.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20have%20to%20purchase%20a%20second%20api%20key%20for%20my%20staging%20or%20development%20site%3F'>\nDo I have to purchase a second API key for my staging or development site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Each API key allows you to identify one domain for your production environment and one domain for your staging or<br />\ndevelopment environment. The rate estimates returned in the staging environment will have the word “Sandbox” appended to them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20plugin%20working%20on%20my%20other%20website%3F'>\nWhy isn’t the plugin working on my other website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you can successfully test your credentials from the Connection page (WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Day &amp; Ross Freight &gt; Connections)<br />\nthen you have one or more of the following licensing issues:</p>\n<p>1) You are using the API key on more than one domain. The API keys are for single sites. You will need to purchase an additional API key.<br />\n2) Your trial period has expired.<br />\n3) Your current API key has expired and we have been unable to process your form of payment to renew it.
