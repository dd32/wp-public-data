If any of your code errors, it won&#8217;t be able to finish parsing it. Also, your PHP code must be syntactically correct as well as echo any content you want shown in order to function properly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I want to help with development of this Plugin!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The project is now hosted on <a href=\"http://github.com/xentek/in-the-loop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">github.com</a>.
