        "faq": "\n<h4>How to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To use this plugin install, activate and configure it. After that positions of cursor and clicks will be saved and can be rendered from the main page.</p>\n<p>Once you click on display heatmap the processing time varies depending on how many clicks you have had on your site. For a few hundred clicks the processing will take a few seconds.  or a few thousand clicks it could take a few minutes. Accurate results can be obtained within a week.</p>\n<p>If the process of loading points with coordinates takes too much time, it is enough to clear the database using the plugin options.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is minimal time to save by intervals?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on you: if you want, you can set a time interval to any value in seconds, but the preferable value is 5 seconds.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
