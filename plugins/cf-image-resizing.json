But how exactly does this work? Let&#8217;s simplify it.</p>\n<p>Usually, when you upload an image to your WordPress site, it creates multiple sizes of the image to fit different screen sizes, which can slow down your site. This plugin eliminates that issue.</p>\n<p>The plugin taps into WordPress&#8217;s image management functions and changes the final URLs of the images in your site&#8217;s HTML code.

Here&#8217;s a quick way to verify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With your site open, activate the developer console in your browser. This is typically done by right-clicking on your webpage and selecting &#8220;Inspect&#8221; or &#8220;Inspect Element&#8221;.</li>\n<li>In the console, navigate to the &#8220;Network&#8221; tab.</li>\n<li>Reload your webpage. You should now see a list of items that are being loaded on your page. You&#8217;re interested in the images.</li>\n<li>Look for any image files in this list (they&#8217;ll typically end in .jpg, .png, etc.). Click on an image to view more details.</li>\n<li>Look at the URL or the response headers for that image. If you see reference to the Cloudflare Image Resizing format, it means your plugin is working correctly and your images are being optimized.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Addressing Filename Issues</h4>\n<p>The Cloudflare Image Resizing plugin works by identifying the images on your site and applying optimizations. However, it can get confused if the filenames of your images are too complex or contain multiple dimensions.</p>\n<p>For example, an image file named &#8220;image-100&#215;200-100&#215;300.jpg&#8221; might not be processed correctly. If you find that some images aren&#8217;t being resized, consider renaming these files and re-uploading them to your site. Simpler names, like &#8220;image1.jpg&#8221; or &#8220;product-shot.jpg&#8221;, are usually best.</p>\n<p>Remember, the goal of image resizing is to deliver the most optimal version of an image for every user. So, it&#8217;s always a good idea to test this functionality on different devices and browsers to ensure all your users are getting the best experience possible.</p>\n<h3>Need Expert Support?</h3>\n<p>Feeling stuck?
