        "faq": "\n<dt id='i%20installed%20the%20plugin%2C%20now%20what%3F'>\nI installed the plugin, now what?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Edit a post or page and select the block that you’d like to show or hide based on conditions.  In the right sidebar of the editor, you should see a panel labeled &#8216;Display Conditions&#8217;.  Click the panel to expand it and click the “Add Condition” link to add your first condition.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20edit%20a%20condition%3F'>\nHow do I edit a condition?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the cog icon to the right of the condition&#8217;s label.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20delete%20a%20condition%3F'>\nHow do I delete a condition?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the cog icon to the right of the condition&#8217;s label to edit the condition and then click the &#8216;Delete&#8217; button.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20show%20a%20block%20when%20the%20current%20date%20is%20between%20two%20dates%3F'>\nHow do I show a block when the current date is between two dates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This can be accomplished by using two &#8216;Check The Date&#8217; conditions.  Click &#8216;Add Condition&#8217; and choose the &#8216;Check The Date&#8217; condition.  Choose the &#8216;After&#8217; option and select the date that you&#8217;d like to start showing the block (i.e. the start date).  Save the condition and add another &#8216;Check The Date&#8217; condition but this time choose the &#8216;Before&#8217; option and select the date that you&#8217;d like to stop showing the block (i.e. the end date).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20set%20up%20a%20block%20to%20display%20after%20a%20certain%20date%20but%20it%27s%20not%20working.%20what%27s%20wrong%3F'>\nI set up a block to display after a certain date but it&#8217;s not working. What&#8217;s wrong?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Be sure that the correct timezone is selected on the Settings &gt; General page in WordPress and that the date and time you specified for your condition is for that timezone.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20%27negate%20condition%27%20option%20do%3F'>\nWhat does the &#8216;Negate condition&#8217; option do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every condition returns true or false based on whether or not the condition was met.  Negating a condition reverses the outcome so that a condition that would normally return true will return false and, a condition that would normally return false returns true instead.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20block%20conditions%20get%20deleted%20if%20i%20deactivate%20or%20uninstall%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWill my block conditions get deleted if I deactivate or uninstall the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes and no.  The conditions are not deleted and will still be there if you re-activate the plugin later; however, if you edit a page with conditional blocks while the plugin is deactivated, any conditions that were previously assigned to blocks will be erased.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
