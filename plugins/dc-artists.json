Enter the artist&#8217;s name in the title field, enter their bio in the text area you can also embed YouTube video here.<br />\nNext select label, select or add genres for this artist and set featured image (this is the image your website visitors will see first when the visit your artists page.</p>\n<p>Q. How do I add Labels?</p>\n<p>A. Click Labels &gt;&gt; Add New enter label name and logo. Like artists you can create a page called labels and place the shortcodes for each label on it add a new menu item if you want to display labels. That&#8217;s it</p>\n<p>Q. How do I add Music/Discography?</p>\n<p>A. Click on Music &gt; Add New &gt; Enter title and description, select genres and choose an artist from the list under details. (All artists music will display on the artists page. If you want to display artists individually you can copy and paste the shortcodes to separate pages.</p>\n<p>Q. How do I display artists profiles?</p>\n<p>A. After activating the plugin, create a new page in WordPress name it Artists (or whatever you like) copy and paste the shortcode generated by each new artist you add to that page. Add the page to your menu. Artists are listed vertically.</p>\n<p>Q. Are there any settings to configure?</p>\n<p>A. To keep things simple we decided not to include any customization settings in this plugin all you have to do is add artists, labels and music info.</p>\n",
