        "faq": "<h4>Isn’t this a giant security risk?</h4>\n<p>Yes, that’s why this plugin is designed only to be used in a secure local environment. Typical cases would include developers working locally. It helps in cases where you need to regularly switch user accounts, log out and in often, or have forgotten your local passwords.</p>\n<h4>Are there any safeguards?</h4>\n<p>Yes, all functionality is disabled unless the server is running locally. The current ‘safe’ list of IPs includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>127.0.0.1</li>\n<li>::1</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Can I add other local/internal IP addresses?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you can add to the ‘safe’ array on line 20 of the plugin file.</p>\n",
