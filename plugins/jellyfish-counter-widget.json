        "description": "<p>The Jellyfish Counter plugin provides a widget and shortcode enabling you to<br />\neasily add animated counters to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>Counters can be used as a manually updated total, an automatic counter that<br />\nupdates over time or just as an animated visual effect.<br />\nEach counter can count upwards or downwards making them suitable for both<br />\nincrementing totals or countdown situations. A great visual effect for travel<br />\nblogs or any website that wants to display a running total or countdown of anything.</p>\n<p>Jellyfish Counters are highly configurable through the widget interface, and<br />\nbeing generated using CSS and JavaScript, they require no external graphics<br />\nfiles. You may have as many counters as you wish on a page, all can have<br />\nindividual settings for totals and appearance.</p>\n<p>Shortcode support allows you to generate a counter directly within any<br />\npost or page content making counters no longer limited to your sidebar or<br />\nother widgetable area.</p>\n<p>Advanced users will find that Jellyfish Counter objects are fully accessible<br />\nvia JavaScript and may be controlled and reconfigured as desired though your<br />\nown custom scripting.</p>\n<h4>Demo</h4>\n<p>Check out the plugin homepage for demos and further information:<br />\nhttp://strawberryjellyfish.com/wordpress-plugins/jellyfish-counter/</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<h4>Widget</h4>\n<p>Simply drag a counter widget to your sidebar and adjust the settings to suit<br />\nyour needs.</p>\n<p>There are three basic modes of operation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Static &#8211; If you want the counter to simply display a non animated number<br />\njust set a Start Value to the desired number for the counter and set the<br />\nCounter Type to &#8216;static&#8217;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Animated – If you supply both start value and end value in the widget, the<br />\ncounter will increment upwards or downwards depending on the chosen Counter<br />\nType until it reaches the end value. Speed of the count is controlled by the<br />\nAnimation Speed option. Note, this counter has no memory, it will reset when a<br />\npage is reloaded or changed but it is great for a visual effect where start and<br />\nend values are relatively close together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continuous – If you want to count over a long period of time and need your<br />\ncounter to continue to count irrespective of page loads then just select the<br />\ncontinuous option in the widget. Then choose the interval between the counter<br />\nincrements, in seconds. As soon as you save the widget the counter will &#8220;start&#8221;<br />\nand will continue to tick away even if nobody is viewing your blog. Changing the<br />\nsetting on an active continuous counter will not effect the count value and it<br />\nwill keep count, if you wish to reset an active continuous counter just change<br />\nthe start value and save the widget and the counter will restart from the new<br />\nstarting value.<br />\nNote: In continuous mode, animation speed and display tenths have no effect.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The counters are very configurable through the widget panel. You can define<br />\nthe digit height, width and font as well as animation speed (animated mode only)<br />\nand &#8220;bustedness&#8221; (odometer style misalignment of the digits).</p>\n<p>You can further customise the appearance of an individual counter via the<br />\n&#8220;Digit Style&#8221; input that will accept a valid CSS style attributes such as<br />\nfont-family, colour, background etc.</p>\n<p>Note: the size of the font here as is automatically calculated<br />\nfrom the height, width and padding settings.</p>\n<p>Need a flat looking counter?<br />\n&#8220;Disable 3D effect&#8221; removes the CSS shading effect.</p>\n<p>If you want to display a prefix on the counter or include separating<br />\ncharacters, use the Format input. Just enter a string here representing your<br />\ndesired counter appearance, a 0 represents a counter digit, any other<br />\ncharacter will be displayed as it is. The Format option overrides the number<br />\nof digits option, if a format string exists then the counter will use the<br />\ntotal number of 0 characters as the number of digits.</p>\n<p>Example Formats:</p>\n<p>$0.00</p>\n<p>1,000,000</p>\n<p>0000 km</p>\n<h4>Shortcode</h4>\n<p>You can generate a counter directly within page or post content using the<br />\n[jellyfish_counter] shortcode. The shortcode accepts a full range of<br />\nparameters to provide identical functionality to the widget version.</p>\n<p>The following parameters may be used within a shortcode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>digits : a number, Number of digits in the counter</li>\n<li>format : a string,  representing any fancy display format</li>\n<li>tenths : true/false, display tenths digit or not</li>\n<li>digit_height : number, pixel height of digits</li>\n<li>digit_width : number, pixel width of digits</li>\n<li>digit_padding : number, pixel padding for digits</li>\n<li>digit_style : a string, custom css styles for the digits</li>\n<li>alignment : &#8216;left&#8217;, &#8216;center&#8217;, &#8216;right&#8217;, &#8216;inline&#8217; overall counter alignment</li>\n<li>bustedness : a number, misalignment of digits</li>\n<li>flat : true/false, don&#8217;t show 3d effect, show 3d effect</li>\n<li>speed : a number, 0 &#8211; 100, animation speed</li>\n<li>start : a number, starting value for the counter</li>\n<li>end : a number, ending value for the counter</li>\n<li>direction : a, string &#8216;up&#8217; or &#8216;down&#8217;</li>\n<li>interval : The number of seconds between updates of a continuous counter</li>\n<li>tick_multiplier : the number of units the counter will increment every interval (defaults to 1) </li>\n<li>timestamp : false or a string representing the starting time for the counter</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t specify a parameter it&#8217;s default value will be used.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>[jellyfish_counter end=100]</p>\n<p>The above shortcode translates as:<br />\nDisplay a counter that animates upwards from 0 to 100</p>\n<p>[jellyfish_counter start=999 end=0 direction=&#8221;down&#8221;<br />\ndigit_style=&#8221;background: transparent; color: red;&#8221; flat=true;<br />\ntimestamp=&#8221;2014-09-28 9:20:21&#8243; interval=300 ]</p>\n<p>The above shortcode translates as:<br />\nDisplay a counter that starts at 999 and ends at 0, counting downwards.<br />\nIt has red digits on a transparent background with no 3D shading effect.<br />\nIt is a persistent counter that started counting at 9:20:21 on 2014-09-28 and<br />\nhas been decrementing by one every 300 seconds (5 minutes) since then.</p>\n<h4>Styling</h4>\n<p>You can modify the appearance of an individual counters text through the<br />\nwidget control panel or through shortcode parameters. This should be<br />\nsufficient for most uses.</p>\n<p>However, if you need to globally override the default counter style or make<br />\nother CSS changes to the counter digits or container, take a look at<br />\njellyfish-counter.css for the appropriate class names. You should override<br />\nthis in you theme rather than modifying this css file as any changes made<br />\nwould be lost when the plugin upgrades..</p>\n",
        "installation": "<p>Either install and activate the plugin via your WordPress Admin</p>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p>Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/<br />\ndirectory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from<br />\nPlugins page.</p>\n<p>After activation you&#8217;ll find a new Counter widget in the widgets panel of<br />\nyour WordPress admin, drag as many counter widgets as you need to your sidebar<br />\nand other widgetable areas. Each counter widget has it&#8217;s own settings.</p>\n<p>You can also use the [jellyfish_counter] shortcode with page or post content<br />\nto display a counter within your page or post. Shortcode counters can be<br />\nconfigured just as much as their widget counterparts. See Usage for details.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How can I make the counter adapt on responsive layouts?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The current version of the counter does not scale easily, try to make your<br />\ncounter small enough to fit your smallest view. The all new future version 2.0<br />\nwill be more responsive design friendly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the counter to track visitors to my website?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it&#8217;s not that kind of a counter.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use the counter to show my post count/comment count/user count?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, possibly down the track in version 2.0+ .</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve a really cool idea for a feature, can you include it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;m always interested in suggestions, send them on through!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
