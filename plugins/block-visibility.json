        "description": "<p>Easily create dynamic content in WordPress that will increase conversions, enhance the user experience, and improve your workflow.</p>\n<p>With this <strong>no-code</strong> solution, control which blocks are visible on your website and who can see them. Schedule content to show or hide at a specific time. Display exclusive promotions to your customers or members. Restrict blocks to specific user roles, screen sizes, query strings, WooCommerce products, EDD downloads, ACF fields, WP Fusion tags, and more.</p>\n<p>Block Visibility is built exclusively for the WordPress Editor (Gutenberg) and is designed to work with <strong>any</strong> WordPress block. This includes blocks natively provided by WordPress, third-party blocks, and even block-based widgets.</p>\n<h3>Create Conditional Blocks in Seconds!</h3>\n<p>Work directly in the WordPress Editor with blocks you&#8217;re already familiar with. There is no external editor or new interface to learn. In seconds, you can transform static blocks into conditional and personalized content.</p>\n<p>It takes just <strong>3 simple steps</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create your content using <strong>any</strong> WordPress block.</li>\n<li>Select the desired visibility conditions.</li>\n<li>Save the page/post and marvel at the results!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Packed With Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Visibility Controls</strong> determine whether a block should be visible to users on the front end of your website. Features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hide</strong> blocks from all users.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule</strong> when content should be visible using a start and end date/time.</li>\n<li>Conditionally display blocks based on <strong>screen size</strong> (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, and more)</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to <strong>logged-in</strong> users.</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to <strong>logged-out</strong> users.</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to users with <strong>specific roles</strong> (Administrator, Subscriber, Customer, Member, etc.)</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to <strong>specific users</strong>. Great for personalization.</li>\n<li>Show or hide dynamic blocks based on <strong>URL query strings</strong>. Great for marketing campaigns!</li>\n<li>Show or hide blocks based on their <strong>location</strong> and &#8220;attributes&#8221; of their location (post type, taxonomy, archive, etc.)</li>\n<li>Display blocks based on a website visitor&#8217;s <strong>referral source</strong> (domain/URL).</li>\n<li>Support for all post and user <strong>metadata</strong> (custom fields).</li>\n<li>Display blocks based on HTML <strong>cookies</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce:</strong> Show or hide blocks based on products, cart contents, customer purchase history, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Custom Fields (ACF):</strong> Control the visibility of block content based on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"ugc\">ACF</a> fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Digital Downloads:</strong> Show or hide blocks based on downloads, cart contents, customer purchase history, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>WP Fusion:</strong> Combine Block Visibility with the power of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fusion-lite/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Fusion</a> to conditionally show or hide content based on data from your favorite CRM or marketing automation platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PLUS: Powerful Settings</strong> allow you to customize Block Visibility to your needs or those of your clients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visibility Presets allow you to control multiple blocks at once.</li>\n<li>Globally disable any visibility control.</li>\n<li>Restrict visibility controls to specific block types.</li>\n<li>Set permissions so only certain users have access to visibility conditions.</li>\n<li>Configure up to 4 different breakpoints to optimize the screen size controls.</li>\n<li>Disable contextual indicators and other plugin utilities.</li>\n<li>Customize the contextual indicator color to enhance theme compatibility.</li>\n<li>Enable Full Control Mode ðŸš€ (See the FAQs).</li>\n<li>Remove all plugin settings on uninstall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Do I Need This?</h3>\n<p>While there are countless applications for conditional blocks, here are a few examples to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use as a content management tool. Hide new blocks while working on them, but keep the page published.</li>\n<li>Temporarily hide seasonal content on your website rather than having to delete it.</li>\n<li>Schedule time-sensitive promotional content or event information to display automatically.</li>\n<li>Show or hide specific content on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.</li>\n<li>Restrict content so it&#8217;s only visible to your customers, members, or subscribers.</li>\n<li>Display messaging to logged-out users, encouraging them to subscribe to your blog.</li>\n<li>Create unique marketing campaigns using query string parameters to display personalized messaging (<a href=\"https://www.blockvisibilitywp.com?bv_query=example\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See it in action</a>)</li>\n<li>Conditionally display elements in the Site Editor using advanced visibility logic.</li>\n<li>Increase visitor engagement and conversions with dynamic content and personalization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Choose Block Visibility?</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Easy to Use</strong><br />\nBlock Visibility is the easiest way to create conditional blocks in WordPress. All with no code and just a few clicks!</p>\n<p><strong>2. A Balance of Power and Simplicity</strong><br />\nBlock Visibility is for you whether you&#8217;re building a sophisticated time-based promotional campaign for your customers or need to hide a few blocks on mobile. Don&#8217;t need certain functionality? Toggle it off in the plugin settings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Helpful Support and Continuous Development</strong><br />\nBlock Visibility is designed, developed, and supported by Nick Diego with contributions from the broader Block Visibility community.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='who%20should%20use%20block%20visibility%3F'>\nWho should use Block Visibility?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Block Visibility is a powerful yet simple plugin that gives marketing agencies, bloggers, eCommerce websites, and small business owners the power to conditionally show or hide blocks on their websites. The need to hide Gutenberg blocks varies. Whether you need to restrict content to specific users like members or launch a promotional campaign at a particular time with block scheduling, the applications are endless.</p>\n<p>If you need dynamic content control on your WordPress website, you need Block Visibility.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20conditional%20visibility%20controls%20really%20work%20with%20any%20block%3F%20%28what%20is%20full%20control%20mode%3F%29'>\nDo conditional visibility controls really work with any block? (What is Full Control Mode?)\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! However, not all block types are enabled by default. Controls are only provided to blocks that can be added directly to a page/post by the block inserter. Therefore, some specialized blocks, such as child blocks, are not included by default. An example is the individual Column block that is part of the larger Columns block.</p>\n<p>That said, you can enable Full Control Mode in the plugin settings. This setting removes all restrictions and adds conditional visibility controls to every block. You probably will not need Full Control Mode in most cases, but it is there if you do!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, while this plugin is designed to be compatible with all blocks, the WordPress ecosystem is ever-expanding. If you find a conflict with a specific block, please let us know in the plugin support forum, and we will investigate. We are committed to bringing visibility block controls to <strong>every</strong> Gutenberg block.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20block%20visibility%20be%20used%20with%20any%20wordpress%20theme%3F'>\nCan Block Visibility be used with any WordPress theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yup, this plugin is not theme-specific. You just need to run the latest WordPress version and use a theme that supports the block Editor. This plugin provides zero functionality to the Classic Editor.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20more%20conditional%20visibility%20controls%20be%20added%20in%20the%20future%3F'>\nWill more conditional visibility controls be added in the future?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, and if you have a specific idea of what you would like to see, please submit a feature request in the plugin support forum on WordPress.org.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20work%20in%20the%20site%20editor%20%28full%20site%20editing%29%3F'>\nDoes this plugin work in the Site Editor (Full Site Editing)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As of version 1.4.0, Block Visibility is supported in the Site Editor, which is available when using a block theme. We are committed to ensuring 100% compatibility with all Full Site Editing features. Please let us know in the plugin support forum if you find bugs or compatibility issues.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20block%20visibility%20work%20with%20elementor%20and%20other%20page%20builders%3F'>\nDoes Block Visibility work with Elementor and other page builders?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Block Visibility is designed specifically for the WordPress block Editor and, therefore, does not work on pages that the Elementor editor or another page builder controls. So long as you edit native WordPress &#8220;block&#8221; content, Block Visibility will work.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20block%20visibility%20controlled%20using%20css%3F'>\nIs block visibility controlled using CSS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visibility is controlled primarily on the server, so if a block should be hidden based on the set block controls, it will not even be rendered. This functionality ensures the plugin does not load any additional resources on the front end of your site, thereby optimizing performance.</p>\n<p>The <strong>one exception</strong> to this is the Screen Size block controls. Visibility by screen size requires the use of CSS. This CSS is loaded to the front end of your site if, and only if, these controls are enabled. You can opt to disable this CSS and add the necessary styles yourself.

    "description": "<p>Easily create dynamic content in WordPress that will increase conversions, enhance the user experience, and improve your workflow.</p>\n<p>With this <strong>no-code</strong> solution, control which blocks are visible on your website and who can see them. Schedule content to show or hide at a specific time. Display exclusive promotions to your customers or members. Restrict blocks to specific user roles, screen sizes, query strings, WooCommerce products, EDD downloads, ACF fields, WP Fusion tags, and more.</p>\n<p>Block Visibility is built exclusively for the WordPress Editor (Gutenberg) and is designed to work with <strong>any</strong> WordPress block. This includes blocks natively provided by WordPress, third-party blocks, and even block-based widgets.</p>\n<h3>Create Conditional Blocks in Seconds!</h3>\n<p>Work directly in the WordPress Editor with blocks you&#8217;re already familiar with. There is no external editor or new interface to learn. In seconds, you can transform static blocks into conditional and personalized content.</p>\n<p>It takes just <strong>3 simple steps</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create your content using <strong>any</strong> WordPress block.</li>\n<li>Select the desired visibility conditions.</li>\n<li>Save the page/post and marvel at the results!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Packed With Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Visibility Controls</strong> determine whether a block should be visible to users on the front end of your website. Features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hide</strong> blocks from all users.</li>\n<li><strong>Schedule</strong> when content should be visible using a start and end date/time.</li>\n<li>Conditionally display blocks based on <strong>screen size</strong> (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, and more)</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to <strong>logged-in</strong> users.</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to <strong>logged-out</strong> users.</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to users with <strong>specific roles</strong> (Administrator, Subscriber, Customer, Member, etc.)</li>\n<li>Only show blocks to <strong>specific users</strong>. Great for personalization.</li>\n<li>Show or hide dynamic blocks based on <strong>URL query strings</strong>. Great for marketing campaigns!</li>\n<li>Show or hide blocks based on their <strong>location</strong> and &#8220;attributes&#8221; of their location (post type, taxonomy, archive, etc.)</li>\n<li>Display blocks based on a website visitor&#8217;s <strong>referral source</strong> (domain/URL).</li>\n<li>Support for all post and user <strong>metadata</strong> (custom fields).</li>\n<li>Display blocks based on HTML <strong>cookies</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce:</strong> Show or hide blocks based on products, cart contents, customer purchase history, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Custom Fields (ACF):</strong> Control the visibility of block content based on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\" rel=\"ugc\">ACF</a> fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Digital Downloads:</strong> Show or hide blocks based on downloads, cart contents, customer purchase history, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>WP Fusion:</strong> Combine Block Visibility with the power of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fusion-lite/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Fusion</a> to conditionally show or hide content based on data from your favorite CRM or marketing automation platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>PLUS: Powerful Settings</strong> allow you to customize Block Visibility to your needs or those of your clients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visibility Presets allow you to control multiple blocks at once.</li>\n<li>Globally disable any visibility control.</li>\n<li>Restrict visibility controls to specific block types.</li>\n<li>Set permissions so only certain users have access to visibility conditions.</li>\n<li>Configure up to 4 different breakpoints to optimize the screen size controls.</li>\n<li>Disable contextual indicators and other plugin utilities.</li>\n<li>Customize the contextual indicator color to enhance theme compatibility.</li>\n<li>Enable Full Control Mode ðŸš€ (See the FAQs).</li>\n<li>Remove all plugin settings on uninstall.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Do I Need This?</h3>\n<p>While there are countless applications for conditional blocks, here are a few examples to get you started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use as a content management tool. Hide new blocks while working on them, but keep the page published.</li>\n<li>Temporarily hide seasonal content on your website rather than having to delete it.</li>\n<li>Schedule time-sensitive promotional content or event information to display automatically.</li>\n<li>Show or hide specific content on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.</li>\n<li>Restrict content so it&#8217;s only visible to your customers, members, or subscribers.</li>\n<li>Display messaging to logged-out users, encouraging them to subscribe to your blog.</li>\n<li>Create unique marketing campaigns using query string parameters to display personalized messaging (<a href=\"https://www.blockvisibilitywp.com?bv_query=example\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">See it in action</a>)</li>\n<li>Conditionally display elements in the Site Editor using advanced visibility logic.</li>\n<li>Increase visitor engagement and conversions with dynamic content and personalization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why Choose Block Visibility?</h3>\n<p><strong>1.
