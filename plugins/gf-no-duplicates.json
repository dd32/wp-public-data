You can do this from the Forms &gt; Settings &gt; GF No Duplicates settings page. Or using the gnd_duplicate_submission_message filter. See the example below:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'gnd_duplicate_submission_message', function( $message, $form ) {\n    $message = 'Your custom text goes here';\n    return $message;\n}, 10, 2 );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using the filter will override the default message and any custom message that you may have added in the settings page.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
