        "faq": "\n<h4>Can I customise the 410 response message?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default message is a simple plain text message that reads &#8220;Sorry, the page you requested has been permanently removed.&#8221; This is because many people want to minimise the bandwidth that is used by error responses.</p>\n<p>If you want to customise the message, just place a template file called <code>410.php</code> in your theme folder, and the plugin will automatically use that instead. Take a look at your theme&#8217;s <code>404.php</code> file to see how the template needs to be structured. You can also hook into the <code>wp_410_response</code> action to trigger any specific events for queries resulting in a 410 response.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this plugin work if a caching/performance plugin is active ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin has been tested with the following caching plugins, and should work even if they are active:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>W3 Total Cache</li>\n<li>WP Super Cache</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have not tested it with other caching plugins, and there is a high chance that it <strong>will not work</strong> with many of them. Most of them will cache the response as if it is a 404 (page not found) response, and issue a 404 response header instead of a 410 response header.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
