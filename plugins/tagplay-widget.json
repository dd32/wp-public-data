Feeds can then be<br />\nintegrated into your website, where they will automatically update whenever you make posts on your social media accounts.<br />\nFor more information, visit https://tagplay.co.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a Tagplay account to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you will need a Tagplay account. Both the widget and shortcode are only wrappers around Tagplay&#8217;s HTML/Javascript widget.<br />\nThey require a Tagplay project ID, feed ID and authentication token.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why should I use Tagplay instead of a simple social media feed widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Tagplay can combine feeds from multiple social media accounts into one, allows moderation, pinning and bumping within the<br />\nfeed, and allows you to make certain feeds collect only posts with certain hashtags, making for a much greater level of<br />\ncontrol over your content. For instance, a restaurant site could have both a Meal of the Day feed and a News feed, controlled<br />\nfrom the same social media account but one collecting only posts hashtagged #mealoftheday and one collecting only #news.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates the default Tagplay widget version to 1.10.1. This new version offers greater control over the handling of hashtags in posts, links hashtags and mentions to appropriate searches on the originating site, and adds lightbox functionality.</li>\n<li>The &#8216;Text&#8217; setting has been split into two settings, &#8216;Hashtags&#8217; and &#8216;Strip hash&#8217;. The former controls whether hashtags should be stripped from the end of a post, and the latter controls whether hashtags should have their initial # stripped, turning them into regular, unlinked words.</li>\n<li>A &#8216;Lightbox&#8217; setting has been added, controlling whether clicking posts in your widget should open the post in a lightbox.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Old widgets using the shortcode will be automatically upgraded. To upgrade widgets in your theme, simply resave them on the Widgets page in the admin. Note that the &#8216;Lightbox&#8217; setting is on by default in 1.1. If you do not wish to add lightbox functionality to your widget, you should uncheck the relevant box before saving.</p>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial release.</li>\n</ul>\n"
