For these reasons, the functionality is disabled by default on mobile operating systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://westonruter.github.io/spoken-word/test/example.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Try it out</a> on standalone example with some test content.</p>\n<h4>Theme Config</h4>\n<p>The settings for Spoken Word are presented in an HTML5 <code>dialog</code> element. For browsers that do not yet support this feature, the plugin bundles the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">dialog-polyfill</a>. The polyfill is only included if it is detected the browser does not support <code>dialog</code> natively. The inclusion of the polyfill can be disabled by adding the following to your theme or plugin:</p>\n<pre>\nadd_filter( 'spoken_word_include_dialog_polyfill', '__return_false' );\n</pre>\n<p>For themes that have a sticky header (such as the nav menu in Twenty Seventeen) you may need to add some additional CSS to ensure that the sticky-positioned playback controls do not get hidden behind the sticky header. For example in Twenty Seventeen, you can add the following to the Custom CSS in the Customizer:</p>\n<pre>\n@media screen and (min-width: 782px) {\n    body:not(.admin-bar) .spoken-word--active {\n        top: calc( 0.5em + 70px );\n    }\n    body.admin-bar .spoken-word--active {\n        top: calc( 0.5em + 32px + 70px );\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n<h4>Internals</h4>\n<p>A bookmarklet can be used to load the Spoken Word functionality into any site, even non-WordPress sites where the plugin is not installed. The key is to use the appropriate <code>contentSelector</code>:</p>\n<pre>\n( () =&gt; {\n    const link = document.createElement( 'link' );\n    link.rel = 'stylesheet';\n    link.href = 'https://unpkg.com/spoken-word/css/style.css';\n    document.head.appendChild( link );\n\n    const script = document.createElement( 'script' );\n    script.src = 'https://unpkg.com/spoken-word/dist/spoken-word.js';\n    script.addEventListener( 'load', () =&gt; {\n        spokenWord.initialize( {\n            contentSelector: [ /* ðŸ‘ˆ Amend as desired. */\n                '.hentry',\n                '.entry-content',\n                '.h-entry',\n                '.e-content',\n                '[itemprop=\"articleBody\"]',\n            ].join( ', ' )\n        } );\n    } );\n    document.head.appendChild( script );\n} )();\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>spokenWord.initialize()</code> function takes an object as its argument which can have the following properties:</p>\n<pre>\n * @param {string}  contentSelector         - CSS Selector to find the elements for speaking.\n * @param {Element} rootElement             - Root element within which to look for content.\n * @param {Object}  chunkifyOptions         - Options passed into chunkify.\n * @param {boolean} useDashicons            - Whether to use Dashicons.\n * @param {Object}  defaultUtteranceOptions - Default utterance options when none are supplied from localStorage.\n</pre>\n<p>The dialog and the controls are rendered using <a href=\"https://preactjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Preact</a>.
