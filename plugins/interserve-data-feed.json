        "installation": "<p>Requires at least PHP7</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Edit wp-config.php and add define(&#8220;DISABLE_WP_CRON&#8221;, true);</li>\n<li>Set up a cron job to call the cron.php (see the codex for wp_cron)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The feed update takes a long time: several minutes on first load, and 20+ seconds for each refresh so it needs to be run as a real system cron job that calls wp-cron.php once every 12 hours at the most. See <a href=\"http://www.lucasrolff.com/wordpress/why-wp-cron-sucks/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Why WP-Cron Sucks</a>.<br />\nNote: the feed data is only updated once a day, so calling more often than once every 12 hours is a waste of CPU time and bandwidth. Repeat abusers will be blacklisted.</p>\n<p>The plugin settings page (in the Settings main menu) has two fields for each custom post type. Use this to insert raw html or a shortcode into the page above or below a singular job posting, story, contact etc.</p>\n<p>If a google maps API key is provided, a google map showing the location of each office will be displayed underneath the office contact details. Sign up for the Google Maps platform before your first sync / update to ensure offices are geocoded correctly.</p>\n",
        "faq": "<ul>\n<li>You must not have a page with a permalink the same as one of the isdata post types, or undefined weirdness will occur. So a page named /job/ or /story/ etc will not work as expected. Try using the plural form or making some other change to the permalink eg /jobs/ or /openings/ instead of /job/; /our-stories/ instead of /story/; /where-we-work/ instead of /locations/ etc</li>\n<li>Typical use on a page would be just a blank page with two related shortcodes eg [isdata_job_search] [isdata_job_list] which provide a search form and a search results page</li>\n<li>The widgets show related jobs or stories. They are smart: they know what other jobs / stories are currently displayed on the page so they adapt to show similar ones with the same location / duration / profession / etc</li>\n<li>iThemes Security plugin may cause the search form to stop working. When you click the Search button it will give a 403 forbidden message. To fix it, disable &#8220;Filter Suspicious Query Strings in the URL&#8221; in the System Tweaks of the iThemes Security settings.</li>\n</ul>\n",
