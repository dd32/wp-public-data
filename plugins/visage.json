If you own a blog or something similar you&#8217;re also free to write some words about it. Thanks! ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to rebuild my theme to support visage?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, you don&#8217;t need to make any changes to your theme if you want it to support my plugin. If you&#8217;re using avatars in your theme, you might already know about the <code>get_avatar()</code> function. Now the great thing about visage: It will just filter this function and replace the default avatar with the new one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which languages do you support?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently <strong>German</strong>, <strong>English</strong> and <strong>French</strong> (more will follow soon).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
