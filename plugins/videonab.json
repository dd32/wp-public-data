        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Installing VideoNab is a piece of cake. Simply navigate to the &#8220;Plugins&#8221; section of your WordPress admin, and select &#8220;Add New&#8221;.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll then want to select &#8220;Upload&#8221; from the menu at the top of this page. On the next screen, you&#8217;ll want to click &#8220;browse&#8221; which will allow you to locate your VideoNab zip file.<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1-install.png</li>\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve selected your file, click &#8220;Install Now&#8221; to start uploading the plugin. After it is finished uploading, you&#8217;ll click the &#8220;Activate Plugin Now&#8221; option.<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2-activate.png</li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it! High five, VideoNab is now installed. You&#8217;ll now see the VideoNab tab in the left sidebar of your WordPress admin, It&#8217;s time to setup the plugin!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Full Documentation here: http://www.videonab.com/videonablite-documentation/</p>\n<p>&#8212;Setup &amp; Settings&#8212;<br />\nThe first section you&#8217;ll want to visit is the VideoNab Settings panel. This is found under the main VideoNab tab. Below you&#8217;ll find a breakdown of the settings you&#8217;ll find, as well as their purpose. A more detailed overview follows after the image. You&#8217;ll want to set each setting to your preference in order to properly display your videos.<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lite-settings.png</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Number of Videos Per Page<br />\nVideoNab consists of 2 core sections on the front-end: The video stream, and the video detail page. This option allows you to set the number of videos that are contained on a single page of the video stream (the list of videos users will first see). This setting is important as you&#8217;ll use it to control the vertical height of the list, so you can customize how many video previews are shown in order to make it fit within your page or post as needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Include Pagination<br />\nThis setting automatically adds pagination to your video stream. This is important as in some cases, especially if not using the Event (Pro Version only: http://www.videonab.com), you may only have a few videos. If all videos fit on a single page of your stream, you can set this to off for a cleaner interface. For users with a LOT of videos, its crucial that this setting is enabled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable Comments<br />\nThis automatically adds a commenting system to each video (it will not post comments to YouTube).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose Main Video Page<br />\nThis page is the location where you&#8217;ve chosen to place the video stream. Note that this doesn&#8217;t add the stream to the page (you&#8217;ll need to place the [VideoNab] shortcut for that) but simply tells VideoNab where the video detail page should link to if the visitor clicks the &#8220;return&#8221; icon.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#8212;Manually Adding Videos&#8212;<br />\nVideoNabLite gives you the ability to manually add any video of your choosing form YouTube. This is perfect for sites that need to display only a few videos, such as a collection of tutorials, or specific videos from their own collection/channel. For site needing more features, including automated video aggregation and voting, we recommend upgrading to VideoNabPro: http://www.videonab.com<br />\n1. Navigate to the tab VideoNab &gt; Add New Video<br />\n2. Enter the url for each video as needed. See the example below for more details. All videos are added to your video stream, and are also added to your admin list, where you can change the title and details if so desired.<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6.manually-adding.png</p>\n<p>&#8212;Editing Video Details&#8212;<br />\nOnce you&#8217;ve manually added videos, VideoNabLite gives you the ability to change the title and description of each video as needed. Further, you can change the permalinks of your videos to enhance SEO and drive traffic to your site.<br />\n1. Navigate to the VideoNab tab to see a list of your videos. From here, you have a few quick-edit options, such as the ability to block videos, and change their dates to reorder.<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/videoNab-videolist.png<br />\n2. Click on a video title for more advanced options. You will be taken to the video details page. Check out the details below:<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/7.edit-video.png</p>\n<p>&#8212;Placing your VideoNab video Stream into a Page or Post&#8212;<br />\nAfter all of your settings are to your liking, it&#8217;s time to place the actual feed into your site! This is as simple as it gets, simply paste the shortcode in any page or post where the feed is meant to appear. It looks like this: [[videonab]]<br />\nSo, it&#8217;s as simple as copying that shortcode and pasting it right into the content area of your page, like this:<br />\nImage reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8.shortcode.png<br />\nThat&#8217;s it! You are officially live and VideoNab is grabbing some awesome videos.</p>\n<p>&#8212;Flushing Videos&#8212;<br />\nDepending on topic, frequency of the event scheduler, etc., VideoNab can at some point aggregate a LOT of videos. If at any point you want to start with a clean slate, we&#8217;ve included the ability to &#8220;flush&#8221; all videos and start from scratch. To do so, follow these simple instructions:<br />\n1. Navigate to the &#8220;VideoNab &gt; Video Removal&#8221; tab in WordPress admin.<br />\n2. Click &#8220;delete all videos&#8221;, as shown below and, boom, you offically have a fresh start and life is good.</p>\n<p>Image reference: http://www.videonab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/9.delete.png</p>\n",
