        "description": "<p>Simple, yet pretty and perfect for most of us. You will love this contact form! Through its Gutenberg block (or shortcode), you can add it anywhere and make it yours in a few clicks. Lightweight, clean UI, no need to set up anything special or download more plugins. It doesn&#8217;t use any JS or CSS files (except if you active ReCAPTCHA). You can find more information on this plugin on <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/contact-form-block/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Meow Apps: Contact Form Block</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why another Contact Form?</strong> I have tried many plugins in the past, and I found them all too heavy and complicated. Most of the time, I just wanted a simple <strong>contact</strong> form. Why would I need to create a new form in a list of forms, manually decide the fields and make sure everything is well set-up? And why do I need more plugins in order to add ReCAPTCHA support, or even pay for such a basic option?</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>The Contact Form Block has been designed to be used within the Gutenberg Editor. You can modify the labels of the main fields (Name, E-mail, and Message) and the overall design. A header can also be added, with an image and some text. The text and color of the submit button can also be customized. There are 3 basic <strong><em>themes</em></strong> available: None, Default and Meow Apps. None will add no styles to your contact form, Default will make it work on any theme, and Meow Apps will look a bit more solid.</p>\n<p>The shortcode [contact-form-block] can also be used, just as it is! That shortcode can be used anywhere, in your widgets for example. Have a look at the <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/contact-form-block/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tutorial</a> to learn how to use it.</p>\n<p>For the ReCAPTCHA and the other various settings, please visit the Contact Form page under the Meow Apps menu in your WordPress Admin.</p>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The default behavior of this contact form is to send an e-mail to the admin of the WordPress install. That can be easily modified through the available WordPress filters.</li>\n<li>ReCAPTCHA v3 is currently used as an Anti-Spam. If you are interested, you can also develope your own &#8216;human check&#8217;. Have a look at <a href=\"https://meowapps.com/contact-form-block/tutorial/#Anti-Spam_Ask_a_question\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Best Practices</h3>\n<p>This contact form follows the best practices, in order to guarantee a maximum conversion rate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vertical layout (multi-columns result in a loss)</li>\n<li>Labels above the fields (instead of placeholders or tricks)</li>\n<li>Explicit and colorful submit button (labelled &#8216;Send&#8217; instead of &#8216;Submit&#8217;, by default)</li>\n<li>A limited number of fields (after 3 fields, the conversion rate goes down)</li>\n<li>No captcha (don&#8217;t worry about spams, this contact form includes ReCAPTCHA_v3, which is invisible)</li>\n<li>Use a header (with a small image), that will motivate the user to contact you</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n<p>This Contact Form&#8217;s goal is to remain simple and fast. New fields and features can be added through its filters and actions, but I will not make the core more complex and heavy.</p>\n<p>Languages: English.</p>\n",
