Customise your calendar to show all events, or only specific categories of events, such as brand sales, sample sales, vintage sales, bridal sales, fashion exhibitions or other fashion events.</p>\n<h4>Using the Plugin</h4>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve installed the plugin, just paste the following onto any page or post on your blog or site:</p>\n<p>[chicmi-calendar city=&#8217;london&#8217;]</p>\n<p>Change city to &#8216;new-york&#8217; or &#8216;los-angeles&#8217; to show events for those cities instead. More cities are added all of the time &#8211; so keep an eye on https://www.chicmi.com/for-bloggers/ to see what cities are available.</p>\n<p>When you save the page and view it, you will find that Chicmi will show all upcoming fashion sales and events for the next week on your page.</p>\n<h4>Customisation</h4>\n<p>There is an amazing number of ways that you can customise your calendar including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing the types of events shown in the calendar, for example only showing sample sales, brand sales, fashion exhibitions, vintage sales, bridal sales or more.</li>\n<li>Limiting results to sector, such as only showing luxury, designer, independent or high street events.</li>\n<li>Changing the date range shown, or setting a specific static date range.</li>\n<li>Filtering the results by specific designers.</li>\n<li>Changing the layout, such as where images are positioned, the number of columns, or the total number of results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8230; plus much more! We&#8217;ve built a configurator to make it easy to generate the code that you can just copy and paste into your blog. To configure your calendar, just visit https://www.chicmi.com/for-bloggers/</p>\n<h4>Get Help</h4>\n<p>Although Chicmi can&#8217;t provide detailed technical support for how to use the plugin on your blog or site, we may be able to help with basic questions. Also, we love hearing feedback &#8211; so if you&#8217;ve got ideas about how we can work with you to build an even better plugin for your site, please let us know!

        "installation": "<p>We recommended that you let WordPress install the plugin for you &#8211; just find the plugin in the WordPress plugins directory and press Install Now.</p>\n<p>If you are unable to use the automatic installer, just download and unzip the plugin to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder and then enable the plugin from the Plugins menu in WordPress. Once the plugin is enabled you can use it as per the usage instructions above.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Do I need to provide the event data myself?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No &#8211; the data comes automatically from Chicmi, and is updated in real time every time someone views your page. Chicmi works hard to list every fashion-related event in the cities we operate in.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need to pay to use the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No &#8211; the plugin is completely free to use.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you support other cities than London, New York and Los Angeles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>At the moment we only support those cities, but more are constantly added and will be coming soon. If there&#8217;s a specific city that you&#8217;re keen for us to support then make your voice heard &#8211; tell us on Twitter at @chicmiapp, or email team@chicmi.com.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I know about an event that you don&#8217;t have. How can I add it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just send us a tip and we&#8217;ll add it, usually within hours! You can send tips here: https://www.chicmi.com/tip/event/</p>\n<p>As soon as it&#8217;s added to our system it will appear automatically on your blog or site.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
