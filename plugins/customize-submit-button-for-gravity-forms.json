However, you can&#8217;t add html as part of the button text and you&#8217;re restricted to using either an input or image element for the button. With this plugin you can choose to use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> tag element instead, which also lets you embed HTML inside it. Moreover, this plugin also lets you conveniently change the CSS classes of the submit button.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of use cases for adding HTML into the submit button text. For instance, if your button text is multiple words long and you&#8217;d like to bold or italicize some of them by wrapping certain words in strong or em tags.</p>\n<p>Likewise, there are many reasons to change the button&#8217;s default CSS class. For example, GravityForms automatically adds the &#8216;button&#8217; class, but, if you&#8217;re using the Twitter Bootstrap framework, &#8216;btn&#8217; would actually be more helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Gravity Forms requires at least: 1.9.12.16</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gravity Forms tested up to: 1.9.15.11</strong><br />\nAfter activating the plugin, please navigate to the form settings of the form that you wish to customize. Scroll down to the &#8216;form button&#8217; section where, in addition to &#8216;text&#8217; and &#8216;image&#8217;, you&#8217;ll also be given &#8216;button&#8217; as an input type option. Selecting the &#8216;button&#8217; option will change the submit button&#8217;s markup to a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. You will also be able to embed html in the &#8216;HTML Button Text&#8217; field.</p>\n<p>In the same &#8216;form button&#8217; section under form settings, there&#8217;s an input called &#8216;Submit Button CSS Classes&#8217;. This is where you can change the CSS classes being currently used by the submit button.</p>\n<p>Currently you are only able to customize the submit buttons on a per form basis within the form settings and not globally.</p>\n<h4>Please note that Gravity Forms must be installed and activated for the plugin to work.</h4>\n",
        "installation": "<h4>Automatic Installation</h4>\n<p>Installing this plugin automatically is the easiest option. You can install the plugin automatically by going to the plugins section in WordPress and clicking Add New. Type &#8220;WooCommerce Change Product Author&#8221; in the search bar and install the plugin by clicking the Install Now button.</p>\n<h4>Manual Installation</h4>\n<p>To manually install the plugin you&#8217;ll need to download the plugin to your computer and upload it to your server via FTP or another method. The plugin needs to be extracted in the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder. Once done you should be able to activate it as usual.</p>\n<p>If you are having trouble, take a look at the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Managing Plugins</a> section in the WordPress Codex, it has more information on this topic.</p>\n",
