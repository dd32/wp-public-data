A few examples:</p>\n<p>Display the lowest price on single product page (without passing product ID as argument), currency symbol attached:<br />\n    <code>This product low is [wc_price_history]</code></p>\n<p>Display the lowest price of the other product, currency symbol attached:<br />\n    <code>The product with ID 3 had the lowest price [wc_price_history id=3]</code></p>\n<p>Display without currency symbol:<br />\n    <code>The product with ID 3 had the lowest price [wc_price_history id=3 show_currency=0]</code></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20filters%20and%20actions%20i%20can%20use%20to%20affect%20wc%20price%20history%20internal%20logic%3F'>\nWhat filters and actions I can use to affect WC Price History internal logic?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Available filters are:<br />\n    wc_price_history_is_correct_place (defined in <code>PriorPrice\\Prices::is_correct_place</code>)<br />\nAllows to display price history on custom screens, not listed in plugins settings. Return true to make price history visible.</p>\n<pre><code>wc_price_history_is_not_correct_when (defined in `PriorPrice\\Prices::is_not_correct_when`)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Allows to stop displaying price history for your own custom conditions.

Go to the product edit screen and set <code>Sale price dates from</code> to the date when the product went on sale.</p>\n<p>Tip: All the products which are On sale but does not have <code>Sale price dates from</code> set will be logged to WooCommerce logs. Go to <code>WooCommerce</code> &gt; <code>Status</code> &gt; <code>Logs</code> to see the list of products (in right top corner preselect log which name starts with wc-price-history).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20adjust%20minimal%20price%20before%20being%20it%20displayed%3F'>\nCan I adjust minimal price before being it displayed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can use filter <code>wc_price_history_lowest_price_html_raw_value_taxed</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>`\n</code></pre>\n<p>add_filter( &#8216;wc_price_history_lowest_price_html_raw_value_taxed&#8217;, function( $price, $wc_product ) {<br />\n    // do something with $price<br />\n    return $price;<br />\n}, 10, 2 );<br />\n    `</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20clean%20the%20history%3F'>\nCan I clean the history?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, on the plugin configuration screen click the button &#8216;Clean history&#8217;. This will remove all the history storage for all products.
