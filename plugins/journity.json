        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20journity%3F'>\nWhat is Journity?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Journity is a service that gives nonprofit organizations the ability to create targeted calls to actions (cta&#8217;s) based on the behavior of users on the organization&#8217;s website. This gives the organization the ability to personalize cta&#8217;s based on the users Journey. Speaking to a user where they are in a 1-to-1 way like this increases subscriptions and donations in ways that a traditional 1-to-many approach simply can&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='so%2C%20what%20does%20this%20plugin%20do%3F'>\nSo, what does this plugin do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Great question! This plugin helps you install the scripts necessary to use Journity on your website. These scripts are necessary to collect data in order to personalize the experience for your users. It will also let you display the CTA&#8217;s (we call them Waypoints).</p>\n<p><strong>What it won&#8217;t do:</strong> It won&#8217;t let you make the CTA&#8217;s for your website, that&#8217;s what your <a href=\"https://app.journity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Journity Dashboard</a> is for! Once you&#8217;ve set up your Waypoints, then the scripts this plugin installs will display your personalized messaging to only the users you specify!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
