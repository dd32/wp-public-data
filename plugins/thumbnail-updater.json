Navigate to Media Library, click on any image and you should a button that says &#8220;Update Image Sizes.&#8221; Clicking<br />\non that will open a popup that lists all of the available image sizes. If a thumbnail size exists for that image, there will be a<br />\ncheck next it. If the thumbnail size doesn&#8217;t exist, then a red exclamation mark will appear.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>thumbnail-update</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s all!</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>Hey! Your plugin keeps saying Error! What&#8217;s wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Possibly permission problems. If you&#8217;re like me, you probably have a two-year-old blog and have switched hosts at least three times<br />\nin that last year. What does that have to do with permissions? Well, some of your older uploads—those dating prior to your last<br />\nwebhost change—either A) don&#8217;t have the folders and files set to 777 and 666 (respectively) or B) Owner:group isn&#8217;t set to www-data:www-data.<br />\nThe first problem is relatively easy to deal with using any good FTP program. The second problem requires that your web-host allows<br />\nshell-access to their servers. If not, you&#8217;ll have to contact them to get the groups changed. Finally, I&#8217;ve run into some issues with<br />\nthe oldest files on my server. It didn&#8217;t matter if I changed permissions or owners on the directory or files, I still could not get thumbnails to generate.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
