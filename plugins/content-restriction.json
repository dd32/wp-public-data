This plugin works with most theme out-of-the-box. However some themes may need adjustments due to not using WordPress/WooCommerce standard hooks or styles or if they add their own customizations which might conflict with Content Restriction.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have any issues using Content Restriction with your theme please let us know through the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/content-restriction/\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a> and we’ll fix it asap.</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20content%20restriction%20%20compliant%20with%20privacy%20laws%20%28gdpr%20%2F%20rgpd%20%2F%20ccpa%20%2F%20lgpd%29%3F'>\nIs content restriction  compliant with privacy laws (GDPR / RGPD / CCPA / LGPD)?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We value your privacy and your customers’ privacy.</p>\n<p>While we cannot guarantee that the plugin is fully compliant with privacy laws in every country.</p>\n<p><strong>We assure you that Fluid Checkout does not, and will not, collect any customer data from your shop.</strong></p>\n<p>In the future, <strong>and with your explicit consent</strong>, we might collect some non-sensitive usage data from your website such as the plugin and WooCommerce settings, which other plugins and themes you have installed on your shop to help us to improve the plugin stability.</p>\n<p>Details and examples of the data collected will be shown on the plugin interface for you to review prior to sending the data to our servers for collection and storage.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20plugin%20protect%20images%2C%20videos%20and%20other%20media%20files%3F'>\nDoes the plugin protect images, videos and other media files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Content Restriction can restrict access to media that is embedded within a post or page, but it does not protect the original file URL on the server.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20create%20a%20account%20to%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nDo I need to create a account to use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No you don’t have to create account to use this plugin.
