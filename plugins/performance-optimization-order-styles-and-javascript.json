However, I will recommend using it to only those WordPress installation where any caching system is in use. Remember, every code takes resources even if it is smaller. My code is not an exception. So, if you are using any caching system then the plugin code need not run every time a request is made for a page on your website/blog.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
