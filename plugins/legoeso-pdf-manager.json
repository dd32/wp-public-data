In cases of large documents, only a preview image will be generated, no text will not be extracted from the document, therefore the document&#8217;s text will not be included when performing keyword searches.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20wasn%27t%20there%20a%20text%20preview%20after%20i%20uploaded%20my%20document%3F'>\nWhy wasn&#8217;t there a text preview after I uploaded my document?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If no text could be detected from the document only a preview image will be shown.  This is also true for large documents with many pages, only a preview image of the document will be generated.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20does%20legoeso%20pdf%20manager%20store%20its%20pdf%20documents%3F'>\nWhere does Legoeso PDF Manager store its PDF documents?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Legoeso PDF Manager stores your PDF documents within the WordPress upload directory.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
