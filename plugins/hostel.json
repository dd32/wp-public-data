Each room supports multiple iCal URLs. You can get the iCal URL from your control panel at the sites that provide it. Most popular booking sites do provide you with iCal URL</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20have%20problems%20with%20receiving%20emails'>\nI have problems with receiving emails\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hostel just sends the emails to your WP installaiton so if emails are not delivered this is most likely a problem with your installation. We suggest installing a free plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Mail SMTP</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/\" rel=\"ugc\">Postman SMTP</a> to test and improve your emails delivery. Hostel will automatically send its emails through any SMTP plugin you have installed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
