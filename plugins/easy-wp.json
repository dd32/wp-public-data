Then click on &#8216;Simple view&#8217; to go back to Easy WP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I add and delete pages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Easy WP is a plugin for people who have very simple websites. We use it for our smaller clients.<br />\nAnd we don&#8217;t want them adding and deleting pages, because it completely screws up there menu&#8217;s and links.<br />\nBut we are planning an Easy WP settings page where this feature will be possible.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
