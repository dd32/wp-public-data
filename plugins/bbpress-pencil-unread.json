        "faq": "\n<h4>It doesn&#8217;t work / CSS styling is bad !</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Styling has been setup for the bbPress default theme.<br />\nIf it doesn&#8217;t work for you, please try to check/override our CSS styles (bbppu.css)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I filter topics to display only the unread or read ones ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just add the <strong>bbppu</strong> arg to your <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress queries</a>.  You can set it either to <em>read</em> or <em>unread</em>.<br />\nOf course, this works for the current logged user and will be skipped if the visitor is not logged.</p>\n<p>Example :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n$last_unread_topics_query_args = array(\n  'post_type'       =&gt; bbp_topic_post_type(), //or 'topic'\n  'posts_per_page'  =&gt; 5,\n  'bbppu'       =&gt; 'unread' //only unread ones\n);\n\n$last_unread_topics_query = new WP_Query( $last_unread_topics_query_args );\n?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><em>bbPress Pencil Unread</em> handles differently the way forums &amp; topics are set as read.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For <strong>topics</strong>, a post meta <em>bbppu_read_by</em> is attached to the topic each time a someone visits it; the meta value is the user ID.  When a new reply is added, all those metas are deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For <strong>forums</strong>, we compare the total count of topics with the total count of read topics for the current user.  If it does not match, the forum is considered as unread.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marking a forum (<em>Mark all as read</em>) adds an entry with the forum ID and timestamp in <em>bbppu_marked_forums</em> (usermeta).  When determining if a topic has been read, we check if the topic&#8217;s forum (or ancestors) has a mark more recent than the topic time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marking a forum will only set the topics from this forum as read.  If there is <strong>super sticky topics</strong> displayed and that they belong to other forums, they will not be marked as read.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use those functions outside of the plugin ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have a look at the file /bbppu-template.php, which contains functions you could need.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I see the plugin&#8217;s log ?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin will generate various notices and informations in the debug.log file, if <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">debugging is enabled</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
