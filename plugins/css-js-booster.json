If not append them by hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compatibility with other plugins</h4>\n<p>CSS-JS-Booster may in rare cases break some other plugins.<br />\nI noticed for example that plugins trying to calculate file-paths based on the src-attribute of the script-tag break.<br />\nSo you need to check yourself.</p>\n<p>If your site has many visitors, we suggest that you combine CSS-JS-Booster with WP-Super-Cache.</p>\n"
