        "faq": "\n<h4>What is Creative Commons?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Creative Commons licenses are several copyright licenses that allow the distribution of copyrighted works.<br />\nAdditional information can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.creativecommons.org/\" title=\"Creative Commons homepage\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Creative Common&#8217;s homepage</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What will be shown when searching for CC-tagged media?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When running a search for CC-tagged media, it will show the media <em>even if it is attached to a post that<br />\nis not published</em>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is CC license information being displayed only on new media?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You should run CC-Tag Batch Index (Tools-&gt;cc-tagger batch index) to tag media that was already in your<br />\nmedia library prior to installing and activating CC-Tagger.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why does my site &#8220;lock up&#8221; when I run CC-Tag Batch Index?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your site has most likely not actually &#8220;locked up.&#8221;  It takes a while for CC-Tag Batch Index to go through<br />\nall the media and apply the tags.  If you have a very large number of media, that time might be very long<br />\nindeed.  You can run CC-Tag Batch Index on a smaller set of media by entering starting and ending IDs,<br />\neffectively processing the media in smaller batches, resulting in a shorter-term load on your site.</p>\n<p>Note that running CC-Tag Batch Index should normally be a one-time process (when you first install and<br />\nactivate CC-Tagger).  After that, you can apply the CC information to each media item as it is uploaded.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I change the CC info for a range of attachments in the media library?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>CC-Tag Batch Index may be used to tag a range of media in the media library that is either not<br />\nyet tagged, or to change the existing tags in a range of attachment IDs.</p>\n<p>To tag all media in that range whether or not it is already tagged, you should check the &#8220;overwrite<br />\nexisting license data&#8221; option.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What new options are there for uploaded media?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When new media is uploaded, two additional fields are provided for selecting CC Usage Rights and CC<br />\nModification Rights. Select the desired setting for that media in the dropdown boxes.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are the options for CC-Tagger and where do I set them?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All the CC-Tagger initial options are set under the &#8216;Settings-&gt;Media&#8217; menu. There you will find options<br />\nfor</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jurisdiction of your license information</strong> &#8211; This allows you to set the CC jurisdiction of your media<br />\nso that it applies to only one country or region, or internationally.</li>\n<li><strong>Badge size</strong> &#8211; This sets the size of the CC &#8220;badge,&#8221; if any, displayed along with the media.</li>\n<li><strong>Display a text link next to the license</strong> &#8211; This determines whether or not a text link will be<br />\ndisplayed (either with or instead of the badge).</li>\n<li><strong>By Default allowed use of untagged media</strong> &#8211; This setting will be used for any uploaded media<br />\nset to &#8216;default.&#8217;</li>\n<li><strong>By Default allowed modification of untagged media</strong> &#8211; This setting will be used for any uploaded<br />\nmedia set to &#8216;default.&#8217;</li>\n<li><strong>Add search options to the search form</strong> &#8211; If set to Yes, it will allow your site visitors to search<br />\nfor CC-tagged media from the search form by providing options to search based on usage and/or modification<br />\nrights.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
