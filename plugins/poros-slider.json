Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upload your images, caption and other slideshow elements using the &#8216;Poros Slider&#8217; menu on the left.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use the vertical scroller, you must resize the thumbnails to 1/3 the size of the slide they correspond to before uploading them, or show may not display correctly.<br />\nTIP: for optimal performance, make sure your slide height is divisible by three (300px, 399px, etc.).  Vertical Scroller is optional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add [poros_show] to any page/post you wish for it to be displayed on.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>What is the best way to resize my images?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using whatever software you are comfortable with.  If you don&#8217;t have a preferred method yet, chances are uploading the image to wordpress, clicking edit, and choosing &#8216;scale&#8217; to resize is the best/most convenient method for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The scroller on the right has images that don&#8217;t fit the show!  What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure your thumbnails are EXACTLY 1/3 the size of the slides if you use the vertical scroller.  The only way to do this is to ensure the slide has a height divisible by three.  This functionality ensures you can resize your images to whatever quality you desire without me doing it straight in the html, which renders very poorly in some cases.  The vertical scroller is optional.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
