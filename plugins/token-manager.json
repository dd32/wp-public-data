        "description": "<p>The Token Manager allows web developers to program PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript into tokens that can be used throughout WordPress. Tokens can be placed into themes, templates, pages, widgets, etc. The code in the token is processed and then injected into the token name. It allows web developers to package their code into components for easy reuse and maintenance while speeding up development time and distribution. The tokens are also aware of WordPress and can utilize all the common libraries and database from within the token. This allows for unlimited possibilities with web page design, third party api, WordPress api, PHP frameworks, web 2.0, other WordPress plugins, etc. The tokens can even be used within other tokens for replacement of text, making HTML, CSS, JS, fully dynamic.</p>\n<h4>MultiSite</h4>\n<p>The Token Manager has been built to work with WordPress MultiSite as well as single blog installations. By activating it on the network, it will add the capabilities to control tokens across WordPress sites and blogs. It will also store all tokens in custom tables that are not attached to WordPress, allowing for easy upgrades, backup and version changes.</p>\n<h4>Token Management</h4>\n<p>The management of tokens is very simple, with built in ajax controls to allow assignment of tokens to individual and all pages. It also separates out frontpage assignment, giving you the freedom to control exactly what is seen on the frontpage. The manager also keeps track of who created and last updated the tokens in WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Token Parameters</h4>\n<p>The Token Manager now supports token parameters. You can specify a string or integer parameter by adding them behind the token name. You can then access the parameter from within the token code, allowing for unlimited code possibilities.</p>\n<h4>Error Handling</h4>\n<p>PHP and token errors are handled by the Token Manager and can be displayed by turning on custom settings in the manager. This gives developers the full control to know where errors are occurring within their token code. The error setting can also be turned off for live sites. This protects you from displaying error information on public sites. All errors that occur in the tokens, unless fatal, will not stop the webpage from being displayed. So feel free to code your ideas without worring about errors halting WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Token Manager (Standard) Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic Processes PHP, HTML, CSS, JS</li>\n<li>Token Management, Add, Edit, Delete</li>\n<li>Token Parameters</li>\n<li>Token Process Ordering</li>\n<li>Token Page Assignment</li>\n<li>Token Statistics</li>\n<li>Token Descriptions</li>\n<li>Custom Token Types</li>\n<li>Custom Searching and Recordsets</li>\n<li>Supports WordPress MultiSite</li>\n<li>WordPress aware Tokens</li>\n<li>Tokens within Tokens</li>\n<li>Error Handling on Webpage, PHP and Tokens</li>\n<li>Quick Help Question Marks</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Token Manager (Professional) Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All Standard Features</li>\n<li>Global Tokens</li>\n<li>External Scripts</li>\n<li>Code Versioning</li>\n<li>Token History</li>\n<li>Backup and Restore Systems</li>\n<li>Error Management Systems</li>\n<li>Online Technical Support</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Future Enhancements For Both</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Token Injection Menus</li>\n<li>Code Optimization</li>\n<li>Sorting Systems</li>\n<li>Better Searching</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any enhancement suggestions or want to report a bug, please visit http://www.codevendor.com/support/</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>My token is not appearing on my page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must assign your token from the Token Manager to page. Visit the tokens link. Click on the icon that look like pages. Search for a page. Assign that page or multiple pages to the token by clicking on the arrow buttons.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What are token types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Token types are created by you. They allow you to organize your code into categories of type. i.e text, control, template, thirdparty</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I assign the front page or all pages to my token?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit the tokens link. Click on the icon that looks like pages. In the search box type &#8216;frontpage&#8217; for frontpage or &#8216;all pages&#8217; for all pages. Then click on the arrow button to assign it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where does my token go if I delete it from the Token Manager?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No worries! It does not delete the token, it just deactivates it from the Token Manager. You would still be able to find it in the database tables. Future enhancements will probably include the functionality to retrieve it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does this plugin support WordPress MultiSite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When activated as a network plugin, you can assign unique tokens in each site and blog from their corresponding dashboards.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is there a history of action on the tokens?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, The Token Manager records an xml file in the table recording actions taken. Future versions of Token Manager will include history managing tools.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you support token code versioning systems?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!, but only in the professional versions. The standard free version uses versioning in the background, but doesnt give you the tools to manage it. If you would like to find out more about the professional version please visit http://www.codevendor.com/product/tokenmanager/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>If I write a PHP code incorrectly, will it halt my WordPress?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not unless it is a fatal error. Common errors in syntax will be displayed with an error message, if the Token Manager has the settings enabled. If the settings are not turned on, it will display a blank token.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I write dynamic HTML, CSS and JS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>PHP code is supported in all coding tabs. Also token codes are also supported in other tokens starting from top to bottom ordering of types.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do you support token backup?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes!, but it is a manual process in the standard version. You must edit each token and copy the contents from each code tab. Professional versions include a simple detailed backup system with versioning and restore tool. If you would like to find out more about the professional version please visit http://www.codevendor.com/product/tokenmanager/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I make suggestions or bug reports?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please visit the WordPress forums for this plugin or visit the main website at http://www.codevendor.com/support/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I optimize my tokens to load faster?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By directly assigning each token to a specific page and only using &#8216;all pages&#8217; sparingly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I keep my token PHP code from having naming convention and collision errors?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By using classes and unique naming, just like you would do writing any PHP code. Please refer to http://PHP.net/manual/en/language.oop5.PHP</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to write the beginning and ending script tags for PHP, CSS and JS?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, they are added for you. If you are injecting PHP code into another language, then yes, <code>&lt;?PHP ?&gt;</code> would be required.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Are PHP shortcodes supported &#8220;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, not at this time. You must use <code>&lt;?PHP ?&gt;</code> for your PHP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do all codes inline on the page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, for now each code inlines into the page, but future enhancements will allow you to make things external.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I add token parameters?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have a token named <code>example</code>, you could add parameters to extend it like so: {example, <code>Param1</code>, <code>Param2</code>, ParamInt3}.<br />\nThis will pass param1, param2 and param3 to example token. Token parameters accept strings and integers. You can use either double or single quotes around parameters. If you have quotes inside quotes you need to escape them. If you use <code>{</code> or <code>}</code> in your strings, make sure you encode them. To access the parameters within your token code use the following: $GLOBALS[&#8220;ARGS&#8221;][0]</p>\n</p>\n\n",
