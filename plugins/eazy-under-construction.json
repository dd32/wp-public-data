To be extra super-sure, try deleting the plugin files. Usually, though, the issue is that you&#8217;re seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again. If you have a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, make sure you clear that too!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I can&#8217;t see the under construction page!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As long as you&#8217;re logged in, you won&#8217;t be able to see it. That&#8217;s a feature! This way, while you&#8217;re logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What kind of HTML can I put in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You enter the contents of the entire HTML file.
