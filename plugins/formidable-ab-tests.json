It doesn&#8217;t make sense, however, to test more than two variations at a time.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many tests can I run?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Currently you can only run one test at a time. It&#8217;s on the drawing board to add the ability to run multiple tests concurrently.</p>\n<p>There is an option to clear test data on the admin page so you can start a new test.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
