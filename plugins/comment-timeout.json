        "description": "<p>This plugin extends the comment closing functionality in WordPress to allow<br />\nyou to extend the discussion time when older posts have recent comments<br />\naccepted, or to override the comment closing time on a post by post basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: PHP 4 is no longer supported.</strong> As of version 2.1, Comment Timeout requires PHP 5.2 or later.<br />\nIf you are still using PHP 4, you should use Comment Timeout 2.0.1.</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>You can change various settings globally on the &#8220;Comment Timeout&#8221; page under the<br />\n&#8220;Options&#8221; tab on the WordPress dashboard. Most of the options are fairly<br />\nself-explanatory.</p>\n<p>You can also change options on a per-post basis by looking for the<br />\n&#8220;Comment Timeout&#8221; section in the sidebar of the post or page editor.</p>\n<h3>Template tags</h3>\n<p>Comment Timeout 2.1 introduces two new functions that you can use in your theme:</p>\n<pre><code>get_comment_timeout()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Returns the UTC time, as a Unix timestamp, when comments will be closed for the current post.</p>\n<pre><code>the_comment_timeout($relative, $dateformat, $before, $after, $moderated)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Formats and displays the date and time after which comments will no longer be<br />\naccepted on this post. Parameters are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$relative</strong>: Set this to <code>true</code> if you want to display the date in terms of the time remaining<br />\n(for instance &#8220;in 3 weeks&#8221;). Set it to <code>false</code> to display it as an absolute date.</li>\n<li><strong>$dateformat</strong>: The format in which the date should be displayed, as used by the PHP<br />\ndate() function. If you set this to <code>false</code>, it will use the date format that you have configured<br />\nglobally for your WordPress installation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>$relative</code> is set to <code>true</code>, this parameter is ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>$before</strong>: The HTML to insert before the date that comments will be closed.</li>\n<li><strong>$after</strong>: The HTML to insert after the date that comments will be closed.</li>\n<li><strong>$moderated</strong>: The HTML to display when late comments are being sent to the moderation queue<br />\nrather than being rejected outright.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Development and reporting bugs</h3>\n<p>When reporting bugs, please provide me with the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which version of Comment Timeout you are using;</li>\n<li>Which version of WordPress you are using;</li>\n<li>The URL of your blog;</li>\n<li>Which platform (Windows/IIS/PHP or Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) your server<br />\nis running, and which versions of Apache and PHP you are using, if you<br />\nknow them;</li>\n<li>The steps that need to be taken to reproduce the bug.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you wish to get hold of the latest development version, or to contribute<br />\nbug fixes or new features, you can clone the project on GitHub:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:jammycakes/comment-timeout.git&lt;h3&gt;Redistribution&lt;/h3&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Copyright (c) 2007-2013 James McKay<br />\nhttp://jamesmckay.net/</p>\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br />\nof this software and associated documentation files (the &#8220;Software&#8221;), to deal<br />\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br />\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell<br />\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is<br />\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in<br />\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p>\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br />\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br />\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
