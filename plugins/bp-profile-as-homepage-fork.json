        "faq": "\n<h4>How is this plugin best used?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It is suggested that you should have a static HOMEPAGE for visitors which allows registration. Once a user has logged in BuddyPress, (s)he will be redirected to the BP Profile. While being logged in the user is redirected to the BP Profile when clicking Homepage links or the logo of the website. This provides the user with easy access to the BP Profile.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the plugin compatible with earlier version og WP and BP</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin is very likely to be compatible with earlier versions of WordPress and BuddyPress, at least to WP 3.2 and BP 1.5. However, backwards compatibility has not been tested.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Possible conflicts with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin may conflict with other redirection plugins. There are no known plugin conflicts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is this plugin ready for translation?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
