        "description": "<p><strong>WooCommerce Attribute Stock</strong> gives your stock superpowers by allowing you to share inventories between multiple products/variations, or deduct different amounts of stock for each purchase of a product, variation, or attribute.</p>\n<p>Easily track and manage shared stock, variable quantities, product addons, combo packs, measurements, components, and much more!</p>\n<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è<br />\nThis is a free LITE version for testing and limited use. Most importantly, it does not affect frontend product stock or prevent over-purchasing. It can however be used to track internal attribute stock. For all features listed below, you can purchase the <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-attribute-stock/25796765\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">full version here</a>.</strong></p>\n<h4>What problem does Attribute Stock solve?</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used WooCommerce for a little while, you know its stock capabilities are quite limited. Each product or product variation can have a stock quantity and that&#8217;s about it. Essentially your products are your stock items.</p>\n<p>This works fine when you&#8217;re selling simple products, but as soon as you need to do things like share stock between multiple products, or deduct variable amounts of stock quantities per sale, you&#8217;re out of luck.</p>\n<h4>How does Attribute Stock solve this?</h4>\n<p>Attribute Stock extends WooCommerce&#8217;s stock functionality by adding a few essential features like <a href=\"https://wcas-docs.mewz.dev/attribute-stock\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">stock items</a> that are separate from your product listings, allowing them to be used across multiple products. And <a href=\"https://wcas-docs.mewz.dev/stock-multipliers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">stock multipliers</a> that let you specify how much stock to deduct for each purchase of a product, variation, attribute term, or stock item.</p>\n<p>With these tools at your disposal you can create all kinds of interesting and bespoke stock setups to suit your range of products, no matter how complex they are.</p>\n<h3>‚ú® Plugin Features</h3>\n<p><strong>Attribute-based Stock</strong><br />\nManage stock at the attribute level. Share stock between all products/variations with one or more attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Stock</strong><br />\nDeduct different quantities of product stock or attribute stock per sale with stock multipliers. Useful for measurements, weights, packs, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Stock Management</strong><br />\nAdmin dashboard for easy management of attribute stock items. Set SKUs, stock images, product filters, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Customization</strong><br />\nExtensive flexibility to set up virtually any type of stock configuration using match rules, product filters, component stock, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Any&#8221; Variations</strong><br />\nUse simple variations for your products. Stock will be accurately tracked without the need to specify every combination of attribute term options.</p>\n<p><strong>CSV Import/Export</strong><br />\nInstantly export your attribute stock to CSV. Add or update stock in your favorite spreadsheet editor, then import your changes with a single click.</p>\n<p><strong>REST API &amp; Webhooks</strong><br />\nManage your attribute stock from external software with our fully integrated WooCommerce REST API endpoint and webhook topics.</p>\n<p><strong>Highly Compatible</strong><br />\nPlays well with most plugins, such as Variation Swatches, POS systems, Subscriptions, Product Bundles, Waitlists, Cart Stock Reducer, WP-Lister, WPML, Polylang, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Friendly</strong><br />\nAlmost anything that can&#8217;t already be configured can be added or changed with powerful actions and filters.</p>\n<p>&#042; <em>Please note that WordPress Multisite and multi-store synchronization is not currently supported or planned.</em></p>\n<h3>üß© Usage Examples</h3>\n<h4>Example #1 ‚Äì Variable Stock (<a href=\"https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/post.php?post=69&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a>)</h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you sell tea in packs of different weights. You can simply set your total tea stock at the product level and specify a <strong>stock multiplier</strong> on each product variation. The respective amount will be deducted from your total stock for each purchase. If you need to share variable stock across more than one product listing, you can use <strong>attribute stock items</strong> instead.</p>\n<h4>Example #2 ‚Äì Multiple Attributes (<a href=\"https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/post.php?post=127&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a>)</h4>\n<p>Often your stock will have more than one attribute, such as t-shirts with different <strong>sizes</strong> and <strong>colors</strong>. In this case it&#8217;s trivial to create <strong>attribute stock items</strong> with rules to match any combination of attributes across any number of products.</p>\n<h4>Example #3 ‚Äì Product Bundles (<a href=\"https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/post.php?post=369&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a>)</h4>\n<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll want to sell several <strong>individual products</strong> as well as a <strong>bundle</strong> of these products for a discount. Since attributes can be added to products as variation or non-variation attributes, you can easily create stock items that are shared between all types of products.</p>\n<h4>Example #4 ‚Äì Component Stock (<a href=\"https://wcas-demo.mewz.dev/wp-admin/edit.php?s=candle&amp;post_type=attribute_stock\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Demo</a>)</h4>\n<p>In some cases you might need to track stock items made from other stock items. For example, let&#8217;s say you design and sell hand-painted candles. By setting your plain candle stock as a component of your painted candle stock, you can track and sell each separately while allowing your painted candles to use the additional stock quantity of your plain candles.</p>\n<p>Component stock is a powerful feature that can be used for many other advanced stock requirements such as batches and even stock from multiple suppliers.
