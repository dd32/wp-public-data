Settings screen may be included in the future, depending on the feedback from the users!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20actively%20maintained%3F'>\nIs this plugin actively maintained?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin is actively maintained to make sure that the core <a href=\"http://mobiledetect.net/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mobile Detect PHP library</a> is updated as and when there is an update in it. Otherwise, this plugin is in maintenance-only mode. No new features are planned in the near future.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20add%20feature%20%22x%22%3F'>\nCan you add feature &#8220;x&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any new feature is unlikely to be added to this plugin. This plugin was created to patch the built-in WordPress function <code>wp_is_mobile()</code> to incorporate a missing feature, functionality or a bug. I expect that WordPress core would fix it at some point in the future. When it does include a fix, this plugin would be retired. When this plugin retires, I don&#8217;t want anyone to miss the feature/s that this plugin may have. So, I encourage everyone to create a standalone plugin or an add-on plugin, if a feature is missing from this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
