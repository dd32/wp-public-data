However, if you want a distinctive search form (or forms!) to use as a widget, this allows you to enter it in using the &#8220;searchform-identifier.php&#8221; format that you can use to distinguish other templates elsewhere in your theme.

In the &#8220;Template&#8221; field of the widget settings, enter only &#8220;widget&#8221;, and that searchform file will be called in your widget automagically.</p>\n<p>Note: Actually coding the search form is up to you.
