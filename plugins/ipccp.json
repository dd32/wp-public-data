        "installation": "<h4>Requirements</h4>\n<p>As mentioned above the expected requirement is an SQL database with IPs. Most statistics plug-ins will keep track of that (f.e. <a href=\"http://andersdrengen.dk/projects\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Counterize</a>). On a technical level I think PHP5 should do the trick. IPCCP is not using any WordPress specific calls and should work with any version (tested up to 2.3.2).</p>\n<p><strong>[Note:]</strong> Running IPCCP on a large data set might require some calculation time, which could exceed the maximum PHP execution time (usually 30sec). Therefore IPCCP can try to extend this execution time, which <strong>will require the server to not run in PHP safemode</strong>. Check with you friendly system administer if you don&#8217;t have the appropriate access level. It took more than 5 minutes to generate the picture above (admittedly on my ancient webserver &#8211; but you get the point).</p>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>Setup itself is the usual 1-2-3 of downloading, expanding into <code>/wordpress/wp-content/plugins</code> and activating. Check the IPCCP options panel in the admin section and set those values to your liking. You&#8217;ll see a first preview there. Provided are both the direct function call (for sidebar&#8217;s, footer and such) <code>&lt;?php if(function_exists(ipccp)) ipccp(); ?&gt;</code> and the token word access <code>[IPCCP]</code> for posts or pages. You might want to check MaxMinds website once in a while, as they offer monthly updates to their database. Simply download the GeoLiteCity databases and drop them into the GeoIP folder within the IPCCP plug-in folder.</p>\n<p><strong>[Note:]</strong> Make sure the webserver has write permissions on those files:<br />\n       /wordpress/wp-content/plugins/ipccp/images/ipccp_out&#042;</p>\n<p><strong>[Note:]</strong> You could also add</p>\n<p>anywhere in your template to activate the reclustering. Use carefully though!</p>\n",
        "faq": "<p>Doesn&#8217;t seem precise, or what? =<br />\nActually what we are looking for is accuracy. IPCCP is (of course) 100% precise (having no stochastic parts at all). Accuracy is a different matter. The longitude / latitude values are often more of an estimate. But MaxMind promises monthly updates, so keep checking their website and grab the current databases (or use the links above). But to be honest, for this matter I think it&#8217;s all good enough. It&#8217;s all about the impression if you ask me.</p>\n\n<h4>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected &#8216;)&#8217;, expecting &#8216;(&#8216; in [..]/ipccp/ipccp.php on line XYZ</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most likely you are not running PHP5, which is required for the GeoIP API to work. You need to upgrade before using IPCCP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I still want more accuracy?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can go ahead and buy their commercial Databases which are currently $420 (base price) + $102 (per monthly update) for the set of City and Country database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s the legend to the cluster map?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll add a legend as we go along. For now just this quick remark: you see four numbers at the bottom left. For the picture above they are:<br />\n* 2881492 IP-entries numbers found<br />\n* 2879499 IP-entries numbers found minus the Satellite Operators<br />\n* 45787 unique IP numbers<br />\n* 5696 unique places<br />\n* 727 unique clusters drawn</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is there an option to disable the image maps?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using the image maps will probably drastically increase the length of the HTML-code (especially if you have some million entries from all over the place). Just look at the source of this page&#8230; Some people might wish for the image only and don&#8217;t care for the additional information. Hence the option.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What was the issue with using the ipccp_out_smal.jpg picture as a preview?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>IPCCP is generating three pictures. The native 2000*1000px <code>ipccp_out.jpg</code>, the user specified large version <code>ipccp_out_big.jpg</code> and the user specified small version <code>ipccp_out_smal.jpg</code>. The scaling of the later two is done by the PHP GD library, which isn&#8217;t near up to standards if you ask me. Just compare the scaled version with the scaling done by the browser (which on OSX is done by the far superior QT). Hence I recommend leaving the small GD version be and simply use the big version. Given that most people will look at the zoomed version anyway that actually saves the download of two images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you have rights to any maps and are willing to donate them for the project, that would be great. I&#8217;ll add a feature where the user could choose his/her map from a given available set. The same holds if you have the rights to a more detailed database! Donate them and earn eternal gratitude from millions of WordPress Users.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
