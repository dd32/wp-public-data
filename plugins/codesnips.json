No longer require the use of a cloud service to host your snippets for you when you can host them right on your own WordPress site! codeSnips allows you to quickly add and embed code snippets to your website with syntax highlighting available for 124 languages! codeSnips uses custom post types where you create a new snippet post, select the programming language, enter the code snippet and publish the post. You then can either access the snippet post directly for sharing, or embed it into another post using the shortcode.</p>\n<p>View all of your snippets in an archived list, or even on the snippet page itself &#8211; without embedding into a new post. You can access all your snippets using a customizable pretty URL permalink. For example: http://yoursite.com/snippets</p>\n<p>You can also view the raw plain text snippet directly, which is ideal for copy &amp; pasting.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quickly add new snippets with syntax highlighting available in 124 programming languages. </li>\n<li>Plain text snippets are supported.</li>\n<li>Syntax highlighting changes dynamically if you select a new code language from the dropdown while editing.</li>\n<li>Embed the snippets using a shortcode that has many options.</li>\n<li>You can embed multiple snippets per post.</li>\n<li>Access a snippet post directly via URL.</li>\n<li>Access a plain text raw view of the snippet directly via URL.

Once you&#8217;ve created your snippet, you need to know the snippet ID. Easiest way is to go back to the &#8220;All Snippets&#8221; page in the Admin Dashboard. Then just copy and paste the shortcode that&#8217;s next to your post. For example, you would copy <code>[snippet id=5]</code> to your post, and that&#8217;s it!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I have private or password protected snippets?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can! Just set the status of the post when you create your snippet. An important item to understand is that if your snippet is password protected or private, then it will not show when you use the shortcode. The snippet will also not be available in the <code>view raw</code> mode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to hide (or show) the snippet meta bar?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The snippet meta bar is enabled by default. The meta bar contains the filename and the code language. If you want to disable the snippet bar globally, you can do so in the codeSnips Settings page. Likewise, if you want to disable it for just a single snippet embed at a time, you can add <code>meta=\"false\"</code> to your shortcode. For example, <code>[snippet id=\"15\" meta=\"false\"]</code> would show the snippet ID 15 with the description but no meta bar.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What if I want to show the snippet description?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The descriptions are disabled by default. To enable them, you must type in a description in the snippet edit page, then check the checkbox for it to display on the single snippet post. To add a description for an embedded post, just add <code>desc=\"true\"</code> to your shortcode. For example, <code>[snippet id=20 desc=\"true\"]</code> would show the snippet ID 20 and it&#8217;s description if it had one.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the look of the snippet box?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Just edit the frontend.css file located under CSS folder. You can remove the border, or even change the way the gutter and everything looks (without changing the built-in editor Themes)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How many options are available using the shortcode?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can see all the documented options under the codeSnips &gt; Settings menu, then select the Usage tab.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I help you translate the plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes please! As of 1.1 the POT file is available. If you translate it, let me know and I&#8217;ll include it in a maintenenace release!</p>\n</p>\n\n",
