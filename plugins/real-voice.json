        "description": "<p>Real Voice is a text-to-speech plugin for WordPress that supports the Web Speech API, Google Text-to-Speech AI, and Azure Text to speech.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://daext.com/real-voice/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pro version of Real Voice</a> with additional features is now available on our website. This upgraded edition includes more text-to-speech converters (other integrations for Amazon Polly and ElevenLabs are available), a dashboard to monitor all the API requests to the cloud services, options to generate the audio files automatically, and more.</p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<h4>Automatically Add the Audio Player</h4>\n<p>The plugin automatically adds an audio player at the beginning of the articles. Note that from the plugin options, you can configure post types on which the audio player should be displayed.</p>\n<h4>Manually Generate the Audio Files</h4>\n<p>We have included a dedicated post sidebar section where you can create a new audio version of the post, update the existing audio version, or delete the audio data.</p>\n<p>The website administrator, the editor, or other authorized users can at any time access to this area.</p>\n<h4>Monitor the Presence and State of the Audio Files</h4>\n<p>The plugin adds a new column named &#8220;Audio File&#8221; to the posts menu (and to the admin menu of all the other enabled post types). Here, you can verify if a specific post has its related audio version and if this version is up to date with the post.</p>\n<h4>Customizable HTML Audio Player</h4>\n<p>The plugin generates a custom audio player built with HTML and the browser API. You can customize the style of the player (color, typography, shadows, etc.) using the plugin options.</p>\n<h4>Responsive Audio Player</h4>\n<p>The audio player is responsive, and you can specify the breakpoint used to switch from the desktop to the mobile version with a dedicated option.</p>\n<h4>Supports Plain Text and SSML</h4>\n<p>You can generate the audio version of an article from plain text or SSML.</p>\n<p>In the case of SSML, the supported tags vary depending on the selected text-to-speech converter.</p>\n<h4>Add Additional Text Before or After the Player</h4>\n<p>Use the dedicated options to configure the message displayed before (or after) the player. You can set messages like &#8220;Listen to this article&#8221;, &#8220;This article is also available in an audio format&#8221;, etc.</p>\n<h4>Optionally Read the Post Title</h4>\n<p>Do you want to use the post title as the first synthesized sentence? Then, use the dedicated settings option to apply this behavior.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Base</h3>\n<p>Get started with the plugin or explore the advanced features with the documentation available in the <a href=\"https://daext.com/kb-category/real-voice/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Knowledge Base</a>.</p>\n<h3>This plugin can optionally use paid third-party services</h3>\n<p>This plugin can optionally use third-party services to perform the text-to-speech conversion. If you configure one of these services and perform a text-to-speech conversion using the tools provided by the plugin, the third-party service will charge you according to their terms.</p>\n<h4>When the third-party service &#8220;Text-to-Speech AI&#8221; from Google Cloud is enabled</h4>\n<p>The plugin will use the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Text-to-Speech AI from Google Cloud</a> third-party service to perform the text-to-speech conversion when both these conditions are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Cloud Text-to-Speech AI</strong> is selected with the <strong>Text-to-speech Converter</strong> option available in the <strong>Text-to-Speech -&gt; General</strong> section of the plugin.</li>\n<li>A valid key is provided in the <strong>Google Cloud Secret Access Key</strong> option available in the <strong>Text-to-Speech -&gt; Google Cloud Text-to-Speech AI</strong> section of the plugin options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Terms of Service of the Google Cloud Platform are available in the link below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/terms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://cloud.google.com/terms</a></p>\n<h4>When the third-party service &#8220;Text to speech&#8221; from Microsoft Azure is enabled</h4>\n<p>The plugin will use the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/text-to-speech\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Text to speech from Microsoft Azure</a> third-party service to perform the text-to-speech conversion when both these conditions are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Azure Text to Speech (Cloud service)</strong> is selected with the <strong>Text-to-speech Converter</strong> option available in the <strong>Text-to-Speech -&gt; General</strong> section of the plugin.</li>\n<li>A valid key is provided in the <strong>Azure Speech Resource Key</strong> option available in the <strong>Text-to-Speech -&gt; Azure Text-to-speech</strong> of the plugin options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Legal information for Text to speech by Microsoft Azure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/</a></p>\n<h4>When the plugin performs a text-to-speech conversion</h4>\n<p>In the contexts described below, the plugin performs a text-to-speech conversion.

For <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"ugc\">Classic Editor</a> users, the text-to-speech conversions are performed when you click the <strong>Generate file</strong> button in the <strong>Audio File</strong> meta box.</p>\n<h4>Accessing the plugin options</h4>\n<p>You can access the plugin options anytime from the <strong>Real Voice</strong> menu on your WordPress dashboard.
