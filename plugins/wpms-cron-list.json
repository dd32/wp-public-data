This is usually quite simple, just disable wp-cron and set up a job that pings your sites wp-cron.php file on a regular interval. The problem comes when you have a multisite installation and need to ping alot of different sites wp-cron.php file.

The file will be found at: mydomain.com/wp-content/uploads/wpms_cron_list.txt</p>\n<h4>How do I use the file created in a cronjob?</h4>\n<p>See this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/alfreddatakillen/33642669507bb3eeab5f\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gist</a> for an example of how to use the file created by this plugin to ping all wp-cron.php files in a network.</p>\n<h4>Does it work on a non-multisite installation?</h4>\n<p>Nope. Nothing will happen if you activate it on a non-multisite installation.</p>\n<h4>Are there any settings?</h4>\n<p>Nope, there aren&#8217;t any settings. Once you activate the plugin it creates the file with all url&#8217;s. If you deactivate it the file get&#8217;s deleted. Everytime you change the status of or create/delete a site in your network the file is updated.</p>\n<h4>Where do I report bugs, contribute with code fixes etc..?</h4>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://github.com/klandestino/wpms-cron-list\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub</a></p>\n",
