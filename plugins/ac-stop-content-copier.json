        "faq": "\n<h4>Setting fast browse interval</h4>\n<p>\n<p>What is fast browse interval? : Basically this is a measure to detect a user browsing your website TOO QUICKLY.<br />\nWHY: A real user would take 2-3 seconds to go to a next page of your site while a robot can browse even 10-100-etc pages in a second.</p>\n<p>You can choose the allowed number of seconds before a new page can be requested (browsed) by setting fast browse interval : Just go to Stop Copier page in wp-admin panel and enter an interval of seconds to allow users browse from page to page. We recommend using a 2 or 3 second.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Changing CAPTCHA REQUEST page title</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This page is automatically created when the plugin is installed containg a shortcode called [acbd_show_captcha]</p>\n<p>When the plugin is detecting a suspicious visitor it will redirect to a CAPTCHA COMPLETION page requesting for a code to be entered by visitor to confirm he is a real human guest and not a content scraper.</p>\n<p>Changing CAPTCHA Request Page title is the same as you would change any other wordpress page title: go to wp-admin-&gt;pages and find the page called WP Stop Content Copier Captcha.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Log page</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To keep you updated with what&#8217;s happening in the background, WP STOP CONTENT Copier is logging everything so you can analyze: IP addresses (visitors) asked for CAPTCHA and the result: (COMPLETED CAPTCHA OR FAILED).</p>\n<p>Find this log into AC Stop Content Copier page in wp-admin panel.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
