        "faq": "\n<h4>Is it compatible with Advanced Custom Fields PRO version?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. A PRO version of <code>Quick and Easy Post creation for ACF Relationship Fields</code> plugin, compatible with ACF PRO, <a href=\"https://codecanyon.net/item/quick-and-easy-post-creation-for-acf-relationship-fields-pro/17201274\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">can be purchased here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can we make the lightbox wider?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately not for the moment. This will be a possible enhancement when <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27473\" title=\"See the bug ticket\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this bug</a> will be fixed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this add-on handle bidirectional relationships?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Bidirectional relationships are out of the scope of this add-on. However, <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/bidirectional-relationships/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the ACF documentation</a> gives a great example to achieve this.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it possible to pre-populate a child field depending on the parent from where itâ€™s been created?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it is. This add-on loads the child post form in an iframe with some additional URL params:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>acf_rc_from_content_type: the post type of your parent post.</li>\n<li>acf_rc_from_content_ID: the ID of your parent post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can use these URL params to pre-populate an ACF field on your child post. Example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\nadd_filter('acf/load_field/name=${NAME_OF_YOUR_ACF_FIELD}', 'populate_acf_field' );\nfunction populate_acf_field( $field ) {\n    if( !empty( $_REQUEST['acf_rc_from_content_type'] ) &amp;&amp; $_REQUEST['acf_rc_from_content_type'] == '${YOUR_PARENT_CONTENT_TYPE}' &amp;&amp; !empty( $_REQUEST['acf_rc_from_content_ID'] ) ) {\n        $field['value'] = 'whatever you want';\n    }\n    return $field;\n}\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n\n",
