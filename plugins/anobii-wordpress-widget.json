Make sure that the path of the main php file is <strong>wp-content/plugins/anobii-wordpress-widget/aNobii.php</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>And now?</h4>\n<p>You have to configure the plugin following the instructions at the page &#8220;<em>Options-&gt;aNobii Plugin</em>&#8220;.</p>\n",

It doesn&#8217;t work!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Probably, you have specified a &#8220;customized&#8221; url in the preferences, such as <a href=\"http://www.anobii.com/people/jhack\" title=\"My Anobii Profile\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.anobii.com/people/jhack</a>: it will never work! You must retrieve your user-id from the Feed RSS url near to the bottom of your aNobii&#8217;s Home Profile.</p>\n<p>Therefore the url you must provide must be something like <a href=\"http://www.anobii.com/people/010c51b082b89840a7\" title=\"My Anobii Profile\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://www.anobii.com/people/010c51b082b89840a7</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The URL is correct now, but I can&#8217;t see any cover</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check if the file &#8220;proxy.php&#8221; (and the directories which contain it) have the correct permissions. It depends on your host, so I can&#8217;t say what are the best configurations. For me, 755 for the directories and 644 for &#8220;proxy.php&#8221;, but on different hosts the latter one needs 755.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What the hell?! It still doesn&#8217;t work!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what could be your problem. Please write a topic and I&#8217;ll try to understand and correct your problem.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
