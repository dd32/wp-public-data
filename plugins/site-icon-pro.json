By default the Site Icon functionality<br />\nautogenerates and uses the same icon for each platform. Different platforms have different recommend styles, so if you want greater control over which Site Icon is used on each, this is the plugin for you!</p>\n<p>Site Icon Pro allows you to specify the exact HTML meta and link tags that are used to display site icons so you get complete control. If you want an icon with a transparent background in browsers, but a white background on iOS, you can do it with this! Unlike editing a theme directly, your changes won&#8217;t be lost if you upgrade or switch themes.</p>\n<p>Note that this is a plugin for advanced users, if you aren&#8217;t comfortable editing HTML please stick to the built in Site Icon functionality (in WordPress 4.3+).</p>\n<h4>Icon Formats</h4>\n<p>Although there are various automated tools that will resize an image to every favion resolution, for full control you should generate each icon seperately. Each platform has different guidelines for how favicons should look and how they behave. Additionality automated tools will resize your images rather poorly &#8211; you will be able to generate much better quality favicons by resizing them yourself from a vector image.</p>\n<p>We recommend you include the following icons at the very least:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ICO &#8211; 16x16px low resolution icon on a transparent background (some tools let you combine multiple resolutions in a single file, in that case also add a 32x32px version)</li>\n<li>PNG &#8211; 32x32px retina icon on a transparent background</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin includes further documentation on icon formats and sizes, including those for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple iOS (iPad and iPhone)</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>Windows Metro Tiles (Windows 8.1+ and Windows Phone 8.1+)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Contributing</h4>\n<p>If you would like to contribute to this plugin, please visit our <a href=\"https://github.com/BlissfulPlugins/site-icon-pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n",
