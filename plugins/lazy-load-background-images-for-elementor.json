This plugin doesn’t have any effect whatsoever on pages not built with Elementor.</li>\n<li>WayPoints JS library – this library is currently bundled and loading on Elementor pages. Future versions of this plugin may include the WayPoints JS library so it will not be required.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I know if this is working?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your pages start loading faster, it&#8217;s probably working. That&#8217;s the non-technical version.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer and know how to use Google Chome Developer Console, read on &#8230;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you&#8217;re using a caching plugin, clear it.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re using a CDN such as Cloudflare, clear the CDN cache.</li>\n<li>Open your site in an incognito tab in Google Chrome.</li>\n<li>Open the Developer Console.</li>\n<li>Go to the Network tab.</li>\n<li>Tick the option to disable cache.</li>\n<li>Click the <code>Img</code> sub-tab.</li>\n<li>Reload the page.</li>\n<li>As you scroll down, ensure that the background images of sections and columns load on the fly as you approach them.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>Why isn&#8217;t this plugin doing anything?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin isn&#8217;t lazy-loading your background images, then one of the following must be true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <strong>Lazy Load Elementor Background Images</strong> plugin isn’t active – activate it.</li>\n<li>Elementor isn’t installed/activated – install and activate it.</li>\n<li>the page you’re checking is not an Elementor page – this plugin ONLY works on section/column backgrounds designed with Elementor.</li>\n<li>the section/column with a background is also animated (motion effects) … I can’t lazyload them because they are hidden until they are scrolled into view.</li>\n<li>Waypoints JS library is not loaded … we can look at this together and figure out why.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If none of the issues above applied to your situation, just leave the plugin activated, open a support ticket (support link forthcoming) and we’ll troubleshoot it. DO NOT leave a crappy review on the plugin, please. I’m providing it for free and support it for free. I will do my best to make it work in all situations but there are no guarantees.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where are the settings?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There is no admin screen added by this plugin. You just activate it and it works.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>This plugin killed my site!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I believe it. It’s a very new plugin that hasn’t been widely tested. Rather than give it a crappy rating, please use the support forum so we can figure out what happened. (I am waiting for WordPress.org to approve my plugin so I can link to the support forum)</p>\n<p>In the meantime, to get your site back, get into your site’s files via cPanel File Manager through your hosting platform or via FTP, go into the <code>wp-content/plugins/</code> folder, and delete the <code>lazy-load-background-images-for-elementor</code> folder – that should immediately bring your site back to life.</p>\n<p>On newer versions of WordPress, you may also use the recovery link that gets emailed to you when your site has a critical error.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I’m not seeing huge performance increases &#8230;</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember – this plugin is not a lazy loader for all images on the page. It only affects background images applied to sections or columns. Use a plugin like WP Rocket to apply lazy-loading to all other image resources.</li>\n<li>Background images which are visible (or close to visible) when the page loads are loaded immediately.</li>\n<li>Your background images may not really be impacting the load time on your site (In other words, maybe your background images are highly optimized and small in size). A 2K JPG lazy-loaded is not going to improve your page speed much. A 500K JPG background will.</li>\n<li>Your web server may simply be slow. Or there are other areas of optimization that need to be addressed.
