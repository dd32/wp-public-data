You can also <strong>import your existing codes</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Build your own stolen serial database:</strong> Support your customer and yourself to protect stolen products to be sold to others. Mark reported stolen products as stolen and let others check the serials.</p>\n<p><strong>How can you setup the serial code generator?</strong><br />\nYou can enter your codes within the WP admin area in the serial code section (a new menu point in the wordpress amdin area).<br />\nYou can add your own codes manually using the serial code generator or import existing codes.<br />\nThe codes can also be generated by the plugin. The serial code generator can create a bulk of serials or numbers as codes.<br />\nAnd you are also able to add your own codes by just entering them to the generated codes below the serial code generator.<br />\nIf needed you can assign the codes to a list. The list (code list) helps you to organize the codes. The code list can be assigned to a WooCommerce product, if you want to add a serial code to each sold product.<br />\nCreate one or more code lists to use the WooCommerce functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>How the serial code generator works</strong><br />\nYou define your look and feel for your codes. The generated codes will be unique. After you are satisfied with the generated codes, you can start the code adding step.<br />\nThe code adding step will check if the code is unique on the server before adding it.<br />\nIf the code (serial number/ticket number) exists already on the server, it will not be added.</p>\n<h4>The generator provides a lot of features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code prefix &#8211; you can enter a fixed prefix to each code</li>\n<li>Length of code</li>\n<li>Only letters</li>\n<li>Uppercase, Lowercase or both</li>\n<li>Exclusion of letters that are easy to missread (i,l,o,q,p)</li>\n<li>Delimiter possible: [None, -, :, SPACE] &#8211; you decide after how many letters within the code</li>\n<li>CVV code generation (only numbers)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit purchase of WooCommerce products to people with a specific code (restriction feature)</li>\n<li>Store WooCommerce orderid, itemid and productid to a serial code that was generated or used for a product sale</li>\n<li>You can now set the serial code format for all WooCommerce product that are using a serial code</li>\n<li>You can now set the serial code format directly on the WooCommerce product detail page if needed</li>\n<li>Use your serials to restrict purchases to allow a purchase of this product only if the buyer has a code for it (purchase allowance code)</li>\n<li>Add your own messages for the serial code validation form for your customers</li>\n<li>Add your own message for the &#8220;product stolen&#8221; validation message</li>\n<li>Disable the validation form for not logged in wordpress user</li>\n<li>User can register to a code (with wordpress user id if needed) after the code is checked &#8211; this makes your code one-time usable</li>\n<li>Display registered user information of a code during the validation if you need this</li>\n<li>One time check is possible (with wordpress user id if needed) &#8211; the code will be marked as used after the check</li>\n<li>One time check can have a maximum check amount based on code list or based on the global setting</li>\n<li>Several checks allowed &#8211; the code will be marked as used after X confirmed checks</li>\n<li>The user can be forwared (redirected) to an URL after the code was checked &#8211; to show more details</li>\n<li>Webhooks &#8211; you can inform other systems about code validation steps by entering for serveral serial code status during the validation check</li>\n<li>Display assigned serial codes to your user with a shortcode [sngmbhSerialcodesValidator_code]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Premium Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Codes (the basic allows you 500 serial codes)</li>\n<li>Unlimited Code Lists</li>\n<li>Save IP address of user using the code validation check on your page</li>\n<li>De- and re-activate codes</li>\n<li>Block IPs after x retries within 60 minutes &#8211; prevent brute force</li>\n<li>One time usage overuled by code list setting</li>\n<li>Enter expiration date for codes</li>\n<li>Enter expiration date for code lists (code overrule list expiration date)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Try it out first, before you go Premium. <a href=\"https://vollstart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;Here you can find the premium plugin&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<h3>Build your own Stolen products database</h3>\n<p>You can set the status of a serial code to be marked as stolen. This way you can offer your customers a way to report a stolen product. Other buyers of used products can validate the code on your website and will be notified with a &#8220;Product is stolen&#8221; warning.<br />\nThis could increase sales and help reducing theft of your products.<br />\nThe check behaviour will be like &#8220;inactive serial codes&#8221; but with the stolen message. You can change the stolen message within the options area of the serial code admin.</p>\n<h3>Protection with CVV</h3>\n<p>You can set a code verification value (CVV) to protect your serial code. This allows you to print your serial code on the visible side of your product and print the CVV number on the open visible part of your packaging of your products. The validation check will ask the user to enter both for a valid check.<br />\nThat way you increase the security of your serial codes and prevent stealing the serial code (If you are able hide the CVV on your packaging).<br />\nIf you use a CVV on a serial code , then the user will be asked to enter this CVV too. If the CVV on your code is not set or empty it will be ignored and your customer is not asked for it.</p>\n<h3>Woocommerce support for auto-generating serial codes</h3>\n<p><strong>Supports version 6+</strong><br />\n<strong>You can use this plugin to auto-generate serial codes for your woocommerce products</strong><br />\n* Create a code list<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a serial code<br />\n* Click on &#8220;Serial Codes and Sale Restrictions&#8221; in the attribute area of your product<br />\n* Choose the &#8220;Code list&#8221; that will be used for this product</p>\n<p>Everytime this product is sold, it will get a new generated serial code or use an unused serial code within your list (This need to be activated within the option settings). The new serial code will be added to the code list you set on your WooCommerce product and to the product sale too.<br />\nIf the sold product quantity in the order is more than 1, then a code will be generated for each element. The code will be generated after the purchase. In case of a refund the serial code will be recovered and marked as unused, so that it can be reused.</p>\n<p><em>E.g.: Your customer bought 2 of the same product within one order, then 2 serials will be generated and stored to the product item within this order.</em></p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Serial Code Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create and assign serial codes for physical products and digital products</li>\n<li>Recover serial code assigned to refunded orders</li>\n<li>Option to reuse the recovered serial codes with the latest orders</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the serial codes with the complete order email</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the serial codes with the optional PDF invoice &#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Woocommerce support product purchase restriction</h3>\n<p><strong>You can use this plugin to protect the sale of a product without a purchase code</strong><br />\n* Create a code list<br />\n* Add codes to this list &#8211; these codes will be the allowance-code to purchase a specific product<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should be restricted for buy-only-with-serial-code<br />\n* Click on &#8220;Serial Codes and Sale Restrictions&#8221; in the attribute area of your product<br />\n* Choose the &#8220;Code List for sale restriction&#8221;<br />\n* Activate the option &#8220;Activate the purchase restrictions of product sales without a valid and unused serial code&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br />\nIf you exceed your limit (<em>no limits for premium user</em>) of the amount of possible codes, then the code added to the sold product will be a text information: <strong>&#8220;Please contact our support for the serial code&#8221;</strong>.<br />\nThis way your business is not harmed and your customer can contact you to get a serial code manually. The format of the serial code will be <strong>12345-12345-12345-12345</strong> if you do not set a generation format within the options.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce PDF Invoices support to display the serial codes on the PDFs</h3>\n<p>If you use <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</a>, then the generated serial codes are displayed on the generated PDFs too!<br />\nThe supported PDF plugin is from Ewout Fernhout.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Product Sale Restriction to code only</h3>\n<p>You can restrict purchases for a product to a code from a code list or any code you have. The purchase will mark the code as used and cannot be reused for the next purchase.<br />\nThis allows you to offer products that can be only bought by customers, that have received already the purchase code.</p>\n<h3>Frontend</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the shortcode <strong>[sngmbhSerialcodesValidator]</strong></li>\n<li>Create a page or use an existing one and add the shortcode to the page</li>\n<li>The shortcode will be replaced for your users by a form to enter the code and a button to validate the serial code. This allows you to surround the form with your own heading and instruction.</li>\n<li>Each code has a display version (e.g. XYZXYZ -&gt; XYZ-XYZ), so it is easier for your user to read the serial code.</li>\n<li>The check will remove the display delimiter &#8220;-&#8220;, &#8220;:&#8221;, &#8221; &#8221; for the check automatically.</li>\n<li>So your user can enter the code with or without delimiters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use CVV on a code and the user enter the code that requires a cvv, then your user will be ask to enter the CVV.<br />\nThe user could enter the CVV immediately with the code. Separate the value with a &#8220;:&#8221;. E.g: XYZXYZ:1234.</p>\n<p>It is possible to prefill the serial code validation form with a code.<br />\nAdd the parameter &#8220;code&#8221; to your page URL to create a link that prefills the form.<br />\n<em>E.g https://vollstart.com/serial-codes/?code=123-456-789</em></p>\n<h4>Form Options for expert</h4>\n<p>You can use your own input, trigger and output HTML element.<br />\nAdd the id parameter to your HTML elements and pass them to the shortcode as corresponding parameter.<br />\nYou can add also your own JS function name that will be called before the code is checked on the server and also if the result comes back.<br />\n<em>[sngmbhSerialcodesValidator inputid=&#8221;&#8221; triggerid=&#8221;&#8221; outputid=&#8221;&#8221; jspre=&#8221;&#8221; jsafter=&#8221;&#8221;]</em><br />\n<a href=\"https://vollstart.com/serial-codes-validator-premium/docs/#styling\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read here more about this feature</a></p>\n<h3>Quick overview</h3>\n<p>Each code is unique.

After you are satisfied with the generated codes, you can start the code adding step.<br />\nThe code adding step will check if the code is unique on the server before adding it.<br />\nIf the code (serial number/ticket number) exists already on the server, it will not be added.</p>\n<h4>The generator provides a lot of features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code prefix &#8211; you can enter a fixed prefix to each code</li>\n<li>Length of code</li>\n<li>Only letters</li>\n<li>Uppercase, Lowercase or both</li>\n<li>Exclusion of letters that are easy to missread (i,l,o,q,p)</li>\n<li>Delimiter possible: [None, -, :, SPACE] &#8211; you decide after how many letters within the code</li>\n<li>CVV code generation (only numbers)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Limit purchase of WooCommerce products to people with a specific code (restriction feature)</li>\n<li>Store WooCommerce orderid, itemid and productid to a serial code that was generated or used for a product sale</li>\n<li>You can now set the serial code format for all WooCommerce product that are using a serial code</li>\n<li>You can now set the serial code format directly on the WooCommerce product detail page if needed</li>\n<li>Use your serials to restrict purchases to allow a purchase of this product only if the buyer has a code for it (purchase allowance code)</li>\n<li>Add your own messages for the serial code validation form for your customers</li>\n<li>Add your own message for the &#8220;product stolen&#8221; validation message</li>\n<li>Disable the validation form for not logged in wordpress user</li>\n<li>User can register to a code (with wordpress user id if needed) after the code is checked &#8211; this makes your code one-time usable</li>\n<li>Display registered user information of a code during the validation if you need this</li>\n<li>One time check is possible (with wordpress user id if needed) &#8211; the code will be marked as used after the check</li>\n<li>One time check can have a maximum check amount based on code list or based on the global setting</li>\n<li>Several checks allowed &#8211; the code will be marked as used after X confirmed checks</li>\n<li>The user can be forwared (redirected) to an URL after the code was checked &#8211; to show more details</li>\n<li>Webhooks &#8211; you can inform other systems about code validation steps by entering for serveral serial code status during the validation check</li>\n<li>Display assigned serial codes to your user with a shortcode [sngmbhSerialcodesValidator_code]</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Premium Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited Codes (the basic allows you 500 serial codes)</li>\n<li>Unlimited Code Lists</li>\n<li>Save IP address of user using the code validation check on your page</li>\n<li>De- and re-activate codes</li>\n<li>Block IPs after x retries within 60 minutes &#8211; prevent brute force</li>\n<li>One time usage overuled by code list setting</li>\n<li>Enter expiration date for codes</li>\n<li>Enter expiration date for code lists (code overrule list expiration date)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Try it out first, before you go Premium. <a href=\"https://vollstart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;Here you can find the premium plugin&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<h3>Build your own Stolen products database</h3>\n<p>You can set the status of a serial code to be marked as stolen. This way you can offer your customers a way to report a stolen product. Other buyers of used products can validate the code on your website and will be notified with a &#8220;Product is stolen&#8221; warning.<br />\nThis could increase sales and help reducing theft of your products.<br />\nThe check behaviour will be like &#8220;inactive serial codes&#8221; but with the stolen message. You can change the stolen message within the options area of the serial code admin.</p>\n<h3>Protection with CVV</h3>\n<p>You can set a code verification value (CVV) to protect your serial code. This allows you to print your serial code on the visible side of your product and print the CVV number on the open visible part of your packaging of your products. The validation check will ask the user to enter both for a valid check.<br />\nThat way you increase the security of your serial codes and prevent stealing the serial code (If you are able hide the CVV on your packaging).<br />\nIf you use a CVV on a serial code , then the user will be asked to enter this CVV too. If the CVV on your code is not set or empty it will be ignored and your customer is not asked for it.</p>\n<h3>Woocommerce support for auto-generating serial codes</h3>\n<p><strong>Supports version 6+</strong><br />\n<strong>You can use this plugin to auto-generate serial codes for your woocommerce products</strong><br />\n* Create a code list<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a serial code<br />\n* Click on &#8220;Serial Codes and Sale Restrictions&#8221; in the attribute area of your product<br />\n* Choose the &#8220;Code list&#8221; that will be used for this product</p>\n<p>Everytime this product is sold, it will get a new generated serial code or use an unused serial code within your list (This need to be activated within the option settings). The new serial code will be added to the code list you set on your WooCommerce product and to the product sale too.<br />\nIf the sold product quantity in the order is more than 1, then a code will be generated for each element. The code will be generated after the purchase. In case of a refund the serial code will be recovered and marked as unused, so that it can be reused.</p>\n<p><em>E.g.: Your customer bought 2 of the same product within one order, then 2 serials will be generated and stored to the product item within this order.</em></p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Serial Code Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create and assign serial codes for physical products and digital products</li>\n<li>Recover serial code assigned to refunded orders</li>\n<li>Option to reuse the recovered serial codes with the latest orders</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the serial codes with the complete order email</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the serial codes with the optional PDF invoice &#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Woocommerce support product purchase restriction</h3>\n<p><strong>You can use this plugin to protect the sale of a product without a purchase code</strong><br />\n* Create a code list<br />\n* Add codes to this list &#8211; these codes will be the allowance-code to purchase a specific product<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should be restricted for buy-only-with-serial-code<br />\n* Click on &#8220;Serial Codes and Sale Restrictions&#8221; in the attribute area of your product<br />\n* Choose the &#8220;Code List for sale restriction&#8221;<br />\n* Activate the option &#8220;Activate the purchase restrictions of product sales without a valid and unused serial code&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br />\nIf you exceed your limit (<em>no limits for premium user</em>) of the amount of possible codes, then the code added to the sold product will be a text information: <strong>&#8220;Please contact our support for the serial code&#8221;</strong>.<br />\nThis way your business is not harmed and your customer can contact you to get a serial code manually. The format of the serial code will be <strong>12345-12345-12345-12345</strong> if you do not set a generation format within the options.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce PDF Invoices support to display the serial codes on the PDFs</h3>\n<p>If you use <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">&#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</a>, then the generated serial codes are displayed on the generated PDFs too!<br />\nThe supported PDF plugin is from Ewout Fernhout.</p>\n<h3>WooCommerce Product Sale Restriction to code only</h3>\n<p>You can restrict purchases for a product to a code from a code list or any code you have. The purchase will mark the code as used and cannot be reused for the next purchase.<br />\nThis allows you to offer products that can be only bought by customers, that have received already the purchase code.</p>\n<h3>Frontend</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the shortcode <strong>[sngmbhSerialcodesValidator]</strong></li>\n<li>Create a page or use an existing one and add the shortcode to the page</li>\n<li>The shortcode will be replaced for your users by a form to enter the code and a button to validate the serial code. This allows you to surround the form with your own heading and instruction.</li>\n<li>Each code has a display version (e.g. XYZXYZ -&gt; XYZ-XYZ), so it is easier for your user to read the serial code.</li>\n<li>The check will remove the display delimiter &#8220;-&#8220;, &#8220;:&#8221;, &#8221; &#8221; for the check automatically.</li>\n<li>So your user can enter the code with or without delimiters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use CVV on a code and the user enter the code that requires a cvv, then your user will be ask to enter the CVV.<br />\nThe user could enter the CVV immediately with the code. Separate the value with a &#8220;:&#8221;. E.g: XYZXYZ:1234.</p>\n<p>It is possible to prefill the serial code validation form with a code.<br />\nAdd the parameter &#8220;code&#8221; to your page URL to create a link that prefills the form.<br />\n<em>E.g https://vollstart.com/serial-codes/?code=123-456-789</em></p>\n<h4>Form Options for expert</h4>\n<p>You can use your own input, trigger and output HTML element.<br />\nAdd the id parameter to your HTML elements and pass them to the shortcode as corresponding parameter.<br />\nYou can add also your own JS function name that will be called before the code is checked on the server and also if the result comes back.<br />\n<em>[sngmbhSerialcodesValidator inputid=&#8221;&#8221; triggerid=&#8221;&#8221; outputid=&#8221;&#8221; jspre=&#8221;&#8221; jsafter=&#8221;&#8221;]</em><br />\n<a href=\"https://vollstart.com/serial-codes-validator-premium/docs/#styling\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read here more about this feature</a></p>\n<h3>Quick overview</h3>\n<p>Each code is unique.
