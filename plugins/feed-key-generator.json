This update fixes that oversight.</p>\n<h4>1.0.7</h4>\n<p>Small optimization fixes.</p>\n<h4>1.0.6</h4>\n<p>Fixing small, unlikely-to-be-executed loophole in the methods that were preventing users to reset their feed key when it is inactive. There should be no way that a user can accidentally reset their feed key while it&#8217;s inactive now. Lastly, please read version 1.0.5 disclaimer if you are using the Network Privacy plugin.</p>\n<h4>1.0.5</h4>\n<p>Updated so that comment and rdf feeds can also be accessed when using the Network Privacy plugin. DISCLAIMER: I&#8217;ve recently discovered that the Network Privacy plugin I&#8217;ve been testing on has been modified for the particular WordPress install that my team has. When I started working on the Feed Key Generator, I was unaware that the core of the Network Privacy plugin had been adjusted and, therefore, I initially recommended it thinking it would work perfectly with the Feed Key Generator. I have contacted the original Network Privacy plugin authors and I hope that a solution can be produced. I will release another update if such a solution arises and, in the meantime, I will try to test the plugin with other privacy plugins on wordpress.org as well.</p>\n<h4>1.0.4</h4>\n<p>It seems that I was still not adding the uninstall.php file properly as there was a slight oversight in the way my directory was set up. The proper uninstall.php files should now be present in all versions of the plugin. Apologies for this mix-up. IMPORTANT: If you are updating from version 1.0.1 or lower, please read the 1.0.2 changelog entry as well.</p>\n<h4>1.0.3</h4>\n<p>Small addition to ensure that feed key status is set to inactive if the plugin is disabled but not deleted. WARNING from version 1.0.2 still stands!</p>\n<h4>1.0.2</h4>\n<p>The option names implemented in version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 were not very unique &#8211; apologies for this. Chances are that most people would not have an issue with this, but it so happens that one of the options is exactly the same as an option in the &#8220;Feed Key&#8221; plugin. To avoid any possible errors, I&#8217;ve changed the option names for version 1.0.2 and beyond. Please note that I&#8217;ve also added a function that deletes the old options from the database if you were using version 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 and you updated to version 1.0.2 &#8211; this is to ensure that the old options are not needlessly kept in the database. One downside to the deletion of the old options is exactly as it sounds &#8211; you would lose your current settings; therefore, please do NOT update if the plugin is working properly for you at this time and you do not wish to reset your current feed key.</p>\n<h4>1.0.1</h4>\n<p>&#8220;uninstall.php&#8221; seems to have been omitted from the initial release. It is included in this update. 1.0.0 now also has the file.</p>\n"
