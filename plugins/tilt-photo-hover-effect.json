        "faq": "<p>So, what is that I can do with this plug-in?</p>\n<p>In short, you can make a visually pleasurable, interactive image effects, white different than with other “hover” effects. This one will tilt images following your mouse movement and create extra ‘onion skin’ layers in a lower opacity to animate.</p>\n<p>– Browse for image in seconds, – Choose one of 3 effects to apply, – Adjust movement, rotation, (X,Y and Z), – Add Link URL’s (on click), – Add Border (of any thickness), – Optionally start as grayscale until rolled over, – Resize to ANY size, – Fit inside the space provided or Crop, – Stay inside or move outside the defined area, and more…</p>\n<p>How did you think of such plugin? There are many hover effects, but this one is quite unique.</p>\n<p>I saw a futuristic poster &#8211; hologram demonstrated by a vendor, looking just like the regular wall poster but this one would change and move as you pass by it. I loved the effect and thought about how cool would be to generate something similar as a  WP plugin.</p>\n<p>Can I use this plugin on all kind of files?</p>\n<p>Honestly, you should try to throw as many different formats and files at it and check out. Pretty much if you can load it- it will tilt it. As you can see in our test demo site (http://downloadsoho.com/smooth-image-effect-demo/), it looks beautiful when applied to Cinemagraphs (animated Gifs), single images, sets of thumbnails, or just on a transparent .png that floats on top of a parallax background (as in the header image shown there)</p>\n<p>If I add extreme values, will I break the plugin?</p>\n<p>I think you should experiment and find even more cool effects with extreme settings. Maybe it can perform some undiscovered magic if pushed to the limits:)</p>\n<p>OK, so what about updates and all that?</p>\n<p>We will be revisiting the plugin, adjusting it to the new WP versions, browsers, etc. If there are glitches in performances, we will be addressing them. We may even add more options in future. You will be notified every time there is an update available:)</p>\n\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here’s how to make the plugin work for your publications.<br />\n1.
