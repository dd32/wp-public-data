If this happens, and the updated packages contain backward-incompatible changes, the plugin may begin to issue errors. Should this occur, please <a href=\"https://github.com/meitar/diasposter/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">file a bug report on the Diasposter project&#8217;s issue tracker</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nCan I specify a post&#8217;s tags?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WordPress&#8217;s tags are also crossposted to Diaspora. If you&#8217;d like to keep your WordPress tags separate from your Diaspora tags, be certain you&#8217;ve enabled the &#8220;Do not send post tags to Diaspora&#8221; setting.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the &#8220;Automatically add these tags to all crossposts&#8221; setting lets you enter a comma-separated list of tags that will always be applied to your Diaspora crossposts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nDoes Diasposter properly attribute content sources?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By default, Diasposter will set itself up so that your WordPress blog&#8217;s posts are attributed as the source for each of your crossposts with a link back to the original post on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I send older WordPress posts to Diaspora?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Go edit the desired post, verify the crosspost option is set to <code>Yes</code>, and update the post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I edit a post that has been cross-posted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you delete a post that you have previously crossposted, Diasposter will delete it from Diaspora accordingly. Unfortunately, Diaspora provides no mechanism for editing a post after it has been published, so you will need to delete and recreate your post if you want to make changes on Diaspora.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I cross-post Private posts from WordPress to Diaspora?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, but this is a planned feature. Feel free to offer suggestions or patches at <a href=\"https://github.com/meitar/diasposter/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the Diasposter project issue tracker</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I choose which Diaspora aspects to share with?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. For each post you make, you can select either &#8220;Public&#8221; or &#8220;All Aspects&#8221; or any combination of your other aspects. The sharing rules obey the same rules as the Diaspora* bookmarklet. This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If &#8220;All Aspects&#8221; is selected, all other selected aspects are ignored.</li>\n<li>If &#8220;Public&#8221; is selected, but &#8220;All Aspects&#8221; is not selected, then your post will be shared <em>publicly.</em></li>\n<li>If neither of the previous two options are selected, you may mix-and-match any number of your personal aspects.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I cross-post custom post types?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. By default, Diasposter only crossposts <code>post</code> post types, but you can enable or disable other post types from the plugin&#8217;s settings screen.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin developer, you can easily make your custom post types work well with Diasposter by implementing the <code>diasposter_save_post_types</code>, <code>diasposter_meta_box_post_types</code>, and <code>diasposter_prepared_post</code> filter hooks. See <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/diasposter/other_notes/\" rel=\"ugc\">Other Notes</a> for coding details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy don&#8217;t I see the option to send a tweet automatically even after I set the auto-tweet/auto-post option?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure you have correctly configured your desired service integration for your Diaspora* account on your Diaspora* pod. Usually, this is available by selecting the &#8220;Services&#8221; tab from your pod&#8217;s account setting page (such as at <code>https://your-diaspora-pod.com/services</code>). Only the services that you have enabled will be available for you to use in the Diasposter post editing meta box.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhy aren&#8217;t my Diaspora* posts showing my location even with &#8220;Send post location?&#8221; checked?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You need a plugin that collects post location data before you have any data to share. If you have not installed such a plugin, then there is simply no location data to send to Diaspora*. Neither Diasposter nor WordPress itself collects this information, but numerous other plugins can.</p>\n<p>If you have installed a geolocation plugin for WordPress but the location data is still not showing up, it is likely because the other plugin does not save location data in a standard format that other plugins (like Diasposter) can access. Diasposter adheres to the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress Geodata standard</a> for location information, and expects other plugins to behave accordingly. Try using a more well-behaved plugin instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs Diasposter available in languages other than English?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! This plugin has been translated into the following languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dutch (<code>nl_NL</code>)\n<ul>\n<li>Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/mijnheer/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AndrÃ©</a>! ðŸ˜€</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With your help it can be translated into even more!
