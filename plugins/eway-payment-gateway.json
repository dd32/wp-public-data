You will need to sign up for a sandbox account, and copy your Rapid API key/password and Client Side Encryption key from the sandbox MyEway. When you go to pay, only use dummy card numbers like 4444333322221111. This allows you to make as many test purchases as you like, without billing a real credit card.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.eway.io/s/article/What-is-the-Sandbox-and-how-do-I-get-it\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">What is the sandbox and how do I get it?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.eway.io/s/article/Test-Credit-Card-Numbers\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Test Credit Card Numbers</a></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20eway%3F'>\nWhat is Eway?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Eway is a leading provider of online payments solutions with a presence in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. This plugin integrates with Eway so that your website can safely accept credit card payments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20recurring%20billing%20supported%3F'>\nIs recurring billing supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet. I know it can be done but I haven&#8217;t had a website that needs it yet, so have not written the code for it.</p>\n<p>If you just need a simple way to record recurring payments such as donations, you might want to try <a href=\"https://webaware.com.au/get-gravity-forms\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravity Forms</a> and <a href=\"https://gfeway.webaware.net.au/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Gravity Forms Eway</a> which does support recurring payments.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20an%20ssl%2Ftls%20certificate%20for%20my%20website%3F'>\nDo I need an SSL/TLS certificate for my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. This plugin uses the Direction Connection method to process transactions, so you must have HTTPS encryption for your website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%27s%20the%20difference%20between%20the%20capture%20and%20authorize%20payment%20methods%3F'>\nWhat&#8217;s the difference between the Capture and Authorize payment methods?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Capture charges the customer&#8217;s credit card immediately. This is the default payment method, and is the method most websites will use for credit card payments.</p>\n<p>Authorize checks to see that the transaction would be approved, but does not process it. Eway calls this method <a href=\"https://www.eway.com.au/features/payments/payments-pre-auth/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PreAuth</a>. Once the transaction has been authorized, you can complete it manually in your MyEway console. You cannot complete PreAuth transactions from WordPress.</p>\n<p><strong>NB: PreAuth is currently only available for Australian, Singapore, Malaysian, &amp; Hong Kong merchants. Do not select Authorize if you are a New Zealand merchant!</strong></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20i%20need%20to%20set%20the%20client-side%20encryption%20key%3F'>\nDo I need to set the Client-Side Encryption Key?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Client-Side Encryption is required for websites that are not PCI certified. It encrypts sensitive credit card details in the browser, so that only Eway can see them. All websites are encouraged to set the Client-Side Encryption Key for improved security of credit card details.</p>\n<p>If you get the following error, you <em>must</em> add your Client-Side Encryption key:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>V6111: Unauthorized API Access, Account Not PCI Certified</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will find your Client-Side Encryption key in MyEway where you created your API key and password. Copy it from MyEway and paste into the Eway Payments settings page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20i%20get%20an%20error%20%22invalid%20transactiontype%22%3F'>\nWhy do I get an error &#8220;Invalid TransactionType&#8221;?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>V6010: Invalid TransactionType, account not certified for eCome only MOTO or Recurring available</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It probably means you need to set your Client-Side Encryption key; see above. It can also indicate that your website has JavaScript errors, which can prevent Client-Side Encryption from working. Check for errors in your browser&#8217;s developer console.</p>\n<p>If your website is PCI Certified and you don&#8217;t want to use Client-Side Encryption for some reason, then you will still get this error in the sandbox until you enable PCI for Direct Connections in MyEway:</p>\n<p>Settings &gt; Sandbox &gt; Direction Connection &gt; PCI</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20beagle%20lite%3F'>\nWhat is Beagle Lite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eway.com.au/features/fraud-protection/fraud-lite/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Beagle Lite</a> is a service from Eway that provides fraud protection for your transactions. It uses information about the purchaser to suggest whether there is a risk of fraud. Configure Beagle Lite rules in your MyEway console.</p>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>: Beagle Lite fraud detection requires an address for each transaction. Be sure to add an Address field to your forms, and make it a required field. The minimum address part required is the Country, so you can just enable that subfield if you don&#8217;t need a full address.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20do%20i%20find%20the%20eway%20transaction%20number%3F'>\nWhere do I find the Eway transaction number?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WP eCommerce</strong>: the Eway transaction number and the bank authcode are shown under Billing Details when you view the sales log for a purchase in the WordPress admin.</li>\n<li><strong>WooCommerce</strong>: the Eway transaction number and the bank authcode are shown in the Custom Fields block when you view the order in the WordPress admin.</li>\n<li><strong>Event Espresso</strong>: the Eway transaction number and the bank authcode are shown in the Payment Details block when you view the transaction in the WordPress admin.</li>\n<li><strong>Events Manager</strong>: from the Payment Gateways menu item or the Bookings menu item, you can view a list of transactions; the Eway transaction ID is shown in the Transaction ID column, and the authcode in the Notes column.</li>\n<li><strong>Another WordPress Classifieds Plugin</strong>: not available yet</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20with%20the%20wp%20ecommerce%20gold%20cart%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin with the WP eCommerce Gold Cart?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, if you deactivate the Gold Cart&#8217;s Eway payment gateway and activate this one.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20get%20an%20ssl%20error%20when%20my%20checkout%20attempts%20to%20connect%20with%20eway'>\nI get an SSL error when my checkout attempts to connect with Eway\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is a common problem in local testing environments.
