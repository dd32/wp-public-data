        "faq": "\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20make%20my%20website%20accessible%3F'>\nDoes this plugin make my website accessible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Despite what other plugins, integrations, or overlay products might tell you, there is <strong>NO</strong> way for any automated tool or plugin to ensure your website is fully accessible. True accessibility can only be achieved through a combination of automated scans and manual review, and if you read the &#8216;fine print&#8217; for any of the accessibility overlays or plugins on the market, you&#8217;ll see that they do not guarantee your website will be accessible.</p>\n<p>Accessibility Checker does not make your website accessible, but it is a valuable tool to help you make your website accessible, the right way.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20an%20accessibility%20overlay%20or%20tool%20bar%20like%20accessibe%2C%20userway%2C%20audioeye%2C%20etc.%3F'>\nIs this an accessibility overlay or tool bar like AccessiBe, Userway, AudioEye, etc.?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. Accessibility Checker is a testing tool that scans for problems and presents reports in the admin dashboard. It does not &#8220;fix&#8221; problems or add any overlays, toolbars, or widgets to the front end of your website. It will not use JavaScript to modify how screen reader and other assistive technology users are able to engage with your website.</p>\n<p>Accessibility Checker is the kind of accessibility tool that accessibility consultants and people with disability support &#8211; one that helps you identify issues so that you can make your website accessible the right way.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20accessibility%20checker%20scan%20all%20of%20my%20content%3F'>\nDoes Accessibility Checker scan all of my content?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Accessibility Checker Free scans blog posts and pages, including the header, content area, sidebar, and footer on those pages. There is no limit to the number of pages or posts that you can scan with Accessibility Checker or the number of times any one page or post can be scanned. So, if your website only contains standard posts and pages, then YES, Accessibility Checker will scan all of your content. If you have custom post types (such as a portfolio, team member pages, or WooCommerce products), the free version of the plugin will not scan these posts.</p>\n<p>For bulk full-site scanning or to check custom post types for accessibility, please upgrade to <a href=\"https:my.equalizedigital.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Accessibility Checker Pro</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20know%20how%20to%20fix%20accessibility%20problems%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nHow do I know how to fix accessibility problems on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every error and warning in Accessibility Checker has an &#8216;i&#8217; icon to the right of the error or warning name on the details tab. If you click these &#8216;i&#8217; icons, you&#8217;ll be directed to a help article that clearly explains what the error or warning is, what its impact on accessibility is, and how to fix or resolve it. Generally, these help articles will provide sufficient information to point you in the right direction, but if you still have questions, open a support ticket on WordPress.org and we&#8217;ll do our best to help you.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20help%20me%20fix%20accessibility%20problems%20on%20my%20website%3F'>\nCan you help me fix accessibility problems on my website?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! If you need need accessibility fixes custom coded for your site, we offer website accessibility remediation to help bring your current site into compliance. <a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/services/website-accessibility-remediation/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about Website Accessibility Remediation</a></p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20there%20are%20accessibility%20errors%20in%20my%20theme%20or%20a%20plugin%20that%20i%20cannot%20fix%3F'>\nWhat if there are accessibility errors in my theme or a plugin that I cannot fix?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If Accessibility Checker is identifying errors in your theme or a plugin and you&#8217;re not sure how to fix them, the best bet is to reach out to the theme or plugin developer for assistance. If that does not work, we may be able to help.

This can save you thousands of dollars per year in accessibility scanning fees and is privacy-focused, ensuring that your website data stays completely under your control.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
