        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20it%3F'>\nWhat is it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Email address harvesters operate by using software &#8220;scrapers&#8221; or &#8220;click through&#8221; staff to steal email addresses directly from web-site pages.<br />\nUsing our service prevents this as your email addresses no longer need to be listed directly on your web-site. Instead<br />\nthey are hidden away from your site. We then only release the address after<br />\nwe are sure it is not being accessed improperly. Because of this it becomes invisible to harvesters and machines and yet is completely<br />\nvisible to bona fide users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20a%20webemailprotector%20secured%20email%20address%20appear%3F'>\nHow does a WebEmailProtector secured email address appear?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The secured email address appears on a site like this: &#8221; &#060;a href=&#8217;JavaScript:emo();&#8217; &#062;Any Text &#060;/a &#062;&#8221;<br />\n(you can change what it says and how it looks)<br />\nwhereas a non protected email address usually appears like this:&#8221; &#060;a href=&#8217;mailto:nobody@webemailprotector.com&#8217; &#062;nobody@webemailprotector.com &#060;/a &#062;&#8221;.<br />\nBoth operate when you &#8220;click&#8221;, but only the former is safe.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20it%20better%20than%20a%20contact%20form%3F'>\nWhy is it better than a Contact Form?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contact Forms are effective in dealing with both human and machine based harvesting, unless you ever want to use email auto responders of course<br />\nas this gives your identity away.<br />\nHowever the real problem is that all the form filling can annoy and therefore dissuade real users from getting in touch &#8211; effectively putting a<br />\nbarrier between you and your users in your most important communications channel &#8211; email</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20it%20better%20than%20captcha%20codes%3F'>\nWhy is it better than Captcha codes?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Captcha codes are effective in dealing with machines but not with users who simply click to reveal your address.<br />\nAnd the other main issue is that they are very very annoying to real users and can heavily dissuade communications with you &#8211; so are effectively<br />\nputting a barrier between you and your wanted users.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20is%20it%20better%20than%20%27free%27%20address%20encoder%3F'>\nWhy is it better than &#8216;free&#8217; address encoder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although at first they may appear effective as your &#8216;mailto:&#8217; text is no longer obvious to the eye within your HTML code. Encoders and encrypters,<br />\n&#8216;free&#8217; or otherwise, have to be built so that they can be interpreted by any web-browser using standard HTML. And this is the nature of there<br />\ndrawback.<br />\nThey are more or less complex but involve a Java/JavaScript sequence munger or character set coder. But to cut a long story short if your browser<br />\nunderstands them so can any harvesting software.<br />\nSo it&#8217;s actually quite simple for encoded email addresses to be interpreted and harvested using standard software libraries and methods.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20the%20email%20protected%3F'>\nHow is the email protected?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We provide protection as the email address is never listed or disclosed on your website. Instead WebEmailProtector detects who and what is trying to access<br />\nthe email link on your site at the time of &#8220;clicking&#8221;, and then deploys algorithms to validate whether this request is being made by a credible, bona-fide visitor.<br />\nThe algoriths check multiple points about the request using our robust, proven Artifical Intelligence (AI) derived method.<br />\nAfter running the validation process, the email address is only returned if certain criteria are met and others not broken.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20you%20get%20for%20the%20free%20trial%3F'>\nWhat do you get for the FREE trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You get the full service free for 1 month, with exactly the same protection as offered with a paid up subscription.<br />\nThere is no obligation to purchase, but at the end of the trial we are confident that you will see a reduction in volume of new email<br />\nspam originating from your web site. At the end of the trial we would also ask you to complete a 10 question survey on how you found<br />\ninstalling and using it.<br />\nPlease note that as its a trial you only get it once per email/website for you to try unless otherwise agreed with us.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20you%20subscribe%20following%20the%20trial%3F'>\nHow do you subscribe following the trial?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once your trial is coming to an end we will send you an email detailing what you have to do to continue the services. You need do nothing if you are<br />\na non commercial site. All payments can be made on-line using PayPal. the more people that use it the more we can keep prices down.

If you really want to check your email is no longer<br />\nlisted view your web site in text mode (e.g. pressing the F12 key in your Internet Explorer/Google Chrome/Firefox web browser) and search for<br />\nyour email address or the mailto: reference.
