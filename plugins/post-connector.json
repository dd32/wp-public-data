But to do so, you’d normally have to use a custom taxonomy. With Post Connector, you can directly relate post types to post types, foregoing all the hassle of having to create loads of custom taxonomies and just allowing you to do what you really want to do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium features</strong></p>\n<p>The Pro version of the plugin comes with the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sortable post connections</li>\n<li>Backwards linking (parent to child AND child to parent)</li>\n<li>A developer friendly API</li>\n<li>Priority support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.post-connector.com/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=after-features-link\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">More information</a> | <a href=\"https://www.post-connector.com/go-pro/?utm_source=wp-plugin-repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=after-features-link\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade now &gt;&gt;</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>No coding required</h4>\n<p>Creating links, linking posts and displaying posts in Post Connector can all be done without coding. Stuff you used to need a developer for can now “just” be done by clicking around in your WordPress backend.</p>\n<h4>Automatically displaying linked posts</h4>\n<p>Automatically displaying linked posts introduces a new way of displaying linked posts. Next to our widget and shortcode you can now display linked posts by let Post Connector append them to your posts. This new feature prevents the need of editing your theme files allowing you to easily switch themes in the future.</p>\n<h4>Unlimited links</h4>\n<p>Unlimited links, in all ways. You can create links in links as many times as you want, no limitations. Whether you want to relate one post to 10 others of a different post type or you want to relate a post to posts in several different post types: it’s all easily done.</p>\n<h4>Widget &amp; Shortcode</h4>\n<p>Post Connector includes a widget for displaying linked posts. Of course you can add the widget multiple times, displaying different links and/or different parents. Next to this you can set the widget’s title, choose whether you want the child posts to be clickable and if you would like to display the excerpt for each child.</p>\n<p>Post Connector also includes a shortcode  for displaying linked posts. This enable you to output specific linked posts anywhere you can type content (e.g. pages) by simply entering the shortcode. Heck, you don’t even to remember that the shortcode is. Just click the Post Connector icon in the editor, set a few settings and click “Insert Shortcode” and you’re done.</p>\n<h4>Multilingual</h4>\n<p>Post Connector is available in English, Dutch, German and Spanish and soon many more languages. Post Connector will automatically select the correct language based on your WordPress installation language.</p>\n<h4>Network/Multisite compatible</h4>\n<p>Post Connector is WordPress Network / Multisite compatible. Each site will have its own version of Post Connector and thus have it own links.</p>\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/barrykooij/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WordPress plugins</a> by <a href=\"http://www.barrykooij.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Barry Kooij</a></li>\n<li>Contact Barry on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/CageNL\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@CageNL</a></li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re a dev, follow or contribute to the <a href=\"https://github.com/barrykooij/post-connector\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Post Connector plugin on GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
