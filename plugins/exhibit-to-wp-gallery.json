The original Exhibit wont run on WordPress 2.1 or newer though, so I included a patched version of Exhibit 1.1b, enabled to run on WordPress up to 2.6.3. (use your original configuration files, or remember to edit the included ones)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why *attachments* and not [insert your favorite gallery plugin]</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Exhibit was the only <em>proper</em> solution back in those days &#8211; way before WordPress even had file uploading capabilities. With only small modifications it has kept on working over <strong>ten</strong> major wordpress releases!</p>\n<p>But <em>all</em> plugins are bound to become outdated. The only sane <em>long term solution</em> is to use the core WP functions. Get yourself a plugin that is built <em>on top</em> of those, and you&#8217;ll always have a safe fallback.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
