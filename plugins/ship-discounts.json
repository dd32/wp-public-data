        "description": "<p>The Ship Discounts plugin is a <a href=\"https://woo.com/woocommerce/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WooCommerce</a> add-on that allows you to offer your customers shipping services with real-time quotes. The plugin is used to manage a shipping method that lets visitors, when ordering products, see the prices of different carriers in real time and choose one. The administrator has control over several options (for example, selecting which carriers to display, box formats, etc.).</p>\n<p>This module must be used with the WooCommerce plugin. Therefore, WooCommerce must be installed first.</p>\n<h3>Third-party Services</h3>\n<p>The plugin is connected to the <a href=\"https://www.shipdiscounts.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ship Discounts</a> platform (see <a href=\"https://www.shipdiscounts.ca/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">privacy policy</a>). To use its services, the plugin must send and receive information via the Ship Discounts API. You will need an account.</p>\n<p>When your store is activated, its domain name and an authentication token are sent to the API.</p>\n<p>When obtaining carrier rates, the number of packages, their weight and dimensions, whether a signature is required, whether there is a non-conveyable item, the shipment value, the customer’s postal code, and the store’s postal code are sent. A non-modifiable statement that the package contains no dangerous goods is also sent.</p>\n<p>When an order is created, the name, full address, and telephone number of the customer and the store are sent. The items in the order, the number of packages, their weight and dimensions, the shipment value, whether a signature is required, whether there is a non-conveyable item, the displayed cost of delivery, the actual cost of delivery, the chosen carrier code, and the chosen service code are also sent.</p>\n<p>When deleting an order, obtaining order details, or obtaining the label, the Ship Discounts order number is sent.</p>\n<p>The Ship Discounts platform can also communicate with your WordPress site using your authentication token. Please note that it can view and modify the details of all WooCommerce orders.</p>\n<p>The order information it can see includes the order number, status, costs, customer name, customer phone number, customer email, customer address, details of items purchased, details of the chosen carrier and delivery service, notes, creation date, update date, and closure date.</p>\n<p>The order information it can modify includes the order number linked to the Ship Discounts platform, the carrier and its service, the displayed cost of delivery and the actual cost, the number of packages and their weights and dimensions, the tracking number and link, the label, the cost of boxes, the value of the shipment, whether a signature is required, and whether there is a non-conveyable item. Please note that these changes do not affect the actual cost of the order; the customer’s invoice will not change.</p>\n",
