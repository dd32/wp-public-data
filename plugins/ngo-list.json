Add your external site- members and event-site members to those groups. If you remove any of those categories you will get a warning in backoffice.</li>\n<li>If you like to create your own image to signal an external site, matching your theme, you could put it in your /theme_folder/images/ico_extern.png Otherwise the plugin will use the image in ngo-list/images/ico_extern.png</li>\n</ol>\n",

If you need to rename these groups do a search and replace of those names on the file ngo-list.php<br />\nThe plugin it self is translated to English though.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Latest stable release</li>\n<li>Changed language base from Swedish to English to make translation easier.</li>\n<li>Made the category names translatable<br />\nBe noticed; since the category names can now be translated I instead use a default slug (extern and eventpage). If you are upgrading this plugin you have to add your sites to the categories with these slugs, Otherwise they won&#8217;t be listed. v1.3.3 and older used slugs (and names) in Swedish.<br />\nThe categories get&#8217;s there names when activating this plugin, but can be changed at will, as long as the slug remains either extern or eventpage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3.3</h4>\n<p>Changed vocabulary (webpage to website) and hide the headlines for category external links and event-page if empty.</p>\n<h4>1.3.2</h4>\n<p>Changed donation link (important stuff ðŸ˜‰ )</p>\n<h4>1.3.1</h4>\n<p>Initial release to the WordPress repositorium</p>\n"
