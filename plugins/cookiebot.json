        "faq": "\n<dt id='is%20cookiebot%E2%84%A2%20free%3F'>\nIs Cookiebot™ free?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cookiebot CMP WordPress Plugin is a freemium plugin, much like Jetpack and Monsterinsights. Cookiebot™ also has a Free Plan option.</p>\n<p>Whether the free plan is sufficient or you need a premium plan depends on two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The size of your website, i.e. the number of subpages on your website, which determines whether you are eligible for the Free Plan. For websites up to 50 subpages, you have the choice between the Free Plan and Premium Lite. <a href=\"https://www.cookiebot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get a quote</a> to see which plan your site needs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The features you need. The free plan <strong>does not include</strong> all features available in the premium plans. The free plan does not include customization of banner and cookies declaration, multiple languages, email reports, data export, geolocation, bulk consent, consent statistics, internal domain alias for development, test and staging. However, our Premium Lite package is available for only €7/month for all domains with fewer than 50 subpages, including all premium features mentioned above.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you sign up for Cookiebot CMP, you will automatically be enrolled in our free 14-day trial for one domain. During the trial, you will have access to all premium features of the Cookiebot CMP.</p>\n<p>See all details of Cookiebot CMP <a href=\"https://www.cookiebot.com/en/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plans and pricing</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='my%20wordpress%20website%20has%20less%20than%2050%20subpages%2C%20why%20should%20i%20upgrade%20to%20premium%20lite%3F'>\nMy WordPress website has less than 50 subpages, why should I upgrade to Premium Lite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Premium Lite package comes with great features that enhance your cookie consent solution. Upgrading to Premium Lite after your 14-day free trial enables you to build user trust and provide an advanced, personalized user experience. Apply  custom branding and geotargeting to your banner, among other features. It also gives you more control over your WordPress website’s privacy compliance with the automated monthly and daily scan reports.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20cookiebot%E2%84%A2%20count%20as%20pages%3F'>\nWhat does Cookiebot™ count as pages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Your pricing plan is dependent on the number of subpages the Cookiebot CMP detects on your website.</p>\n<p>Cookiebot™ does not count image files as subpages, which could set users to a higher subscription plan. Depending on your theme, WordPress may automatically create real pages for content placed in your media library, called Attachment pages. Because these pages can contain online trackers, Cookiebot CMP includes them in your page count.</p>\n<p>To disable the Attachment page feature in WordPress, please see the following guides:</p>\n<p>https://themeskills.com/disable-media-attachment-pages-wordpress/<br />\nhttps://www.wpexplorer.com/disable-image-page/</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='cookie%20declaration'>\nCookie declaration\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cookiebot CMP includes an automatically updated cookie declaration for the cookies in use on your site.</p>\n<p>By implementing it, you can ensure that your cookie declaration is detailed and accurate at all times, as required by the GDPR. Also, the declaration automatically provides the mandatory options for the user to be able to change or withdraw consent.</p>\n<p>For CCPA and CPRA compliance, businesses will be able to display the required “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link on their cookie declaration.</p>\n<p>To display your cookie declaration, create a new page on your website and add the shortcode to the page that’s provided by the plugin: [cookie_declaration]. Alternatively, you can incorporate it into your existing Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>By default, the cookie declaration is displayed in the selected Cookiebot CMP language. You are able to override this setting with a “lang” attribute in the shortcode, e.g.: [cookie_declaration lang=”de”] for a German version. Remember to add all languages used in the <a href=\"https://admin.cookiebot.com/login\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cookiebot CMP Admin Interface</a>.</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/67XUgTUy3ok?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</p>\n<dt id='cookie-checker%3A%20what%20cookies%20are%20in%20use%20on%20my%20site%3F'>\nCookie-checker: What cookies are in use on my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are in doubt about what cookies are in use on our site, start with our free compliance test:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.cookiebot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Test my site</a></strong></p>\n<p>The test scans up to five pages of your website and sends you a complete report of the cookies and online trackers in use on these pages, including information on their provenance, purpose, and whether or not their use is compliant with EU regulations.</p>\n<p>If you want a complete overview of the cookies and online tracking on your website, sign up for the Cookiebot CMP solution.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20set%20up%20my%20cookie%20banner%20with%20cookiebot%20cmp%3F'>\nHow can I set up my cookie banner with Cookiebot CMP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Here is <strong><a href=\"https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408356523282-Getting-started\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our step by step guide</a></strong> on how to set up your cookie banner.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20cookiebot%20cmp%20block%20cookies%20and%20trackers%3F'>\nHow does Cookiebot CMP block cookies and trackers?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cookiebot CMP provides two modes to block cookies and trackers before consent has been given.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cookie auto-blocking mode</strong> will automatically block all cookies (except for ‘strictly necessary’ cookies) until a user has given consent. <a href=\"https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009074960-Automatic-cookie-blocking\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Learn more about the cookie auto-blocking mode</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Cookie manual-blocking mode</strong> requests manual adjustments to the cookie-setting scripts. <a href=\"https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405978132242-Manual-cookie-blocking\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about the cookie manual-blocking mode</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20gdpr%20and%20the%20eprivacy%20directive%3F'>\nWhat is the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, an EU data privacy law enforced since May 2018. It protects EU citizens’ personal data globally and affects all organizations and websites that handle such data. If you have a website with users from the EU, and if your website uses cookies (it probably does), then you need to make your use of cookies and tracking compliant with the GDPR and obtain user consent.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">EU GDPR homepage</a> for more information, or their infographic for businesses: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/justice/smedataprotect/index_en.htm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Data Protection: Better rules for small businesses</a>.</p>\n<p>The ePrivacy Directive is another EU legal instrument that specifically aims to protect EU citizens’ online data, including that from electronic communications. It is in the process of becoming a full regulation like the GDPR.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20ccpa%20and%20cpra%3F'>\nWhat is the CCPA and CPRA?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state-wide law that regulates how businesses all over the world are permitted to handle the personal information of California residents. Starting from January 1, 2023 the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) comes into effect, amending and extending the CCPA.</p>\n<p>You are required to comply with the CCPA if your business:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sells the personal information of more than 50,000 California residents per year (increased to 100,000 under the CPRA as of January 1st, 2023)</li>\n<li>as annual gross revenue exceeding USD 25 million</li>\n<li>derives more than 50 percent of annual revenue from the selling of personal information of California residents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the CPRA, compliance also applies to sharing as well as selling personal information. Cookies and other tracking technologies are classified as unique identifiers that form part of the CCPA’s definition of personal information.</p>\n<p>If your business has a website, you must know and disclose to consumers, at or before the point of collection, the data you collect, via what cookies or other mechanisms, and which third parties you share it with. This can be done through the Cookiebot CMP cookie declaration that also features the required “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link, so end users can opt out of having their data sold or shared.</p>\n<p>If your website is visited by consumers under the age of 16, or you collect sensitive personal information, you are required by the CCPA and CPRA to first obtain their opt in (or consent from a parent or guardian for children). This can be done through Cookiebot CMP’s CCPA opt-in banner.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.cookiebot.com/en/what-is-ccpa/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a> to find all the details about the CCPA and CPRA and how to achieve compliance.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20make%20other%20plugins%20support%20cookiebot%E2%84%A2%3F'>\nHow do I make other plugins support Cookiebot™?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If your favorite plugin doesn’t support Cookiebot CMP you are always welcome to ask the developer to add support for it.</p>\n<p>Send an email to the plugin developer you want to support Cookiebot™ and request that support for Cookiebot CMP be added. Cookiebot™ provides a helper function to check if there is an active, working version of Cookiebot CMP on the website.</p>\n<p>The easiest way for a developer to implement Cookiebot CMP support is to add a check where tags are outputted to the visitor. This can be done following way:</p>\n<p>$scriptTag = ‘‘;<br />\nif(function_exists(‘cookiebot_active’) &amp;&amp; cookiebot_active()) {<br />\n$scriptTag = ‘&lt;script’.cookiebot_assist(‘statistics’).’&gt;’;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>The developer of the plugin can see more details on our <a href=\"https://github.com/CybotAS/CookiebotWP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github repository</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20my%20website%20become%20compliant%20once%20i%20install%20cookiebot%20cmp%3F'>\nCan my website become compliant once I install Cookiebot CMP?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you use our plugin version 3.0 or later and choose the automatic implementation, Cookiebot™ enables compliance with the prior consent requirement of the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive (ePD) and similar privacy regulations for protection of user data around the world. Cookiebot CMP also enables compliance with the CCPA and CPRA through the implementation of the “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link on a website’s cookie declaration, as well as the opt-in banner required if your website targets visitors under the age of 16 or processes sensitive personal information.</p>\n<p>The default consent banner has the strictest settings possible and is suitable for obtaining consent under both the GDPR and the ePD. Make sure to adapt the consent banner design and content to fit your website.

If so, you have to:<br />\n1. Ask the plugin developers if they are planning on becoming GDPR/CCPA compliant, or if they would like to integrate with Cookiebot CMP. Check out our <a href=\"https://github.com/CybotAS/CookiebotWP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github repository</a>, where we are developing integrations for Cookiebot CMP, until the plugin developers choose to do this themselves, or if <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44043\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Core</a> enables such functionality.<br />\n2.

The law aims to ensure fair competition, enhance consumer protection, and promote innovation in the digital ecosystem.

The DMA has designated these companies as “gatekeepers”. These platforms will be subject to enhanced regulatory obligations and scrutiny under the DMA. The DMA’s requirements protect online users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and the UK. The DMA does not apply outside of these areas, even though the currently designated gatekeeper companies are headquartered in the USA and China.</p>\n<p>The six gatekeepers designated by the European Commission are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)</li>\n<li>Alphabet (Google, YouTube, Android)</li>\n<li>ByteDance (TikTok)</li>\n<li>Apple (iOS, Safari)</li>\n<li>Amazon</li>\n<li>Microsoft (LinkedIn, Windows PC OS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the DMA applies to these gatekeepers, smaller businesses should also be aware of and understand the law, as it’ll directly impact how they use the large online platforms and services owned by gatekeepers. Business owners will be responsible for following the compliance rules imposed by digital services such as those from Google and Amazon.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20cookiebot%E2%84%A2%20integrate%20with%20wp%20consent%20api%3F'>\nDoes Cookiebot™ integrate with WP Consent API?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Cookiebot™ is fully integrated with the WP Consent API.
