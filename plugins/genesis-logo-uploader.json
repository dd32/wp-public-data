        "faq": "\n<h4>Why won‚Äôt my logo show?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are 2 things required to get your logo to show.  A lot of themes use the Custom Header theme support, so you have to make sure that‚Äôs removed from your functions.php file.  Also, a lot of themes use logos as background image, so in the CSS, under .site-title (or similar), there may be be an attribute called ‚Äòtext-indent‚Äô.  Remove that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why didn‚Äôt you include styles to make the logo appear nice?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because every logo is different. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to have a default style for a rectangle logo if you‚Äôre logo is round, etc. Adding a little padding, width, and margin in the style sheet should make every logo appear fine.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>1.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the logo link to use site_url() instead of ‚Äò/‚Äò </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Official WordPress Release</li>\n</ul>\n"
