Simply use the shortcode to place your grid anywhere you want. A custom content type called &#8220;Shift8 Portfolio&#8221; is created for you to manage internally. You have the option of having a separate single page for each portfolio item added (that you will arrive when you click the image in the grid). If no additional information is given in the backend then clicking the image in the grid will simply enlarge it as a modal window.</p>\n<p>You can see a demo of the plugin in use on our own <a href=\"https://www.shift8web.ca/our_work/\" title=\"Toronto Web Design\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">web design</a> portfolio page.</p>\n",
