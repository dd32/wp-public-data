This plugin invokes a restAPI call to the ThreatPoint API, consumes the response and acts based on configuration options in the plugin. This allows ip reputation data to be placed in front of pages (wp-admin and custom pages for example) &#8211; without interrupting normal access.<br />\nTo communicate with the restAPI an API KEY is required from ThreatPoint.</p>\n<p>The plugin calls the rest API (requires an API KEY) at <a href=\"https://verify.threatpoint.co.uk/api/v1/resources/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this ThreatPoint api endpoint</a><br />\nThe rest API is only passed the IP address from the client or X-Forwarded-For address(es) is present.<br />\nThis external service is called during any login attempts to the admin page. The plugin allows any page to be protected by simply entering the slug name on the setting page in the correct field (comma separated). Any custom page can be protected in this manner.<br />\nAn API key is required to utilise the service, although the plugin will operate without one it will not be able to pass the IP or call any data from the API. Your pages are NOT protected without a valid API key.</p>\n<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>The privacy policy for the api services is viewable here <a href=\"https://threatpoint.co.uk/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">privacy policy</a><br />\nThis plugin only passes IP information &#8211; no other PII is transferred. The IP address is analysed across the aggregated data within the ThreatPoint IP reputation service and a risk score with geo location information is returned to the plugin. Simple rules within the plugin dictate whether traffic should be allowed to continue as normal or be redirected to an information URL of your choice (set by through the plugin settings). The IP address is stored in the IP aggregated data and used as part of the consortium. No other data such as originating website is stored. Only the IP address and geo location information is held, with date, time and risk scores associated with the request.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Detects activity and IP reputation from the following sources:</li>\n<li>Tor exit node traffic</li>\n<li>Proxy (paid)</li>\n<li>Proxy (free)</li>\n<li>VPN (paid)</li>\n<li>VPN (free)</li>\n<li>Known Malicious Behaviour (Consortium)</li>\n<li>Brute force detection</li>\n<li>API Documentation is available here: <a href=\"https://threatpoint.co.uk/documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation</a></li>\n<li>Video is here <span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mub-Oa24b10?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide risk based decisions through configuration to allow an administrator the correct flow for their site.</li>\n<li>Consortium model of malicious IP&#8217;s created from activity seen across the ThreatPoint network</li>\n<li>Detect and block bots, malware, trojans and aggregators as well as malicious human traffic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Configuration Items</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>API Key &#8211; An API key is required to access the IP reputation service as explained above &#8211; (info@threatpoint.co.uk)</li>\n<li>Country Blacklist &#8211; 2 Character ISO country code csv format.
