        "faq": "\n<h4>How long time does it take to create a Prodii-profile?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It takes approximately 5 minutes when you import data from social media. We recommend you spend 5 minutes more to adjust information. Publish on a vanity-url and you have an online profile ready to pop up on search engines when somebody is searching for you. Remember to come back to keep your profile updated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it cost money to create a profile on Prodii?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do you make money? Do you sell my data to third parties?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We don’t use data trackers and we don’t sell data. Read about our data policy (link til: https://blog.prodii.com/en/the-prodii-solution/data-use/).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I need a social media profile to build a profile on prodii.com?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. You can enter data yourself or you can complete the team invitation provided to you by your team owner.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have changed my social media profile. How do I refresh my profile?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Data import takes your data from your social media and puts them in a “edit layer” from where you can accept the content you want transferred into your profile.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What information do you import from my social media?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We take data from your profile. Such as profile image, job title and bio. Depending on the media we import number of actions (how many times you have shared, liked, posted), hash tagged words (twitter).<br />\nNB! We do <em>not</em> import updates (comments, images, postings and the like).</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Which social media can I connect?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have started with the usual – and will continue to add media based on our users suggestions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linkedin: Basic API; name, title, image, bio, geo location</li>\n<li>XING: Most of your profile data</li>\n<li>Twitter: Name, image, bio, geo location, hashtags</li>\n<li>Slideshare: Name, title, image, bio, categories</li>\n<li>Delicious: Name, title, image, bio, categories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coming soon</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google+ and Youtube</li>\n<li>Coursera</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>5.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; The old data structure were designed to specific elements, but now we are introducing a new and more generic data structure.</li>\n<li>Modification &#8211; The media icons from Awesome Fonts is no longer used. Instead we hold all the icons from the media that we supports on prodii.com. The new icons is in colors, so if you are the developer of a Prodii template, you are free to show them as you like. With pure css you can choose to style the icon to show them in colors, white or any other color just as you like.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; We are now using the WP_Http class istead of using cURL directly, as WordPress recommend.</li>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Languages now covers bort speaking and writing abilities. So the old data structure languages.name and languages.longname is deprecated and languages.speakname, languages.speakname, languages.speakname and languages.speakname are now the new standard. Template developers can still use the old ones but we recommende use of the new data structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>5.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Depricated constructor format problem.</li>\n<li>Modification &#8211; &#8216;company&#8217; renamed to the more logical name &#8216;network&#8217; in order to reflect the purpose of this tool. Company in the shortcode is now depricated, but can still be used.</li>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Customer &#8216;Google Map key&#8217;-field introduced to the &#8216;Settings&#8217;-section.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Enhanced error handling added. The templates will be shown if it is possible, even if the shotcode has errors. If it is not possible, a proper error message will be show. In any error situation, an visible icon is shown on the template top to imply that you have an error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Had some problems showing the templates in special situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Prettyfy problem in the WordPress admin code generator.</li>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Added the ability to rate the plugin link from admin.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Some minor adjustments to improve stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; jQuery load problem resolved. Google map sensor parameter not needed anymore, thus removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Shortcode generator improved. Now the code generation of company-, team- and member-shortcodes are independant of each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.3.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; We are introducing two great new features for our paying customers:<br />\nChange language on your template.<br />\nThis is step 1 of enabling you to present in any language. In step 2 we will introduce google translate of free text.<br />\nRight now we provide English as main language and Portuguese, Danish as add ons</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.2.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Language handling for fixed textes introduced to this plugin. So now you can select among the languages supported by the template you are using. The default language is English(UK).<br />\nDublin and Dublinda are supporting the languages English(UK), Danish, Portuguese and French.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.1.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Change of system logic according to shortcodes and embedcodes. Therefore the shortcode and embedcode parameter level Teams has changed to Company.<br />\nSo updating now means you have to change level parameter for the company view. Now we also need the companyid before the teamids.<br />\nNow it is possible to show a company without teams.<br />\nWe made vanity system to show companies, teams and profiles with a pre selected template.<br />\nJust write eg.:<br />\nhttps://prodii.com/prodii/development &#8211; and you will see our Development team from Prodii with one template<br />\nand<br />\nhttps://prodii.com/prodii &#8211; and you will see Prodii with another template.<br />\nThe templates shown is the ones selected by the profile.<br />\nThere are much more combinations, go there and explore https://prodii.com. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Related posts error for users with several shortcodes and related posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Code generator Company error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Ajax problem resolved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; We have added an WP administration section, in order to help with shortcode creation.

These data can be viewed on prodii.com or retrieved using our API. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Now teams is shown in the same order as in shortcode or embedcode, instead of name alphabetic, which means you can control the team order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem resolved &#8211; Plugin installed on WordPress site located in subdomain error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Modification &#8211; Template runned from customers server is now possible, just by uploading your template to the Company Presentation plugin&#8217;s newly added &#8220;templates&#8221;-folder.</li>\n<li>The file structure has been changed in order to accommodate this new requirement.</li>\n<li>Company Presentation plugin, detects if a certain template exists on the customers server.
