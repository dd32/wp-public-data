For your convenience, this list is sorted in descending order according to the number of keywords that have rankings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keyword changes over time</strong><br />\nThis chart shows how the number of TOP-ranking keywords has changed over time. It helps you monitor all position changes in Google 1-100 organic search results for your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keyword rankings</strong><br />\nUsing the Semalt SEO plugin, you can easily check the number of keywords that your website ranks for in Google 1-100 organic search results and compare these data with those you have received earlier.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Use our handy filters to get the data you need.</em></strong><br />\nYou can classify the data by various criteria, including the keywords, the URL of a website, rankings in TOP 1-100, and position changes. For instance, you can filter out all the existing pages that rank for a keyword that has the word “buy” in its structure and have TOP positions in Google.</p>\n<p><strong>2. BEST PAGES</strong><br />\nThis section shows the pages that drive the highest share of organic traffic to your website. Make sure to pay special attention to them &#8211; fix all the existing SEO errors, add unique content, and promote these pages to attract more organic traffic to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Best page changes over time</strong><br />\nThis chart shows how the number of web pages that rank in Google TOP has changed over time. By switching the scale, you can view the data for a week or a month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Difference in performance</strong><br />\nThis section shows the number of website pages in Google 1-100 organic search results as opposed to an earlier date. By switching the scale, you can check the difference for a week or a month.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword stats for the selected pages</strong><br />\nThis chart shows the changes in the number of keywords that the selected pages have been ranking for previously.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pages in TOP</strong><br />\nThe table shows the number of keywords that the given page has been ranking for in Google TOP for the selected dates.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Use filters to check the data you need.</em></strong><br />\nYou can filter the best pages list by the whole URL or its part. You can also select the pages that have entered Google 1-100.</p>\n<p><strong>3. COMPETITORS</strong><br />\nThis section shows all the websites that rank in Google 1-100 for the keywords similar to those your website ranks for. Find out what position your website holds among your competitors by the number of all keywords in TOP-100.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Position in competitors rank</strong><br />\nHere’s the position your website holds among your competitors by the number of all keywords in TOP-100.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shared keywords</strong><br />\nThe blocks below show the number of shared keywords that your website and your TOP 500 competitors rank for on Google.

You can also select the websites that have entered TOP 1-100.</p>\n<p><strong>4. PAGESPEED BOOST</strong><br />\nThe common reason that lies behind website slowness is large and not-optimized images. There might be product photos, infographics, illustrated instructions, how-to images, and others. That is why the Pagespeed Boost tool is a great solution for those looking to optimize their images in a quick and effective way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Image CDN</strong><br />\nIn the era of smartphones and mobile Internet, it’s important to make sure that your website images load in a flash. This is crucial for e-commerce websites because customers always want to view products from all angles. The Semalt SEO plugin uses a CDN to ensure the lightning-fast website image loading. A CDN (content delivery network) is our network of servers located around the globe that can help deliver content to your site users almost instantly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How it works:</strong><br />\nWe determine the location of the user so that images are delivered from a geographically closer server. Besides, when the user requests an image on his or her device (by simply opening one of your website’s pages), we cache this image. So, when another user requests the same image on a similar device, we can deliver the pre-cached image almost immediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Image optimization</strong><br />\nThe Pagespeed Boost tool can find and analyze all the images on your website without you lifting a finger. Enable image optimization to make sure all the images that you upload to your site are automatically optimized to meet Google search engine requirements. You don’t have to use third-party image compression tools. Pagespeed Boost can do this in background mode as you upload images to your WordPress admin panel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resized images</strong><br />\nWordPress generates resized versions of each image, which is why the Pagespeed Boost tool has a lot of work to do. Enable optimization for resized image versions to make sure your website’s loading speed is not compromised. This is especially important if you can’t find all the resized images created by WordPress. After installing the Semalt SEO plugin, you will never worry about this again as the Pagespeed Boost tool will do everything for you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why choose our Semalt SEO plugin</h3>\n<p>✔ All-in-one SEO tool for WordPress websites</p>\n<p>✔ The most recent analytical data</p>\n<p>✔ User-friendly interface</p>\n<p>✔ The detailed graphics</p>\n<p>✔ A lot of data filters</p>\n<p>✔ Regular updates and new features</p>\n<p>✔ This plugin is free-of-charge</p>\n<h3>How to install the Semalt SEO plugin</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Select &#8216;Plugins &gt; Add New&#8217; in your WordPress admin panel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter &#8216;Semalt SEO&#8217; in the search field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install the Semalt SEO plugin once you have found it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then activate the Semalt SEO on your Plugins page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voila!
