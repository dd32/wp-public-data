Most systems have the required packages installed already, but if you notice any errors upon plugin activation, first check to ensure your system&#8217;s <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.include-path\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PHP include path</a> is set correctly. The <code>lib</code> directory and its required files look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>lib\nâ”œâ”€â”€ OAuthWP.php\nâ”œâ”€â”€ OAuthWP_WordPressDotCom.php\nâ”œâ”€â”€ WPCrosspostAPIClient.php\nâ”œâ”€â”€ httpclient\nâ”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE.txt\nâ”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ http.php\nâ””â”€â”€ oauth_api\n    â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE\n    â””â”€â”€ oauth_client.php\n</code></pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s also possible that your system administrator will apply updates to one or more of the core system packages this plugin uses without your knowledge. If this happens, and the updated packages contain backward-incompatible changes, the plugin may begin to issue errors. Should this occur, please <a href=\"https://github.com/meitar/wp-crosspost/issues/new\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">file a bug report on the WP-Crosspost project&#8217;s issue tracker</a>.</p>\n",
        "faq": "\n<h4>\nCan I specify a post&#8217;s tags or categories?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WordPress&#8217;s tags and categories are also crossposted to your other WordPress sites. If you&#8217;d like to keep your local WordPress tags or categories separate from your crossposted ones, be certain you&#8217;ve enabled the &#8220;Do not send post tags in crossposts&#8221; or &#8220;Do not send post categories in crossposts&#8221; setting.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the &#8220;Automatically add these tags to all crossposts&#8221; setting lets you enter a comma-separated list of tags that will always be applied to your crossposts.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I crosspost older WordPress posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Go edit the desired post, verify the crosspost option is set to <code>Yes</code>, and update the post. WP-Crosspost will keep the original post date.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nWhat if I edit a post that has been cross-posted?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you edit or delete a post, changes will appear on the remote site accordingly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nCan I cross-post Private posts?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. WP-Crosspost respects the WordPress post visibility setting and supports cross-posting private posts. Editing the visibility setting of your WordPress post will update your remote site&#8217;s cross-posted entry with the new setting, as well.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs WP-Crosspost available in languages other than English?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not yet, but with your help it can be. To help translate the plugin into your language, please <a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-crosspost/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sign up as a translator on WP-Crosspost&#8217;s Transifex project page</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",

For Tumblr Crosspostr&#8217;s <code>rel-syndication</code> to work, you must also install a compatible WordPress syndication links plugin, such as the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/\" rel=\"ugc\">Syndication Links</a> plugin, but the absence of such a plugin will not cause any problems, either.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Bugfix: Consistent post meta field names resolve several issues where previously-crossposted entries were not found or had incorrect syndication links associated with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Version 0.3.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/seems-to-work-better-than-other-plugins-but\" rel=\"ugc\">Bugfix</a>: Respect &#8220;Do not send post categories in crossposts&#8221; option.

Your support is appreciated!</p>\n<p>This plugin is inspired by and based on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tumblr-crosspostr/\" rel=\"ugc\">Tumblr Crosspostr</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Full feature list</strong></p>\n<p>WP-Crosspost turns your self-hosted WordPress blog into the back-end of one of your WordPress.com sites. Crossposting between self-hosted WordPress blogs is <em>theoretically</em> supported (but untested) if you have <a href=\"https://jetpack.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">JetPack</a> installed and enabled on the remote self-hosted WordPress blog.</p>\n<p>You can crosspost (push):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posts (of <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><em>any</em> type</a>, including <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pages</a> and custom post types). Pushed data includes the post&#8217;s:\n<ul>\n<li>date</li>\n<li>title</li>\n<li>status and visibility settings (including the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Password_Protection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post password</a> if set and whether or not the post is currently in the trash)</li>\n<li>format</li>\n<li>tags</li>\n<li>categories</li>\n<li>slug</li>\n<li>whether comments are on or off</li>\n<li>whether <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Pingback\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pingbacks</a> are on or off</li>\n<li>whether the post is <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Sticky_Posts\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">sticky</a></li>\n<li>featured image,</li>\n<li>content</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Excerpt\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">excerpt</a>,</li>\n<li>image attachments, along with the actual image media file itself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some notes on crossposting (push-posting):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you update a post on the remote site (such as on WordPress.com), the change will not be pulled back automatically, so always prefer to use your self-hosted WordPress blog to make changes.</li>\n<li>When you upload a file to your Media Library, it will not be crossposted to the remote site&#8217;s Media Library until and unless you attach it to a post and save the post.</li>\n<li>The URLs of images and other media files will be automatically rewritten to reference the remote site&#8217;s copy, so always use <em>local</em> URLs in your posts. (Let the plugin handle media URLs itself.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When sync&#8217;ing is enabled, you will import (pull):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posts (of any type, including pages and custom post types), including the post&#8217;s:\n<ul>\n<li>date</li>\n<li>title</li>\n<li>content</li>\n<li>excerpt</li>\n<li>status and visibility settings (including the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Password_Protection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post password</a> if set and whether or not the post is currently in the trash),</li>\n<li>whether comments are on or off</li>\n<li>whether <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Pingback\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pingbacks</a> are on or off</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.wordpress.com/geotagging/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">geolocation</a></li>\n<li>featured images</li>\n<li>media attachments, along with the actual media file itself</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wondering if WP-Crosspost can do something you don&#8217;t see on this list? Ask about or search for it in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-crosspost\" rel=\"ugc\">WP-Crosspost plugin support forum</a>! Also, I&#8217;m just one guy working on this whenever I get the time to, so I prioritize the most often requested features. If your feature isn&#8217;t high on my list, please be patient or, better yet, <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=meitarm%40gmail%2ecom&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=WP%20Crosspost%20WordPress%20Plugin&amp;item_number=wp%2dcrosspost&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">donate to support my work on this plugin</a> so that I have more time to devote to this work.
