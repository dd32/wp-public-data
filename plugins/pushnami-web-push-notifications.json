With Pushnami’s browser-based push notifications, you can deliver your message through desktop and mobile browsers with ease. Users opt-in with a single click, no email address required.</p>\n<p>Once installed on your WordPress site, your visitors opt-in to receive notifications with one easy step. Once subscribed, you have the ability to send them content or updates to their device at any time, regardless of if they’re on your website or not.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pushnami.com/publishers/?utm_medium=plugin&amp;utm_source=wordpress&amp;campaignid=undefined&amp;utm_campaign=directory\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pushnomics</a>, what we call our machine learning technology, enables you to automate your send strategy by optimizing which messages and offers should be sent to each individual subscriber. When you attempt to manually optimize your campaigns with other providers you’re typically able to make small improvements, but with Pushnomics on your side, you can automate your workflows to ensure that you’re not leaving potential dollars on the table.</p>\n<p>Pushnami can help your organization push content including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abandoned cart/abandoned form reminders</li>\n<li>Promotions (discounts, exclusive offers, free trials, etc.)</li>\n<li>New product or blog post announcements </li>\n<li>Event and webinar registration sign-ups</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Company</h4>\n<p>Pushnami was founded in Austin, TX in 2017 to help solve a common issue many marketers were facing: traditional channels were drying up and brands needed new ways to message and monetize their online audience.
