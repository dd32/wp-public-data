Composer is a dead simple JSON-based dependency manager for PHP. For more information, check out <a href=\"http://getcomposer.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http://getcomposer.org/</a>.</p>\n<h3>So this is complete Composer support?</h3>\n<p>No, not exactly! Sadly, I&#8217;m building this out and I&#8217;m trying to make some sweet WP-CLI and Composer integration. But for now, we only support a few command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>install</li>\n<li>update</li>\n<li>diagnose</li>\n<li>help</li>\n<li>status</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;d love to help out, please help! Make a pull request and let&#8217;s get coding!</p>\n<h3>How do I build Composer Management inside of my plugin?</h3>\n<p>Simple really! You just create a simple <code>composer.json</code> file like you would with any Composer project. From there, wp-composer will interface with each plugin/theme that has composer support and it will generate the autoload files, too!</p>\n<p>Just include something like this inside your main plugin file:</p>\n<pre><code>require(__DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php');\n</code></pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple.</p>\n",
