Just as with any other custom post type, you can export WooCommerce orders with the free version of WP All Export. However, the order item data is stored by WooCommerce in several custom database tables and this custom data is only accessible with WP All Export Pro.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pass data through custom PHP functions:</strong> With WP All Export Pro you can pass your data through a custom function before it is added to your export file. This will allow you to manipulate your data any way you see fit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Guaranteed technical support via e-mail.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wpallimport.com/upgrade-to-wp-all-export-pro/?utm_source=export-plugin-free&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=premium-support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to the Pro edition of WP All Export.</a></p>\n<h4>Automatic Scheduling</h4>\n<p>A new service from Soflyy, Automatic Scheduling provides a simple interface for setting exports to run on a schedule. The service will make sure that your exports start on time and that they successfully complete without the need to set up individual cron jobs.</p>\n<p>It costs $19/mo and can be used with WP All Export and WP All Import. You can set up as many exports and imports on as many sites as you like.</p>\n<p><strong>What information is shared with Soflyy?</strong> If you set an export to run on a schedule, WP All Export will open an encrypted connection to Soflyy servers. It will send the license key, site URL, ID of the export you want to run, export security key, and times that you want the export to run.</p>\n<h4>WordPress CSV Exports</h4>\n<p>A CSV is a very simple type of spreadsheet file where each column is separated by a comma. With WP All Export you can very easily set up a WordPress CSV export and control the order and title of the columns.</p>\n<p>Very often you&#8217;ll want to edit your data with Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, or maybe something else. This is why a CSV export is so powerful &#8211; all spreadsheet software can read, edit, and save CSV files. WP All Export allows you edit your WordPress data using whatever spreadsheet software you are most comfortable with.</p>\n<h4>WordPress XML Exports</h4>\n<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll want to export your data so that some other tool, software, or service can use it. Very often they will require your data to be formatted as an XML file. XML is very similar to HTML, but you don&#8217;t need to know anything about that in order to set up an XML export with WP All Export.</p>\n<p>If you want to set up a WordPress XML export all you need to do is select &#8216;XML&#8217; when configuring your export template. And just like a CSV export, an XML export will allow you to customize the element names and put them in any order you wish.</p>\n<h4>Related Plugins</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/\" rel=\"ugc\">Import any XML or CSV File to WordPress</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-xml-csv-product-import/\" rel=\"ugc\">Import Products from any XML or CSV to WooCommerce</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-export-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">Export Products to CSV/XML for WooCommerce</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-product-tabs-wp-all-import-add-on/\" rel=\"ugc\">Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce WP All Import Add-on</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/order-export-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"ugc\">Export Orders to CSV/XML for WooCommerce</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-wp-users-xml-csv/\" rel=\"ugc\">Export WordPress Users to CSV/XML</a></p>\n<h4>Related Tutorials</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-export-woocommerce-products-to-google-merchant-center/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Export WooCommerce Products to Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping)</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-export-gravity-form-entries-to-csv-or-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Export Gravity Forms Entries</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/toolset-types-export-csv-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Export Toolset Types to CSV, XML, or Excel</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-export-woocommerce-variable-products/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Export WooCommerce Variable Products</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/export-wordpress-posts/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Export Blogs, Articles, Posts, Standard Post Data, Permalinks, Excerpts, Captions, Menus, Subscriptions, and Other Details From Your Websites</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/export-wordpress-comments-csv-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How To Export WordPress Comments</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-export-woocommerce-coupons-to-csv-or-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How To Export WooCommerce Coupons</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-export-woocommerce-reviews-to-csv-or-xml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How To Export WooCommerce Reviews</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-schedule-wordpress-exports/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Schedule Your Exports to Run Automatically</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/how-to-migrate-woocommerce-and-wordpress-data/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Migrate WooCommerce and WordPress From One Host to Another</a></p>\n<h3>Premium Support</h3>\n<p>Upgrade to the Pro edition of WP All Export for premium support.</p>\n<p>E-mail: support@wpallimport.com</p>\n",
