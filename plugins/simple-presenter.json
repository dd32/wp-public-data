Just make sure to change the slide length to the length of the video and put a YouTube/Vimeo/etc. embed code in the custom HTML field.</p>\n<p>Some gotchas:<br />\n&#8211; Make sure to enable autoplay in the embed, or the video won&#8217;t play (for YouTube, this means adding &amp;autoplay=1 to the end of the URL)</p>\n</p>\n\n",
