So an URL like &#8216;http://zafrira.net/?p=1466&#8217; with<br />\nthe name &#8216;affiliate test link&#8217; would result in the following shortcode:<br />\n    [afflink url=&#8221;http://zafrira.net/?p=1466&#8243; name=&#8221;affiliate test link&#8221;]</p>\n",

Please check this before you use it.<br />\nAlso in some cases it might not be allowed by your affiliate link provider.<br />\nPlease be wise and check this! I do not have a list of countries where it is allowed and<br />\nwhere not.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
