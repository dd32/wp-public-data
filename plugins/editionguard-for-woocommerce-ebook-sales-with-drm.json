        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20editionguard%3F'>\nWhat is EditionGuard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>EditionGuard is a secure and robust eBook DRM (digital rights management) service, based on the industry standard Adobe Content Server.</p>\n<p>The aim of our service is to provide publishers of all sizes with a cost-effective and easy to use DRM system without the usually large capital and time investments required.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20need%20to%20use%20editionguard%3F'>\nWhy would I need to use EditionGuard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Typically, eBook DRM systems have very high capital and operational costs associated with them. Not only would you have to pay for costly server software licenses, you would also need to setup and manage your own IT infrastructure consisting of various expensive server hardware and software software.</p>\n<p>Also, the software components of a DRM system are usually quite complex and low-level. What this means is that you’re expected to develop and integrate your own management and business logic layers on top of the DRM system to utilize it comprehensively. While this structure allows for lots of flexibility, we found that most of our clients really want to perform some simple tasks easily, without having to dabble in all the technical details involved.</p>\n<p>These are the main reasons we created EditionGuard. We want to provide you with a cost-effective and easy to manage DRM system, while still maintaining the robust and flexible infrastructure present in its core by basing the system on industry standard technologies.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='who%20is%20using%20editionguard%3F'>\nWho is using EditionGuard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Our service is being used by a wide range of eBook publishers, distributors and authors. Examples of some of our client profiles are as follows;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bookstore chains who wish to offer eBooks securely to their clients through the web,</li>\n<li>Self publishers who want to put up their eBooks on their blogs securely,</li>\n<li>E-Commerce sites with a wide range of products wanting to include eBooks in their product range,</li>\n<li>Publishing Houses of all sizes wanting to publish and distribute their titles online,</li>\n<li>Government institutions with a desire to sell their publications digitally through their portals</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='more%20questions%3F'>\nMore questions?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please visit the <a href=\"http://www.editionguard.com/help#faq\" title=\"EditionGuard FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">our official FAQ</a> or feel free to <a href=\"mailto:&#x73;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#105;t&#x69;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x75;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x2e;&#099;&#111;&#109;\" title=\"Contact EditionGuard Support\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact us</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
