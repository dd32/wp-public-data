        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%203d%20model%20formats%20are%20supported%3F'>\nWhat 3D model formats are supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>AR for WordPress and AR for WooCommerce display your 3D models using an iOS App built using Apple’s ARkit software. This system supports the use of GLb/GLTF and USDZ/REALITY file formats. You can also use DAE, DXF, 3DS, OBJ, PDF, PLY, STL, or Zipped versions of these files which will be automatically converted to GLB format.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20it%20support%20android%20and%20ios%3F'>\nDoes it support Android and iOS?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin uses the model-viewer scripts which supports most iOS and Android devices. Viewing of the models in 3D is done directly in the browser and launches the native Android WebXR and iOS Quick Look apps for AR viewing. For optimum performance it requires your site to have an SSL certificate (https://).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20there%20any%20additional%20costs%3F'>\nAre there any additional costs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you use the free version of the plugins then there are no costs involved, however you will have limitations to the number of 3D models you can have on your site and the features for manipulating your model display are limited.</p>\n<p>If you use a premium version of the plugins then there is a monthly subscription fee for the plugin to support unlimited models and to access the full feature set for the duration of your subscription. https://augmentedrealityplugins.com</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20don%27t%20have%20any%203d%20models%3F'>\nWhat if I don&#8217;t have any 3D models?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you don’t have 3D models there are a number of solutions available to you, including downloading existing models from online libraries, creating your own models using your mobile phone or tablet’s cameras or commissioning a 3D model to be created. Please visit our 3D Model Resources section for more details. https://augmentedrealityplugins.com/support/#3d</p>\n</p>\n\n",
