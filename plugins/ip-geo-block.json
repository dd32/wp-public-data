This brings a smart and powerful methods named as &#8220;<strong>WP Zero-day Exploit Prevention</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>WP Metadata Exploit Protection</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Combined with those methods and IP address geolocation, you&#8217;ll be surprised to find a bunch of malicious or undesirable access blocked in the logs of this plugin after several days of installation.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Privacy by design:</strong><br />\nIP address is always encrypted on recording in logs/cache. Moreover, it can be anonymized and restricted on sending to the 3rd parties such as geolocation APIs or whois service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Immigration control:</strong><br />\nAccess to the basic and important entrances into back-end such as <code>wp-comments-post.php</code>, <code>xmlrpc.php</code>, <code>wp-login.php</code>, <code>wp-signup.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin-ajax.php</code>, <code>wp-admin/admin-post.php</code> will be validated by means of a country code based on IP address. It allows you to configure either whitelist or blacklist to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements\" title=\"ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">specify the countires</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\" title=\"Classless Inter-Domain Routing - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CIDR notation</a> for a range of IP addresses and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)\" title=\"Autonomous system (Internet) - Wikipedia\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AS number</a> for a group of IP networks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Zero-day Exploit Prevention:</strong><br />\nUnlike other security firewalls based on attack patterns (vectors), the original feature &#8220;<strong>W</strong>ord<strong>P</strong>ress <strong>Z</strong>ero-day <strong>E</strong>xploit <strong>P</strong>revention&#8221; (WP-ZEP) is focused on patterns of vulnerability. It is simple but still smart and strong enough to block any malicious accesses to <code>wp-admin/*.php</code>, <code>plugins/*.php</code> and <code>themes/*.php</code> even from the permitted countries. It will protect your site against certain types of attack such as CSRF, LFI, SQLi, XSS and so on, <strong>even if you have some vulnerable plugins and themes in your site</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Guard against login attempts:</strong><br />\nIn order to prevent hacking through the login form and XML-RPC by brute-force and the reverse-brute-force attacks, the number of login attempts will be limited per IP address even from the permitted countries.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minimize server load against brute-force attacks:</strong><br />\nYou can configure this plugin as a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins\" title=\"Must Use Plugins &laquo; WordPress Codex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Must Use Plugins</a> so that this plugin can be loaded prior to regular plugins. It can massively <a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/validation-timing.html\" title=\"Validation timing | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">reduce the load on server</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prevent malicious down/uploading:</strong><br />\nA malicious request such as exposing <code>wp-config.php</code> or uploading malwares via vulnerable plugins/themes can be blocked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Block badly-behaved bots and crawlers:</strong><br />\nA simple logic may help to reduce the number of rogue bots and crawlers scraping your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Support of BuddyPress and bbPress:</strong><br />\nYou can configure this plugin so that a registered user can login as a membership from anywhere, while a request such as a new user registration, lost password, creating a new topic and subscribing comment can be blocked by country. It is suitable for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/\" title=\"BuddyPress &mdash; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">BuddyPress</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/\" title=\"WordPress &rsaquo; bbPress &laquo; WordPress Plugins\" rel=\"ugc\">bbPress</a> to help reducing spams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Referrer suppressor for external links:</strong><br />\nWhen you click an external hyperlink on admin screens, http referrer will be eliminated to hide a footprint of your site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple source of IP Geolocation databases:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.maxmind.com\" title=\"MaxMind - IP Geolocation and Online Fraud Prevention\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">MaxMind GeoLite2 free databases</a> (it requires PHP 5.4.0+) and <a href=\"https://www.ip2location.com/\" title=\"IP Address Geolocation to Identify Website Visitor's Geographical Location\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IP2Location LITE databases</a> can be installed in this plugin.

        "faq": "\n<h4>Does the site using this plugin comply with GDPR?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is designed based on the principle of &#8220;Privacy by design&#8221; so that you can compliantly run it to GDPR. As guarding against personal data breach, IP addresses in this plugin are encrypted and also can be anonymized by default. It also provides some functions not only to manually erase them but also to automatically remove them when those are exceeded a certain amount/time.</p>\n<p>However, these are the part of GDPR requirements and do not guarantee that the site is compliant with GDPR. Refer to <a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-3.0.11.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">3.0.11 release note</a> for details.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin support multisite?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. You can synchronize the settings with all the sites on the network when you activate on network and enable &#8220;<strong>Network wide settings</strong>&#8221; in &#8220;<strong>Plugin settings</strong>&#8221; section.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin works well with caching?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The short answer is <strong>YES</strong>, especially for the purpose of security e.g. blocking malicious access both on the back-end and on the front-end.</p>\n<p>You can find the long answer and the compatibility list of cache plugins at &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/living-with-caching-plugin.html\" title=\"Compatibility with cache plugins | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Compatibility with cache plugins</a>&#8220;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I still have access from blacklisted country. Does it work correctly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Absolutely, YES.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a Wordfence Security user would report this type of claim when he/she found some accesses in its Live traffic view. But please don&#8217;t worry. Before WordPress runs, Wordfence cleverly filters out malicious requests to your site using <a href=\"https://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file\" title=\"PHP: Description of core php.ini directives - Manual\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">auto_prepend_file</a> directive to include PHP based Web Application Firewall. Then this plugin validates the rest of the requests that pass over Wordfence because those were not in WAF rules, especially you enables &#8220;<strong>Prevent Zero-day Exploit</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>It would also possibly be caused by the accuracy of country code in the geolocation databases. Actually, there is a case that a same IP address has different country code.</p>\n<p>For more detail, please refer to &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/access-from-blacklisted-country.html\" title=\"I still have access from blacklisted country. | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">I still have access from blacklisted country.</a>&#8220;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I test this plugin works?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The easiest way is to use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=free+proxy+browser+addon\" title=\"free proxy browser addon - Google Search\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free proxy browser addon</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one is to use <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=browser+add+on+modify+http+header\" title=\"browser add on modify http header - Google Search\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http header browser addon</a>.</p>\n<p>You can add an IP address to the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header to emulate the access behind the proxy. In this case, you should add <code>HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR</code> into the &#8220;<strong>$_SERVER keys for extra IPs</strong>&#8221; on &#8220;<strong>Settings</strong>&#8221; tab.</p>\n<p>See more details at &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/#how-to-test-prevention-of-attacks\" title=\"Codex | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to test prevention of attacks</a>&#8220;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m locked out! What shall I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Please find the solution in <a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/quick-recovery-from-blockig-on-login-page.html\" title=\"Quick recovery from blocking on your login page | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Quick recovery from blocking on your login page</a> at first.</p>\n<p>You can also find another solution by editing &#8220;<strong>Emergent Functionality</strong>&#8221; code section near the bottom of <code>ip-geo-block.php</code>. This code block can be activated by replacing <code>/*</code> (opening multi-line comment) at the top of the line to <code>//</code> (single line comment), or <code>*</code> at the end of the line to <code>*/</code> (closing multi-line comment).</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Invalidate blocking behavior in case yourself is locked out.\n *\n * How to use: Activate the following code and upload this file via FTP.\n */\n/* -- ADD '/' TO THE TOP OR END OF THIS LINE TO ACTIVATE THE FOLLOWINGS -- */\nfunction ip_geo_block_emergency( $validate, $settings ) {\n    $validate['result'] = 'passed';\n    return $validate;\n}\nadd_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login', 'ip_geo_block_emergency', 1, 2 );\nadd_filter( 'ip-geo-block-admin', 'ip_geo_block_emergency', 1, 2 );\n// */\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please not that you have to use an <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_Files#Using_Text_Editors\" title=\"Editing Files &laquo; WordPress Codex\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">appropriate editor</a>.</p>\n<p>After saving and uploading it to <code>/wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block/</code> on your server via FTP, you become to be able to login again as an admin.</p>\n<p>Remember that you should upload the original one after re-configuration to deactivate this feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/what-should-i-do-when-i-m-locked-out.html\" title=\"What should I do when I'm locked out? | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">This document</a> can also help you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do I have to turn on all the selection to enhance security?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Roughly speaking, the strategy of this plugin has been constructed as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Block by country</strong><br />\nIt blocks malicious requests from outside your country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Prevent Zero-day Exploit</strong><br />\nIt blocks malicious requests from your country.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Force to load WP core</strong><br />\nIt blocks the request which has not been covered in the above two.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bad signatures in query</strong><br />\nIt blocks the request which has not been covered in the above three.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please try &#8220;<strong>Best for Back-end</strong>&#8221; button at the bottom of this plugin&#8217;s setting page for easy setup. And also see more details in &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/the-best-practice-for-target-settings.html\" title=\"The best practice of target settings | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The best practice of target settings</a>&#8220;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin validate all the requests?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. This plugin can&#8217;t handle the requests that are not parsed by WordPress. In other words, a standalone file (PHP, CGI or something excutable) that is unrelated to WordPress can&#8217;t be validated by this plugin even if it is in the WordPress install directory.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;re exceptions: When you enable &#8220;<strong>Force to load WP core</strong>&#8221; for <strong>Plugins area</strong> or <strong>Themes area</strong>, a standalone PHP file becomes to be able to be blocked. Sometimes this kind of file has some vulnerabilities. This function protects your site against such a case.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to resolve &#8220;Sorry, your request cannot be accepted.&#8221;?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you encounter this message, please refer to <a href=\"https://www.ipgeoblock.com/codex/you-are-not-allowed-to-access.html\" title=\"Why &ldquo;Sorry, your request cannot be accepted&rdquo; ? | IP Geo Block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this document</a> to resolve your blocking issue.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t solve your issue, please let me know about it on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ip-geo-block/\" title=\"View: Plugin Support &laquo;  WordPress.org Forums\" rel=\"ugc\">support forum</a>.
