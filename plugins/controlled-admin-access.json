        "description": "<p>Give a temporary limited admin. access to themes designers, plugins developers and support agents.</p>\n<p>The plugin is simple and clean, it helps the administrator to create a user with a temporary access and choose which pages in your admin area which you don&#8217;t want the user to access. send the details to the user and when he finished his task, you can easily deactivate the account and activate it later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpruby.com/plugin/controlled-admin-access-pro?utm_source=lite&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=freetopro\" title=\"Upgrade to Controlled Admin Access Pro\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Upgrade to Pro Now</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpruby.com/knowledgebase_category/controlled-admin-access-pro/\" title=\"Documentation \" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<h3>Menu Filter</h3>\n<p>The plugin will allow you to select admin menu items that you want to restrict for the created admin. Not only the plugin will hide the menu item from the admin but it also will block the page if they access it in some other way.</p>\n<h3>Expiration Time</h3>\n<p>You may don’t want to give access indefinitely, the plugin allows you to set an expiration time for the restricted admin account. After the account expires, the account will no longer be able to login into the admin dashboard. Moreover, you can always extend the expiry time or change it.</p>\n<h3>Hide Admin Bar</h3>\n<p>WordPress offers an admin bar to provide quick access to some pages or to perform some actions. Using the plugin, you can hide the admin bar links at the top of the page will be hidden in both the frontend and admin areas.</p>\n<h3>Disable Access</h3>\n<p>You can always disable the restricted admin account at any time. For example, if you gave a developer access to fix a bug or install a theme, when they finish the task you can disable their account. This will block login in using the account but it will retain the account’s information in case you wanted to give them access in the future.</p>\n<h3>Pro Features</h3>\n<h3>Plugins Internal Pages</h3>\n<p>Take more control and restrict access to plugins’ internal pages. For example, you would like to give access to the WooCommerce Settings page, but you do not want the account to see the Payments Gateways tab. Currently, the plugin supports WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads and BuddyPress. In the future, we will add support for more plugins.</p>\n<h3>No Password Login</h3>\n<p>Add some convenience when sending access to the user, you can generate a secure login URL for the user, and the user will use the link to login into the dashboard without the need for a password. You can also disable login by a password for restricted admins, this will restrict the admin from login in using a password or sending a reset password email.</p>\n<h3>Activity Log</h3>\n<p>Keep track of what restricted admins have done while logged in, the plugin will log more than 20 actions such as activating/deactivating/deleting a plugin, switching a theme, deleting a theme, exporting data, publishing/deleting a post and uploading a file.</p>\n<h3>Remote Logout</h3>\n<p>At any given time, you can force logging out any restricted admin if you no longer need them logged in the admin dashboard. This action will log them out on all logged-in devices and locations.</p>\n",
