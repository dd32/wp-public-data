A simple click on a link and your post will be scheduled<br />\nfor a future date based on a set of simple rules that you set up.</p>\n<p>I use this on a blog of mine where I write several posts at a time and want to<br />\nspread them out rather than publishing them all at the same time.  Future posts<br />\nare great for this, but I found myself going back and forth to the calendar<br />\nto schedule.</p>\n<p>When activated the plugin adds an &#8220;Auto&#8221; link right next to the link that you<br />\nuse to schedule a future post.  Clicking on the Auto link makes an Ajax call that<br />\nwill set the date for your post at some point in the future, using rules that you<br />\nset.</p>\n<p>More information at <a href=\"http://www.nutt.net/tag/auto-future-date/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Nutt.net</a></p>\n",
