        "faq": "\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%20without%20rank%20math%3F'>\nCan I use the plugin without Rank Math?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you absolutely can. You can use the Instant Indexing plugin with any SEO plugin you like. But, we recommend using the Instant Indexing API plugin with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/\" rel=\"ugc\">Rank Math SEO</a> for best results.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20submit%20pages%20that%20do%20not%20have%20job%20posting%20or%20livestream%20structured%20data%3F'>\nCan I submit pages that do not have Job Posting or Livestream structured data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Although the Google Indexing API officially supports pages containing Job Posting and Livestream structured data &#8211; it is officially recommended to use only on such websites. But, it can be used with any website. But, do proceed with caution if you are not comfortable with this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20my%20pages%20and%20posts%20get%20indexed%20instantly%3F'>\nWill my pages and posts get indexed instantly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Technically, yes. That&#8217;s what the plugin is made to do. But, please note that we guarantee instant crawling using this plugin. Whether or not Google will index your content after crawling is and always will be in Google&#8217;s control. They have the final say in what they want to appear in their SERPs and what they don&#8217;t.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
