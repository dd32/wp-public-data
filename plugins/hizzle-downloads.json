This information is available in the Noptin dashboard, where you can see a list of all your downloadable files and their download stats. You can also see which users have downloaded the files, and view their information and activity in your mailing list. This can be useful for tracking the popularity of your files and understanding which users are interested in them.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20restrict%20downloads%20by%20user%20role%20or%20newsletter%20subscription%20status%3F'>\nCan I restrict downloads by user role or newsletter subscription status?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, Noptin allows you to restrict downloads by user role or newsletter subscription status. This means that you can choose which users are able to download your files, based on their user role on your website or their status as a newsletter subscriber. For example, you can make a file available only to users who are registered as members on your website, or only to users who have subscribed to your newsletter. This can be useful for creating exclusive content or offers for your users, and for encouraging people to sign up for your newsletter. You can set these restrictions for each of your downloadable files in the Noptin settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20display%20downloadable%20files%3F'>\nHow do I display downloadable files?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the <code>[hizzle-downloads]</code> shortcode to display all the downloadable files that the current user has access to.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20get%20in%20touch%3F'>\nHow can I get in touch?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https://hizzle.co/contact-us/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact form on our website</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20contribute%3F'>\nHow can I contribute?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are a lot of ways to contribute to this plugin:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Star the plugin on <a href=\"https://github.com/hizzle-co/hizzle-downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hizzle-co/hizzle-downloads/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Clone the plugin,</a> make improvements to the code and send us a <a href=\"https://github.com/hizzle-co/hizzle-downloads/pulls\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pull request</a> so that we can share your improvements with the world.</li>\n<li>Give us a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hizzle-downloads/reviews/?filter=5\" rel=\"ugc\">5* rating</a> on WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20work%20with%20my%20theme%3F'>\nWill this work with my theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yeah.
