So if you&#8217;re using a LiteSpeed based web host, you need to install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/\" rel=\"ugc\">LiteSpeed Cache plugin</a> before installing Fresh Forms for Gravity.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20to%20enable%20acf%20support'>\nI want to enable ACF support\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>ACF fields of the following types are supported as standalone fields and also as subfields of a Flexible Content or Repeater field: Text, Text Area, WYSIWYG. But this is disabled by default.</p>\n<p>To enable ACF support go to the settings page at Forms &gt; Settings &gt; Fresh Forms.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='i%20want%20fresh%20forms%20to%20run%20for%20certain%20posts%20where%20i%27m%20embedding%20forms%20using%20an%20embed%20method%20that%20is%20not%20supported.'>\nI want Fresh Forms to run for certain posts where I&#8217;m embedding forms using an embed method that is not supported.\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Starting with Fresh Forms 1.5 you can add a list of pages or posts IDs where you would like to force Fresh Forms to run by going to Forms &gt; Settings &gt; Fresh Forms.</p>\n<p>You could also add the freshforms_post_has_gform filter in your theme functions.php file or a custom fucntionatliy plugin to pass Fresh Forms an array containing the ID of the pages/posts where you want it to run without performing the usual automatic detection of forms.</p>\n<p>The following example would exclude posts with ID 1 and 8:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'freshforms_post_has_gform', 'fffg_fresh_these_posts' );\nfunction fffg_fresh_these_posts(){\n    // Force Fresh Forms to run for posts with id 1 and 8.\n    return array( 1, 8);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following example would exclude WooCommerce products using a product category with the slug product-category-1</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'freshforms_post_has_gform', 'fffg_fresh_these_products' );\nfunction fffg_fresh_these_products( $post_has_form ){\n    global $post;\n\n    // Run Fresh Forms for a WooCommerce product if it has one of the following categories slugs.\n    $product_categories = array( 'product-category-1' );\n    if ( is_object( $post ) &amp;&amp; 'product' === $post-&gt;post_type &amp;&amp; has_term( $product_categories, 'product_cat', $post-&gt;ID ) ) {\n        return array( $post-&gt;ID );\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise.\n    return $post_has_form;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After doing the above, you need to <strong>flush your host/plugin and browser cache</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20varnish%20caching%20supported%3F'>\nIs Varnish caching supported?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Fresh Forms targets only WordPress caching plugins, it doesn&#8217;t communicate with your server directly. If you have a WordPress installed to manage Varnish cache and this plugin has support for the DONOTCACHEPAGE constant, Fresh Forms should work out of the box.</p>\n<p>But there are some WordPress plugins, like Breeze by CloudWays and NitroPack, that while they are created to integrate WordPress with Varnish, they don&#8217;t support DONOTCACHEPAGE or provide any WordPress filters to exclude content dynamically (at the time of writing this).</p>\n<p>But both have support to exclude pages from their cache based on a cookie added. Since Fresh Forms 1.3.4, you can use the freshforms_add_cookie filter in your theme functions.php file or a custom fucntionatliy plugin to make Fresh Forms to add a cookie that you can configure in CloudWays or NitroPack account dashboard.</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'freshforms_add_cookie', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have the filter added to your site, follow the instructions below.</p>\n<p>CloudWays documentation: <a href=\"https://support.cloudways.com/how-to-include-or-exclude-cookies-from-varnish/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Include or Exclude Cookies From Varnish</a></p>\n<p>Make sure you select <strong>Exclude</strong> for the Method, and use <strong>FreshForms</strong> for the cookie Value.</p>\n<p>NitroPack documentation:  <a href=\"https://support.nitropack.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500002527202-Excluded-Cookies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Excluded Cookies</a></p>\n<p>Use <strong>FreshForms</strong> for the Cookie Name and <strong>no-cache</strong> for the Cookie Values.</p>\n<p>After doing the above, you need to <strong>flush your host and browser cache</strong>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
