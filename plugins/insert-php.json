The plugin helps to create and store code snippets or duplicated text in a special library at the admin bar of your website. Use the shortcode to add a snippet anywhere on your website. Or do it automatically, for example: head, footer and post injections.  You can show or hide code snippets using conditional logic.</p>\n<h3>Why do you need this plugin?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Insert Headers and Footers</li>\n<li>Insert Google AdSense Ads, Amazon Native Shopping Contextual Ads, Yandex Direct Ads, Media.net on your website.</li>\n<li>Insert Google Analytic Tracking code, Yandex Metrika Tracking Code, Yandex Counter to Header, Footer.</li>\n<li>Insert PHP Code Snippets and execute on your website. Register PHP functions, classes, global variables everywhere.</li>\n<li>Insert Social media widgets, add any external resources widgets.</li>\n<li>Insert Facebook Pixels, Facebook Scripts, Facebook og:image Tag, Google Conversion Pixels, Vk Pixels.</li>\n<li>Show or hide code snippets based on conditional logic.</li>\n<li>You can save templates of posts or page builders, quotes, and galleries to re-use them on your website.</li>\n<li>Roll back changes with Code Revisions <strong><a href=\"https://woodysnippet.com/pricing/\" title=\"Get PRO\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">(Premium)</a></strong></li>\n<li>Cloud storage for snippets <strong><a href=\"https://woodysnippet.com/pricing/\" title=\"Get PRO\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">(Premium)</a></strong></li>\n<li>Synchronize snippets between your sites using the cloud (<strong>Coming soon</strong>)</li>\n<li>Ready-made snippets in our cloud that will help you solve some of your cases (<strong><a href=\"https://woodysnippet.com/pricing/\" title=\"Get PRO\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Premium</a></strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Need premium features?</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://woodysnippet.com/pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Premium version</a></strong></p>\n<h3>How It Works?</h3>\n<h4>Example #1</h4>\n<p>You create a new javascript snippet and add a code you’d like to place on a website. Html snippet editor provides you with tooltips and highlights errors in syntax. Now you need to define where to put a code. For example, you can place the code in header, footer of all pages. This works great for Google Analytics. Create an additional condition: do not show this code to the administrator. It will prevent from tracking user role.</p>\n<h4>Example #2</h4>\n<p>You create a text snippet and add a repeated text or a template. You can add a shortcode for the contact form, in case it’s universal for all website pages. Now you can add conditions to show this content to registered users only. Save the text snippet and go to editing pages.  If you use the Gutenberg editor, you need to select a special unit. For the classic editor, click the icon of our plugin and add a shortcode of your new snippet.<br />\nAs you can see, working with snippets is super easy!</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNoNsl_jy2k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>All Plugin Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Header footer code manager</li>\n<li>User-friendly code editor with syntax highlighter.</li>\n<li>Create rich text ads using a classic WordPress editor TinyMCE.</li>\n<li>Use shortcodes to place a snippet anywhere on a website.</li>\n<li>Use a special unit to add a snippet in Gutenberg Editor.</li>\n<li>You can send content and additional attributes to a snippet using a shortcode or a special unit (Gutenberg Editor).</li>\n<li>Place post snippets automatically on all pages.</li>\n<li>Run PHP code everywhere or for a certain shortcode.</li>\n<li>Use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code to create code snippets.</li>\n<li>The Unlimited number of code snippets.</li>\n<li>Use shortcodes of other plugins.</li>\n<li>Show or hide code snippets based on conditional logic.</li>\n<li>Export/Import of code snippets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Where Can You Place a Snippet Automatically?</h3>\n<p><strong>All website:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Insert Headers and Footers on all pages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insert Header — code snippet is added to the source code in header before the &lt;/head&gt; tag.</li>\n<li>Insert Footer — code snippet is added to the source code in footer before the &lt;/body&gt; tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Insert to Posts, pages, custom posts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insert ads Before Post — post snippets is added to the source code before the &lt;/head&gt; tag.</li>\n<li>Insert ads Before Content — page snippets is added before the post/page content.</li>\n<li>Insert ads Before Paragraph — post snippets is added before a certain paragraph.

If you still want to execute your php code via [insert_php][/insert_php] shortcodes, you can enable this option.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Code Editor</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code style &#8211; The optional feature. You can customize the code style in the snippet editor. The &#8220;Default&#8221; style is applied by default.</li>\n<li>Indent With Tabs &#8211; The optional feature. Whether, when indenting, the first N*tabSize spaces should be replaced by N tabs. The default is false.</li>\n<li>Tab Size &#8211; The optional feature. Pressing Tab in the code editor increases left indent to N spaces. N is a number pre-defined by you.</li>\n<li>Indent Unit &#8211; The optional feature. The indent for code lines (units). Example: select a snippet, press Tab. The left indent in the selected code increases to N spaces. N is a number pre-defined by you.</li>\n<li>Wrap Lines &#8211; The optional feature. If ON, the editor will wrap long lines. Otherwise, it will create a horizontal scroll.</li>\n<li>Line Numbers &#8211; The optional feature. If ON, all lines in the editor will be numbered.</li>\n<li>Auto Close Brackets &#8211; The optional feature. If ON, the editor will automatically close opened quotes or brackets. Sometimes, it speeds up coding.</li>\n<li>Highlight Selection Matches &#8211; The optional feature. If ON, it searches for matches for the selected variable/function name. Highlight matches with green. Improves readability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Geolocation</h4>\n<p>IP geolocation database (Webnet77 or MaxMind) &#8211; Select IP geolocation database</p>\n<h3>Use this plugin with care!</h3>\n<p>ATTENTION! Check your php scripts before inserting on your site. If you don&#8217;t understand how the php script you are using works, try to avoid using it. Using unverified or outdated php scripts can damage the security of your site! Using the plugin on multisites can be dangerous as it will allow all administrators to insert php, js code. If you cannot control the work of administrators, we recommend that you do not use this plugin for security reasons. We are constantly working to improve the security of the plugin, but unfortunately we cannot check the code scripts you use that may violate the security of your site!</p>\n<h3>History, Developers, Credits</h3>\n<p>If you are a long-term user, you may be confused about the new plugin update. You’ve been using an old plugin – Insert php 1.3.0, and now got an extended product – Woody Code Snippets. Insert php was the first plugin version to work with PHP code. It was created by Will Bontrager Software, LLC. In 2018, the Webcraftic studio started to actively develop the plugin. We’ve created a roadmap and released several powerful updates that help you to use PHP code more comfortable and secure. Now plugin supports not only PHP but other snippet types as well. We’ve decided to rename the plugin as Woody Code Snippets. This name is more suitable for new and powerful plugin features.</p>\n<p>More information about the Insert PHP plugin can be found here:<br />\nhttp://www.willmaster.com/software/WPplugins/go/iphphome_iphplugin</p>\n",

The attribute name can contain Latin letters and lowercase digits. You can also use underscore.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20snippet%20code%20executed%20with%20an%20error%20and%20i%20cannot%20change%20it%2C%20what%20should%20i%20do%3F'>\nThe snippet code executed with an error and I cannot change it, what should I do?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Do not despair!

You need to wrap the content you’d like to pass to a snippet with shortcodes [wbcr_php_snippet id=”xx” simple=”example”]page content[/wbcr_php_snippet]. Page content in a snippet is located in the $content variable.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20plugin%20support%20gutenberg%20editor%3F'>\nDoes plugin support Gutenberg editor?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, it does.

What should I expect in 2.x.x version?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The old version of Insert php 1.3.0 worked this way: you wrapped PHP code with shortcodes [insert_php]php code[/insert_php]. Starting from version 2.x.x and higher, you need to create special snippets to place PHP code. Use a snippet shortcode [wbcr_php_snippetid=”xx”] instead of shortcodes  [insert_php][/insert_php] to execute PHP code on pages.<br />\nWe recommend you to move all your code from the post editor to snippets.<br />\nImportant! TinyMCE converts double quotes to special characters. So if you place this code on the snippet editor, it may not work. To avoid this problem, replace all special symbols of double quotes in your PHP code with classic double quotes.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20long%20are%20you%20planning%20to%20support%20the%20old%20version%201.3.0%3F'>\nHow long are you planning to support the old version 1.3.0?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>60% users have already downloaded 2.x.x version. We are trying to reach the number of 80%.

How can I roll back to 1.3.0 and don’t get updates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>First of all, please, take some time to actually go through the new version. Usually, it takes a week to see how useful this version may be for you. If you’ve faced any problems or found some bugs, feel free to contact us at our <a href=\"http://forum.webcraftic.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support forum</a>.<br />\nYou can always download the old version (1.3.0) from <a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/insert-php.1.3.zip\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.<br />\nTo avoid getting updates, open the PHP file wp-content/plugins/insert-php/insert_php.php and change the plugin version to 9.9.9.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20plugin%20documentation%3F'>\nIs there any plugin documentation?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can find the detailed documentation in <a href=\"https://woodysnippet.com/getting-started-with-woody-ad-snippets/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20plugin%20compatible%20with%20gdpr%3F'>\nIs plugin compatible with GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with GDPR.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20plugin%20be%20completely%20uninstalled%3F'>\nCan the plugin be completely uninstalled?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Go to the settings page and enable the &#8220;Complete uninstall&#8221; option. Than, when you delete Woody Code Snippets using the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress it will clean up the database table and a few other bits of data. Be careful not to remove Woody Code Snippets by deleting it from the Plugins menu unless you want this to happen.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20to%20remove%20plugin%20via%20ftp%20client%3F'>\nHow to remove plugin via ftp client?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You have to delete the folder with the plugin, which is located here: wp-content/plugins/insert-php<br />\nThis will not clear the plugin data from the database. You have to remove the plugin through the admin panel with the &#8220;Full Uninstall&#8221; option enabled in order to completely clear the plugin data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20i%20lose%20my%20snippets%20if%20i%20change%20the%20theme%20or%20upgrade%20wordpress%3F'>\nWill I lose my snippets if I change the theme or upgrade WordPress?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the snippets are stored in the WordPress database and are independent of the theme and unaffected by WordPress upgrades.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20plugin%20work%20with%20multisite%3F'>\nDoes plugin work with multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin doesn’t support multi-sites.<br />\nWe will definitely add multisite support in the future.

The plugin helps to create and store code snippets or duplicated text in a special library at the admin bar of your website. Use the shortcode to add a snippet anywhere on your website. Or do it automatically, for example: head, footer and post injections.  You can show or hide code snippets using conditional logic.</p>\n<h3>Why do you need this plugin?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Insert Headers and Footers</li>\n<li>Insert Google AdSense Ads, Amazon Native Shopping Contextual Ads, Yandex Direct Ads, Media.net on your website.</li>\n<li>Insert Google Analytic Tracking code, Yandex Metrika Tracking Code, Yandex Counter to Header, Footer.</li>\n<li>Insert PHP Code Snippets and execute on your website.

Html snippet editor provides you with tooltips and highlights errors in syntax. Now you need to define where to put a code. For example, you can place the code in header, footer of all pages. This works great for Google Analytics. Create an additional condition: do not show this code to the administrator. It will prevent from tracking user role.</p>\n<h4>Example #2</h4>\n<p>You create a text snippet and add a repeated text or a template. You can add a shortcode for the contact form, in case it’s universal for all website pages. Now you can add conditions to show this content to registered users only. Save the text snippet and go to editing pages.  If you use the Gutenberg editor, you need to select a special unit. For the classic editor, click the icon of our plugin and add a shortcode of your new snippet.<br />\nAs you can see, working with snippets is super easy!</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNoNsl_jy2k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<h3>All Plugin Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Header footer code manager</li>\n<li>User-friendly code editor with syntax highlighter.</li>\n<li>Create rich text ads using a classic WordPress editor TinyMCE.</li>\n<li>Use shortcodes to place a snippet anywhere on a website.</li>\n<li>Use a special unit to add a snippet in Gutenberg Editor.</li>\n<li>You can send content and additional attributes to a snippet using a shortcode or a special unit (Gutenberg Editor).</li>\n<li>Place post snippets automatically on all pages.</li>\n<li>Run PHP code everywhere or for a certain shortcode.</li>\n<li>Use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code to create code snippets.</li>\n<li>The Unlimited number of code snippets.</li>\n<li>Use shortcodes of other plugins.</li>\n<li>Show or hide code snippets based on conditional logic.</li>\n<li>Export/Import of code snippets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Where Can You Place a Snippet Automatically?</h3>\n<p><strong>All website:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Insert Headers and Footers on all pages:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insert Header — code snippet is added to the source code in header before the &lt;/head&gt; tag.</li>\n<li>Insert Footer — code snippet is added to the source code in footer before the &lt;/body&gt; tag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Insert to Posts, pages, custom posts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insert ads Before Post — post snippets is added to the source code before the &lt;/head&gt; tag.</li>\n<li>Insert ads Before Content — page snippets is added before the post/page content.</li>\n<li>Insert ads Before Paragraph — post snippets is added before a certain paragraph.

Check your php scripts before inserting on your site. If you don&#8217;t understand how the php script you are using works, try to avoid using it. Using unverified or outdated php scripts can damage the security of your site! Using the plugin on multisites can be dangerous as it will allow all administrators to insert php, js code. If you cannot control the work of administrators, we recommend that you do not use this plugin for security reasons. We are constantly working to improve the security of the plugin, but unfortunately we cannot check the code scripts you use that may violate the security of your site!</p>\n<h3>History, Developers, Credits</h3>\n<p>If you are a long-term user, you may be confused about the new plugin update. You’ve been using an old plugin – Insert php 1.3.0, and now got an extended product – Woody Code Snippets. Insert php was the first plugin version to work with PHP code. It was created by Will Bontrager Software, LLC. In 2018, the Webcraftic studio started to actively develop the plugin. We’ve created a roadmap and released several powerful updates that help you to use PHP code more comfortable and secure. Now plugin supports not only PHP but other snippet types as well. We’ve decided to rename the plugin as Woody Code Snippets. This name is more suitable for new and powerful plugin features.</p>\n<p>More information about the Insert PHP plugin can be found here:<br />\nhttp://www.willmaster.com/software/WPplugins/go/iphphome_iphplugin</p>\n",
