For example &#8220;My Code School Badges&#8221;</li>\n<li>Choose how many badges you would like to display</li>\n<li>Enter how large each badge should be. Examples: 60px, 5ems, 12pts, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How to Use the Shortcode</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the post or page you would like to add the badges to appear.</li>\n<li>Enter in the shortcode [wpcodeschool_badges]</li>\n<li>Customize the number of badges displayed by adding the parameter &#8216;num_badges&#8217; with the number of badges you want to display. [wpcodeschool_badges num_badges=&#8217;4&#8242;]. If a number is not specified, all of your badges will be displayed.</li>\n<li>Customize how large each badge should be. Examples: 60px, 5ems, 12pts, etc. [wpcodeschool_badges badge_size=&#8217;100px&#8217;]. If no size is specified, the default badge size is 60px.</li>\n<li>You can use any of the parameters in combination [wpcodeschool_badges num_badges=&#8217;4&#8242; badge_size=&#8217;100px&#8217;]</li>\n</ol>\n",

This keeps your site running fast and prevents too many calls to the Code School API. You can clear the cache by going to the admin area, Settings &gt; Code School Badges, and hitting the &#8216;Update&#8217; button.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How Often Does the Profile Information Get Updated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Whenever someone visits a page, the plugin checks to see if the profile information was updated in the last 12 hours. If it has been longer than 12 hours, then the plugin will update the profile information. The next time someone visits the site or clicks on a page, the latest badges show.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I Choose What Specific Badges I Want to Display?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not yet. For future releases, we are considering more customized ways to choose what badges you want to display, instead of just showing the most recent badges.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I contribute code and bug fixes?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Contributors are welcome. Please visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/mcnitt/code-school-badges-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Code School Badges GitHub project.</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
