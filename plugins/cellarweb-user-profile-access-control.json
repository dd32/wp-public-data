Users will see a message that they are unable to edit their profiled.  Administrator-level users will not see that extra field.</p>\n<p>Another option will send an email to the admin whenever a profile is changed.

        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20want%20to%20use%20this%20plugin'>\nWhy would I want to use this plugin\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is useful if you want to prevent users from accessing their user profile, such as changing their password. A blocked user won&#8217;t be able to access their User Profile page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20administrators%3F'>\nWhat about administrators?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>An administrator &#8211; or anyone with the &#8216;edit-user&#8217; privileges &#8211; will not have that blocking field on thier user profile page. If that was allowed, then that administrative level user could not edit their own user profile. It would require direct access to the user database.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20the%20plugin%20notify%20me%20when%20a%20user%20profile%20is%20changed%3F'>\nWill the plugin notify me when a user profile is changed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. The notification email, if enabled, will go to the email address specified in the Settings, General screen.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20information%20will%20the%20adming%20get%20when%20a%20user%20profile%20is%20changed%3F'>\nWhat information will the adming get when a user profile is changed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The email will include the current contents/settings of all fields. Text fields that have had a change will also be sent.</p>\n<p>This includes the password field, so be careful about who gets the email. There is a possibility of personal or security information being sent in clear text in that email.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20do%20you%20send%20the%20password%20information%20%3F'>\nWhy do you send the password information ?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All fields on the user profile page are sent. The administrator may want to know if a password has changed, and if the password meets their security requirements.</p>\n<p>Or, for a site that has a &#8216;generic&#8217; user ID used by many people, the administrator will want to know when that password has changed, as that change would affect all people that used that generic user id.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20specify%20user%20roles%20that%20will%20get%20the%20extra%20field%3F'>\nCan you specify user roles that will get the extra field?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time, but it may be a future feature. Right now, the extra field is put on all user profiles that have the &#8216;edit-user&#8217; privilege.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20specify%20the%20user%20that%20gets%20the%20notification%20email%3F'>\nCan you specify the user that gets the notification email?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not at this time, but that is also a possible future feature. With this version, the email is the one specified on the Settings, General screen.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20about%20%5Bsome%20new%20feature%5D%3F'>\nWhat about [some new feature]?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We&#8217;re always open to new ideas. Use the contact link on the settings page, or the &#8220;Support&#8221; forum on the plugin page.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20something%20doesn%27t%20work%3F'>\nWhat if something doesn&#8217;t work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Use the &#8220;Support&#8221; forum on the plugin page. We&#8217;ll try to respond within 48 hours.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
