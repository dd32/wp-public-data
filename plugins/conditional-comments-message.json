Make sure the &#8220;enabled&#8221; checkbox is checked.</p>\n<h4>I entered some text but don&#8217;t see anything on the page.</h4>\n<p>Is the page/post cached?</p>\n<p>Did you set the number of days comments are set to automatically close? See the Installation page for instructions.</p>\n<h4>How can I style the output?</h4>\n<p>The text is wrapped in div tags with class name &#8220;ccm-conditional-msg&#8221;. Use this class in your local stylesheet to style the output how you want.</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t want the admin CSS. How do I remove it?</h4>\n<p>Add this to your functions.php:</p>\n<pre><code>remove_action('admin_head', 'insert_ccm_admin_css'); </code></pre>\n<h4>What does the &#8216;dynamic remaining days&#8217; checkbox do?</h4>\n<p>Instead of just showing how many days the comment period is open, this will instead dynamically count down the number of days remaining. So if you set your comment window to 30 days, then it will initially say &#8220;4 weeks&#8221;. As time passes, the message dynamically adjusts itself from &#8220;weeks&#8221; to &#8220;days&#8221;. The post date is used to determine the number of days remaining and the countdown.</p>\n",
