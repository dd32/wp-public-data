OKRs are kept public in front of everyone, so people and teams move towards the same goals and know what others are focusing on.</p>\n<p>OKRs consist of a list of 3-5 high-level objectives. Under each objective then usually 3-5 key measurable results are listed. Each key result has a progress indicator or score of 0-100% or 0 to 1.0 that shows its achievement.</p>\n<p>OKR structure is very simple:</p>\n<p>Objectives. You start by defining 3-5 key objectives on company, team or personal levels. Objectives should be ambitious, qualitative, time bound and actionable by the person or team.<br />\nResults. Under each objective, define 3-4 measurable results, not more. Key results should be quantifiable, achievable, lead to objective grading and be difficult, but not impossible. OKR results can be based on growth, performance, revenue or engagement. Often they are numerical, but they can also show if something is done or undone, so a binary 0 or 1.</p>\n<p>The main benefit is to keep vision, goals and objectives always in front of employees. They&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s exactly expected of them. They can then also align their work to team, department and company goals.</p>\n<p>When set up and used regularly, OKRs are really simple to use and do not take much time to implement or follow. Often it takes just a few hours each quarter to check and review the OKRs, although you will look at them as a reminderand mark your progress on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>OKRs are often loved by leaders and managers seeing their people start moving towards important goals, not small unimportant tasks.
