TidyConnect gives your members and admins more tools, not only for your website, but opens the door for more plug ins while keeping all your main administrative functionality in TidyHQ.  To keep your website secure, if they do not have a WordPress account with your organisation, the plugin will allow them to log in but only create them as a user with basic WordPress access.

        "faq": "\n<h4>What is TidyHQ</h4>\n<p>\n<p>TidyHQ is a cloud-based platform designed to help streamline the administration and management of organisations.  For more information about how TidyHQ can help your organisation visit &lt;tidyhq.com&gt;.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can my members log in to WordPress using TidyHQ credentials?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Provided the TidyHQ credentials are correct, TidyConnect will allow them to log in, however they will not have any access to additional WordPress or TidyHQ functions unless granted through the WordPress users or TidyHQ Users &amp; Roles.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can people not associated with my organisation log in?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>As above.  Provided the TidyHQ credentials are correct, TidyConnect will allow them to log in, however they will not have any access to additional WordPress or TidyHQ functions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is my information secure?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Data used by TidyConnect is read-only.  TidyConnect promises to never store confidential information from TidyHQ.  Login information is sent directly to TidyHQ for validation.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I still log in with my normal WordPress username/password?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes.  Simply login as you have done previously. To log in via TidyHQ, use the image displayed on your wp-login.php page.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have a query or suggestion.  Who do I contact?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you email <a href=\"tidyconnect@iinet.net.au'\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">tidyconnect@iinet.net.au</a>, I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
        "changelog": "<h4>3.0.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated help to include shortcodes.</li>\n<li>[tidy_connect_login] shortcode now allows image=true to display a TidyHQ image instead of text.</li>\n<li>A notice will now display when you are updating a WordPress user which is linked to TidyHQ.</li>\n<li>WP User description and TidyHQ contact Additional Information are now linked.</li>\n<li>Your profile information will now be updated from TidyHQ more often.</li>\n<li>Calendar settings have returned. If an item is disabled in settings, all references to those items won&#8217;t be displayed.</li>\n<li>Quicklink to your TidyHQ Dashboard&#8230; click on your site name at the top of your page.</li>\n<li>Option to data sync TidyHQ contacts and WordPress users. Enable one way keeping one system as a primary, or both ways allowing consistant information on both systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.0.0</h4>\n<p>TidyConnect has been completely redeveloped and now works slightly differently. It no longer matches the user email address, but now will always create a new user for TidyHQ contacts upon login or when added by an administrator. This allows full compatibility between TidyHQ and WordPress allowing WordPress to always maintain correct information from TidyHQ.</p>\n"
