This enables AI voices to effectively pronounce elements that other platforms can struggle with, such as names, numbers, and dates, as well as filtering out elements that shouldn&#8217;t be read aloud. You can even add aliases to ensure everything is read exactly how you want it.</p>\n<p>BeyondWords gives you access to neural voices from Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure (500+ voices across 140+ language locales).</p>\n<p>You can also get access to premium neural voices &mdash; voice clones of professional voice actors that are exclusive to BeyondWords. Users have the option to develop a completely bespoke custom voice using our voice cloning service.</p>\n<p>The result is naturalistic spoken-word audio content that engages your target audience &mdash; at a fraction of the cost of human recordings.</p>\n<h3>EFFORTLESS DISTRIBUTION</h3>\n<p>BeyondWords makes it easy to reach new audiences and grow your listenership. As well as auto-embedding audio players to your WordPress site, you can embed your audio manually or share via URL. You can even download your audios as mp3 files.</p>\n<p>This includes content created automatically with our WordPress text-to-speech plugin, as well as content created manually with the Text-to-Speech Editor &mdash; perfect for audio newsletters.</p>\n<p>Users can even create custom playlists that keep listeners listening for longer. These can be embedded, shared via URL, or even distributed via podcast feed. That means you can reach audiences through platforms like Apple Podcasts and Spotify.</p>\n<h3>ANALYTICS AND MONETIZATION</h3>\n<p>You get access to project analytics, which means you can track listener engagement at the project level through your BeyondWords dashboard. Users can also get access to audio analytics, as well as Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager integrations.</p>\n<p>You can even leverage your listenership through audio advertising. Use our self-serve audio advertising feature to create your own campaigns or use VAST (video ad serving template) to connect a programmatic advertising platform, such as Google Ad Manager.</p>\n<h3>CREATE YOUR FREE ACCOUNT TODAY</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://dash.beyondwords.io/auth/signup?utm_source=wordpress&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Create your Pilot account</a> to see how the BeyondWords text-to-speech plugin improves reach and engagement on your WordPress site.
