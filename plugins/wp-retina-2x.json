        "description": "<p>Take control of your images with Perfect Images! This powerful plugin helps you optimize and manage your images with ease. Easily replace or regenerate existing images in bulk, set custom sizes, improve performance, and create retina versions for high-quality displays. Plus, with features like CDN support and the ability to disable the image threshold, you can fine-tune your image management to suit your specific needs. Perfect Images is fast, does not create any new tables in your database, and is fully compatible with other plugins.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at the main features of Perfect Images:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage Image Sizes (Custom Sizes and Disable Sizes)</li>\n<li>Replace Image &amp; Media Entries</li>\n<li>Regenerate Thumbnails</li>\n<li>Retina Images / High DPI</li>\n<li>CDN (with Image Optimization by EWWW)</li>\n<li>Disable Image Threshold</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Originally designed to handle retina images, Perfect Images has evolved to become a must-have tool for any WordPress site.</p>\n<h3>Manage Image Sizes</h3>\n<p>With this feature, you can easily disable any unnecessary sizes and keep track of the sizes created for each of your media entries. This allows you to streamline your image management and get rid of any unnecessary sizes that may be taking up space on your site. For example, you can disable the medium_large, 1536&#215;1536, and 2048&#215;2048 sizes that WordPress automatically creates, which are often unnecessary.</p>\n<h3>Replace Image &amp; Media</h3>\n<p>This convenient tool allows you to quickly swap out an image for a new one, all from within the plugin&#8217;s dedicated dashboard, or directly from the Media Library or Edit Attachment pages. Say goodbye to the hassle of manually replacing images and streamline your media management.</p>\n<h3>Regenerate Thumbnails</h3>\n<p>This feature allows you to update your thumbnails en masse, with a convenient progress bar to keep you informed of the process. Plus, Perfect Images handles all the details, including regenerating your retina images and updating your media metadata as needed.</p>\n<h3>Retina Images / HighDPI</h3>\n<p>Make your website look stunning on high-DPI devices with Perfect Images. This plugin automatically generates and serves beautiful, crisp retina images to your visitors, ensuring that your site looks great on every device. Plus, with the option to manually generate retina images and the unique feature of creating retina images for full-size images, you&#8217;ll have everything you need to make your website stand out. Visit the official website for more information and tutorials on how to get the most out of this feature.</p>\n<h3>Disable Image Threshold</h3>\n<p>This plugin gives you the ability to disable WordPress&#8217; automatic image scaling feature, which sometimes results in files with &#8220;-scaled&#8221; at the end of their filenames.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p>The Pro version adds support for Retina for full-size, support for lazy-loading for your responsive images and various options. And it supports my work ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h4>Quickstart</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Set your option (for instance, you probably don&#8217;t need retina images for every sizes set-up in your WP).</li>\n<li>Generate the retina images (required only the first time, then images are generated automatically).</li>\n<li>Check if it works! &#8211; if it doesn&#8217;t, read the FAQ, the tutorial, and check the forums.</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "description": "<p>Take control of your images with Perfect Images! This powerful plugin helps you optimize and manage your images with ease. Easily replace or regenerate existing images in bulk, set custom sizes, improve performance, and create retina versions for high-quality displays. Plus, with features like CDN support and the ability to disable the image threshold, you can fine-tune your image management to suit your specific needs. Perfect Images is fast, does not create any new tables in your database, and is fully compatible with other plugins.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at the main features of Perfect Images:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage Image Sizes (Custom Sizes and Disable Sizes)</li>\n<li>Replace Image &amp; Media Entries</li>\n<li>Regenerate Thumbnails</li>\n<li>Retina Images / High DPI</li>\n<li>CDN (with Image Optimization by EWWW)</li>\n<li>Disable Image Threshold</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Originally designed to handle retina images, Perfect Images has evolved to become a must-have tool for any WordPress site.</p>\n<h3>Manage Image Sizes</h3>\n<p>With this feature, you can easily disable any unnecessary sizes and keep track of the sizes created for each of your media entries. This allows you to streamline your image management and get rid of any unnecessary sizes that may be taking up space on your site. For example, you can disable the medium_large, 1536&#215;1536, and 2048&#215;2048 sizes that WordPress automatically creates, which are often unnecessary.</p>\n<h3>Replace Image &amp; Media</h3>\n<p>This convenient tool allows you to quickly swap out an image for a new one, all from within the plugin&#8217;s dedicated dashboard, or directly from the Media Library or Edit Attachment pages. Say goodbye to the hassle of manually replacing images and streamline your media management.</p>\n<h3>Regenerate Thumbnails</h3>\n<p>This feature allows you to update your thumbnails en masse, with a convenient progress bar to keep you informed of the process. Plus, Perfect Images handles all the details, including regenerating your retina images and updating your media metadata as needed.</p>\n<h3>Retina Images / HighDPI</h3>\n<p>Make your website look stunning on high-DPI devices with Perfect Images. This plugin automatically generates and serves beautiful, crisp retina images to your visitors, ensuring that your site looks great on every device. Plus, with the option to manually generate retina images and the unique feature of creating retina images for full-size images, you&#8217;ll have everything you need to make your website stand out. Visit the official website for more information and tutorials on how to get the most out of this feature.</p>\n<h3>Disable Image Threshold</h3>\n<p>This plugin gives you the ability to disable WordPress&#8217; automatic image scaling feature, which sometimes results in files with &#8220;-scaled&#8221; at the end of their filenames.</p>\n<h3>Pro Version</h3>\n<p>The Pro version adds support for Retina for full-size, support for lazy-loading for your responsive images and various options. And it supports my work ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h4>Quickstart</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Set your option (for instance, you probably don&#8217;t need retina images for every sizes set-up in your WP).</li>\n<li>Generate the retina images (required only the first time, then images are generated automatically).</li>\n<li>Check if it works! &#8211; if it doesn&#8217;t, read the FAQ, the tutorial, and check the forums.</li>\n</ol>\n",
