When you have a lot of comments and heated discussions, managing this manually can take a substantial amount of your precious time. WP Ban Manager keeps track of all this for you, so you can focus on more rewarding activities.</p>\n<p>As an additional feature, you can also ban comments from the Tor network. In our experience, it was used a lot by banned people to circumvent our bans.</p>\n<p>Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ban IP-based, user based or both</li>\n<li>Multiple IP addresses assignable to one entry</li>\n<li>Wildcards in IP addresses allowed (xxx.yyy.<em>.</em> and xxx.yyy.zzz.*)</li>\n<li>Define your own ban &#8220;packages&#8221;, eg. a two week ban, or a three month ban</li>\n<li>Custom messages to the offender can be defined individually or by &#8220;package&#8221;</li>\n<li>Assign these packages to your bans</li>\n<li>Block comments originating from the Tor network</li>\n<li>Allow or disallow Tor comments when a user is logged in (default is allow)</li>\n<li>Automatically unban users</li>\n<li>Automatically remove bans 1 year after expiration (configurable, GDPR-measure)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: This plugin stores its bans in the WP options table, and as such is not suitable for sites having hundreds of bans simultaneously.
