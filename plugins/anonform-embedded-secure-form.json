We do not have any online editing of forms, everything is uploaded manually by us after virus and other security checks.</p>\n<p>All services are run on own servers in secure server halls. The encryption software we use is open source (OpenPGP) which is constantly reviewed by a large community spread all over the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Spam protection</strong></p>\n<p>All forms have Captcha protection against robot-generated spam. The Captcha function is locally installed and does not download anything from external sources such as Google. The forms also support <a href=\"https://www.hcaptcha.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hCaptcha</a>, which offers better spam protection but poorer anonymity through increased traceability.</p>\n<h4>EU/EN 301549 and W3C/WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance</h4>\n<p>All forms meet the accessibility requirements according to EU Directive 2016/2102 and other corresponding directives in different countries according to WCAG 2.0/2.1 AA and associated legislation.</p>\n<h4>Pre-built form templates</h4>\n<p>ANON::form comes with pre-built form templates, both embedded and stand-alone, to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.
