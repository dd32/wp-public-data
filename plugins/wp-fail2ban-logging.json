It then hooks into the WP login failed action. Any invalid login attempts are logged with the ip address, username used and website that it’s coming from.  These invalid attempts are parsed by Fail2Ban to provide a proactive method to block intrusion attempts.</p>\n<p>This plugin is different from other plugins in that we don&#8217;t save to the syslog.  A custom log is created.  This reduces the CPU load on the server and keeps a log dedicated to invalid WordPress login attempts.  These log entries can be used to block repeat offenders as well as place temporary blocks on anyone attempting to break your website.  The log file can also be used across many different websites and transferred between servers.</p>\n<p>Visit us at <a href=\"https://wireflare.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WireFlare</a></p>\n",

Once the plugin is active it does the logging so long as you followed the steps outlined in the blog post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What OS is this plugin compatible with?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin has been tested with Redhat and Debian variants.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why doesn&#8217;t it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You must have server side access to configure the per-requisites for this plugin to work.  It will not work on shared hosting unless your hosting provider has made provisions for the plugin to work.  If you have a VPS or Dedicated server you should have root access.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
