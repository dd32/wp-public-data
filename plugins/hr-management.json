        "faq": "\n<dt id='who%20should%20use%20crew%20hrm%3F'>\nWho should use Crew HRM?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Anyone who needs to share jobs on their website and accept applications from their website. This would give a professional impression and help you save time compared to using forms and emails.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20are%20the%20server%20requirements%3F'>\nWhat are the server requirements?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use our plugin on any WordPress site. We used React.js to make it, so it works well in your browser. If you have a lot of employees (over 3000) and many using it at once (over 200), a dedicated hosting package works better than shared hosting.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20offer%20a%20whitelabeling%20feature%3F'>\nDo you offer a whitelabeling feature?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, we offer a whitelable setting on the Pro add-on to change the name and images easily. If you prefer to use the free version only, you can change the name using translation plugins like Loco Translate or the Say What plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20go%20ahead%20and%20customize%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nCan I go ahead and customize the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, as Crew HRM is offered under the GPL license, you can modify it any way you like. There is no restriction at all. So that you know, we do not offer support for customized plugins.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20you%20develop%20a%20custom%20feature%20for%20me%3F'>\nCan you develop a custom feature for me?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to offer customizations right now. You can hire a developer from a marketplace, and we&#8217;ll gladly help your developer.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20plugin%20multisite%20compatible%3F'>\nIs this plugin multisite compatible?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No. We are not supporting multisite installations at this moment.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20this%20plugin%20in%20other%20languages%3F'>\nCan I use this plugin in other languages?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can translate the plugin into any language you want.

Please check our <a href=\"https://getcrewhrm.com/docs/translating/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation</a> for detailed instructions.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20you%20have%20video%20tutorials%3F'>\nDo you have video tutorials?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We have posted walkthrough videos on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@crewhrm\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Crew HRM YouTube Channel</a>. If you have requests for video tutorials and discuss different ideas, please feel free to comment on any video or use the contact form on our website.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20suggest%20new%20features%3F'>\nHow can I suggest new features?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can email us using the contact form on our website to share feature ideas with helpful screenshots, sketches, etc.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20report%20security%20bugs%3F'>\nHow can I report security bugs?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program.
