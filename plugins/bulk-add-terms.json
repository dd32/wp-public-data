You can add thousands of terms in one go with this plugin.</p>\n<h3>How do I do that?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Install the plugin and activate. A new menu called &#8216;Add Bulk Terms&#8217; will pop up.</li>\n<li>Click on the menu and you&#8217;ll be taken to a new page where you will see all the registered taxonomy either by theme or any plugin.</li>\n<li>First select a taxonomy which you want to add terms.</li>\n<li>Then insert the terms in the right side textarea. Make sure each line contains only one term.</li>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Add Now&#8217; button. A little confirmation will pop up just to make sure you have inserted everything correctly. Click yes and BOOM. All terms are added.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What about nesting parent and child?</h3>\n<p>This plugin supports to do that. You can go and do nesting. You can indent child levels with a dash (-). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>Foo\n-Bar\n-Baz\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, &#8216;foo&#8217; will be parent while &#8216;bar&#8217; and &#8216;baz&#8217; will be child of it.<br />\nYou can use correct indent to make even more child of child. Example:</p>\n<pre><code>Foo\n-Bar\n--Baz\n</code></pre>\n<p>Complex nesting example:</p>\n<pre><code>Foo\n-Child of Foo~~foo-custom-slug\n--Grand child of Foo~~grand-child-slug\n-Second child of Foo\nBaz is sibling of Foo\n-Nephew of Foo\n--Grand child of Baz\n--Second grand child\n-Son of Baz\n-Daughter of Baz~~daughter-custom-slug\nI am a lonely term\nDo not have child\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately the maximum supported level is as deep as the SEA.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited terms per time</li>\n<li>Unlimited level of nesting</li>\n<li>Supports any registered taxonomy. (only those which can be added or removed within UI)</li>\n<li>Uses AJAX request</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>version 2.0 update</em></strong><br />\n* Custom slugs for each terms. Use the <code>~~</code> symbol to seperate name and slug.<br />\n* Get all terms from selected taxonomy as a template. Later, use that template to add them to another taxonomy.<br />\n* Remove all terms that were added by the plugin from selected taxonomy. (Requires at least WordPress 4.4 and plugin version 2.0 when Adding and deleting the terms)</p>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can&#8217;t add child items to those terms which are already added. If you try to do, the given parent item will add as a new term.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GitHub repository: https://github.com/sohan5005/bulk-add-terms</p>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Which taxonomies are supported to add terms?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can add terms to any available taxonomies. However, if any registered taxonomy doesn&#8217;t have an UI, it will be counted as something that should not be changed by you. So, you can&#8217;t add terms to that taxonomy. For example, Nav menu&#8217;s taxonomy is like that.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add child terms?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the possible level is unlimited. Please see the description for example.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I use this plugin in my commercial projects?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can do that. Attribution will be highly appreciated.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
