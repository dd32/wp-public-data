        "description": "<p>With this plugin, you can easily host a top-notch ecommerce shop in WordPress while staying up-to-date with the latest features of your Spreadshop.<br />\nThis is achieved by embedding your existing Spreadshop as-is into any WordPress post, page or path.<br />\nBoth the plugin and your Spreadshop are fully free of charge. Always.</p>\n<p><strong>What you need</strong><br />\n* Installed WordPress instance<br />\n* A Spreadshop (which can be registered <a href=\"https://www.spreadshop.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>)</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Download the plugin&#8217;s *.zip file.</li>\n<li>Go to the plugin menu within your WP dashboard.</li>\n<li>Upload the *.zip file to your content folder.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin.</li>\n<li>Follow the steps in the Spreadshop admin menu.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20plugin%20for%3F'>\nWhat is the Plugin for?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is for people who are running a Spreadshop (which might look like <a href=\"https://shop.spreadshirt.com/SpreadShop\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this</a>) and want to make that Spreadshop available in their WordPress system.<br />\nIf you do not have a Spreadshop yet, you can <a href=\"https://www.spreadshop.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">open one free of charge</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I use the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once you activate the plugin, you will be redirected to the plugin&#8217;s admin menu. Follow the presented steps to connect your Spreadshop with your WordPress system. Info on how to embed your SpreadShop is then also given in the admin menu. The admin menu can be accessed any time from the left-hand bar.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20a%20difference%20between%20a%20stand-alone%20spreadshop%20and%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nIs there a difference between a stand-alone Spreadshop and the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this plugin will simply <em>embed</em> your Spreadshop <em>as-is</em> into your WordPress system.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20work%20from%20a%20technical%20point%20of%20view%3F'>\nHow does this work from a technical point of view?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin simply performs a &#8220;Website Integration with JavaScript&#8221; under the hood, as explained <a href=\"https://help.spreadshop.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010529039-Website-Integration-with-JavaScript\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.<br />\nThe advantage of using this plugin is that you do not need to write any code yourself.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20use%20the%20plugin%20to%20make%20my%20spreadshop%20the%20start%20page%20of%20my%20site%3F'>\nCan I use the plugin to make my Spreadshop the start page of my site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Most WordPress themes come with a pre-installed start page layout. The plugin is not able to overwrite this setting, but you can usually embed your Spreadshop into the start page.<br />\nIf you just want to run your Spreadshop on your own domain and nothing else, we recommend not to use WordPress at all but to follow the steps described <a href=\"https://help.spreadshop.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010529039-Website-Integration-with-JavaScript\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='which%20platform%20am%20i%20using%3F'>\nWhich platform am I using?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Simply put, if you signed up on .com, .ca or .com.au, your Spreadshop runs on the North American platform. All other domains imply you are based on the European platform.<br />\nThis information is only relevant to you if a shop with the same ID or name exists on both platforms and you have to specify which one is yours.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='where%20can%20i%20get%20more%20support%3F'>\nWhere can I get more support?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.spreadshop.com/forum/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">forum</a> and get to know other Shop Owners who can help. Spreadshop staff is also available there.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20if%20i%20deactivate%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nWhat If I deactivate the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Spreadshop will disappear from your WordPress system. This, however, does <em>not</em> affect your stand-alone Spreadshop in any way.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20uninstall%20the%20plugin%3F'>\nHow do I uninstall the plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your WordPress plugin section.</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;deactivate&#8221; on your Spreadshop plugin.</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;delete&#8221; on your Spreadshop plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n",
