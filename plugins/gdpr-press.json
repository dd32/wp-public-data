When a browser (i.e. computer) requests a file (e.g. an image or a font file), the server needs the IP address of that computer to send it back. All these requests (including the IP address) are logged in a so-called <code>access.log</code>.</p>\n<p>Once this IP address leaves the European Union, your website is violating the GDPR.</p>\n<h4>What does this plugin do?</h4>\n<p>GDPRess scans your homepage for 3rd party scripts (JS) and stylesheets (CSS), and:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to download or exclude them from downloading,</li>\n<li>Parses the stylesheets for loaded font files, downloads them, and rewrites the stylesheet to use the local copies,</li>\n<li>Makes sure the local copies of each script/stylesheet are used in your site&#8217;s frontend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, it makes sure no requests are made to external/embedded/3rd party scripts and stylesheets.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the plugin files to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/gdpr-press</code> directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; screen in WordPress</li>\n<li>Use the Settings -&gt; GDPRess screen to configure the plugin</li>\n</ol>\n",

But if it somehow missed it, I&#8217;d love to hear about that, because that might be a bug. Please head over to the support forum and submit a ticket, and include the full URL to the external stylesheet.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20allow%20me%20to%20use%20google%20analytics%20in%20compliance%20with%20gdpr%3F'>\nWill this plugin allow me to use Google Analytics in compliance with GDPR?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, because much more is needed than <em>just</em> downloading analytics.js/gtag.js to your server. To <a href=\"https://ffw.press/blog/gdpr/google-analytics-compliance-gdpr/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">use Google Analytics in compliance with GDPR</a>, you need <a href=\"https://ffw.press/wordpress/caos-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CAOS Pro</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
