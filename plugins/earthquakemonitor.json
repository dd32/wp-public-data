        "faq": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How does the filter work? =&gt; When applying a filter, keep in mind that it filters for city and region. So be as explicit as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When is the tsunami icon shown and what does it mean? =&gt; The Tsunami Icon is shown at major events in oceanic regions. The visibility of this icon does not indicate whether a tsunami has actually occurred or is about to occur. If this icon is visible, more actual information is available via the USGS website (with a link to NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)). See http://www.tsunami.gov/ for all current tsunami alert statuses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What is a quarry seismic event? =&gt; Quarry blasts, underwater explosions, chemcial explosions and other dubious seismic events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What does WordPress database error: Got a packet bigger than &#8216;max_allowed_packet&#8217; bytes mean? =&gt; The MySQL Default configuration does not allow large feeds (for example Magnitude +1 for 30 days) to be stored. This can be changed in the configuration of the SQL server. Check [here] (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/packet-too-large.html) for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What happens with the database cache after I remove a shortcode? =&gt; Cache data older than 24h will be automatically purged , so it is automatically removed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
