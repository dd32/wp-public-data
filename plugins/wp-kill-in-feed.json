It\\&#8217;s especially useful for wrapping around multimedia shortcodes that are adding bits and pieces of the media player into your feed, or for making content exclusive to only one consuming audience. For example, you could use it to display an ad on your site but not in your RSS feed, or show an exclusive link or promotion to your podcast subscribers but not to your website visitors.
