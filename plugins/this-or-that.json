First make sure you have some content to compare by adding items to the <em>This-or-That</em> post-type in the Admin. Make sure to add some featured images! When this has been done, you can add the shortcode <code>[thisorthat]</code> to any of your posts or pages.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I display the ranking list</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This van be done by using the shortcode <code>[thisorthat_ranking]</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to use my own Posts types?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add a &#8216;posttype&#8217; variable to your shortcode. Example: <code>[thisorthat posttype=\"product\"]</code>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I use a certain category?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Add a &#8216;category&#8217; variable to your shortcode. Example: <code>[thisorthat category=\"holiday_pics\"]</code>.<br />\nBy deafult, This-or-That will use the categories set under the <em>This-or-That</em> amin item. If you use a different post-type, it will generally have a different taxonomy. Therefore, you have to set which taxonomy you want to use.For example, if you want compare a category from WooCommerce you should use <code>[thisorthat taxonomy=\"product_cat\" category=\"Sweaters\"]</code></p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I customize the &#8216;voting&#8217; appearance?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can control which elements you want to show through a couple of <em>true</em> or <em>false</em> variables. These are:<br />\n<em>show_image : Shows the posts featured image (default: *true</em>)<br />\n<em>show_title : Shows the post title (default: *true</em>)<br />\n<em>show_excerpt : Shows the exceprts of the posts content (deafult: *false</em>)<br />\n<em>show_score : Shows the items ranking (default: *false</em>)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the thumbnail size?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can use the <em>thumb_size</em> variable. Example <code>[thisorthat thumb_size=\"medium\"]</code>. It uses any thumbnail size you use in your website. WordPress by default supports: <em>thumbnail</em>, <em>medium</em>, <em>large</em>, or <em>full</em>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
