        "faq": "\n<h4>What is the purpose of this widget?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While I thought a widget like this was very common, I had trouble finding one for my blog. That led me to create this basic widget that simply displays a link to the top commented posts. You can customize the title, number of posts, and whether you want to display the comment count.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is it configurable?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sure. Have a look at the options in the widget configuration panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I only show posts from a single category if I want?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. As of version 1.3, more control is available for categories. You can select a single category for the links, or exclude a single category. All options are available from the widget configuration panel.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What do these options mean?</h4>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Show comment count</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Display the number of comments associated with the post beside the link.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Include zero comment posts</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Show links to posts that do not yet have any comments.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Show comments from all categories</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check if you want links to be displayed for posts in any category.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Only show posts in this category</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Show links to posts that are only in this category. The previous checkbox must be unchecked for this setting to take effect.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Exclude posts from no categories</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check if you don&#8217;t want to exclude links from a specific category.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Exclude posts in this category</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Skip posts that fall in this category. The previous checkbox must be unchecked for this setting to take effect.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Nest widget inside list</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When this is checked, the widget will use an additional <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element around it. Toggle this option to see how the widget best fits in with your theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Classes</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This box includes options to style the list components of the plugin. To match the list with your theme, add a class here, then insert a class declaration in your style sheet.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Show posts in the last x days/weeks/months</h4>\n<p>\n<p>By request, version 1.4.3 includes an option to only show links to posts from certain a certain time period. This is determined by the date the post was published, not the comments themselves.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Get least commented posts</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Toggle the order in which posts are displayed.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
