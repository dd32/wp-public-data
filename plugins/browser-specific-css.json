Browser Specific CSS adds a short javascript to the head of your page that enables you to use browser specific css selectors.

Every major browser is supported including code for targeting Macs, PCs, and Linux operating systems.</p>\n<p>This plugin uses the javascript written by <a href=\"http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/\" title=\"Rafael Lima\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Rafael Lima</a>. No changes have been made to his code, and all the credit goes to him.

This screen will give you a list of browser specific css selectors that you can begin to use in your stylesheet(s)</li>\n</ol>\n",

If you don&#8217;t understand CSS this plugin probably isn&#8217;t for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does this plugin work if a visitor has javascript disabled?&#8221;</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Since this plugin uses a javascript, it won&#8217;t target browsers that have javascript disabled. Depending on who you ask, this might affect 5% of your visitors. In this case, you can use the .no_js selector to target these users.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
