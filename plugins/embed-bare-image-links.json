Which is really nice for forums with unexperienced users who find difficult inserting images</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Does it affect old published untagged image links?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, it only affects to newly saved posts/pages. However, if you update an old post, the plugin will check the content and will work aswell for that post.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What link image extensions it embeds?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>jpg, jpeg, png &amp; gif</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the external plugin page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>http://www.diegobiota.com/tecnologias-web/wordpress/embed-bare-image-links-plugin/</p>\n</p>\n\n"
