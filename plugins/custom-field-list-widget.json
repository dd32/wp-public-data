The listed values can be (hyper-)linked in different ways.<br />\nOne possibility is to create a list of all values of a custom field, which will be groupped by their post (or page) and (hyper-)linked automatically to this post (or page).<br />\nAnother possibility is that you can create a list of all unique values of a custom field and specify links as you like (or not).</p>\n<p>In other words: This plugin allows you to create lists of one category of meta information (on each list). The custom field names and values can be used as categorizable tags and with this plugin you can create lists of tags of one category.</p>\n<p>One example of usage could be: a list of the names of the guest of your podcast episodes. Or if you write about books then you can have e.g. a list of the authors and as sub list elements the titles of the books linked to the posts containing the recension.</p>\n<p>This plugin supports multiple widgets (You can have more than one list at the same time in one sidebar.) and uses the jQuery framework (which is delivered with WP automatically) to make the hide and show effects e.g. of a parted list (if the browser of a visiter of your does not allow or support Javascript the full list will be visible).</p>\n<p>Available in the languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>English</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Spanish provided by Juan Jose Bescos of <a href=\"https://www.ibidemgroup.com\" title=\"Juan Jose Bescos of IBIDEM GROUP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IBIDEM GROUP</a></li>\n<li>Bulgarian provided by Peter Toushkov</li>\n<li>Hindi provided by (complete only until v1.1.7) <a href=\"http://kakesh.com\" title=\"Kakesh Kumar of kakesh.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Kakesh Kumar</a></li>\n<li>Danish (frontend only) provided by <a href=\"http://http://www.fotoblogger.dk/\" title=\"Peter Kirring of fotoblogger.dk/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Peter Kirring</a></li>\n<li>Russian (only for v0.9.4 and v0.9.4.1) provided by <a href=\"http://www.comfi.com/\" title=\"Michael Comfi of the ComFi.com, Corp.\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Michael Comfi</a></li>\n<li>Uzbek (only for v0.9.4 and v0.9.4.1) provided by <a href=\"http://www.comfi.com/\" title=\"Alisher Safarov of the ComFi.com, Corp.\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Alisher Safarov</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If like to translate this plugin into your language or if you like to continue the existing translations then you are very welcome. Contact me and I will help you with the first steps.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<h4>Lists with more than one hierarchy level</h4>\n<p>(since v0.9.5)</p>\n<p>You can define several custom field names for a post. The values of these custom field names will be taken from the data base like they were arranged in columns side by side.<br />\nAll the values will be sorted by one of these columns. You can choose which column resp. custom field name should be the sort criterion. Further it is possible to hide this column (which should be decisive for the sorting) in the list in the sidebar.</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\nAn easy to understand example is probably a list of posts which are categorized by special dates. In this example the custom field names are &#8220;realdate&#8221; and &#8220;datename&#8221;. As &#8220;realdate&#8221; you set good sortable text strings or numbers like 20091005 (consists of year, month, day) and as &#8220;datename&#8221; you can set e.g. &#8220;October 2009&#8221; which is probably not in the same way sortable as the numbers. This way you can of course build probably more useful lists. A more colourful case of use which works this way is probably if you make list of posts grouped by a none-Gregorian calendar. You can use as datenames e.g. names of months and years of the Chinese calendar.<br />\nIn this example the &#8220;datenname&#8221;s would be the main list elements and the post titles sub elements of them. The &#8220;realdate&#8221; would be hidden via the option &#8220;hide this&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you want to create a more sub-divided list (instead of &#8220;datename&#8221; something like &#8220;year&#8221;, &#8220;month&#8221;, &#8220;day&#8221;) then you should keep an eye on the right hierarchy order.<br />\n(e.g. 0. &#8220;realdate&#8221; (sort by / hide this), 1. &#8220;year&#8221;, 2. &#8220;month&#8221;, 3. &#8220;day&#8221;). The post titles will be sub elements of &#8220;day&#8221; and &#8220;day&#8221; will be sub elements of the months and so on &#8211; in the list in the side bar widget. (But for this special case there other plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/collapsing-archives/\" title=\"Collapsing Archives on wordpress.org\" rel=\"ugc\">Collapsing Archives</a>)</p>\n<p>Other and even better examples (in English) are the book lists at the <a href=\"http://www.wilsonld.com/weblog/\" title=\"Larry Wilson's blog\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">weblog of Larry Wilson</a>. He makes list of the books he has read.</p>\n<p>There are some basic things you should be aware of:<br />\n* Overall you can use 5 hierarchical levels (if you want to have more then write me an email).<br />\n* Every post you want to have in the sidebar list should have the same custom field names (The custom field values can differ from post to post.)<br />\n* The custom field name which should be excluded from the list should be the first or the last in the list on the widgets page (on the admin site).</p>\n<h4>Usage of the sorting option &#8220;sorting values by the last word&#8221;</h4>\n<p>(since v0.7)</p>\n<p>You can influence which word the last word is by using a underline character between the words. If you make a underline character between two words it will be seen as one word.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>names with more than one first and family name\n\nJon Jake Stewart Brown\nthe last word is Brown\n\nJon Jake Stewart_Brown\nthe last word is \"Stewart Brown\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The underline character will not displayed in the sidebar.</p>\n<h3>Changing the appearance of the lists</h3>\n<p>Since v1.0 all click-able drop down menu elements have the class &#8220;customfieldlist_opt_link&#8221; so you can adapt the appearance of these elements easier.</p>\n<p>The speed of the show/hide effects and the hide/show characters are changeable via the settings page of the plugin. The settings on this page are for all the widgets of this plugin.</p>\n<h3>Deinstallation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin.</li>\n<li>Delete the folders and files of the plugin via the Dashboard of your blog or FTP or etc.(don&#8217;t forget the file from the K2 theme folder if you have used that). Only deleting the plugin via the WP Dashboard will remove the options from the database.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Put the files and the folders from the .zip-file into a separate sub folder below the main plugins folder of your weblog.<br />\nThe files should be stored in a path like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/wp-content/plugins/widget&#095;custom&#095;field&#095;list/</li>\n<li>custom&#095;field&#095;list&#095;k2&#095;widget.php (move this file into the /app/modules/-folder (e.g.: /wp-content/themes/k2/app/modules/) of the K2-theme if you are using the K2 theme with the old sidebar manager or the comparable plugin)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since WP 2.7 you can upload the .zip-file at once and the files will be put in the right place automatically &#8211; except for the K2 theme file.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin.</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<p>How can I keep the individual Links during an plugin upgrade?</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t deactivate the plugin. Because the options of the plugin in the options table of your weblog database are going to be removed automatically during the plugin deactivation.<br />\nFurther you have to upload the file of the new plugin version manually e.g. via FTP. Because during the automatic upgrade the old plugin would be deactivated.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to use this widget with the K2 theme sidebar manager (plugin)?<br />\nYes, it is possible. Move the file custom&#095;field&#095;list&#095;k2&#095;widget.php to the /app/modules/-folder (e.g.: /wp-content/themes/k2/app/modules/) of the K2-theme if you are using the K2 theme with the old sidebar manager or the comparable plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have questions then ask them on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-field-list-widget\" rel=\"ugc\">support page</a>.

        "changelog": "<h4>v1.5.1</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>bug fix regarding the new feature: filter by category. The widgets will show now all custom field values of a post (not only the first)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.5</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>new feature: filter by category &#8211; it is now possible to display only links to posts (with custom fields) which are in certain, selected categories.</li>\n<li>minor bug fixes (CSS, undefined variables, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.4</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish language files provided by Juan Jose Bescos of <a href=\"https://www.ibidemgroup.com\" title=\"Juan Jose Bescos of IBIDEM GROUP\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">IBIDEM GROUP</a></li>\n<li>minor appearance bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.3</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>language file updates</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.2.9</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>minor corrections in the German languages files and the plugins meta information regarding the translation</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.2.8</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>the localization file will load again</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.2.7</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>rework of the initialization of the plugin</li>\n<li>some minor bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>v1.2.6</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: In WP 3.3 the name of the Thickbox event which happens on closing the Thickbox (&#8220;unload&#8221;) has been changed by the WP team (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19189\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Ticket #19189</a>). This bug fix takes this modification into account so that the function of this plugin uses &#8220;unload&#8221; in combination with older WP versions and &#8220;tb_unload&#8221; with the current and probably the next couple of WP versions. (This is related to the &#8220;&#8230; full screen box&#8221; option of this widget.) </li>\n<li>Bugfix: The CSS option z-index of #TB_window and #TB_overlay will be increased temporarily (while the full screen box is open) to 10005 and 10000.

He makes list of the books he has read.</p>\n<p>There are some basic things you should be aware of:<br />\n* Overall you can use 5 hierarchical levels (if you want to have more then write me an email).<br />\n* Every post you want to have in the sidebar list should have the same custom field names (The custom field values can differ from post to post.)<br />\n* The custom field name which should be excluded from the list should be the first or the last in the list on the widgets page (on the admin site).</p>\n<h4>Usage of the sorting option &#8220;sorting values by the last word&#8221;</h4>\n<p>(since v0.7)</p>\n<p>You can influence which word the last word is by using a underline character between the words. If you make a underline character between two words it will be seen as one word.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>names with more than one first and family name\n\nJon Jake Stewart Brown\nthe last word is Brown\n\nJon Jake Stewart_Brown\nthe last word is \"Stewart Brown\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The underline character will not displayed in the sidebar.</p>\n<h3>Changing the appearance of the lists</h3>\n<p>Since v1.0 all click-able drop down menu elements have the class &#8220;customfieldlist_opt_link&#8221; so you can adapt the appearance of these elements easier.</p>\n<p>The speed of the show/hide effects and the hide/show characters are changeable via the settings page of the plugin. The settings on this page are for all the widgets of this plugin.</p>\n<h3>Deinstallation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Deactivate the plugin.</li>\n<li>Delete the folders and files of the plugin via the Dashboard of your blog or FTP or etc.(don&#8217;t forget the file from the K2 theme folder if you have used that). Only deleting the plugin via the WP Dashboard will remove the options from the database.</li>\n</ol>\n",
