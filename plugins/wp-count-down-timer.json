The user can add a target date in the future (i.e: Dec 30, 2099) in the shortcode provided with the plugin. Pasting the shortcode on any page, post or widget area will show a countdown timer counting from the current time towards the target date specified earlier. The user can set the target date in the parameter date=&#8221;&#8221; (i.e: date=&#8221;Dec 30 2099 13:00:00 UTC+1&#8243;). The following date formats are accepted:<br />\n &#8211; Dec 12 2099<br />\n &#8211; Dec,12,2099<br />\n &#8211; Dec 12,2099<br />\n &#8211; Dec/12/2099<br />\nAnd the month name Dec can be replaced with the month number (12) in all of the above.<br />\nThe user has some more feature to customize the appearance of the timer. The user can set the text that should show after the counting is over. By default it is Time Out. The user can set the color of the counter. By default it is blue. The color parameter works exact same is color attribute in CSS, so it could be color:black, or color:#000. The user can set the alignment of the timer text left, center or right. By default it is center.</p>\n",
