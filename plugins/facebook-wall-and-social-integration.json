If your page URL is look like this: <code>https://www.facebook.com/pages/pagename/123654123654123</code> then the Page ID is the numbers &#8211; <code>123654123654123</code>.</p>\n<p>If you have a Facebook <strong>group/profile</strong> then use <a href=\"http://lookup-id.com/\" title=\"Look Up my ID\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">this tool</a> to find your Group ID or view our documentaion link above.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20access%20token%20and%20how%20to%20get%20it%3F'>\nWhat is Access Token and how to get it?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Access Token is required by Facebook in order to access their feeds. It&#8217;s easy to get one. Just follow the step-by-step instructions <a href=\"http://extensions.techhelpsource.com/facebook_wall_documentation_wordpress.htm\" title=\"Getting an Access Token\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here in the doc</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20isn%27t%20the%20feed%20from%20my%20group%2Fpage%20displaying%3F'>\nWhy isn&#8217;t the feed from my group/page displaying?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Make sure system requirements are met(look for the tab in settings page), facebook id and access token are right. Also, increase the  <strong>Show number of posts</strong> value from settings becuase<br />\nnon-pro version only shows status/textual posts of page/group/profile so there may not be status posts in the number of posts value specified. Finally, make sure if there are no restrictions set in facebook page/group settings comparing with other page/groups for which feed works, mainly remove country and age restrictions in page/group settings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20my%20facebook%20profile%20feed%20not%20displaying%20properly%3F'>\nWhy my facebook profile feed not displaying properly?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you created facebook application after 30th April 2014 and using its token then profile feed may not be displayed for new facebook Graph API(you may require profile id in a different way, contact for that). Actually Displaying feed for profile shows only public and selected posts because of various restrictions.So it&#8217;s not good to show profile feed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20show%20photos%20and%20videos%20in%20my%20facebook%20feed%3F'>\nCan I show photos and videos in my Facebook feed?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This free plugin only allows you to display textual updates from your Facebook feed.
