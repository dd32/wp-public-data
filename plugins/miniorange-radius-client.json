We support radius authentication schemes like PAP, CHAP (MD5), MS CHAP V1, EAP-MSCHAP v2 and other schemes on request.<br />\nRADIUS Client plugin also allows you to invoke multi factor authentication (mfa/2fa) using RADIUS Server. You can also configure and use miniOrange as a RADIUS server with MFA.<br />\nRADIUS Client plugin supports both ACCESS/REJECT and CHALLENGE RESPONSES. In this way you can use all type of Second factor methods.<br />\nRADIUS Client supports all types of Attribute import.</p>\n<h3>Radius Servers we Support</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>freeRadius</li>\n<li>jumpCloud</li>\n<li>routerOS</li>\n<li>techRouter </li>\n<li>tinyRadius</li>\n<li>AuthenticateMyWiFi</li>\n<li>ClearBox</li>\n<li>FoxPass</li>\n<li>Acess Points</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>FREE VERSION FEATURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports login with any 3rd party RADIUS server or custom RADIUS server </li>\n<li>Option to allow/deny Auto Register Users- Automatic user registration after login if the user is not already registered with your site</li>\n<li>Allow login with WordPress Username, Email or both for existing users.</li>\n<li>Supports Authentication scheme &#8211; PAP Authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>PREMIUM FEATURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All the Free Version Features</li>\n<li>Login Widget- Use Widgets to easily integrate the login link with your WordPress site</li>\n<li>Support for Authentication Schemes &#8211; PAP Authentication, CHAP-MD5 Authentication, MSCHAP v1 Authentication, EAP-MSCHAP v2 Authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>RADIUS Servers support :-</h4>\n<p>The plugin works with the following RADIUS Servers:<br />\n*   Microsoft Windows Network Policy Server (NPS Server)<br />\n*   Free RADIUS 2 and above<br />\n*   Tiny RADIUS</p>\n<h4>What is RADIUS?</h4>\n<p>Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a client/server(networking) protocol,operating on port 1812 that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service. It enables remote access servers to communicate with a server to authenticate users and authorize their access to the requested system or service.</p>\n<h4>RADIUS Client</h4>\n<p>The RADIUS client is typically a NAS ( Network Access Server ) which is responsible for passing user information to designated RADIUS servers, and then based on the response which is returned, authenticates or rejects login to the user.</p>\n<h4>RADIUS Server</h4>\n<p>RADIUS servers are responsible for receiving user connection requests, authenticating the user, and then returning all configuration information necessary for the client to authenticate the user. A RADIUS server can act as a proxy client to other RADIUS servers or other kinds of authentication servers.</p>\n<h4>Authentication Protocols</h4>\n<p>The RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, EAP, EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS and EAP-PEAP.</p>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>Transactions between the client and RADIUS accounting server are authenticated through the use of a shared secret, which is never sent over the network.</p>\n<h4>Popular RADIUS Clients miniOrange integrates with:</h4>\n<p>*Palo Alto<br />\nThe users enter their AD credentials to log in to Palo Alto, the RADIUS Client, and after the username/password validation, an One Time Passcode is sent to the user&#8217;s mobile number.

Post validation of 2nd factor, users are logged in to OpenVPN.</p>\n<p>*FortiNet<br />\nThe users enter their AD credentials to log in to FortiNet, and after the username/password validation, an push notification is sent to the user&#8217;s mobile, that he needs to accept to get logged in to AWS.</p>\n<p>*AWS AD Connector</p>\n<p>*Citrix</p>\n<p>If you do not find your radius server listed here, please contact us on info@xecurify.com</p>\n<p>Secure your WordPress site with 2FA on top of single sign-on using miniOrange On-Premise IDP.
