It allows for user categories (how you use them is up to you) as well as membership / restricted content based solely on a custom membership taxonomy.  In order to use the membership/restricted content all you have to do is assign the membership taxonomy (after you create some terms just like post categories) to a post, page, menu item, media item, custom post type, ect&#8230;  Then that content is restricted unless a user has been assigned either that same membership category (term) or a parent membership category (parent term).  The membership/restricted content taxonomy is hierarchical so you can assign childred to the membership level and provide a user with parent priviledges which will allow them access to all child restricted content.  Media is also able to be restricted.  You can assign a media item the membership category (term) as well as click a checkbox to make it private.  When making it private, the media is sent to a protected folder that is inaccessible directly (by way of a direct url) or through the site.  In order to view the media or have access to it, a user must be logged in and have the correct privileges. Please note that when images are moved to the protected folder, all generated associated sizes are removed and only the main image is preserved.  You are able to restore the protected media back to the general access uploads folder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Restricted Content/Membership</h4>\n<h4>With Membership/Restricted Content</h4>\n<p>Have private media files that are not accessible either within the site or via a direct link (unless the user is logged in and has sufficient privileges (ie. the correct membership category assigned to them).</p>\n<h4>User Categories</h4>\n<h4>Create Custom Post Meta</h4>\n<h4>Create Custom Taxonomies (categories)</h4>\n<h4>Create Custom Admin Options Pages</h4>\n<h4>Create Custom Post Types</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<h4>DOCUMENTATION</h4>\n<p>There is documentation in regards to use and hooks in the plugin itself under the associated tabs.
