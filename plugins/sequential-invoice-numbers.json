These will uniquely identify each transaction that your business makes and (being sequential) help keep your records organized. Our developers know this is something that is not only important to you, but also any accountants that may need to view your sale history.</p>\n<p>The plugin will also create a table within your WordPress database to store information about your transactions. You can use this as your list of invoices, interrogate it or simply use it as a backup if needed.</p>\n<p>In addition to appearing on each edit order page, the invoice numbers will appear in the Woocommerce orders page as a sortable column. This will streamline your experience of the WordPress admin as you can view each order by when the transaction occurred.</p>\n<h4>Customisability</h4>\n<p>Our developers understand that everyone uses their WordPress site differently. For example, you may use a plugin to operate your store using different order statuses. If this is the case, you can change when we create the invoice number by visiting the Woocommerce settings under invoices.</p>\n<p>You may decide to begin your invoice numbers at a value other than 1, or skip to a number and create a distinction between sets of transactions. To do this, visit the same settings page and change the value of the next invoice number.</p>\n<p>we also provide the option to add these invoice numbers to the emails sent by Woocommerce. This makes communication with your clients easier as you can quickly identify the relevant invoice for a customer if needed.</p>\n<h4>Future of Sequential Invoice Numbers Plugin</h4>\n<p>Our developers are currently working on plugins to extend our sequential invoice numbers plugin. We aim to add more invoicing features that will make your life easier. These will show up on the AOD suite page which comes with the plugin.</p>\n"
