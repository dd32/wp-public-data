Generated the csv dynamically, to ensure the security of my users data.<br />\n2. Used wordpress apis to generate the csv data, to ensure that it was the actual data I wanted (rather than querying the database directly as some plugins do).</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20add%20fields%20to%20the%20download%3F'>\nHow do I add fields to the download?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The plugin includes a filter called <code>lh_eutc_headings</code>, simply add the meta field to the headings array by use of this filter e.g.:</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20something%20does%20not%20work%3F'>\nWhat is something does not work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>LH Logged In Post Status, and all <a href=\"LocalHero\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://lhero.org</a> plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones).</p>\n<p>If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.</p>\n<p>If the problem persists pleasse leave a post in the support forum: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-export-users-to-csv/\" rel=\"ugc\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-export-users-to-csv/</a>.
