All that&#8217;s required is to include this <code>&lt;!-- simple_archive --&gt;</code> on a page (or post).

Ensure WPLANG is set in your wp-config file.  Then use the simple-archive.pot template to create a .po translation for your language, this then needs compiling to create a .mo file.  For example, a German translation (simple-archive-de.po) is provided thanks to Ingo Terpelle at http://www.xing.com/profile/Ingo_Terpelle</p>\n",
