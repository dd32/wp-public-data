        "faq": "\n<h4>Can candles be submitted by my visitors automatically?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. On top of your ability to add and edit candles in the WordPress admin area, you can also use a shortcode to display a form on any page you like. This form will create a new candle when a user fills it out. The shortcode to do this is [candle-submission-form]</p>\n<p>When a user submits a candle, it will default to &#8220;Draft&#8221; status. You will need to publish any candle this way before it will display on your site. Just in case someone writes anything naughty!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I display all of my candles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To display all candles with pagination, use the [candles] shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I display a candle?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To display a single candle you can use the [candle id=&#8221;xyz&#8221;] shortcode, where &#8220;xyz&#8221; is the ID of the candle you wish to display.<br />\nYou can copy and paste the candle shortcode complete with ID from your Candles admin page in WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How can I display a category of candles?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>To display a category of candles (with pagination!), you can use the [candles category=&#8221;xyz&#8221;] shortcode. where &#8220;xyz&#8221; is the ID of the candle category you wish to display.<br />\nYou can also display candles from multiple categories by using [candles category=&#8221;xyz,abc&#8221;] where &#8220;xyz&#8221; is the first ID and &#8220;abc&#8221; is the second. You can pass in as many ID&#8217;s as you like, just separate them with commas.</p>\n<p>You can copy and paste this shortcode complete with ID from the Candles -&gt; Categories admin page in WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I display a random candle?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, you can use the Candle Widget and specify the &#8220;random&#8221; option, or you can use the [candle id=&#8221;random&#8221;] shortcode.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I change the number of candles shown per page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. Specify the &#8220;per_page&#8221; attribute when using the [candles] shortcode. EG, [candles category=&#8221;10&#8243; per_page=&#8221;5&#8243;].</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Available filters</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The following filters are available in In Memoriam (Light a Candle) so you can customise it to your liking.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>new_candle_notification &#8211; Filter whether an email notification should be sent to the administrator when a new candle is submitted.</li>\n<li>new_candle_email &#8211; Filter which email address which the new candle notification email is sent to.
