Effectively, if you switch back and forth between themes WordPress forgets which template it is suppose to use for any particular page. This is problematic if you are showcasing a plug-in and wish to allow the end user to switch between a selection of thems (via <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-switcher/\" rel=\"ugc\">Theme Switcher</a>, for example), and don&#8217;t want the page templates being reset to &#8216;default&#8217;.</p>\n<p>This plug-in resolves that problem. Whenever you save a page, the plug-in stores the theme-template pair. If you switch themes and save the page, it also stores that theme-template pair too. On switching between the two themes the appropriate template is &#8216;remembered&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Obviously for the plug-in to work you&#8217;ll need to save the appropriate template for the page for each theme you&#8217;ll be switching between.
