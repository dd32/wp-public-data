        "description": "<p>WordPress includes a handy way to add a favicon on your site through its Site Customizer. This icon will be used as a favicon on desktop browsers, but on mobile devices as well, when users create a shortcut on their homescreen. What happens, though, if you want to have different icons on different occasions, either because, for example, iOS doesn&#8217;t support transparency or simply because you want to have a more detailed icon on mobile devices? This plugin extends the WordPress&#8217; native functionality and allows you to upload different images for mobile (Android), iOS and Windows. Omitting an image will fallback to the default Site Icon.</p>\n<h4>Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Extend the native WordPress Site Icon functionality to use different icons for Android, iOS and Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the Favicon Extender plugin to your WordPress plugins directory and activate it.</li>\n<li>Go to the WordPress Customizer / Site Identity and add you Site Icon.

Favicon Extender is not a replacement for the WordPress&#8217; native functionality. Instead, it complements it. Therefore, in order for the plugin&#8217;s options to appear, you need to set your Site Icon first.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20kind%20of%20icons%20should%20i%20add%3F'>\nWhat kind of icons should I add?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Mobile (Android) icons should be png of 192&#215;192 pixels (transparency is allowed).  iOS icons should be 180&#215;180 pixels, with no transparency (iOS doesn&#8217;t support transparent icons). Windows icons should be 144&#215;144 pixels. The plugin should guide you on that, forcing you to crop the images to the proper dimensions.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
