        "description": "<p>PayPal Responder processes payment for a product via PayPal, then sends an email responder to the customer and returns them to a URL of your choice. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>You can use it to sell any type of product/s on your website. There is no cart, checkout process or anything complicated &#8211; it just lets the user buy a single product in 1 click, then returns them to a URL of your choice, and emails them the auto-responder.</p>\n<h4>Example Usage</h4>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re selling an eBook. User clicks &#8220;Buy&#8221; button &gt; user is directed through PayPal checkout &gt; once checkout it completed user is returned to a thank you URL and emailed the eBook.</p>\n<p>I developed this plugin for a usage similar to above example. I didn&#8217;t want a fully fledged eCommerce system, and many other solutions include Add to Cart and then whole heap of other stop screens that hindered the transaction.</p>\n<h4>Key Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple, light-weight PayPal plugin</li>\n<li>Can handle multiple products</li>\n<li>Can accept any currency PayPal can handle</li>\n<li>Set customer return URL </li>\n<li>Helpful tags available to use in auto-responder template</li>\n<li>Use default PayPal &#8216;buy now&#8217; button or upload a png button of your own</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Pro Version Available</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://enigmaplugins.com/plugins/paypal-responder-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get Pro Version</a> if you need the following advanced features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attach a file to responder (simple digital delivery of your product)</li>\n<li>Unlimited responder templates (so you can use a different email responder for each different product)</li>\n</ul>\n",

        "faq": "\n<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upload the <code>paypal-responder</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the PayPal Responder plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Configure the plugin by going to the <code>PayPal Responder</code> tab that appears in your admin menu.</li>\n<li>Add buy buttons to any page using shortcode which is generated in the Manage Products area</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n<h4>The auto-responder is not working</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Firstly, please check your SPAM folder. It&#8217;s pretty common for WordPress generated email to get sent to SPAM, or even rejected by the recipient mail server entirely.  A good solution is to configure WordPress to send systems generated emails over SMTP instead of using PHP mail(). I recommend Callum Macdonald&#8217;s plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/\" rel=\"ugc\">WP Mail SMTP</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>What could I sell with this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>You can sell whatever you want. There aren&#8217;t any fancy features in this plugin &#8211; like it doesn&#8217;t have delivery options, order management etc so it&#8217;s really designed for just a single simple product. For example I use it to sell access to a private site &#8211; after successful checkout user is sent the password to log in. You could use it for other similar things like to sell a PDF or eBook, or you might use it for selling a virtual product or service like say consultation services for example.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I add more than 1 product?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes the plugin can have any number of products. In this free version you can only set 1 return URL and 1 email auto-responder template.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can I attach a file to send with the auto-responder?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Not in free version. You can in Pro &#8211; <a href=\"http://enigmaplugins.com/plugins/paypal-responder-pro/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">available here.</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Where can I get support for this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve tried all the obvious stuff and it&#8217;s still not working please request support via the forum.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
