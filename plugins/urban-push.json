        "description": "<p>Urban Push is a WordPress plugin that utilizes the Urban Airship API to send a push directly from the WordPress “new post” page. <strong>You MUST have an account with Urban Airship to use this plugin.</strong> You can send a single push to up to 4 Urban Airship applications. After a push attempt, you will see one new custom field entry for each configured Urban Airship application. It will say <strong>push sent for</strong> followed by the name you chose for your Urban Airship application. The value of the custom field will contain the response returned from Urban Airship. For a successful push, the response is usually “(null).”</p>\n<p>More features are coming like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ability to set your aps options (badge, sound, etc..)</li>\n<li>The ability to choose which app to send a push to (or all).</li>\n</ol>\n",

It will know to build the aps string for an Android device.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is Urban Airship?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Urban Airship is the engine behind thousands of the world’s most successful mobile apps, providing a full suite of messaging and content delivery tools, including Push Notifications, Rich Media Messaging, In-App Purchase and Subscriptions.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is a push notification?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Push Notifications allow you to send messages directly to the people who have installed your app, even when your app is closed.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why is there a limit of only 4 Urban Airship applications?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It seemed like a good number. If you need more, the plugin is easy enough to modify. Just add more form fields to the settings.php file and add another send_push method with the correct parameters in urbanairship.php. If you need help, contact me.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
