        "faq": "\n<h4>How do I use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Activate the plugin, and modify the settings for your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this impact my SEO (Google Ranking)</h4>\n<p>\n<p>A JavaScript gateway such as this will allow easy indexing by search engines. Search bots won’t run the JavaScript to<br />\nto activate the gateway, and so it will not appear for them at all. The script is executed after the page is loaded, and<br />\nthe content is rendered.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What source is used for legal drinking ages?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Legal drinking ages by country are referenced from <a href=\"http://drinkingage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004294\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ProCon.org</a></p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why the hastle, can&#8217;t I just input a specific age?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Plugins exist that allow you to set a specific age requirement for visitors. This is for worldwide alcohol brands. All countries don’t have the same drinking age.<br />\nSo solutions where the gateway is based on a static entry age aren’t viable. An age, and location must be gathered by the gateway to determine if a user is credible<br />\nto enter the site. Tequila consumption in Mexico is legal 3 years earlier than it is for residents of California.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
