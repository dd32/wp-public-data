        "description": "<p><strong>Design Feedback &amp; Approvals</strong> (formerly Cycles) allows you to share any design (mockups, wireframes, sitemaps) with clients and colleagues, who view your work in their browser and post feedback directly on your designs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This plugin is the used to be called <a href=\"https://cycleshq.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cycles</a>, and is the predecessor of new Cycles software with a new plugin submitted to the repo and coming any day now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Overview</h4>\n<p>This plugin allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Share designs with anyone</strong> &#8211; Upload any design (mockups, moodboards, wireframes, etc) and share with your clients. They&#8217;ll only need the URL (and optional password) to view and make comments.  No attachments or accounts required.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collect design feedback</strong> &#8211; Clients view mockups in their browser, and click directly on the design to comment. Feedback remains organized, eliminating back and forth emails and miscommunication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Record approvals/sign off</strong> &#8211; When you&#8217;ve made requested changes, your client approves the design by agreeing to terms and providing a digital signature.  The time, date, and name of the approver are recorded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep project members informed</strong> &#8211; When you publish a design, the plugin can send an email invitation with access details and instructions.  Additionally, you can configure instant email notifications for new comments and approvals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Import design feedback into 3rd party services</strong> &#8211; Connect your designs to Trello, Basecamp, Asana, Slack, Help Scout, or any 3rd party service with project based email addresses, to bring feedback and approvals into your team&#8217;s project management workflow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nhIQH9IHVE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Why you should use the new Cycles plugin</h4>\n<p>First, many of the &#8220;designers&#8221; we speak with are moving <strong>from</strong> creating mockups in Photoshop and Illustrator <strong>to</strong> starting projects with themes and designing straight in the browser.</p>\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve launched a new version of Cycles that <strong>collects feedback and approvals on any web page</strong> that works on many web development platforms (not just WordPress).  A (free) Cycles account enables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A record of all comments, replies, and approvals (outside of your WordPress database or client&#8217;s site)</li>\n<li>Easy notifications and integrations without configuring your WordPress email settings</li>\n<li>Feedback and approvals on any web page or site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Free accounts have no trial time limits, and include all visual feedback and approval features.</p>\n<p>Get more info at <a href=\"https://cycleshq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://cycleshq.com</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Plugin features</h4>\n<p><strong>Email Invites &amp; Notifications</strong><br />\nSend your client an invitation to review your newly published design, directly from your WordPress site.  Then, when someone makes a comment or provides their approval, get notified at the email address(es) of your choosing. Note: As this plugin relies on the <code>wp_mail()</code> WordPress function, this feature requires your web server/host to have email correctly configured, or the use of a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp\" rel=\"ugc\">Postman-SMTP</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3rd party integration</strong><br />\nEnter project-specific email addresses in the notification section to send new comments and approvals directly to many 3rd party services like Trello, Basecamp, Asana, Slack, and Help Scout.</p>\n<p><strong>Approvals &amp; Digital Signatures</strong><br />\nWhen a client is ready to “sign off,” they approve designs by agreeing to terms and providing their digital signature for the system to record.</p>\n<p><strong>Custom Design URL <em>and</em> Slug</strong><br />\nMake sharing easier with custom, client friendly and easy to pronounce URLs. Now including the path/slug.</p>\n<p><strong>Self Hosted</strong><br />\nWorks on your (or your client’s) WordPress installation, so files stay private and secure on your client-friendly, recognizable domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Upload images</strong><br />\nUpload single or multiple files of any type supported by WordPress, such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Library</strong><br />\nOrganize designs in the WordPress media library for quick sorting and searching.</p>\n<p><strong>Password Protection</strong><br />\nSet optional passwords to keep designs private and secure from unwanted visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>Annotated Feedback</strong><br />\nViewers leave comments anywhere on the design so others can view their feedback with context.</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback List</strong><br />\nComments are gathered into a single, easy to reference list of design feedback.</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the entire plugin folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the <code>Plugins</code> menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Done!

Go to &#8216;Cycles&#8217; in the sidebar, and click add new (<code>Design Feedback &gt; Add New</code>).  Give your design a name (clients will see this) and add an image. You can optionally adjust the share URL to make it more client friendly.

Your clients need only open your URL in a browser to begin leaving feedback.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What kind of images are supported?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Design Feedback works with most image types supported by WordPress, such as JPEG, GIF, PNG, and BMP.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What kind of designs can I share?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We produced this plugin to help you share anything where you need someone else&#8217;s opinion.  Use it to get feedback on designs like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logos</li>\n<li>Site maps</li>\n<li>Wireframes</li>\n<li>Mockups</li>\n<li>Stock photography selections</li>\n<li>Illustrations</li>\n<li>Mood boards</li>\n<li>Infographics</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I get more help?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you encounter a technical issue, please use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/design-feedback\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Forum</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
