Then 10Web Booster is exactly website speed optimizer you&#8217;re looking for!<br />\nOur WordPress performance plugin will transform your website in no time, enhancing the visitors&#8217; user experience, SEO, engagement, and conversion rates.</p>\n<p>10Web Booster works on desktop and mobile versions of websites of any complexity. Optimize your website pages, experiment with every level we offer, and obtain rewarding results from the best WordPress speed plugin in the market.</p>\n<p>Check out the extensive feature list of the 10Web Booster below and take a more detailed look at everything we offer.</p>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated 90+ PageSpeed</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Optimized Core Web Vitals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Higher search engine rankings</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Up to 7% boost in conversions</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Up to 40% boost in visitor engagement</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Up to 53% mobile traffic engagement boost</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What&#8217;s in it</h3>\n<p><strong>Optimization of homepage + 5 pages , embedded images included</strong><br />\n10Web Booster is made possible thanks to dozens of technical optimizations:</p>\n<h4>Page Cache</h4>\n<p>A cache is a fast-retrieval, short-term storage space where copies of recently accessed data and resources are saved. A cache significantly speeds up page speed and performance by downloading these commonly accessed data from the source, creating a copy of these resources and temporarily keeping them in a more easily accessible storage space from where the data can be accessed faster once the visitor returns. This short-term space can be a browser or a web server or even the original web server which also keeps different format copies of your resources. When you update your website data, the saved copies are also revised and updated.</p>\n<p>10Web Booster uses a number of cache techniques, including page cache for HTML, file cache, smart cache invalidation, session-aware, and browser-aware caching and device and cookie-aware caching.</p>\n<p>Page cache takes care of dynamic pages. In WordPress, dynamic pages are written in the PHP backend language, which require a great deal of time to generate, when compared to the generation time of traditional static web pages in plain HTML. Page cache creates and stores copies of dynamic pages in the format of static files, making their retrieval as quick as possible. When a visitor enters your site, this &#8220;static&#8221; copy of your page is immediately loaded from the cache instead of your hosting.</p>\n<p>File cache, or resource cache, on the other hand, allows for storage of created minified and compressed scripts and styles. This process also speeds up your page speed and performance.</p>\n<p>10Web Booster Pro employs backend or server caching, and through NGINX FastCGI Cache, caches a variety of resources from pages to feeds to 301-redirects on subdomains. This way you obtain page speed and retrieval at the fastest possible speed.</p>\n<h4>CSS &amp; HTML Minification &amp; Compression</h4>\n<p>The minification and merger of CSS and HTML is the procedure of reducing file size by a couple of bytes. The significance of this stems from the fact that larger files require more resources which may slow down website load time.</p>\n<h4>JS Minification and Compression</h4>\n<p>Compression of lengthy algorithmic JS codes is standard practice. The crunching of JS code, meaning, the removal of all the extra spaces, comments and other components which make the code readable and understandable, reduces the time of downloading JavaScript, directly improving WordPress Speed. By combining JS scripts, we can also minify the files, further reducing execution time.</p>\n<h4>Image Optimization</h4>\n<p>Image optimization leans on minimizing file size through image compression while simultaneously preserving image quality. 10Web&#8217;s image optimization achieves that and more. Through WebP compression, container-specific image resizing, and preloading of images, images can be optimized and loaded within seconds.</p>\n<p>Container-specific image resizing finds or generates copies of images in various sizes. It then uses these differently sized copies of images on different-sized screens. This technique reduces valuable seconds of image load time and guarantees that you do not sacrifice quality for page speed.<br />\nPreloading images also significantly reduces page load time while providing your visitors with a seamless user experience. Preloading images means recovering images prior to visitor interaction. This method does make sense for certain cases &#8211; and not for all types of image, like mouseover images or slide show images.</p>\n<h4>Defer JS and CSS Execution</h4>\n<p>Having content that&#8217;s immediately visible when a user opens your website is only possible with file load optimization through prioritization of important CSS and deferral of JavaScript.  That&#8217;s how 10Web booster ensures a 90+ page speed score as the best WordPress speed plugin.</p>\n<p>Javascript files may cause a severe reduction in page load speed. This is particularly true of third-party JavaScript files that are poorly created. Third-party JavaScript files include<br />\nwidgets, trackers, analytics, ads, social, chats, media buttons, pop-ups, and other files directly embedded on your site. These JavaScript files can reduce your page load speed, and therefore must first be located, and then divided into critical and non-critical JavaScript files. Those that are not critical must be delayed and only activated when a visitor interacts with the webpage.</p>\n<h4>Critical CSS</h4>\n<p>Downloading complete CSS files hinder the perceived speed of your WordPress website. After the user visits the webpages, the minimum-necessary stylesheets for the proper rendering of the webpage&#8217;s visible content are loaded, while the rest is served per need. Critical CSS doesn&#8217;t block page rendering and assists in passing the Core Web Vitals. 10Web Booster&#8217;s superiority in the case of critical CSS generation is due to its algorithms which programmatically parse through your web page and collect all the CSS rules used on that page. 10Web Booster guarantees that all stylesheets for critical CSS are present and unaffected. It also ensures that rule duplicates are deleted and that styles are structured to improve performance. 10Web Booster uses the critical CSS generation technique on five different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop to deliver the most effective page speed optimize in the market.</p>\n<h4>Image Lazy load</h4>\n<p>Images are one of the largest resources on a page dragging your page speed. Through the image lazy loading technique, you can delay the loading process of all the images on your page, except for those in the view of website visitors. This method saves significant seconds of load time and drastically improves all Core Web Vitals. 10Web Booster ensures that its lazy loading algorithms work perfectly and do not conflict with themes and plugins. 10Web Booster also lazy loads background images.</p>\n<h4>Font Swap</h4>\n<p>The reduction and optimization of how web fonts load could potentially help in passing the Core Web Vitals assessment, thus, benefit your ranking on Google.Custom fonts require additional resources to load and only then does your page displays your hand-picked font, and of course, this takes time and adds much-feared milliseconds to your page speed. 10Web Booster adds font-display: swap. This technique first displays a generic font, therefore loading your page immediately, then swaps the default font with your custom-picked font once your original font style is set up. This swap method reduces page load time, and makes sure that FOUT or Flash of Unstyled Text and FOIT or Flash of Invisible Text issues are avoided.</p>\n<h4>Conversion of Image Format to WebP</h4>\n<p>Images take up website resources and unfortunately cannot be avoided. There are ways to reduce their large size. Conversion to different formats is one solution. Conversion to JPEG or PNG was the traditional method. There is another, a newer player which produces better results. Google&#8217;s WebP compression can reduce file size, on average, 25-34% smaller than a comparable JPEG image and 26% smaller than a comparable PNG image. This significant reduction in size, substantially impacts and improves page speed.</p>\n<h4>iFrame and Video Lazy load</h4>\n<p>Iframes and videos are even larger in size than images, so imagine their impact on your page speed. Through lazy loading of iframes and videos, we make sure that content not yet in the direct view of your visitor does not conflict with your page speed. The loading of these items is delayed until your user scrolls down. As with image lazy loading, iframe and video lazy loading enhance all Core Web Vitals.</p>\n<h4>Container-specific Image Resizing</h4>\n<p>The container-specific image resizing method involves identifying images on your page and creating different-sized duplicates of these images. The differently sized images are then used for differently sized screens. Small-screen devices receive the small-sized images, loading them at the optimal speed possible. Medium-sized screens load medium-sized images, loading images at the fastest possible speed without sacrificing image quality. Large-sized screens, likewise, load large-sized images, ensuring the best quality and the best possible speed. Therefore, with the 10Web Booster, instead of forcing your website to load an enormous image when the user is only looking for a thumbnail, you&#8217;ll have a container-specific image at your disposal.</p>\n<p><strong>10Web Booster Pro</strong></p>\n<h4>Full frontend optimization of the entire website and all images</h4>\n<h4>Backend optimization</h4>\n<p><strong>Speed Optimization Modes</strong></p>\n<p>When your automated homepage optimization kicks off, we test out each and every one of the 4 modes. Consequently, we compare the results, and, as presumed, the mode that achieved the highest score while simultaneously keeping your website from breaking, will be set as your default.</p>\n<p>You can choose any of the following four levels and manage the levels for each page individually from the Custom rules tab in your 10Web dashboard to provide. We provide the best page speed optimizer to any WordPress website, based on need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard Mode:</strong> &#8211;  Uses different standard speed optimization techniques.</li>\n<li><strong>Balanced Mode:</strong> &#8211;  All optimization techniques in Standard Mode + Critical CSS</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Mode:</strong> &#8211;  All optimization techniques in Standard Mode + JS Delay.</li>\n<li><strong>Extreme Mode:</strong> &#8211;  All optimization techniques in Balanced Mode + JS Delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IMPORTANT:</h3>\n<p>If you think you found a bug in 10Web Booster or have any problem/question concerning the plugin, please check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tenweb-speed-optimizer\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Forum</a> in our website.</p>\n",

Then 10Web Booster is exactly website speed optimizer you&#8217;re looking for!<br />\nOur WordPress performance plugin will transform your website in no time, enhancing the visitors&#8217; user experience, SEO, engagement, and conversion rates.</p>\n<p>10Web Booster works on desktop and mobile versions of websites of any complexity. Optimize your website pages, experiment with every level we offer, and obtain rewarding results from the best WordPress speed plugin in the market.</p>\n<p>Check out the extensive feature list of the 10Web Booster below and take a more detailed look at everything we offer.</p>\n<h3>Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated 90+ PageSpeed</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Optimized Core Web Vitals</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Higher search engine rankings</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Up to 7% boost in conversions</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Up to 40% boost in visitor engagement</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Up to 53% mobile traffic engagement boost</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What&#8217;s in it</h3>\n<p><strong>Optimization of homepage + 5 pages , embedded images included</strong><br />\n10Web Booster is made possible thanks to dozens of technical optimizations:</p>\n<h4>Page Cache</h4>\n<p>A cache is a fast-retrieval, short-term storage space where copies of recently accessed data and resources are saved. A cache significantly speeds up page speed and performance by downloading these commonly accessed data from the source, creating a copy of these resources and temporarily keeping them in a more easily accessible storage space from where the data can be accessed faster once the visitor returns. This short-term space can be a browser or a web server or even the original web server which also keeps different format copies of your resources. When you update your website data, the saved copies are also revised and updated.</p>\n<p>10Web Booster uses a number of cache techniques, including page cache for HTML, file cache, smart cache invalidation, session-aware, and browser-aware caching and device and cookie-aware caching.</p>\n<p>Page cache takes care of dynamic pages. In WordPress, dynamic pages are written in the PHP backend language, which require a great deal of time to generate, when compared to the generation time of traditional static web pages in plain HTML. Page cache creates and stores copies of dynamic pages in the format of static files, making their retrieval as quick as possible. When a visitor enters your site, this &#8220;static&#8221; copy of your page is immediately loaded from the cache instead of your hosting.</p>\n<p>File cache, or resource cache, on the other hand, allows for storage of created minified and compressed scripts and styles. This process also speeds up your page speed and performance.</p>\n<p>10Web Booster Pro employs backend or server caching, and through NGINX FastCGI Cache, caches a variety of resources from pages to feeds to 301-redirects on subdomains. This way you obtain page speed and retrieval at the fastest possible speed.</p>\n<h4>CSS &amp; HTML Minification &amp; Compression</h4>\n<p>The minification and merger of CSS and HTML is the procedure of reducing file size by a couple of bytes. The significance of this stems from the fact that larger files require more resources which may slow down website load time.</p>\n<h4>JS Minification and Compression</h4>\n<p>Compression of lengthy algorithmic JS codes is standard practice. The crunching of JS code, meaning, the removal of all the extra spaces, comments and other components which make the code readable and understandable, reduces the time of downloading JavaScript, directly improving WordPress Speed. By combining JS scripts, we can also minify the files, further reducing execution time.</p>\n<h4>Image Optimization</h4>\n<p>Image optimization leans on minimizing file size through image compression while simultaneously preserving image quality. 10Web&#8217;s image optimization achieves that and more. Through WebP compression, container-specific image resizing, and preloading of images, images can be optimized and loaded within seconds.</p>\n<p>Container-specific image resizing finds or generates copies of images in various sizes. It then uses these differently sized copies of images on different-sized screens. This technique reduces valuable seconds of image load time and guarantees that you do not sacrifice quality for page speed.<br />\nPreloading images also significantly reduces page load time while providing your visitors with a seamless user experience. Preloading images means recovering images prior to visitor interaction. This method does make sense for certain cases &#8211; and not for all types of image, like mouseover images or slide show images.</p>\n<h4>Defer JS and CSS Execution</h4>\n<p>Having content that&#8217;s immediately visible when a user opens your website is only possible with file load optimization through prioritization of important CSS and deferral of JavaScript.  That&#8217;s how 10Web booster ensures a 90+ page speed score as the best WordPress speed plugin.</p>\n<p>Javascript files may cause a severe reduction in page load speed. This is particularly true of third-party JavaScript files that are poorly created. Third-party JavaScript files include<br />\nwidgets, trackers, analytics, ads, social, chats, media buttons, pop-ups, and other files directly embedded on your site. These JavaScript files can reduce your page load speed, and therefore must first be located, and then divided into critical and non-critical JavaScript files. Those that are not critical must be delayed and only activated when a visitor interacts with the webpage.</p>\n<h4>Critical CSS</h4>\n<p>Downloading complete CSS files hinder the perceived speed of your WordPress website. After the user visits the webpages, the minimum-necessary stylesheets for the proper rendering of the webpage&#8217;s visible content are loaded, while the rest is served per need. Critical CSS doesn&#8217;t block page rendering and assists in passing the Core Web Vitals. 10Web Booster&#8217;s superiority in the case of critical CSS generation is due to its algorithms which programmatically parse through your web page and collect all the CSS rules used on that page. 10Web Booster guarantees that all stylesheets for critical CSS are present and unaffected. It also ensures that rule duplicates are deleted and that styles are structured to improve performance. 10Web Booster uses the critical CSS generation technique on five different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop to deliver the most effective page speed optimize in the market.</p>\n<h4>Image Lazy load</h4>\n<p>Images are one of the largest resources on a page dragging your page speed. Through the image lazy loading technique, you can delay the loading process of all the images on your page, except for those in the view of website visitors. This method saves significant seconds of load time and drastically improves all Core Web Vitals. 10Web Booster ensures that its lazy loading algorithms work perfectly and do not conflict with themes and plugins. 10Web Booster also lazy loads background images.</p>\n<h4>Font Swap</h4>\n<p>The reduction and optimization of how web fonts load could potentially help in passing the Core Web Vitals assessment, thus, benefit your ranking on Google.Custom fonts require additional resources to load and only then does your page displays your hand-picked font, and of course, this takes time and adds much-feared milliseconds to your page speed. 10Web Booster adds font-display: swap. This technique first displays a generic font, therefore loading your page immediately, then swaps the default font with your custom-picked font once your original font style is set up. This swap method reduces page load time, and makes sure that FOUT or Flash of Unstyled Text and FOIT or Flash of Invisible Text issues are avoided.</p>\n<h4>Conversion of Image Format to WebP</h4>\n<p>Images take up website resources and unfortunately cannot be avoided. There are ways to reduce their large size. Conversion to different formats is one solution. Conversion to JPEG or PNG was the traditional method. There is another, a newer player which produces better results. Google&#8217;s WebP compression can reduce file size, on average, 25-34% smaller than a comparable JPEG image and 26% smaller than a comparable PNG image. This significant reduction in size, substantially impacts and improves page speed.</p>\n<h4>iFrame and Video Lazy load</h4>\n<p>Iframes and videos are even larger in size than images, so imagine their impact on your page speed. Through lazy loading of iframes and videos, we make sure that content not yet in the direct view of your visitor does not conflict with your page speed. The loading of these items is delayed until your user scrolls down. As with image lazy loading, iframe and video lazy loading enhance all Core Web Vitals.</p>\n<h4>Container-specific Image Resizing</h4>\n<p>The container-specific image resizing method involves identifying images on your page and creating different-sized duplicates of these images. The differently sized images are then used for differently sized screens. Small-screen devices receive the small-sized images, loading them at the optimal speed possible. Medium-sized screens load medium-sized images, loading images at the fastest possible speed without sacrificing image quality. Large-sized screens, likewise, load large-sized images, ensuring the best quality and the best possible speed. Therefore, with the 10Web Booster, instead of forcing your website to load an enormous image when the user is only looking for a thumbnail, you&#8217;ll have a container-specific image at your disposal.</p>\n<p><strong>10Web Booster Pro</strong></p>\n<h4>Full frontend optimization of the entire website and all images</h4>\n<h4>Backend optimization</h4>\n<p><strong>Speed Optimization Modes</strong></p>\n<p>When your automated homepage optimization kicks off, we test out each and every one of the 4 modes. Consequently, we compare the results, and, as presumed, the mode that achieved the highest score while simultaneously keeping your website from breaking, will be set as your default.</p>\n<p>You can choose any of the following four levels and manage the levels for each page individually from the Custom rules tab in your 10Web dashboard to provide. We provide the best page speed optimizer to any WordPress website, based on need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard Mode:</strong> &#8211;  Uses different standard speed optimization techniques.</li>\n<li><strong>Balanced Mode:</strong> &#8211;  All optimization techniques in Standard Mode + Critical CSS</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Mode:</strong> &#8211;  All optimization techniques in Standard Mode + JS Delay.</li>\n<li><strong>Extreme Mode:</strong> &#8211;  All optimization techniques in Balanced Mode + JS Delay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>IMPORTANT:</h3>\n<p>If you think you found a bug in 10Web Booster or have any problem/question concerning the plugin, please check out <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tenweb-speed-optimizer\" rel=\"ugc\">Support Forum</a> in our website.</p>\n",
