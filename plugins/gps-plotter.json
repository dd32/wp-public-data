        "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.stpetedesign.com/product/gps-plotter-bootleg/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GPS Plotter by St. Pete Design</a> allows you to track Android phones in real time. GPS Plotter displays a map on your website with your present location using Openstreet Maps or Google Maps. We recommend that you start with Openstreet Maps unless you have experience with Google Maps API.</p>\n<p>GPS Plotter was forked from a plugin called GPS Tracker by Nick Fox. Nick stopped development on GPS Tracker so we picked up where he left off. You can watch the cell phones being tracked using Openstreet maps and Google maps and you can store and reload routes easily for later viewing. The plugin is fully responsive and it will display properly on any device such as a cell phone, tablet or desktop computer.</p>\n<p>You can download the app from the Android store then you enter your username and the URL that you have installed the GPS Plotter plugin on. Now you are ready to click &#8220;Tracking On&#8221; to start sending GPS tracking information to that URL.</p>\n<p>Then you can go to that site on either your computer or mobile device and check out the GPS information you are sending for yourself.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this plugin useful. If you find any bugs, please email us so we can address any issues that come up immediately.</p>\n<p>Please rate it and leave a review so we can help other developers find this software. Thanks!</p>\n",

Click on the &#8220;Start Tracking&#8221; button and then go to your WordPress website and view your location on the map. Please note that it may take a couple of minutes for the first location to appear. If you are having trouble viewing your first location make sure you are outside and that there are not a lot of trees or something else covering your view of the sky. If it&#8217;s a really cloudy day, it may take a while to get your first location. This is normal behavior for all cell phones since they tend to have a smaller antenna than a dedicated gps device.</p>\n<p>How to Install GPS Plotter on your Android phone;</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/doHDXO41kLk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>How to Install GPS Plotter on your WordPress site with Google Maps;</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuUelJGFfWQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n<p>How to install GPS Plotter on your WordPress site with OpenStreetMaps;</p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rmb7brxigUk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n",
