        "faq": "\n<h4>Plugin is telling me that I don&#8217;t have permissions to edit the files</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If for any reason the plugin is telling you that it doesnâ€™t have permissions to alter a given file you will need to access your server, using your favorite FTP Client (Filezilla, Cyberduck, FlashFXPâ€¦) and change the permissions of the file to 777. You can revert them back to 644 (normal permissions of a file) after the plugin finishes the modifications.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>My sub-domain health is is returning a 500 HTTP error code</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you get a sub-domain health notification stating that your sub-domain is returning a 500 HTTP error code the most probable explanation is that your sub-domain folder has 777 permissions. Revert them back to 755 and you should be fine.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have activated the plugin but I get a permissions notification</h4>\n<p>\n<p>WP-PLS will automatically try to do everything for himself. One of his biggest restrictions is file permissions. If you get a notification that you should change the permissions of a given file access using your favorite FTP Client and change its permissions.<br />\nThere are a lot of tutorials on how to do this as this is specific to your FTP Client</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I cannot see .htaccess on my FTP Client</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is normal. A file started with a &#8220;.&#8221; is interpreted as a hidden file, therefore, you need to activate &#8220;Show hidden files&#8221; on your FTP Client</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using a NGINX HTTP server. Will it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It will but it does require additional configuration and a bit more IT knowledge. All information will be given by the plugin if he sees fit. Let me know if you have any suggestion.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m using Window Server. Will it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I have been reported that it work with some limitations by a few users, but it does require additional configuration and a bit more IT knowledge. All information will be given by the plugin if he sees fit. Let me know if you have any suggestion.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;m getting a Warning: get_headers()</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This is probably because your sub-domain doesn&#8217;t have http:// or https:// at the start.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve configured my sub-domain on apache level myself and its DocumentRoot folder is the same as my main domain. Will it work?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes it will. Since version 0.1.3 that it will detect if we&#8217;re dealing with WordPress .htaccess and if it&#8217;s the case it will append to the file instead of replacing it.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the plugin safe?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Like everything in life, nothing is 100% safe. However I&#8217;ve implemented a lot of rules to the plugin to avoid any big issues.<br />\nIf for any reason you have problems with the plugin there are always backups on each of the sub-domain folders. You just need to back it up with the one you like. &#8220;Nothing is lost, only transformed&#8221; ðŸ™‚</p>\n</p>\n\n",
