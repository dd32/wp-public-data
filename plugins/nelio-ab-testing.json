All details are very intuitive and provide you with the information you need to know which alternative is working best for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Day-to-day information that will help you understand what happens over time.</li>\n<li>See at a glance how confident you can be of having found a winning variant.</li>\n<li>Compare each variant with the original version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>#7 &#8211; 1Ô∏è‚É£One-click winner</h4>\n<p>Apply the winning version quickly and increase your income right away!
