        "description": "<p><a href='https://wpuserspro.com/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Users Pro </a>plugin was developed to help you receive earnings from your WordPress website, manage members, create subscription plans and restrict access to premium content can be done with few clicks.</p>\n<p>WP Users Pro is a full-featured membership plugin for WordPress that allows you to restrict partial content or restrict entire posts and pages.</p>\n<p>You will be able to create membership plans and start selling within minutes. You can restrict access to premium content based on the membership level of the user, roles, post type and categories.</p>\n<h4>Content Accessibility:</h4>\n<p>This is an essential part of the plugin and we have implemented useful restriction options. You can make a post visible to only certain roles. Also, you can display posts or pages to only logged in users.</p>\n<p>The capability to allow members to purchase <strong>multiple subscriptions</strong> is available on pro versions as well.</p>\n<p>This is a powerful feature that gives you even more control of what your members can see based on the different subscription levels you offer.</p>\n<p>The plugin offers four different protection methods:</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> &#8211; Protect entire posts and pages. You can set a custom message to display when the members try to access to the protected post. Also, you can set a custom title and even hide the entire post from the website.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> &#8211; Logged in Members Protection.  This method will make either posts or pages visible to logged in members only.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> &#8211; Membership Protection. You can make posts and pages visible to only certain subscription plans.</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> &#8211; <a href='https://docs.wpuserspro.com/protect-partial-content/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Partial Content Protection.</a> This allows you to hide just part of a post’s content. This is useful to let your members access to just a small section of your content without hiding the whole post.</p>\n<p>Simple to install and configure – yet customizable and scalable!</p>\n<h4>Recurring Payments:</h4>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be able to track how many subscribers you have, when they&#8217;re being billed, and how much revenue you&#8217;re generating from the recurring payments — which means you&#8217;ll always know how much revenue your subscription website can count on as you continue to grow.</p>\n<h4>WooCommerece Integration:</h4>\n<p>The plugin can be integrated with WooCommerce giving your users a fantastic experience when checking the status of their orders. By installing the WooCommerce extension, your user will be able to manage their orders, update billing and shipping information directly from the WP Users Pro User’s Dashboard.</p>\n<h4>Membership Payments:</h4>\n<p>Accept PayPal payments from your subscribers. You can keep track of all member payments, payment statuses and purchased subscription plans.</p>\n<p>The plugin comes with a clear user’s panel that allows your subscribers to check their payments easily. This is important because not only the admin will be able to control the payments history, but the members as well.</p>\n<p>Read about all of the plugin&#8217;s features at <a href='https://wpuserspro.com/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP Users Pro</a></p>\n<h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://wpuserspro.com/testing/registration-page/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Registration Form With reCaptcha</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://wpuserspro.com/testing/members-login-page/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Login Form With reCaptcha</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://wpuserspro.com/testing/members-password-reset-page/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Password Recover With reCaptcha</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>PAID EXTENSIONS</h4>\n<p>WP Users Pro has a range of extensions that allow you to extend the power of your membership website.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://wpuserspro.com/extensions/content-dripping/' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Content Dripping</a> &#8211; This add-on allows you to release content at regular intervals.
