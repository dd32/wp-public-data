        "faq": "\n<dt id='why%27s%20it%20called%20draft%20concluder%3F'>\nWhy&#8217;s it called Draft Concluder?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Because it helps you find an end to those annoying drafts that sit around and never get completed. And it&#8217;s a pun on &#8220;draft excluder&#8221;. Yes, I know &#8211; blame my SO, who came up with the name.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20does%20the%20%22status%22%20on%20the%20settings%20screen%20mean%3F'>\nWhat does the &#8220;Status&#8221; on the Settings screen mean?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>In Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Draft Concluder, you&#8217;ll see, under the title, a status &#8211; this will tell you when it last ran and whether it was successful or not.</p>\n<p>The success is dependent on whether any error was returned when sending out emails &#8211; a failure would indicate a problem with <code>wp_mail</code> and will need further investigation.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='the%20email%20isn%27t%20turning%20up%20at%20the%20time%20that%20it%27s%20scheduled%21'>\nThe email isn&#8217;t turning up at the time that it&#8217;s scheduled!\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The internal WordPress scheduler is an interesting beast. It&#8217;s totally reliant on someone visiting your site for it to trigger &#8211; so if you set it to 1am but nobody visits until 8am then, yeah, you won&#8217;t get email until after 8am.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I thought of you when I wrote the plugin. As per the previous question, there&#8217;s a status on the settings screen. Additionally, there are 2 shortcodes that you can add to any post or page to help you out.</p>\n<pre><code>[dc_now] - this will run the email generator and show, on screen, what would be sent if you were running it now.\n\n[dc_last_run] - this will show, on screen, what happened during the last scheduled run. So, if the status in the settings shows it ran, you can use this shortcode to display what was actually sent and to whom.\n</code></pre>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20unsubscribe%20from%20the%20email%20that%20i%27m%20sent%3F'>\nCan I unsubscribe from the email that I&#8217;m sent?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Heck, no. That&#8217;s the beauty of this plugin.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20just%20send%20the%20email%20to%20spam%20instead%3F'>\nCan I just send the email to spam instead?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t do that. The email comes from the site&#8217;s account &#8211; marking it as spam may also lead to all other site emails going the same way, including password resets and important security information.</p>\n<p>Look, if it means that much to you, maybe look to sorting out your drafts, yes?</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20can%20i%20prevent%20the%20plugin%20from%20being%20deactivated%3F'>\nHow can I prevent the plugin from being deactivated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>&#8230;said no-one. But seriously, you want to remove the temptation, right?</p>\n<p>Crack open your site&#8217;s <code>wp-config.php</code> and add the following line of code&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'DO_NOT_DISABLE_MY_DRAFT_REMINDER', true );\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the deed is done &#8211; you can no longer disable the plugin (cue diabolical laughter).</p>\n</p>\n\n",
