        "faq": "\n<h4>\nWhat can I do with this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Upload and show private videos with a block only to logged users. IMPORTANT! all videos are save it in your hosting, so keep it in mind for disk space and bandwidth. Maybe a shared hosting it is not a good idea to work in this way, especially if you will have many visualizations.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nI no longer need Vimeo or Amazon S3?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>It depends on your needs and your particular situation. Video sharing is not cheap and if you use your own server with this plugin to serve video you have to make your own accounts and see what is the best for you and study the costs of your own hosting around bandwidth spending with videos. Maybe you need a VPS and it is not good idea work on shared hosting which ends up blocking you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I setup this plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>All configuration is within each block on WordPress editor.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nHow can I do global setup?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>We can avoid add an options page to the plugin to only put there default block configuration, because of is already possible do that with native WordPress Block Editor.</p>\n<p>Just add a new Private Video Block and set your favourite configuration with colors and alternative content and then ‚ÄúAdd to Reusable Blocks‚Äù with a custom name. In this way you can set multiple default video blocks.</p>\n<p>Whenever you want to add new Private Video Block just select your custom video block and then ‚ÄúConvert to Regular Block‚Äù to allow put inside the new video with all your previus default configuration already set.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs this plugin with self hosting video for everyone?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Only use this plugin if you know well what kind of hosting you have and what are your expenses and limitations to use it as storage and video visualizations. Also only after comparing other options like Vimeo, Youtube, Amazon S3, etc and determining that this plugin is the best option for you.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>\nIs it really true that users will not be able to download the videos?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If they insist they will get it as with any other solution, but it has been raised to be quite complicated especially for most people.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
