The plugin is quite useful but isn&#8217;t dependant on any functionality found in any given version of WordPress.  But this is our first plugin and therefore has only been tested with the most recent release of WP which is why we can only claim 3.3.1 compatibility.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will this affect my SEO?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No.  The content is clearly visible to search engines and very friendly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I am new to Social, do you have a Facebook page?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes we do, but as our brand identity&#8230; <a href='https://www.facebook.com/PSDCovers' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">PSDCovers</a>. Please like!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How about Twitter?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes! <a href='https://twitter.com/psdcovers' rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@psdcovers</a> does the twitter.  please follow!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How does one use the shortcode, exactly?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin does not use shortcodes.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
