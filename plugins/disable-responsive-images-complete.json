        "faq": "\n<dt id='where%20are%20the%20screenshots%3F'>\nWhere are the screenshots?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin works behind the scenes with no settings required. So there are no screenshots to show!</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20work%20for%20wp%20multisite%3F'>\nDoes this work for WP Multisite?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, this plugin works great on Multisite.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20this%20plugin%20differ%20from%20the%20original%20disable%20responsive%20images%20plugin%3F'>\nHow does this plugin differ from the original Disable Responsive Images plugin?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The difference is that this plugin also disables the extra 768px image copy from being generated for every image upload. So it saves server memory and other precious resources. Additionally, at the time this plugin was created, the original Disable Responsive Images plugin had not been updated in over 2 years.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='why%20would%20i%20want%20to%20disable%20responsive%20images%3F'>\nWhy would I want to disable responsive images?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is not &#8220;anti-responsiveness&#8221;. In fact, quite the opposite. WP responsive-image feature locks users into prescribed methods, instead of leaving it open for users to create their own solution. With this plugin, users take back control in order to implement their own preferred responsive solutions. So it&#8217;s actually &#8220;pro-responsiveness&#8221;, as it frees designers and developers and encourages independent, innovative implementations.</p>\n<p>For anyone still confused, here is a list of reasons why anyone would want to disable WP responsive images:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Because not all sites want or need responsive images</li>\n<li>Because not all users want or need WordPress to do everything for them</li>\n<li>Because generalized solutions do not cater to 100% of users or scenarios</li>\n<li>Because there are many different ways to implement responsive images</li>\n<li>Because the WP method makes assumptions that may not hold true in every case</li>\n<li>Because some users want to implement their own responsive image solutions</li>\n<li>Because the WP method generates an additional mid-size image for every image upload (which can be wasteful and gobble up server memory and other resources)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, as explained on the homepage, this plugin is designed for people who <em>know what they are doing</em> and want full control over how responsive images are handled on their WordPress-powered site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='got%20a%20question%3F'>\nGot a question?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Send any questions or feedback via my <a href=\"https://plugin-planet.com/support/#contact\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contact form</a></p>\n</p>\n\n",
