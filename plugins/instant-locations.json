Data is saved in separated table so it won&#8217;t create extra records in <code>wp_postmeta</code> and you can deactivate plugin or delete database table any time you want (We hope not) without affected to your website.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How to get the location data?</h4>\n<p>\n<p><code>il_get_data($post_id, $address_component)</code><br />\nWhere<br />\n    $post_id your post id<br />\n    $address_component not required.
