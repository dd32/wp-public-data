It also adds a link back to the original post at the end of the content:</p>\n<p>e.g. This article was first published on http://benjaminmoody.com.</p>\n<h4>Need More?

This means that only clients that you have registered can access the content.</p>\n<h4>Need to stop content going to a client?</h4>\n<p>Just remove their account or change the user group. You are in control of who can receive your content.</p>\n<h4>Full complete content import</h4>\n<p>When a push is made to a client&#8217;s site, WordPress will import not only the post content (title, content, excerpt, meta data) it will also import any categories and tags applied to each post. As the images, the client plugin will detect all images used in each post and import those images directly into the client&#8217;s media library!</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Just install this &#8216;master&#8217; plugin on in your WordPress install.</li>\n<li>Now create some client accounts, works just like adding any other WordPress user.

All it does is &#8216;ping&#8217; each client with a simple quick http request. The client server then jumps into action, authenticating with the master server which runs a quick query and provides a list of content to import.</p>\n<p>The client site then does the heavy lifting, importing the post data and downloading any images from your server without WordPress getting involved, thus keeping server load to a minimum.</p>\n<h4>Problems? Got you covered</h4>\n<p>Sometimes web servers go down or take a while to respond. If there is any issue with pushing content to a client, the plugin will send an email to you with the details of the error and it will also send an email to the client admin with instructions on how to manually pull in the content using the client plugin admin options.</p>\n",

Go to Settings &gt; Content Syndication and select the post type you wish to use from the &#8216;Syndication Post Type&#8217; drop down menu.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I&#8217;ve created accounts for my clients and published a post but the content has not been syndicated</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Check that all the accounts you have created for your clients are using the Role &#8216;Syndication Sub&#8217;. Now make sure that all you clients have downloaded the &#8216;Content Syndication Toolkit Reader&#8217; plugin from WordPress and that they have entered their account details into the reader plugin options.</p>\n<p>From here the client can also tell the reader plugin to pull all content from your website without you having to do anything!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i create draft posts without pushing them to clients?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes. only &#8216;Syndication Posts&#8217; that are marked as published will be pushed to clients. So be careful when you push the blue publish button, be sure you want the post to go out. If not sure just &#8216;save as draft&#8217; and publish later when you are ready.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can i correct mistakes in posts</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, this is a one way process. Think of it as an email campaign, once is goes out mistakes can&#8217;t be corrected. Be sure before you publish!</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Can people read these posts on the front end like any other post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, all &#8216;Syndication Posts&#8217; published on your site. All client copies of posts are automatically marked with a Canonical tag pointing back to the original post on your site.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens when i delete a post?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once deleted a post will no longer be pushed to clients. If a client already has a copy of this post it will remain live on their site along with any images.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Is the content served from my WordPress install?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the import process is exactly that. A complete import of posts, categories, tags, and images for each post pushed to a client. So each client has their very own copy of each post inside their WordPress database.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What happens if a push goes wrong?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Sometimes web servers crash or are slow to respond.</p>\n<p>If your site cannot reach a client during a push it will send you and email with the account name and error details. It will also send your client and email with instructions on how to manually start a content pull from their wordpress admin area.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
