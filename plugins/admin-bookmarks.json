However, you can manually add the role with the following lines of code:</p>\n<pre><code>        global $wp_roles;\n        $wp_roles-&gt;add_cap(\"editor\", \"manage_personal_menu\", true);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above line adds the capability to the Editor role.  Replace &#8216;editor&#8217; with whatever role you wish to assign the capability.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why can&#8217;t users with the &#8216;manage_personal_menu&#8217; capability manage their bookmarks in the same way an administrator can?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The user must have the &#8216;edit_theme_options&#8217; capability to be able to edit a navigational menu. Without that capability, he or she will not be able to use the menus interface and must use a different interface instead.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Why are there menus labeled &#8216;favoritesBar&#8217; followed by a number?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Each user gets a favorites bar menu followed by their User ID. Editing a favorites bar with a User ID not your own will effectively be editing a different user&#8217;s menu.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
