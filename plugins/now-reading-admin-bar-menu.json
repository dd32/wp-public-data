It simply adds the same backend menu links to the admin bar introduced in WordPress 3.1.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Will these links show up if I don&#8217;t have Now-Reading Reloaded plugin activated?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>While I&#8217;ve not actually tested (this is version 0 after all), the links should not show if Now-Reading Reloaded is not installed &amp; active. This plugin checks for the <code>nr_check_versions</code> function from Now-Reading Reloaded before it attempts to generate the admin bar menu.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
