        "faq": "\n<h4>What is this good for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Suppose you have a post about the Cannes Film Festival, and another about a French film. Both might be in the &#8220;France&#8221; and &#8220;Films&#8221; categories, but perhaps you&#8217;d want to put the film post mainly in the &#8220;Films&#8221; category and the Cannes post in the &#8220;France&#8221; category.</p>\n<p>Using Top Cat&#8217;s template tags, you can then style the posts differently based on their main categories. For example, see my home page at http://www.thunderguy.com/bennett/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I don&#8217;t see the radio buttons on the admin screen!</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The administration functions of Top Cat currently don&#8217;t work on all browsers, especially older ones. I plan add universal support in the near future.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How did you add the radio buttons to the admin screen?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Have a look at the code&#8230; It&#8217;s slightly tricky because Windows Internet Explorer works differently to the way you might expect.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
