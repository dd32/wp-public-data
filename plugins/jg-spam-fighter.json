Spammers, whether robots or real persons, usually make more than one comment from one such IP address. More like dozens if not hundreds of them. Based on the above JG Spam Fighter Plugin makes it easy for you to identify and remove spammy comments in bulk AND block the spammy IP addresses as well, to prevent further spam.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
