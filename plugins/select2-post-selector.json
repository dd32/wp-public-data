Say you have a plugin or theme that sets up a custom post type called &#8220;Resources&#8221;.  You want users to be able to manually create, for each post, &#8220;Related posts&#8221; and &#8220;Related resources&#8221; using meta boxes with data (the IDs of the related posts/resources) saved to custom fields.</p>\n<p>One way to do this is to use a select box. This would be a big long list of ALL the posts or resources on your site. This is not very user friendly, but also, with a large number of posts and resources to list, can be a real performance hog. I&#8217;ve even had this approach blow the PHP memory_limit and break the admin of sites.</p>\n<p>This plugin improves both the user experience and performance of creating selectable post lists by enhancing them with the functionality of AJAX-powered <a href=\"https://github.com/select2/select2\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Select2</a> select boxes.</p>\n<p>The plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gives a simple way to select posts from a specified post type based on a partial, case-insensitive title search</li>\n<li>saves selected post IDs to custom post meta variables</li>\n<li>requires minimal coding (but, sadly, does require some coding in your plugin or theme)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Select2 is MIT Licensed and Copyright (c) 2012-2015 Kevin Brown, Igor Vaynberg, and Select2 contributors,</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>This plugin provides a library for you to use in Themes and Plugins that you create.
