Other builders could be added at a later date.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20does%20it%20work%3F'>\nHow does it work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin stores code snippets in the plugin subfolder <code>usr</code> and text snippets in the WordPress database as a Heckler post.</p>\n<p>During the WordPress <code>init</code> phase, the plugin checks for all defined snippets that have defined hooks, and if the <code>rule</code> returns true, it hooks the code (loaded from the <code>usr</code> folder) or the text to the defined hooks.</p>\n<p>In case a snippet is used as a shortcode, before the shortcode is executed the <code>rule</code> is checked, and if it passes, only then is the text rendered or the code executed.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20is%20this%20not%20a%20security%20hazard%3F'>\nHow is this not a security hazard?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Good question. This plugin uses <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">nonces</a> to protect the edit form, and in order to access the edit form you need to have highest possible privilegies. To make sure that a user has modified a snippet from within the Hecker UI the <code>save_post_heckler</code> hook is used. Also, all the stored code snippets are prefixed with <code>&lt;?php if ( !defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) return;</code> to ensure a snippet can&#8217;t be accessed directly without loading the WordPress first.</p>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s as much of a hazard as the plugin editor, or the plugin installer that come by default with the WordPress installation.</p>\n<p>If this is still too much of a risk for you, then this plugin might not be for you.</p>\n</p>\n\n"
