By cloaking your links, your visitors will see a clear, user friendly URL when they hover over an affiliate link.</p>\n<h4>Avoid Commission Theft</h4>\n<p>An uncloaked link is vulnerable to commission hijacking. Anyone can simply replace you affiliate id with their own when making a purchase and your commission will go to someone else. The Link Cloaker for Affiliates prevents commission hijacking so you keep all your earned commissions.</p>\n<h4>Note:</h4>\n<p>Your cloaked links are saved remotely to AffiliateDefense. This makes it easy to manage and sync your cloaked links from your WordPress admin panel or AffilateDefense. This also makes it easy to use the link cloaker on a non WordPress website and to restore your links at a later time.</p>\n",
