Sometimes people are intentionally mean and not all blog owners want to deal with trolls. Sometimes visitors substitute ingredients or make the recipe incorrectly and are surprised when that leads to bad results. Also, visitors seem more likely to leave a review if they&#8217;re unhappy with the recipe than if they liked it, which might skew the accuracy of the ratings.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='will%20disabling%20ratings%20affect%20my%20seo%20and%2For%20google%20ranking%3F'>\nWill disabling ratings affect my SEO and/or Google ranking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Disabling ratings will cause you Google Rich Cards from being fully enhanced. If that&#8217;s important to you, don&#8217;t use this plugin. For more information about Rich Cards, read the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/05/introducing-rich-cards.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">post about Rich Cards on the Google Webmaster Blog</a>. You can monitor the status of your Rich Cards by registering your site with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google Search Console</a> and clicking on Search Appearance -&gt; Rich Cards. This page will let you know how many of your cards are fully enhanced, enhanceable, or invalid. You can also use <a href=\"https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Google&#8217;s Structured Data Testing Tool</a> to check the status of a particular page on your site.</p>\n<p>According to the Google documentation on how to format recipes, the &#8220;AggregateRating&#8221; field used by the ratings feature is recommended but not required. However, it also says &#8220;mark up as many of the recommended fields as possible to drive better engagement in Search.&#8221; So you will probably get better engagement if you include the ratings, but if your recipe has a low rating that might discourage users from clicking through from Google. It&#8217;s your call. If your goal is to make your recipes as Google-friendly as possible, don&#8217;t use this plugin.
