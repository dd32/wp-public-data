This plugin makes use of the <code>wp_footer()</code> function to load the JavaScript file and it&#8217;s dependancy (jQuery). Check your theme to ensure that the <code>wp_footer()</code> function is being called right before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag in your theme&#8217;s footer.php file.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='issues%2Fsuggestions'>\nIssues/Suggestions\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>For bug reports or feature requests or if you&#8217;d like to contribute to the plugin you can check everything out on <a href=\"https://github.com/philbuchanan/Accordion-Blocks/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github</a>.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
