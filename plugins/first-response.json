        "description": "<p>This plugin is intended for first responders who want to list the calls their department receives on their department&#8217;s website. It adds a &#8220;911 calls&#8221; post type to list calls your department is dispatched for. These calls can be written manually, or they can be imported from an email inbox, if your department receives messages via email. This plugin is in early stages of development (it works for our department, but hasn&#8217;t been expanded to be sure it works for any others), but it should serve as a good base to expand from for a programmer who wants to create similar functionality for your department. I plan to expand it and add new features in the future, and if you&#8217;d like to help, it would be more than appreciated!</p>\n",
        "installation": "<ol>\n<li>Upload the &#8216;first-response&#8217; folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</li>\n<li>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</li>\n<li>Set up an email account to receive dispatch messages. The account must be dedicated to this plugin</li>\n<li>Enter your login details for the email account on the plugin settings page</li>\n</ol>\n",
        "faq": "<h4>Can calls be imported to wordpress automatically?</h4>\n<p>Yes. If your department can receive email notifications when you are dispatched, this plugin can read those messages and post a new &#8220;911 call&#8221; to your website. You need to set up a dedicated email address for this to work. This plugin will read that email account, and import any unread messages as new calls. Right now, the code MAY need to be adjusted slightly for your department, but the code should be easy to read and extend.</p>\n<h4>Can it do the import process the moment we are dispatched?</h4>\n<p>No. This is a feature I plan to add in the future, but I have not had the time to yet. If you expand the plugin to include a cron job or daemon which does this, please let me know!</p>\n<h4>How do I start the import process?</h4>\n<p>In the admin page, click on &#8220;911 calls&#8221; on the menu on the left, and then click on &#8220;Load calls&#8221; in its submenu. It will import all new calls, tag and categorize them, publish them, and then report back on what it has done.</p>\n<h4>Do I NEED to use the import process to use this plugin?</h4>\n<p>No. You could create new calls manually without ever using the import process. Importing does make things a whole lot easier, though.</p>\n<h4>How do you receive emails when you are dispatched?</h4>\n<p>Our county uses a system called &#8220;iamresponding&#8221; to notify us via text message and email when we are dispatched. Other similar systems exist which you could sign up for. I am not aware of any that are free.</p>\n"
