You can set the individul URLs (redirect links) per each product individually. Besides you can set the redirect link for one product and keep the original &#8220;Add To Cart&#8221; process for another.  &#8220;Add To Cart&#8221; button should not have a different look either it redirects to some URL or keeps working as it is in normal WooCommerce.
