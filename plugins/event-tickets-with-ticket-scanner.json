The built-in ticket scanner allows you and your team to redeem the tickets by scanning the QR-code.

The ticket number generator gives you a flexible pattern to generate ticket numbers upfront. You can also <strong>import your existing codes</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Validation of tickets:</strong> You customer will get a link to a detail page and a PDF for each sold ticket.</p>\n<p><strong>Build your own stolen ticket number database:</strong> Support your customer and yourself to protect stolen ticket numbers to be sold or used to others. Mark reported ticket numbers as stolen and let others check the ticket numbers with the ticket number validator.</p>\n<p><strong>How can you setup the ticket numbers?</strong><br />\nThe ticket numbers will be generated by the plugin automatically, if you do not set up ticket numbers upfront.<br />\nYou can enter your ticket numbers within the WP admin area in the ticket number section (a new menu point in the wordpress amdin area).<br />\nYou can generate your own ticket numbers manually using the ticket number generator or import existing ticket numbers.<br />\nAnd you are also able to add your own ticket numbers by just entering them to the generated ticket numbers below the ticket number generator.<br />\nIf needed you can assign the ticket (numbers) to a list which helps you to organize the tickets. The ticket list need to be assigned to a WooCommerce product.<br />\nCreate one or more ticket lists to use the WooCommerce functionality.<br />\nCreate bundle products &#8211; determine how many ticket numbers should be created with the sale of one product.</p>\n<p><strong>How the ticket number works</strong><br />\nYou define your look and feel for your ticket numbers. The generated ticket numbers will be unique. After you are satisfied with the generated ticket numbers, you can start the adding step.<br />\nThe ticket adding step will check if the ticket number is unique on the server before adding it.<br />\nIf the ticket number exists already on the server, it will not be added.</p>\n<h4>The ticket number generator provides a lot of features:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ticket number prefix &#8211; you can enter a fixed prefix to each ticket number</li>\n<li>Length of ticket number</li>\n<li>Only letters</li>\n<li>Uppercase, Lowercase or both</li>\n<li>Exclusion of letters that are easy to missread (i,l,o,q,p)</li>\n<li>Delimiter possible: [None, -, :, SPACE] &#8211; you decide after how many letters within the ticket number</li>\n<li>CVV code generation (only numbers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, this is a fork of the serial code validator plugin.

This way you can offer your customers a way to report a stolen product. Other buyers of used products can validate the ticket number on your website and will be notified with a &#8220;Product is stolen&#8221; warning.<br />\nThis could increase sales and help reducing theft of your products.<br />\nThe check behaviour will be like &#8220;inactive codes&#8221; but with the stolen message. You can change the stolen message within the options area of the serial code admin.</p>\n<h3>Protection with CVV</h3>\n<p>You can set a code verification value (CVV) to protect your tickets. The validation check will ask the user to enter both for a valid check.<br />\nThat way you increase the security of your ticket numbers and prevent stealing the numbers (If you are able hide the CVV on your packaging).<br />\nIf you use a CVV on a ticket number, then the user will be asked to enter this CVV too during the validation. If the CVV on your ticket number is not set or empty it will be ignored and your customer is not asked for it.</p>\n<h3>Woocommerce support for auto-generating tickets</h3>\n<p><strong>Supports version 6+</strong><br />\n<strong>You can use this plugin to auto-generate tickets and codes for your woocommerce products</strong><br />\n* Create a code list<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a ticket<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a code &#8211; if needed<br />\n* Click on &#8220;Event Tickets&#8221; in the attribute area of your product<br />\n* Choose the &#8220;List&#8221; that will be used for this product</p>\n<p>Everytime this product is sold, it will get a new generated ticket number/code or use an unused one within your list (This need to be activated within the option settings). The new code will be added to the code list you set on your WooCommerce product and to the product sale too.<br />\nIf the sold product quantity in the order is more than 1, then a ticket number/code will be generated for each element. The code will be generated after the purchase. In case of a refund the code will be recovered and marked as unused, so that it can be reused.</p>\n<p><em>E.g.: Your customer bought 2 of the same product within one order, then 2 tickets will be generated and stored to the product item within this order.</em></p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Ticket Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create and assign tickets for physical products and digital products</li>\n<li>Recover tickets assigned to refunded orders</li>\n<li>Option to reuse the recovered tickets with the latest orders</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the tickets with the complete order email</li>\n<li>Automatically a ticket as PDF for download and add the download link to the complete order email.</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the tickets and download URL with the optional PDF invoice &#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</li>\n<li>Download a flyer for your event or party</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>WooCommerce Code Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create and assign codes for physical products and digital products</li>\n<li>Recover code assigned to refunded orders</li>\n<li>Option to reuse the recovered codes with the latest orders</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the codes with the complete order email</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the codes with the optional PDF invoice &#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br />\nIf you exceed your limit (<em>no limits for premium user</em>) of the amount of possible tickets/codes, then the ticket/code added to the sold product will be a text information: <strong>&#8220;Please contact our support for the code&#8221;</strong>.<br />\nThis way your business is not harmed and your customer can contact you to get a code manually.

This way you can offer your customers a way to report a stolen product. Other buyers of used products can validate the ticket number on your website and will be notified with a &#8220;Product is stolen&#8221; warning.<br />\nThis could increase sales and help reducing theft of your products.<br />\nThe check behaviour will be like &#8220;inactive codes&#8221; but with the stolen message. You can change the stolen message within the options area of the serial code admin.</p>\n<h3>Protection with CVV</h3>\n<p>You can set a code verification value (CVV) to protect your tickets. The validation check will ask the user to enter both for a valid check.<br />\nThat way you increase the security of your ticket numbers and prevent stealing the numbers (If you are able hide the CVV on your packaging).<br />\nIf you use a CVV on a ticket number, then the user will be asked to enter this CVV too during the validation. If the CVV on your ticket number is not set or empty it will be ignored and your customer is not asked for it.</p>\n<h3>Woocommerce support for auto-generating tickets</h3>\n<p><strong>Supports version 6+</strong><br />\n<strong>You can use this plugin to auto-generate tickets and codes for your woocommerce products</strong><br />\n* Create a code list<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a ticket<br />\n* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a code &#8211; if needed<br />\n* Click on &#8220;Event Tickets&#8221; in the attribute area of your product<br />\n* Choose the &#8220;List&#8221; that will be used for this product</p>\n<p>Everytime this product is sold, it will get a new generated ticket number/code or use an unused one within your list (This need to be activated within the option settings). The new code will be added to the code list you set on your WooCommerce product and to the product sale too.<br />\nIf the sold product quantity in the order is more than 1, then a ticket number/code will be generated for each element. The code will be generated after the purchase. In case of a refund the code will be recovered and marked as unused, so that it can be reused.</p>\n<p><em>E.g.: Your customer bought 2 of the same product within one order, then 2 tickets will be generated and stored to the product item within this order.</em></p>\n<h4>WooCommerce Ticket Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create and assign tickets for physical products and digital products</li>\n<li>Recover tickets assigned to refunded orders</li>\n<li>Option to reuse the recovered tickets with the latest orders</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the tickets with the complete order email</li>\n<li>Automatically a ticket as PDF for download and add the download link to the complete order email.</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the tickets and download URL with the optional PDF invoice &#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</li>\n<li>Download a flyer for your event or party</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>WooCommerce Code Features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create and assign codes for physical products and digital products</li>\n<li>Recover code assigned to refunded orders</li>\n<li>Option to reuse the recovered codes with the latest orders</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the codes with the complete order email</li>\n<li>Automatically deliver the codes with the optional PDF invoice &#8220;WooCommerce PDF Invoices&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong><br />\nIf you exceed your limit (<em>no limits for premium user</em>) of the amount of possible tickets/codes, then the ticket/code added to the sold product will be a text information: <strong>&#8220;Please contact our support for the code&#8221;</strong>.<br />\nThis way your business is not harmed and your customer can contact you to get a code manually.
