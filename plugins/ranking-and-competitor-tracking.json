        "faq": "\n<dt id='will%20this%20plugin%20work%20with%20any%20theme%3F'>\nWill this Plugin work with any theme?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin is theme independent.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20often%20if%20the%20ranking%20updated%3F'>\nHow often if the Ranking updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Plugin will update the ranking every 3 days. More frequent updates are not necessary as changes in SERP are gradual.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20will%20i%20know%20when%20the%20ranking%20is%20next%20to%20be%20updated%3F'>\nHow will I know when the Ranking is next to be updated?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The dashboard menu option labelled &#8216;Status Check&#8217; shows the last run date and the approximate next due date for the Ranking update by search phrase.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20do%20i%20update%20the%20ranking%3F'>\nHow do I update the ranking?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The ranking is automatically updated continually (about every 3 days) by WordPress. A WordPress CRON job manages the updates.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='do%20all%20the%20updates%20happen%20at%20the%20same%20time%3F'>\nDo all the updates happen at the same time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the updates are staggered.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='are%20ranking%20results%20immediately%20available%3F'>\nAre ranking results immediately available?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, the first ranking results will take a little time to be collected and it may take an hour or two before a full set of ranking results are available. Trend charts can take a while longer because by their nature, they need to track the site over a number of days. Once the results are in place the data will remain up to date thereafter.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20i%20increase%20the%20frequency%20of%20the%20ranking%20updates%3F'>\nCan I increase the frequency of the ranking updates?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No these are controlled by the system. It is not advisable to measure more than once every 3 days as this allows a settling time between changes to the site pages.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20the%20ranking%20performance%20be%20configured%20for%20a%20defined%20region%3F'>\nCan the ranking performance be configured for a defined region?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, there is a wide selection of distinct regions in this version. The site owner can select one primary region only.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20more%20than%2010%20search%20terms%20be%20set%20up%3F'>\nCan more than 10 search terms be set up?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The current version allows only 10 search terms and 3 competitors. This will be extended in a future version.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20happens%20if%20a%20search%20term%20of%20competitor%20is%20changed%20after%20the%20software%20has%20been%20used%20for%20some%20time%3F'>\nWhat happens if a search term of competitor is changed after the software has been used for some time?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Any data from the old search term and / or competitor will be lost when a change is made. Therefore it is a good idea to carefully think through your key phrases before you start.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20the%20api%20license%20necessary%3F'>\nIs the API license necessary?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the software will not operate properly without registering the API. However, it is easily generated with a single click of a button and the only information gathered is the domain name of your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20there%20any%20charge%20for%20the%20api%20licence%3F'>\nIs there any charge for the API licence?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The API licence will always be provided free of charge.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20purpose%20of%20the%20api%20license%3F'>\nWhat is the purpose of the API license?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The API license provides a unique 5 character (case-sensitive) id on the site that allows every registered domain to be uniquely identified. Our server uses this domain / api combination to communicate with your site in order to capture ranking trend data. Ranking trends can be viewed directly from your site.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20the%20api%20licence%20capture%20any%20personal%20data%3F'>\nDoes the API licence capture any Personal data?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, there is no personal information sent when the API is registered.  No personal information is captured by any of the plugin processes. The Plugin is fully GDPR compliant.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20be%20used%20to%20track%20ranking%20on%20a%20different%20site%3F'>\nCan this plugin be used to track ranking on a different site?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Once installed on a WordPress site, ranking is tracked for the site domain and for 2 competitor domains. It can be installed on any number of sites, but the core tracking is always for the domain of the site that it is installed on.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='can%20this%20plugin%20be%20installed%20on%20other%20content%20management%20systems%3F'>\nCan this plugin be installed on other content management systems?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>This plugin is only available for WordPress sites.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='if%20the%20specified%20competitors%20are%20not%20on%20wordpress%20cms%20will%20the%20plugin%20still%20work%3F'>\nIf the specified competitors are not on WordPress CMS will the plugin still work?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the plugin does not care whether the competitor sites are static or operate on a different CMS. The only requirement is that ths plugin is installed on WordPress.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='how%20much%20information%20is%20held%20and%20will%20this%20data%20eventually%20clutter%20my%20database%3F'>\nHow much information is held and will this data eventually clutter my database?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Data is held on the client site for the past 2 weeks and then is updated to the Hub5050 Cloud for longer term data analysis. The data footprint on the client site is very small considering the amount of information that is available aminly because data is stored on the cloud servers.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20the%20keyword%20or%20key%20phrase%20space%3F'>\nWhat is the keyword or key phrase space?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>When you define a set of keywords or key phrases for a particular search engine and region, you are defining a search performance space. This is essentially a map of who the main &#8216;players&#8217; (competitors) are for the search terms on the particular search engine.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20do%20if%20the%20ranking%20values%20are%20not%20updating%3F'>\nWhat do I do if the ranking values are not updating?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>There are 2 main reasons why ranking may not update: the first is if your developer has disabled CRON jobs, contact the developer to rectify this. The second is if your site IP address has been banned by a search engine (usually due to a spam site sharing the same IP address). Contact your hosting provider to resolve this.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20do%20i%20do%20if%20the%20trend%20charts%20are%20not%20updating%3F'>\nWhat do I do if the trend charts are not updating?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Click the &#8216;Refresh licence&#8217; button on the setup page. This will renew you licence and should fix the problem. All the data you entered for keywords and competitors will be retained so you will not need to re-enter these.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='is%20this%20data%20shared%20with%20anyone%20else%3F'>\nIs this data shared with anyone else?\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>No, any data held against your site is available only to registered users who have permission to view this data.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='does%20this%20plugin%20affect%20the%20performance%20of%20my%20website'>\nDoes this Plugin affect the performance of my website\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Every Plugin has an effect on the performance of the site. This performance cost should be weighted against the benefit of using the Plugin. This plugin has a small footprint and the major grunt work is done on a separate system.</p>\n</p>\n<dt id='what%20is%20hub5050.com'>\nWhat is Hub5050.com\n</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Hub5050.com is the parent site where the base data is held. This site provides all the storage for your results so that your site does not need to assign storage space for these results.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
