But I don&#8217;t get any popup. Why?</p>\n<p>A2. You need to refresh the page in the browser after activating the ad blocker.</p>\n<p>Q3. I set the popup width for large screens from admin section. Now I want to reverse the effect of setting width?</p>\n<p>A3. You need to set the popup width to 0 in popup admin and save the settings.</p>\n<p>Q4. I am not being allowed to save my plugin options as it asks for a theme. I want to keep the earlier theme.</p>\n<p>A4. Just save your options with the blue theme which has blue preview image.</p>\n",
