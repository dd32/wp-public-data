        "faq": "<p>Below are asnwers to most common questions. If you have a question which is not<br />\nanswered here, please ask your question on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/tags/wordpress-connect/\" title=\"WordPress Connect Support Forums\" rel=\"ugc\">support forums</a>.<br />\nI monitor those and will try to answer as soon as possible.</p>\n\n<h4>How does it work</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Using WordPress Connect is very easy. Simply install and activate the plugin.<br />\nThe default settings will ensure that you can start benefiting from the<br />\nfeatures of WordPress Connect right away. By default, Like Buttons will appear<br />\nat the top of all posts and pages (just before the content) and Comments will<br />\nappear at the bottom of your posts and pages (right after the content). All<br />\nwidgets are pre-configured with Facebook default values and are available from<br />\nthe Widgets Menu for an immediately use.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I have upgraded to 2.0 and some/all of my previous settings are gone</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Version 2.0 of WordPress connect offers greatly extended functionality, more<br />\nfeatures and more control over the social plugins. Unfortunately, as a direct<br />\nconsequence, a few settings from previous version(s) are incompatible and will<br />\nneed to be entered as again via the settings pages.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Facebook has rolled out many new features in March 2011 and<br />\nconsequently the format and xfbml markup of some of their social plugins has<br />\nchanged. New options on WordPress Connect setting pages reflect these changes,<br />\nbut unfortunately, it was not possible to keep every single setting from<br />\nprevious versions.</p>\n<p>If you notice any unexpected behavior, please double check the values set<br />\non the WordPress Connect settings (available through your administratior<br />\ndashboard). Additionally, please consult the <a href=\"http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/docs/\" title=\"Wordpress Connect Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation pages</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Cannot access comments moderation</h4>\n<p>\n<p>After adding the comments plugin to your blog and creating a new <a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/setup/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Facebook Application</a><br />\nclicking on &#8220;Settings&#8221; on the comments box displays the following error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cannot edit global settings or moderation mode without fb:app_id</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To solve this problem, you will need to add the domain of your blog<br />\nto the Facebook Applpication settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php\" title=\"My Apps on Facebook\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">My Apps</a></li>\n<li>Select the application your created for your blog/site (from the list of applications on the left side)</li>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Edit Settings&#8217; in the list of links on the right side (next to application details)</li>\n<li>Click on &#8216;Web Site&#8217; (the second link from the top)</li>\n<li>Fill in the &#8216;Site Domain&#8217; field. If your blog is at http://www.myblog.com enter just &#8216;myblog.com&#8217;</li>\n<li>After clicking on &#8216;Save Changes&#8217; and reloading the page with the comments on it, you should be able to access the moderation settings</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please visit the <a href=\"http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/faq/#comments-moderation-access\" title=\"WordPress Connect FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ pages</a><br />\nfor a more detailed walk-through of the process described above (including screenshots)</p>\n</p>\n<h4>What is the Application ID for?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The Facebook Javascript API require a unique application ID to work. A new<br />\nID can easiliy be created by registering your site/blog at<br />\nhttp://developers.facebook.com/setup/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>How do I change the position of the Like Button/Comments?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The default position of the Like Button and Comments can be changed from the<br />\nWP Connect options pages accessible through the dashboard. If you would<br />\nlike to change the position of the Like Button of Comments in a particular<br />\npost or page, simply go to edit the post/page and select the new position<br />\nfrom the Like Button and Comments position drop-downs (or the right-hand side,<br />\nin the &#8220;WordPress Connect&#8221; module).</p>\n<p>For more details about customizing the position and the settings of individual<br />\nLike Buttons and Comments see the <a href=\"http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/docs/\" title=\"WordPress Connect Documentation\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation page</a><br />\nand <a href=\"http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/faq/\" title=\"WordPress Connect FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ pages</a>.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Do the widgets work with WP Super Cache and other caching plugins?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Yes, the content in all widgets will update every time a user visits your site,<br />\neven if the page (in which the widgets are embedded) remains unchanged.<br />\nThis is because Facebook delivers content to widgets either via asynchronous<br />\nJavascript calls (xfbml), i.e. content is requested after every page load.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The widgets I place in my sidebar are cut-off</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Some Facebook Social Plugins have a minimum width below which they will not<br />\nresize any further (but the will rather get cut-off). For example,<br />\nthe comments box needs to be at least 400px wide. If the container into which<br />\nyou are placing the widget is not wide enough, the content of the widget will<br />\nnot display properly. The usual sidebar that comes with most themes is too<br />\nnarrow for widgets such as the comments box. The only solution is to place the<br />\nwidget into a widget area that is wide enough, such as the &#8216;Footer Widget<br />\nArea&#8217; of the defeault twenty ten theme.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The plugin doesn&#8217;t work in my favorite theme</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If the plugin doesn&#8217;t work in one theme but does in others, the most<br />\nlikely reason is that the theme itself doesn&#8217;t implement WordPress hooks<br />\nproperly. For everything to work correctly, the plugin needs to add code into<br />\nthe html head tag (wordpress header) and the footer of the blog pages.<br />\nIt uses wordpress hooks (<code>add_action</code> and <code>add_filter</code>) for this purpose.<br />\nIf the theme author has not included the common wordpress hooks into the<br />\ntheme, required code cannot be added into the pages.</p>\n<p>You should contact the theme author and ask him/her to implement the<br />\nwp_head and wp_footer action calls correctly.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I updated the plugin to the latest version but don&#8217;t see the changes</h4>\n<p>\n<p>If you are using any caching solution, such as WP Cache or WP Supercache,<br />\nyou&#8217;ll need to reset the cache, i.e. to delete the cached pages. This is<br />\nnecessary so that the xfbml markup values can be updated.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>Facebook Social Plugins Info</h4>\n<p>\n<p>More information about the plugins can be found back on Facebook at<br />\nhttp://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/</p>\n</p>\n<h4>I set an image as the feature image but it doesn&#8217;t show on Facebook</h4>\n<p>\n<p>The theme you are using must support <code>post-thumbnails</code> for this particular<br />\nfeature to work.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>FAQ</h4>\n<p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://wp-connect.tomasvorobjov.com/faq/\" title=\"WordPress Connect FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">FAQ pages</a><br />\nfor more info and details about WordPress Connect Plugin</p>\n</p>\n\n",
