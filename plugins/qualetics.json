All this without writing a single line of code! Qualetics helps you to understand the quality, performance and stability of your WordPress website so that you can proactively get ahead of users facing problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Product Analytics</strong> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Qualetics helps you unearth insights into how your users interact with your website in this case. You will get to know what actions visitors take on your website so you can enhance the experience of the visitors across your website in entirety.</p>\n<p><strong>User analytics</strong> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Qualetics helps you unearth insights about your visitors, how much time they spend on a specific page, how many times they visit per day, per week, per month, etc. to name a few.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance analytics</strong> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> This is where it gets interesting for you as a WordPress website owner. Qualetics lets you know about the overall quality of your software powering your WordPress website so you can get a fair idea of why or why not visitor traffic is increasing or decreasing.</p>\n<p><strong>Geo location insights</strong> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Qualetics helps you understand from what all global locations are visitors visiting your WordPress site. You may want to, in the future, maybe create some content in a local language from the most visited country to have a personalized experience for visitors from such locations.</p>\n<p><strong>User behavior flow</strong> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> Wouldn’t it be great if you know exactly where in the entire website visitor experience the visitors faced issues, exceptions, errors, bugs, or friction points? Qualetics helps you to understand the entire user behavior flow on your WordPress website to let you know exactly what derailed your website visitor experience.</p>\n<h4>Data Ownership</h4>\n<p>Your Website, Your Data <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-exclude-emoji\">→</span> With Qualetics, you are the owner of your data, not Google, not WordPress.
