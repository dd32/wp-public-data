It then reports those attacks to the cloud for processing and fingerprinting.</p>\n<h4>App Alerts</h4>\n<p>Using the app you and your team are able to review attacking IP addresses organized by country and user. Blocking specific addresses or entire country and user targeted attacks with a swipe of your finger.</p>\n<h4>Instant Firewall Blocks</h4>\n<p>The threats you block in the app are imported by the BruteBank WordPress plugin blocking attackers instantly.
