If anyone has an elegant solution for this one, I would be more than happy if you would contact me.</li>\n<li><strong>Posts associated with more than one category are not supported</strong> (the reader might switch from one category to the other).

This can be fixed by rewriting all permalinks, which might be implemented in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Category hierarchy is currently not supported</strong>. While this will not break your blog, it does not behave perfectly. When accessing any post, the plugin will filter out content that does not belong to the most specific category in the permalink. </li>\n<li><strong>Selected category should be highlighted, and the main page should appear in the category list</strong>.
