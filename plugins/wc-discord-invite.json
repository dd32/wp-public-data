Copy the template <code>wp-content/plugins/wc-discord-invite/templates/emails/discord-invite.php</code> and paste it in your theme in the folder <code>woocommerce/emails/</code>, then edit it as you wish.

What do I do?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Install the free plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/email-log/\" rel=\"ugc\">Email Log</a> and trigger the Discord invite email with a new order, changing its status to what you chose in the integration settings. Now go to <strong>Email Log &gt; View Logs</strong> and check if the email appears there. If yes, the issue is not with this plugin but most likely with your host.</p>\n</p>\n<h4>The invite has been sent but I want to send it again. How do I do it?</h4>\n<p>\n<p>Edit the order in Orders &gt; All Orders. On the right of the order edit screen find the section <strong>Order actions</strong> and choose the option <strong>Resend Discord invite</strong> from the dropdown. Then click the <strong>&gt;</strong> button.</p>\n</p>\n\n",
