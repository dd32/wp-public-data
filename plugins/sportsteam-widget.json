        "description": "<p>SportsTeam Widget is a widget that shows the next match of a game.<br />\nIt uses a Custom Post Type for sportsteams, together with a Taxonomy/Term<br />\nfor the class/level where the team plays.<br />\nYou can add widget to every page anywhere you want and customize it for your needs for every sport &#8211; football (soccer), basketball, hockey, tennis, cricket and much more. Just add your team or teams and set up widget settings such as:<br />\n* Widget title<br />\n* Match date<br />\n* Subtitle<br />\n* Is match away (ticker)<br />\n* Class<br />\n* Home Team<br />\n* Home Team result<br />\n* Home Team color<br />\n* Out Team<br />\n* Out Team result<br />\n* Out Team color<br />\n* Background color<br />\n* Text color<br />\n* Show teams as links</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not all! We&#8217;ve added a new feature &#8211; football livescore widget to add fully automated live scores and results for today from any tournament you want (or all of them at once). Just insert simple shortcode where you want on page and your users will get livescores with real time updates with no need to refresh the page.<br />\nLivescore widget is fully responsive for any screen sizes and has no ads.</p>\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.classicpress.net\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ClassicPress</a>.</p>\n<h4>Interaction with External Services</h4>\n<p>Sportsteam Widget utilizes the external service 777score.com to obtain up-to-date information about the schedule and results of football matches. 777score.com is a recognized source of sports information trusted by the sports community. This service provides a wide range of information about football, including various leagues, tournaments, and championships from around the world.</p>\n<p>The functioning of the 777score.com service is based on delivering real-time data about selected matches, including the match start time, its status, incidents, and the score. Users have the ability to view detailed information about matches, such as goal lists, received cards, and other key events, without the need to refresh the page. This means that data is automatically updated without requiring page reload.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures users quick and uninterrupted access to the latest sports data without the effort of manually updating information, allowing them to stay informed about ongoing events in real-time.</p>\n",
