This process involves sending a request with specific data to the server API endpoint, which then queues and processes the request to generate HTML content. Once your request reaches the front of the queue, the service processes the data, generates the HTML content based on the specified URL, and then sends the HTML back to the plugin using the provided postback URL. The plugin automatically receives the generated HTML content and saves it to the disk on your WordPress installation. This process is designed to be seamless and requires no manual intervention.</p>\n<p>Example data sent to server API endpoint &#8216;https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/enqueue&#8217; to request HTML page generation:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"url\":\"https://example.com/\",\n    \"postbackUrl\":\"https://example.com/wp-json/fastpixel-website-accelerator/v1/update\",\n    \"settings\":{\n        \"modules\":{\n            \"ScriptRewrite\":{\n                \"enabled\":true,\n                \"settings\":{\n                    \"exclude\":{\n                        \"strings\":[],\n                        \"regexps\":[]\n                    },\n                    \"eventHandlersRewrite\":false,\n                    \"excludeGDPR\":true\n                },\n            \"injectBootstrapScripts\":true,\n            \"rdelay\":0\n            },\n            \"ImageRewrite\":{\n                \"enabled\":true,\n                \"settings\":{\n                    \"forceImageDimensions\":false\n                }\n            },\n            \"ReducedFonts\":{\n                \"settings\":{\n                    \"soft\":true\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"imageQuality\":\"lossy\",\n        \"cropImages\":false\n    },\n    \"plugin_version\":\"1.0.22\",\n    \"siteKey\":\"randomKey\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also there are two enpoints on external service:<br />\nhttps://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/purge_all &#8211; this endpoint is used to request pages cache. Url is put into queue and once your request reaches the front of the queue, service processes request. Service request page and parse it to get list of links to other pages. Pages from this list are requested too. New html pages will be prepared and send back to wordpress installation for all pages from the list.<br />\nExample data sent to server API endpoint &#8216;https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/purge_all&#8217; to request HTML page generation:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"url\":\"https://example.com/\",\n    \"siteKey\":\"randomKey\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/detect_endpoints &#8211; this endpoint is used to check which rest api route is available, /wp-json/fastpixel-website-accelerator/v1/update or ?rest_route=/fastpixel-website-accelerator/v1/update. Response from this endpoint return list of available endpoints and first item from this list is saved for future use. This endpoint is used only if default rest api endpoint is not available.<br />\nExample data sent to server API endpoint &#8216;https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/detect_endpoints&#8217; to request HTML page generation:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"url\":\"https://example.com/\",\n    \"siteKey\":\"randomKey\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More information can be found on <a href=\"https://fastpixel.io\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://fastpixel.io</a></p>\n<p>Security Measures<br />\nWe prioritize your security and privacy.
