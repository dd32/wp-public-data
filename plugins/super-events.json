You can drag this widget to any of your sidebars. This widget will appear ONLY on event type pages. The widget allows the user to enter a response (yes, no, may be) if logged in, else points a link to login/register.

Click on &#8220;Add New&#8221;. Search for &#8220;superevents&#8221;. On the search results page, click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you prefer the manual way, you can also download the superevents plugin, unzip it and upload <code>super-events</code> folder to the <code>/wp-content/plugins/</code> directory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Activate the plugin through the &#8216;Plugins&#8217; menu in WordPress</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will now see &#8216;EVENTS&#8217; post type below comments in your dashboard. You can create as many events as you want. You can also categorize events by type.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to Appearance -&gt; Widgets. You will see the RSVP widget. Add this widget to your sidebar, configure it. The widget appears only on event pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(OPTIONAL STEP) If you want more control over CSS:<br />\nCopy superevents.css from the superevents/css folder, paste it to your theme folder and override the values. Note: If you do so, the css file in the superevents/css folder ll not be loaded. In any case, only one of the stylesheets is loaded. All element IDs and Classes have superevents as a prefix.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(OPTIONAL STEP) if you want more control over the template:<br />\nIn your theme directory, make a copy of single.php, rename it to &#8216;single-event.php&#8217;.<br />\nThis template ll be picked up for all single event type pages instead.<br />\nYou may also want to overload taxonomy &#8216;type&#8217; if required with a custom template.<br />\nPlease try to reuse CSS by adding superevents prefix in all your elements.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",
